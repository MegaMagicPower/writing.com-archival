It seemed to be an island of civilization amidst untamed land, which isolated it from outside contact but also made it a beautiful contrast with the still natural surroundings. On the west side of town was the magnificently blue ocean, a field of dunes between the shore and the cliff upon which several houses were built, usually the bigger and more manor-like houses that belonged to the wealthier of the town. Everywhere else the town was fenced in by thick woodland, broken only by the many various trails and clearings that people liked to visit and travel through. A bit to the north, a small mountain rose up above the canopy of the forest, the peak breaking the top by just a bit. This was a good town, and this was where I lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight shone brightly through my bedroom window before landing on my face, rousing me from a sleep-in. Yawning, I took a look around my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe window to the right of my bed faced east, hence the rising sun waking me up each morning - far better than an alarm clock during the school year. Beneath the windowsill was a wooden desk, a place for both homework and leisure. Strewn across it was a mess of papers and books, though because it was summer break the space would soon be repurposed. But, being the prince of procrastination that I am, I decided to do that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the wall to the left of the bed was my closet where I dump my clothes, as well as some tools that satisfy my tickling fascination. All my interests have made a home in there, and there is probably still some candy among the clutter too buried to be found again. Yet apart from my closet the rest of my room was pretty neat: between the foot of the bed and the door was a worktable where most of my non-paper related stuff happens, like inventive modifications to common house items and the occasional science project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamiliar smells filled my nostrils, and beyond the window a bird chirped happily. All seemed at peace, a perfect summer morning. I was ready to sit up when I realized...</span></div></div>",

Several of my friends wanted to hang out with me, but because of the end of school homework rush I simply didn't have the time. With summer here though, I was able to catch up on a few invitations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friend since the first grade, Jenna is bursting with energy at all times. She's very outgoing and her natural charm has made her very popular. We may not always hang out with the same people and we don't always talk at lunch, but we're childhood friends and there's something about surviving the the competition with another stubborn kid that forges a strong friendship. It's been a while since we last hung out though, and she wants to fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine is an attractive tech geek, and a relatively new friend. To be honest, it's a wonder that she's still in high school with all her mechanical ingenuity. What started our friendship was our open sharing of tickling fantasies, inventing a lot of incredibly advances machinery that achieves those purposes. I've been her 'guinea pig' for these machines, something that I rather enjoy, and she has a whole new array of inventions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of my newest friends, Phoebe is both hot and popular, though not in the sense of distancing herself from 'nerds' and other kids like that. Actually, she's incredibly caring. We sat next to each other in history class and we just started talking, and before I knew it we were friends. We've confided some things in each other and built up a trusting relationship. For a while she's been asking if we could hang out together - somewhere alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext door to me lives Maddie. She's very shy and quiet, but once she opens up she's very kind and caring. Our parents were close friends before we were born, and so Maddie and I grew up very close to each other. The friendship is an ancient one, but it is very enduring. She also tutors me in mathematics, of which my parents approve. Before summer she was especially quiet about something, and she asked me to come over soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways doing something, Sharon is a balance of indoor and outdoor activities. When she's not playing sports or swimming in her pool she's reading books in her room or playing a video game on the TV. Her closet and shelves were so crammed that stuff was literally spilling onto the floor: footballs, baseballs, a basketball, books, games, and other odd items she's collected. She needed help getting organized, and I offered.</span></div></div>",

The bubbly girl always knew what to do with those long summer days with the only difficulty arising when she couldn't make up her mind. This seemed to be the case when I made her way to her house and saw Jenna out on the porch, looking over three pieces of paper as she chewed her bottom lip in the adorable way she always did when trying to make up her mind. Due to the heat, she was wearing a tanktop that showed off a healthy amount of midriff along with shorts that ended midway down her thighs and bright pink sandals. She was an attractive girl, dark hair down to her shoulders that was tied up in a ponytail and nut brown skin with brown eyes that dazzled whenever she smiled, which was a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing me, Jenna smiled widely, her bright teeth almost dazzling before indicating a couple fliers she had in her hand \"Just in time!\" She announced \"Got these in today about three new attractions opening up and I need your help to decide what we're going to see. There's the Kitchy Karnival opening up and it promises a load of rides with Kitchy the Klown having a huge show during it. We could always go to the beach of course, there's a huge crowd from school going so we could make a day of it there, you'll enjoy all the girls in swimsuits I imagine.\" She said with a giggle before presenting you with the final leaflet \"There's also this traveling wrestling group arriving in town and they're offering prizes for two people who can enter and take on their own wrestlers. We could enter together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing down the leaflets, Jenna gave me a look \"Which one do you want to go to then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thought, I eventually answered by saying \"Let's go to the...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I always was a sucker for a good carnival and opted for that, Jenna nodding in agreement as she soon led the way towards the Kitchy Karnival. I'd heard about it, apparently it was a bit different than your typical circus and ride attraction but always left you with a smile on your face. Walking through the town on such a pleasant day felt good, Jenna constantly talking about something or other and I responded in kind, enjoying her company. It took half an hour to get to where the carnival was and I had a blast just from being with Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carnival was huge, tents and attractions spreading out all over the place with the big top tent right in the very middle of it. Despite it being fairly early, I could see men and women all around us getting into things and it was already pretty busy. Jenna's eyes opened wide as she looked all over, unable to decide on what to do first. Just as I was having the same problem on what to do, a honking noise from behind us got our attention and turned to see a clown behind us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in her mid twenties and quite your typical clown, white make up, red nose and frizzy orange wig. But with a bright smile under the make up she looked quite attractive along with a curvy figure that was highlighted by the tight fitting patchwork shirt and bright blue trousers. Her shoes were still enormous though and made squeaks with each step. Seeing that she had our attention, she gave a dramatic bow and a smile \"Greetings chasers of chuckles! Grabbers of giggles! And welcome to the Kitchy Karnival! Allow me to give a preview of our attractions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she stood back up and flicked her wrists, two large rainbow coloured feather dusters appearing in her hands seemingly from nowhere. Giving me a wink, she then briefly tickled Jenna's bare belly with the tools, brushing her belly with them as she swirled the feathers around her navel. Jenna instantly burst into laughter and backed away, swatting the dusters from her bare skin as she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marvelous!\" The clown said \"You'll fit in right here, at Kitchy Karnival!\" She announced before handing the dusters over to me \"Such a pretty giggle always needs encouragement!\" She said as I took hold of the dusters and smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too much!\" Jenna said although the grin on her face said encouragement was never out of the question really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing at Jenna's words, the clown indicated the carnival around us \"And to which attraction first? The stalls with their delightful games such as 'Feather Dunk' and 'Hook the Prize'? Or maybe our rides with such excitement that the 'House of Giggles' and many others can give you? Or the main attraction, the Big Top Tent with our own clown show on where Kitchy herself will make an appearance? All are open to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shared a look with Jenna that said it all. I looked to the clown and said \"We'll go to the...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenna didn't wait long as she grabbed onto my hand and started to drag me towards the game stalls. There certainly was quite a large number as Jenna flitted from one to the other, trying to figure out which one to go for. The sound of laughter echoed around us as the games were (of course) ones where tickling played an important part of each one. Men and women were reduced to giggly messes from the various machines in the stalls as they pushed themselves to beat the challenges and gain the prizes. I saw Jenna's eyes light up with glee at the various sights in front of us and I kept the feather dusters the clown had given me tightly, feeling strangely safer for their presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Jenna settled on one stall in particular as we watched a pretty blonde woman take part in the challenge. She was a rather buxom blonde woman looking to be in her late twenties who had stripped down to her bra as part of the challenge. Her legs were tied to the ground with some nylon rope while her body was held in place with a strap under her chest keeping her tied to a board that rested against her lower body. She held a bucket over her head while standing in front of a horizontal wheel as the challenge began. The wheel had dozens of feathers of all shapes and sizes sticking out of the edge and as the wheel spun, all of them brushed against the woman's belly, tickling her constantly The woman shook and laughed as she was tickled, her belly getting brushed with the plumes from one side directly to the other and each feather dipped into her navel before flicking out, only adding to her torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the woman to break and she covered her bare belly with her hands, the bucket she was holding up fell and proved to be full of cold water as it splashed down on top of the woman, only adding to her squeals. A female clown went to untie her as well as giving the woman a towel to dry off as the crowd that had gathered gave a round of applause for the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the woman gone, the clown turned to the crowd and gave a cheery smile \"Who's next to take out challenge?\" She asked \"The person to hold the bucket above their heads for one minute without spilling a drop wins the grand prize! Does anyone dare to see how much they can take of the dreaded tickle wheel?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the audience looked around to see if anyone was willing to volunteer for the treatment as Jenna faced me with a grin. Before I could say anything, she said...</span></div></div>",

Jenna could be just like a little kid sometimes, she was just so bubbly and happy all the time. It could be quite contagious sometimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, slow down, Jenna! Don't pull my arm out\" I said, laughing as she tugged me along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, I wonder what this game is,\" she said, suddenly stopping in front of a large tent. Inside I could see that there were were rows of people in stocks and a small crowd watching the mirthful proceedings<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you asked, dearie,\" a smartly-dressed young man with a colorful bowtie leaning against a sign outside the tent said. \"Welcome to the Stocks of Fortune! Consider yourself a master tickler? Think you know the first thing about feathers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickle them with the pointy end?\" I offered, knowing full well it was meant as a rhetorical question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be so sure about that one, dear boy,\" the man shrugged. \"But feel free to prove me wrong! Here at the Stocks of Fortune we give you the chance to showcase your tickling skills, and win some lovely prizes in the process!\" He boomed loudly, reminding me a lot of those hammy game show hosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks interesting. What's the game?\" Jenna asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very simple, dear! Every stock has a number on it, from one to ten. If you can get our ticklish staff members to say 'stop', 'no more, ''mercy', or etc before the time limit, then you win a fabulous prize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time limit?\" I asked, a little confused how this game worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what the numbers are for, dear boy! Number five means you have five minutes to make 'em squeal for mercy! So choose wisely, the lower numbers will be easier, but the rewards will be smaller! I'm personally a fan of the higher numbers, as they say, take the risk, take the reward!\" He gushed dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, looks like fun, doesn't it? It'd be nice to not be on the receiving end of a tickling for once,\" Jenna giggled, prodding me in the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? You tickle me more than I tickled you!\" I chuckled, poking her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do ya say, kids? It's fun for all ages!\" The man said, trying to usher us in. I looked up at the colorful tent and bustling crowd inside.  </span></div></div>",

Oh, and tell number one I said hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was brightly lit and noisy inside with the sound of chattering and laughter. I could see there were ten stocks filled with ten ticklish individuals, some of which were already giggling with laughter while others were just idly chit-chatting. I actually reasoned that this must be a rather cushy job. If no one came to challenge you, you just sat around and gossiped, right? I wondered if they were hiring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's take a look around, okay?\" Jenna said, grabbing hold of my arm again and dragging me along. We looked around, and saw that there was a big crowd around number one, a petite brown-haired wearing a sundress whose feet seemed incredibly responsive. Checking out her soft-looking feet with metallic red toenail polish it wasn't that surprising. She looked like she had barely walked a day in her life, her feet seemed jumpy to every touch and were constantly wiggling and flexing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also noticed that there was a toolbox and a sign next to her feet that stated which tools were allowed to be used. It seems for the delightfully sensitive girl at stocks number one only feathers and fingers were allowed. Apparently her feet were so sensitive that even those could make her beg for mercy. And after watching for a few minutes, I realized that she probably gave up three out of every five times, and even when she didn't her girlish laughter and squirming was so adorable the losers would often want to play again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Jenna was biting her lip, looking rather enraptured at the sight of a handsome blonde boy getting his feet tickled in stocks three, I began feeling a little jealous. I couldn't resist sneaking up behind her and squeezing her sides, making her yelp, jolting her from her trance as she turned to me. \"Let's check out the other end, I like big gambles, don't you?\" I smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay,\" she nodded, tearing her eyes away from the pretty boy in the stocks. I made a mental note to remember to ask if they were hiring, because while I was watching the show at stocks number one, I had also noticed that quite there were quite a few gals having a good time here, especially the pretty ones in the stocks. This would also be a great place to go looking for dates who also shared my interest, I'm sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown at the end of the row there weren't as many people, probably because of the high difficulty and the higher wagers. Though the technique at this end was noticeably higher, as I watched a brown-haired middle-school girl I vaguely recognized tickle a dark-haired Chinese girl practically to tears at number nine. I noticed that while stocks number one had only allowed feathers and fingers, at number ten it seemed more devilish tickling weapons were allowed as I watched the young girl apply a toothbrush to great effect, scrubbing the soles and toes of the stocked girl's pale feet and never letting up for a moment. The middle-schooler was ruthless and meticulous, scrubbing all over the wiggling feet and following them wherever they went. The cute Chinese girl tried to curl her toes up to cover the vulnerable skin between them, but her tormentor would just casually grab her toes with one hand, pry them back, and began to wave the toothbrush underneath the sensitive digits, causing the victim to go ballistic and squeak with laughter. I could see that the Chinese girl kept trying to scrunch her feet shut, but the middle-schooler still managed to keep them pinned back with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make things even worse for the stocked Asian girl, the middle-schooler kept on teasing her, making it even more embarrassing and humiliating that a younger girl was able to making her squeal with laughter like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coochee Coochee Coo! Can't believe you're a nine, this is too easy!\" she giggled, continuing to tease the Chinese feet with glee, scratching each and every ticklish nook and cranny, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohohohokay! Nohoho more! Mehehercy!\" the pale-skinned girl in the stocks said, giggling hysterically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear that? Victory is mine!\" the middle-school girl cheered triumphantly as a clapping stall assistant next to the stocks passed her a giant teddy bear. \"Oh, hey!\" she said, greeting me. \"This carnival sure is fun, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind whirred for a bit and I realized where I had recognized her from. This girl was Katelyn, a neighbor of mine who also had a reputation in her middle-school for pulling pranks. It also seemed like she was a veteran tickler. The egg timer on the stocks said she still have a full two minutes to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Katelyn. You sure are good at this,\" I said, before realizing she and Jenna had never met and introduced them to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Jenna, nice to meet you. This big boy over here's a nice guy, but you gotta make sure he doesn't step out of line,\" she giggled, as she poked me in the ribs, which Jenna took as her cue to poke me from the other side now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehey, stop it, girls!\" I said, batting her fingers away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you didn't even last ten seconds. You should be in stocks number one,\" Jenna laughed, with Katelyn quickly joining in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Katelyn's eyes went to her watch. \"Oh, snap, I'm late. I said I'd meet some of my friends at this time. Have fun you two! See you later, big boy!\" she called as she skipped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, fancy running into her here,\" I muttered. \"So what do you want to play, Jenna? Want to take our chances on the high numbers? Or go for a lower number first to get warmed up?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You need a warm-up,\" I said taking her arm and steering her to the number four stocks, the blonde boy I had seen her looking at earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling lucky, sweetheart?\" The blondie said, wiggling his feet at her. I was actually taken aback for a moment, that guy was really a dedicated worker. I saw Jenna shoot me a big grin. I shrugged, grinning back and gave her a pat on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I am considerate and awesome,\" I said, looked around and seeing that there was no line at number five either. An idea just popped into my head. \"Come to think of it, you think you're really good right? Up for a little wager?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna raised her eyebrows and laughed. \"Let's do it, bring it on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take number five,\" I said, gesturing to my thumb at the red-haired girl in stocks five, \"I betcha I can win before you. Loser has to volunteer to go into the stocks. Sound fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are so on...\" she said competitively, clapping her hands together and rubbing them. \"You're going down...\" she said playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying the stall assistants at number three and four we both sat down at the stools in front of our victim's feet. We gestured to the assistants and told them to start their timers at the same time because we were having a little contest. And then I turned my attention to the cute girl whose feet were mine to play with for the next few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Since you're a number four, I take it you're plenty ticklish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to work that out for yourself, boy,\" the redhead smiled, wiggling her feet at me. \"But I'm not nearly as ticklish as blondie over there,\" she gestured. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Jenna do a fist-pump. \"Oh, and I heard about your bet with your girl over there,\" she said, looking evilly at me, \"I think I'm going to try extra hard to endure this round. My break is after this, and it's not often you get a bit of good ol' revenge tickling,\" she said, giving me a sinister grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged, trying to seem nonchalant. \"I like a challenge, besides; as I'm sure you'll find out soon, I'm pretty good at this. You'd be surprised how much practice I get,\" I boasted, wiggling my fingers near her feet, which instantly clenched up as soon as they went close.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no cheating! We haven't started yet,\" Jenna called out as it looked like I had started prematurely, as the assistants were still setting things up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" I replied as retracted my hands and instead looked at what tools I had been offered, at number four I had four minutes to make her cry for mercy so all I had in my disposal was a sash of ribbon which I wasn't actually how I was meant to use. Surely they weren't meant to be used to tie here toes back, the stocks already had string that went around the captives' big toes to prevent movement. I picked up the ribbon and looked at it and wondered how I was supposed to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI supposed one could use the ends of the ribbon to lightly tickle her feet, though I rather doubted they would cause extreme laughter, but I suppose it still tickled a little bit, nevertheless. Better than nothing, I reasoned. Jenna leaned over and saw my tool and chuckled, waving her bristly hairbrush at me. \"You're going down! A ribbon versus a hairbrush! No contest!\" She said confidently. The assistants setting up the timers looked to the two of us, gesturing they were ready to begin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's go time. Get ready to lose!\" Jenna said, turning to the tanned feet of the stocked boy in front of her. She could get awfully competitive at times, but I wasn't about to go down without a fight, as I concentrated my attention and the wiggling pale feet in front of me. The toes were tightly clenched, revealing black nail polish on as both feet shivered in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached up and tickled lightly across the top of the toes, prompting the toes of that foot to spread up and outwards. I was willing to beat those toes were ticklish, just about every girl was ticklish there. But before I went all-out on her toes, I danced my fingers across both smooth soles at the same time, wanting to gauge her reactions and get a comparison before I played with those flexing toes. To my dismay I had been at these for almost half a minute and there was no still laughter. I could hear rapid, heavy breaths and occasional snorts from my redheaded captive. This might be a little harder than I thought. To further demoralize me, I could hear that Jenna already had the blonde boy giggling hysterically, as she scrubbed the toothbrush up, down and all over.  So, she was trying to hold it in, eh? I had an idea of how to deal with that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holding is in only gonna make it worse!\" I said, as just using my index fingers, I rapidly traced lines up and down the arch of a foot, alternating between the two, before stroking up and down both feet simultaneously. This light tickling actually seemed more effective in getting her to giggle, I gradually added more and more fingers till I was using all ten fingers and she was having to really try hard to clamp down and hold back the laughter building up inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bahahahahaha!\" She giggled. I grinned triumphantly, having finally made her burst into sweet laughter. I glanced over at the clock and saw that I had taken a minutes and a half just to get her laughing. Alright, I would need a hell of a reversal to win this now, Jenna was now making her target shout with laughter and it sounded like he was close to giving up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at the redhead grinning at me confidently, she seemed proud she had managed to hold out so long, if I wanted to turn it around I would have to use some desperate measures. Time to go for broke!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Figuring I was going to lose unless I did something drastic, I formulated a plan. It was a desperate gamble, but I was betting with an intense attack I could coax a reflexive \"stop, please\" out of her.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the fact I already had her giggling to my advantage, I began stroking across each of her toes, aiming for the pads and teasing her pale toes with quick little strokes. She would clench her toes defensively, but I would persistently weave my fingers through her toes just to let a finger slip in and tickle those fleshy undersides. Miraculously this move paid dividends, as soon I had her squeaking and giggling. Then still attacking her feet with my left hand, I reached down with the right and retrieved the ribbon. I had just had an idea of exactly how to use it. I stopped tickling her toes long enough to slip the ribbon between the big toe and second toe on her left foot. Then, carefully watching the redhead's expression for if it was working, I slid the ribbon back and forth, up and down and all over delicate skin between her toes. I saw her face screw up in a grimace for a second from the unique, but no less ticklish sensation, before she broke out into blasts of hysterical giggles. It seemed it had been quite effective, but the drawback was manoeuvringa the ribbon between her toes took both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was gambling that using the ribbon had her right on the edge of surrendering, and that one little surprise push was all I needed to get her to give up. I chanced a glance over at how Jenna was doing, the blonde boy was shrieking in an oddly high-pitch and looked like he was close to breaking too.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\nAlright, time to break out my last resort, I leaned down and lapped at the toes on her foot without the ribbon with my tongue. Half-expecting the assistant to call me out for cheating. Nothing happened however, as all that transpired was that her giggles got deeper and heavier as a result of the oral tickling. Thankfully the toe-ties around her big toes prevented her feet from moving anywhere, which made life easier. After a few moments of this, I heard exactly what I wanted to her \"Comehohohhoon Sthahahp it! Sthap!\" I gestured to the stall assistant and when he nodded and stopped the egg timer, I raise my hands and cheered, feeling like I had just won a championship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced over at Jenna who had stopped tickling and was scratching her head. \"I can't believe you pulled that off!\" She exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, don't feel down. You can pick the prize,\" I said, feeling jubilant at my victory, as I stood up to talk to the assistant. The redhead whose feet I had just licked stepped out of the stocks and slipped her feet into a pair of flip-flops and stuck her hand out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta admit I'm impressed. Most boys don't have the guts to pull stuff like that,\" she laughed. \"You got me there. I'm Amber, visit us again sometime. Next time you won't win!\" She vowed, patting my shoulder as she walked off. I grinned at her, as I watched her walk off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was giggling as she selected a big plushie as a prize. She hugged it as we both stood up and walked away from the stocks to let someone else have a go. \"That sure was fun, wasn't it?\" She smiled cheerfully, as she slipped her arm around mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure was. But don't think being all sweet to me is going to make me forget you just lost the bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed but noticeably still kept her arm around mine. I wondered if she had really fun and she maybe didn't really mind her upcoming ordeal. She was a really fun girl to be around, so it wouldn't have surprised me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do now?\" She asked.</span></div></div>",

Well, I do anyway,\" I smiled confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, mister big shot,\" Jenna laughed. \"How about eight?\" I turned and looked at the girl in stocks number eight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't we know her?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we do,\" Jenna answered cheerfully as she strolled over to the number eight stocks and greeted their occupant. \"Hey, Lizzy! Didn't think I'd see you here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy, also known as just Liz, was an blonde-haired Australian-born girl who had immigrated here and had a part-time job as a lifeguard at the local swimming pool. It didn't surprise me that she got along so well with Jenna as they had a lot in common: friendliness, a mutual love of coffee, and from what I could tell, ticklishness. \"Hey, Jenna! Nice to see you! What brings you here?\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, y'know, just checking out some of the games here with the big guy over here,\" Jenna said, gesturing at me. \"What are you doing here anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just searching for some money, and here they pay you just to be ticklish. Looked like it might be kinda fun too!\" Liz smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, well, we don't want your boss to see you just chit-chatting. So we better play this game of yours,\" Jenna said, winking mischievously to her friend. \"I got this one, just sit back and watch the master at work,\" Jenna said confidently, turning to me. I nodded and decided to just sit back and enjoy the show. A cutie tickling another cutie was almost always an entertaining sight. I deeply considered taking my camera-phone out, but annoyingly enough the recording function had broken recently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went up and paid for the game as the assistant set up the egg-timer for eight minutes. Jenna wiggled her fingers at her Australian friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm digging in. I totally remember how ticklish your feet are from that time I invited you over for a sleepover,\" Jenna grinned playfully. I was imagining erotic pillow fights when laughter jolted me from my fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed Jenna had already begun and she had picked up two feathers that seemed to be her tools for this round. She ran both feathers up the blonde girl's soles at the same time, from heel to toes. The feet clenched and unclenched spasmodically as the feathers moved, enough that Jenna was able to dip the tips of the feathers into the bases of Liz\u2019s toes as she went past them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna, giggling at her friend's reaction, grabbed the toes of the right foot and traced one feather's tip all over the stretched arches, slightly pink balls and heels, between the captive's toes and along the edges of the feet as she heard giggling. The left foot was far enough away that it couldn't reach to interfere with her as she played and played with the other foot, but it bucked and flexed energetically as she continued. She turned the feather around, and used the stiff quill end to sew up and down the soles, causing the toes she held to twitch and flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffing blood, Jenna grabbed the foot around the arch and held it steady. Now with only her toes able to move, Liz's toes started wiggling back and forth to no avail. Using the tip of the feather, Jenna teased and stroked the tender webs of skin between the Australian girl's bubble-like toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to give up yet? I think I got you laughing pretty good...\" Jenna teased as she continued stroking away with the feather. All the while, Liz had only giggled endlessly, never quite replying to Jenna's taunts. She shook her blonde head wildly and defiantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, I guess I'll just have to use my fingers...\" Jenna grinned as she discarded the feathers. \"Don't say I didn't give you a chance!\" she said as she began wiggling her long sharp fingernails up and down the stocked feet. I shuddered as those long fingernails looked quite deadly, and it seemed Liz agreed with my sentiment, based on her gales of laughter as Jenna used her claws to stroke up and down her feet. She was about to begin digging through Liz's pale toes when she was interrupted by a loud ringing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops... looks like you were too slow,\" Liz smirked, panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, was that eight minutes already? Sure didn't feel like eight minutes...\" Jenna said, scratching her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what they all say!\" Liz laughed as she took a swig from a bottle of water. \"Better luck next time, mate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I can't believe she got the best of me. So what now, you want to have a go?\" Jenna asked. To be honest, I had enjoyed myself mightily just watching, but now that Jenna had asked me herself...</span></div></div>",

Jenna led the way as she grabbed onto my hand and pulled me along to where the rides had been set out. All around us were the sounds of joyful screams and manic laughter as the rides sought to excite and tickle at the same time. Jenna pulled me from one to another, unable to focus her attention for more than a few moments before heading off somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe finally came to a stop outside one of the larger attractions, a ride that had been set up to resemble a large spooky house with a set of tracks going through for the carts. Another female clown stood outside, this one with long blonde hair and a bright patchwork overcoat \"Ladies and gentlemen!\" She cried out, drumming up a crowd for the attraction \"Dare you enter the House of Giggles?! The Manor of extreme mirth?! I warn all those who think of entering, inside dwell the most merciless of tickle monsters that'll torment your toes, tease your tummies and tickle you until you go red!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clown went over her pitch to the audience, I glanced over to the carts that carried people through the ride. There was only one of them and that was designed for two people, making you wonder how long the thing lasted for. Instead of rests for the arms, they instead had padded parts that stuck upwards, meaning the arms would be held up high and would leave some very vulnerable armpits and ribs. The bottom had four padded holes where the feet would stick out and then I noticed the 'no shoes allowed on ride' sign nearby. Aside from a few straps on the limbs, only a seat belt around the waist for each person was on the ride and I realised just how vulnerable a person would be if they agreed to go on this ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing by the expressions of many around us, they too had caught on to how intense the ride could get and were looked as if they were having second thoughts \"So who among you will dare to try out the House of Giggles? Do any of you have the courage to do so?\" The clown called out as people looked back and forth at themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna caught my eye and I knew that her choice would be to...</span></div></div>",

Jenna squealed before trying to make a run for it, me following as I managed to keep up, brushing her sides and back with the feathers as she continued to giggle and enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe eventually stopped the chase as we slowed down our running and I put the feather dusters to one hand as Jenna got her breath back, although she was still giggling a bit. We had stopped by another ride and we both looked up to it to have a proper inspection of it. The ride was of the pirate ship variety, the sort where it'd swing back and forth, going high into the air time and time again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was interesting about this one though was the ship had several holes right by the seats for people to put their feet in when they sat down.

I had to take a moment to marvel at how many people were already here. We finally came to a ride that had a small line, though that might have been because it wasn't really a ride by the looks of it but a kind of an indoor obstacle course instead. There was a male clown who had purple baggy pants, squeaky shoes and bright green T-shirt underneath a patchwork coat. He also had a cane with a feather duster on the end, which he was using to gesture at things and tickle people who came up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come one, come all! Welcome to The Laughter Course! Who thinks they can brave the challenges ahead? Once you enter a room, the way to the next will be easy to spot, but not so easy to get to.

Only one way to find out! Enter our course and test your ticklish mettle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna and I exchanged nervous, but excited looks. It sounded like an awesome obstacle course, but of course we were both incredibly ticklish and it sounded like you would have to endure quite a bit of tickling just to get from one room to another, and we might get stuck a few times because of it.

So, would you like the kid course or the adult course?\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? There's two courses?

You'll need it.\"  <br>\r\nWe gulped nervously at those last three words and headed up to the entrance room. The room was brightly painted, there was the conveyor belt he was talking about and there was a sea of feathers in between us and a door marked with a big, red number 1.<br>\r\n\"How deep do you think it is?\" Jenna asked as we started slipping off our clothes. <br>\r\n\"At a guess, deep enough to reach our necks.\"<br>\r\n\"Makes sense.\"<br>\r\nBefore long, I was in nothing but grey and black striped boxers, standing in front of Jenna who wore a bright pink bra and panties.

After losing a battle of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock, I slowly lowered myself into the feathers first and immediately started giggling as I touched the feathers. It tickled quite a bit, and I was right. It came up to your neck. I looked over at the door to room 1, and then back at Jenna as I heard her shriek and giggle from the feathers.<br>\r\n\"You ready for this?\" I asked her.<br>\r\n\"Will it matter?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" And with that, we started making our way through the feathers and we both couldn't help but laugh and yelp from how bad the feathers tickled.<br>\r\nAfter a particularly loud yelp, she asked \"What tickles the most from these? For me it's the thighs.\"<br>\r\n\"Good to know! The armpits by far.\"<br>\r\nAfter we chuckled our way out of the sea, we took a moment to breathe before walking to the door.<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" I asked.<br>\r\n\"Let's do this.\" She responded with a grin.<br>\r\nWe opened the door and inside was...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly a female voice spoke over speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to room 1.  There are two table in front of you, blue is for male, pink is for female.

A thicker one for her knees and wrists, a thick one that went across and covered her bra; there were also two on her upper thighs that went at a parrel line with her panties.  And final one strap that doubled as a blindfold and kept her head down.  \"Wow I really am helpless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"  You said giving her side a light pinch, she giggles and tries to squirm away but can not move at all in her bondage.  \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but I doubt that matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"  You thin start to dig your fingers into her belly and spider tickle her midsection.  She bursts into hysteric laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmyhahahah-ohnonononopleshahagah!!!!\"  The cart starts to move as you continue your relentless assault on her poor soft and goregours brown skin.  \"Pleplepleshaha!\"  She continues to laugh, unable to stop as her skin is assault under your fingers.  He belly convulses at the touch.  Her brown skin turning a almost brownish-red from the assault.  She continues to gasp as you use your left hand to tickle her amazing belly while your right hand tickles her thighs.  \"Pleeeeeees-Stahahahap!!!!\"  She begs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, sorry got to keep this cart moving out of the mine, can wait to take you to the bank.\"  Then you lean down and blow a raspberry into her tasty tummy.  She bursts into more hysterics at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHA-nohahha-notthathahahstahp!!!!!!\"  You smiled as you again focus on her belly, one focusing on her ribs and midriff while the other assaulted her navel and hips.  Sweat trickled down her body as she had now been tickled for ten minuets.  You realize that you can take tickle instruments off passing barrels.   You grab an electric toothbrush and feather and use them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I have here.\"  You say mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what?\"  Jenna asked.  \"What-HAHA-nohahawhatesnostahhahahoh-gahd!!\"  You turn on the toothbrush and push it as deep it would go in her navel while the feather strokes her thighs and feet.  You refuse to stop as you reach half way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halfway there.\"  You say mockingly as the panty clad girl gasps below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half-wahnoIcahn-hahaha!!\"  You smile as her torture goes on and on.  You then switch, tickling Jenna's belly with the feather, going in slow deliberate strokes that circled her midriff.  Then the toothbrush assaulted her feet.  \"Nowhyst-ohwhatevahIsubmitples-hahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good submit to the tickling.\"  You say as you go back to using your fingers to assault her skin.  She laughs and screams finally when Jenna is about to faint the cart stops and a loud unlocking sound is heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations for completing room one.\"  The same woman voice said.  \"The tickle can now get off the table.\"  You unstrap Jenna and help her up, enjoying her warm and trembling skin against yours.  She sways and has to lean against the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That- that was literally torture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I enjoyed it.\"  She rolled her eyes and tried to slap your chest but was to tired to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You now have a choice, there are two doors.  One Green, One Red.  If you go through the green door then the ticklee must go in alone.  There they will have to reach the other side to unlock the door and allow their partner to cross undisturbed.  But beware there are ticklish and vicious vines that will assault you with tickles constantly, as well as hungry trees that would love to send you to their ticklish belly, which would force your partner through an additional room while the first partner is tortured mercilessly in the belly of the monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you do look delectable.\"  You say to Jenna grinning, she sticks her tounge out at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Red Door leads to the Room of Belly Torture.  There you will both face trials, with one of you having to be sacrificed to the Aztec tickle god at the end.  The surving partner will then go into the next room alone to rescue partner one.  Choose wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich door did they go through.  </span></div></div>",

Right before the two of you can get to the end Jenna shrieks. \"What the he-OHGODAHAHAHAHA!\" You can make out a pair of lithe hands grabbing her around the sides and pulling her away from you, but as you reach for her twisting laughing form both Jenna and perpetrator disappear into the darkness around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna? Jenna!\" You call with no success. She's gone. You reach the end of the tunnel in sadness. Sadness turns to bewilderment as you suddenly are in a massive jungle, in front of a huge Aztec pyramid. How is it even possible for the inside of the obstacle course to be this massive? It has to be some kind of magic. While you marvel at its size the announcers voice rings out from seemingly nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This challenge has two parts: first the non-captured partner will need to go to the top of the temple and enter it. Deep inside the temple you'll find your other partner, where priestesses will attempt to tickle-sacrifice her to a rival god.

I'm sure you'll find all of it to be very... Effective. The person who loses will be the sacrifice to the true god, and the surviving partner will go into the next room to rescue them again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is only one thing to do as you can practically hear Jenna's tortured screams as fingers, feathers, and hand brushes take over her soft skin.</span></div></div>",

The room is set up well with the backdrop and sound effects adding to the atmosphere, as though it was dusk with a volcano in the background.  Climbing to the top of the stairs you look in and find that you have to climb stairs downward into the pyramid.  Walking down there are feathers arranged so they stroke across your belly.  You cough to hold back giggles as Jenna's tortured laughter could be heard.  You reach the bottom of the stairs where you could go left or right.  You go right and continue as fuzzy vines flutter back and forth across you stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room of belly, torture, makes sense.\"  You continue walking as you round a corner and see a figure.  It was a hooded woman who sounded to be in her forties or fifties.  She just stood there for a moment before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer this riddle if you wish to past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is usually deep, but can also not be, what can be oval, round or different.

What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment before realizing what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A navel.\"  You answer.  The woman nods as a secret door opens to her left and she disappears.  You continue until you see a group of pillars.  You realize that the pillars rotate at different sections.  Turning them you see that the pillars tell a story of a girl being captured, tied and tickled, and... eaten by a monster and tickled in its belly....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh ho.  You think as Jenna's screams become louder.  She hadn't been given a moment to rest and the poor brown skin girl seemed to be in constant ticklish agony.  Moving fast you reach a door.  Looking at it you realize you have to take a knob and lead it through a maze.  Once completed the door moves to reveal a small chamber.  In the chamber you beautiful friend was tied down spread eagle on a stone slab.  Surrounding her was half a dozen women dressed in outfits tickling her all over her body and chanting.  Poor Jenna was in hysterics as her body was absolutely drenched in sweat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhahahaha-ple-pl-ohahaha.\"  She was losing the ability to even yell she was so tired and out of breath.  The leading woman seemed to nod and the priestesses stepped away.  Suddenly as they backed away another hidden door opened.  Out stepped what looked and acted like an animatronic.  It looked like a giant jaguar-man that moved rigidly as its robotics moved.  It Walked towards Jenna who laid her head back and moaned as he creature approached her.  Its claws cut the ropes of her feet and ankles.  Suddenly it grabbed her by the waist and opened its jaws as she was lifted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna!\"  You yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, save me!\"  She yells as her head was shoved int he creature's mouth.  Out of its mouth shot a bunch of firm feathery-tongues.  It danced across her arms, face, at first.  Then it moved to attack and taste her breasts, ribs and eventually her toned and sexy tummy.  She bucked and squirmed but the creature's claws held her tight and its mouth clamped down, making Jenna groan and go 'oomph' as it became tighter as she continued to laugh.  \"Oh-hahah-gah-stohahahap-ples-stoahap-noooo-dohaha-eatme!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna!\"  You yell running forward as the rest of her tummy and hips eaters the ceature's jaws.</span></div></div>",

The monster releases a humming noise that almost sounds like laughter and opens its jaws, dropping Jenna.  You run over and grab Jenna by the wrist.  She is very tired but you drag her running as you backtrack through the pyramid all the way back out into the room.  Jenna is completely out of breath and leans her warm body against you as you enjoy feeling her stomach rise and fall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  She says smiling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"  You say squeezing her side and causing her to giggle.  Suddenly the woman who gave you the riddle comes up to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good boy, you saved this delectable damsel from the false lord.  Now it is time for you to battle.  You two must fight each other, trying to tickle the other into submission.  The loser will bee sacrificed to the true tickle gods.\"  Jenna shivers at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  You say excitedly.  The woman smiles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, here are you weapons.\"  She says handing you an electric feather duster and a old style brush.  Jenna got a large feather and an electric toothbrush.  The woman led you over to a ring of dirt.  Jenna looked worried, being extremely exhausted from her previous ordeals.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\"  You ask smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it!\"  Jenna says taking a deep breath, trying to get zoned in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brave words, but who will win. Battle for your lives, now!\"  The woman throws up her arms and you lunge at Jenna, she dodges you and strokes you legs and hips with her large feather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice strike.\"  You say chuckling.  \"But can you dodged this.\"  You strike to one side with your brush making Jenna jump and enter the spinning feathers of the electric dusters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha-stahp!\"  She yells scrambling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give up.\"  You yell chasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never!\"  She replies waving her electric toothbrush around.  You dodge her toothbrush and parry her feather, striking against with your swirling duster.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give up yet!\"  You taunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\"  The two you continued to dance around trying to gain the upper hand.  However you're able to wear out Jenna who is already tired.  Finally as she dance backwards, bending her wonderful body trying to avoid your tickle, she stumbled back and fell in the dirt.  Seizing the chance you dive and try to pin your gorgeous friend.  She twist and turns and momentarily gets on top you and start to tickle your chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now you hahahaha don't.\"  You say popping her thigh.  You grab her sexy thighs and twist, getting her in front of you on her side.  You wrap her legs around hers pinning them tightly.  You then pin her arms and start digging into her soft and wonderful belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohno-oh-please-hahahahahahaha-ohnooo-hahahaha!\"  Finally a face of submission crosses her face as she realizes she is the one who will be sacrificed.  She continues to try to buck and gag as your fingers dig deeply into her amazing skin.  Her bucking right against you feels nice to say the least and you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you submit?\"  You ask pushing as hard as you can into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha-ohgod-haha-fine-pleshahastahhahap!!!!\"  She begs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be the sacrifice!\"  You then use you knees to force her arch to back, forcing your hands deeper into her midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owowowow-fineahhahah-owhahpleasethathurtshaha!\"  She replies groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say I won, say you are just a girl to be sacerficed!\"  You keep ticking her faster and harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohowhahahaha-fine-hahah-youwon!  Hahahahahohohoh-ILLLBETHESACERFICEIMJUSTAGIRLTOBESCERFICEDHAHAHPLES!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.\"  You say smiling standing up.  Your poor friend lays and pants on the ground as two men in fake jaguar costumes come and grab her by each arm and firmly take hold of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations on your victory.\"  The woman says looking at you.  \"As for you\"  she says looking at Jenna, \"Im afraid you have quiet the ordeal in front of you.\"  She signals to the two men who start to drag her up the steps of the pyrimid.  \"Hopeful the sacerfice wont hurt you to bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just saying that as part of the show right?\"  Jenna says worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not.\"  The woman said softly.  \"It is never fun to be the sacrifice.\"  As they reach the top of the steps Jenna is brought to an altar.  She submissively lays down but is surprsingling not tied down.  The man and woman then start chanting as a hum filled the room.  Jenna's breasts and tummy rose and fell as she breathed rapidly.  Suddenly multiple pairs of long and strong hands popped out of the altar.  Each pair grabbed her wrists and ankles.  Bfore she could scream a pair of hands wrapped around her mouth, holding her down and quieting her screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmph!\"  Jenna yells and another half dozen pairs of hands appear and start to tickle her, scratching and digger into her skin.  She tries to get away but doens't come close.  \"Mppphhhaphahhahpppppppph!!!!!\"  She screams.  The middle of the altar that Jenna is on then starts to descend as raging hot steam starts to shoot out from the edges.  Jenna flinches and yells as the hot steam rolls across her sweaty body.  She continues to groan and struggle against her captors as she slowly disappears.  You smile at her as her the steam forms droplets on her body and she continues to desperately try to get away from the hands and burning steam.  Then she slowly disappears and the altar closes, though wisps of steam still comes through giving a clue of the torment she is still in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well congratulations champion.  Now it is up to you to go rescue your friend.\"  The woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you give me a clues of what to expect?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for your friend she is basically going to spend her time waiting for you being tickled is a room filled with very <i>very</i> hot steam, with some hot water that shots out at her body occasionally.  We also have a guy dressed up in a ac cooled absurd costume tickling her as well as a bunch of ticklish feeling snakes running across her body.\"  You flinch at this as Jenna is terrified of snakes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I need to go get her then.\"  You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but you have a choice.  Do you want to rescue your friend quickly, or let her suffer in order to make you path easier.  You can take the hard path and enter the hot and humid room and fight her tickle torturer.  Or you can let her suffer for a little bit as you take a relaxing walk into a medical room.  There you will get a ac cooled costume that you can wear for the one room to rescue your friend.  The aztec tickle 'god' will act as though he recognizes you and will allow you to take your desperate friend.  Which will you choose.?\" </span></div></div>",

Then she started to tickle Jenna's exposed midriff with her hard and long nails.

The look in Jenna's eyes stops you from giving in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, good sir, we understand.\", the blonde woman replies sweetly, but as she says this she motions for a busty, heavily made-up redhead (also in renaissance-style clothing) to stop her relentless tickling of a teenager and come over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jenna. There's other cool things in the park to look at besides these stocks. Besides, they seem a little too friendly...\" you grab her arm and pull her away from the elegantly dressed woman. She pauses for a second to catch her breath and then, rubbing her sides, walks with you towards the exit. Right before you walk out of the area's gate she gives a shriek. You look at her to see the woman has grabbed her around the sides and is immobilizing her with one arm, while her fingers dance around Jenna's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" You step in to help Jenna but before you can out-tickle Jenna's attacker you feel two hands in your armpits. The other woman she called over has approached you from behind and digs her fingernails into your pits. You utter a decidedly unmanly ticklish cry and attempt to wriggle free. \"Hey, stop-ahahahaha!\" She pulls you tightly against her ample breasts and whispers to you, \"Now you'll both have to play the clothing game, aye?\" She has a slight accent, Scottish maybe. You look over at Jenna who's doubled over in silent laughter, held tightly by the blonde lady. The blonde woman's light tickles are driving her mad, versus the rough squeezes and jabs the redhead is subjecting you to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you both tire enough to stop resisting and are dragged over to two pairs of restraints: horizontal X-frames that exposed plenty of belly, armpit, sides, and pretty much every other ticklish place on the body. Sweaty, exhausted, and maybe slightly aroused, neither of you give the two Renaissance women much of a fight and are strapped down right next to each other. \"Let the questions begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one is addressed to Jenna, They seem to be history themed, with a bit of fetish thrown in. \"What was Catherine the Great's favorite method of interrogation?\". one of the women asks her, You know the answer but it's not your turn, all you can hope is that Jenna is as much of a tickling buff as you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... spanking?\", Jenna tentatively answers. \"Wrong!\", answers the redhead, \"Now we get to remove an item of clothing from BOTH of you. Also, it isn't in the rules but I think we should tickle you every time you get a question wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\", you exclaim, \"I didn't answer wrong! It was her answer...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women ignore you and set to work, The blonde tears off Jenna's shirt while the redhead removes your own with an antiquated pair of scissors. This whole amusement park is seeming more realistic by the second. Then before you can protest any more they dig in. The lady who captured Jenna runs her sharpish fingernails all over her belly, sending the poor girl into panicked shrieks of laughter. He voice shoots higher when a well-manicured nail enters her cute belly button. .<br>\r\n\"Jesus Chris-Ahahahah HehehehStopthathehehehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are faring no better. The accented redhead starts to massage your thighs, which at first feels good but then turns to tickling when she begins to squeeze. For all your struggling you can't escape the relentless pinching of your soft flesh by her pale hands. The minutes turn to hours, and several difficult questions later you both are down to your underwear/panties. Jenna's even lost her bra.  You both are dirtier and sweatier than before, thanks to your restraints being low to the dusty ground and how sweaty your bodies have become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk!\" the redhead chides. \"You both seem to have gotten dirty, and we cam't have dirty people in the park.\" The blonde woman goes to a nearby supply shed and returns with two antiquated wooden buckets, each filled with soapy water, a scrub brush, and a sponge. \"Thankfully we ladies here have the perfect solution to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you let us go, so we can wash ourselves?\", you try. Next to you Jenna pulls on her wrists but to no avail, as the X-frame still holds tight. \"Nice try, honey. but we\u00e9re not ready to let you two go yet. The fun has just begun!\" says the blonde lady, her bosom bouncing in her excitement. She hands a soapy bucket to the redhead, who approaches you while she walks up to Jenna's bound frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn those bathing devices look really tickly!</span></div></div>",

The Countess of Chuckles is known to have lots of fun with those who see her shows.\" She paused, and smirked with amusement. \"Though, if you're one of the lucky ones, you might not even be able to pay attention to the show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna and I looked at each other with confusion. \"What do you mean by that?\" I asked. \"Wouldn't we want to be paying attention to the show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown chuckled. \"You'll find out for yourself when you go to the seat ticket booth. Either way, have fun at the Big Top!\" She waved at us as she walked away, laughing quietly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna turned to me nervously. \"What do you think she meant? Lucky ones? Who wouldn't want to pay attention to the show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged back. \"Only one way to find out, I suppose.\" Jenna nodded her agreement, and the two of turned toward the Gigantic Tent, and started walking, with me giving Jenna a quick tickle with the feather dusters any time something caught her attention. Eventually, the ticket booth came into view with a fairly long line still ahead of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after a few minutes of waiting, and talking quietly to ourselves, we got to the ticket booth, to find a clown who looked like he was in his mid-thirties, next to a big spinner that had five slender gold lines in star formation standing out against the rest of the blue board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello kids!\" The clown greeted. \"I haven't seen you guys here before. New to the Karnival?\" He asked, to which we nodded yes to. \"Splendid! Well let me explain how this works! There's two types of seats in the big top. The first, and much more common are the blue ticket seats. They're about what you'd expect from normal circus seats. You'll be surrounded by other people, you'll be expected to not disturb the show, and you run the risk of catching the attention of Kitchy when she starts looking for volunteers from the audience to join her show. Which, don't get me wrong, would be fun and put a smile on your face. However, there's another, luckier place to sit. Centered around near the top of the tent, are ten sound proof boxes. We call these gold ticket seats. In there, you'll have privacy from the rest of the tent, you won't be called on by Kitchy, and since it's soundproof, you don't need to worry about disturbing the show. But! There's a catch.\" Jenna and I exchanged glances. \"There's only one actual 'seat' up there. The other one is actually a set of stocks positioned so your face is pointed toward the glass in the box. One of you will be stripped to your underwear and immobilized in the stocks, the other will get to sit in the chair and inflict whatever ticklish desire they have on the poor person. Now you can see why they're sound proof. Which person is stocked is up to you. So far, 4 of the boxes have been taken up. Now, I can just give you blue tickets if you want, but if you're feeling lucky, we can give the spinner a...well, a spin, and see if you hit gold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna and I looked at each other, not even needing to discuss this. We both already knew what we were gonna choose. I looked at the clown and said...</span></div></div>",

You're sure to be laughing during the show! One way or another.\" He ended mischievously. \"Just pray that you don't end up called down to the stage. Unless you'd enjoy being up front and center, as Kitchy has fun with you. Enjoy the show kids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter laughing off the clown's antics, Jenna and I walked into the tent only to be amazed by how much bigger the tent seemed on the inside. Which was saying something, given how large it seemed on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is huge!\" Jenna said in awe. \"You'd be able to fit the entire school, and their entire families in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then some, I'm guessing.\" I commented, before something caught my eye, and I pointed. \"Look Jenna! Those must be those private boxes the ticket guy was talking about!\" Indeed, they somehow had ten metal boxes stationed around the tent, with mirrored glass on the side facing toward the stage, so we couldn't see in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna turned to me, a little nervous. \"Should we have tried for one of those boxes? I mean the guy said that the people in there don't have to worry about getting called down to the stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh psh. Being called down to the stage would be fun. Especially given the Kitchy Karnival's 'theme'\". I added on to this by tickling her belly real quick with one of the feather dusters, to which she responded with some nervous giggling and taking a half step back. \"Besides, you saw how small those gold lines were on the spinner. There's no way we would have been lucky enough to get those seats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to settle down a little bit upon hearing that. \"You're right, you're right. Just a little nervous at the idea of being tickled in front of all these people. Even if I would stay fully clothed, unlike up there I suppose.\" She looked at the box almost wistfully, and I gave her a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well tell you what. If the public exposure is the problem, I'll just head up to the stage if she points our way, and when we leave and go back home, I can tickle you in private. I won't even make you strip down.\" I said, then added: \"Unless you want to of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna rolled her eyes, smiles and snorted a little, before lightly hitting me in the arm. \"Don't push your luck guy. But we'll see how this goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe quickly walked down and found our seats. We talked for awhile as people slowly filled into the Big Top. Only about ten minutes before the show started, we heard a familiar voice say \"Well, well, well. Look who's sitting next to our seats.\" We turned and saw...</span></div></div>",

That didn't seem to cross her mind however and she agreed to meet me here at her place once we were ready. I quickly rushed home and changed into some swimming trunks and a t-shirt, grabbing a bag for some towels and food and water bottles. Remembering to grab some sun cream as well, I then walked back to Jenna's and saw her standing there, eagerly waiting, a bag over her shoulder and wearing a large white t-shirt that covered all the way down past her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing me wave, she bounced over to the street. \"Finally got here then?\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't miss it for the world,\" I replied, and Jenna actually looked fairly bashful at that, giving a sweetly shy smile and a hint of a blush coloring her cheeks. Hooking her arm in with mine, we started walking towards the beach. I felt a smile cross my face as Jenna did that. She always had been a very affectionate person, something I'd always liked about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some might think we're a couple going like this,\" I said, growing rather fond of the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna laughed as we descended the steps and saw the beach itself before us, the golden sands and azure sea calling out. \"I'll just tell people you're here to cool me down with a big leafy fan. That's a lot more believable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it in good humor, I covered my mouth in mock outrage. \"Me? A mere servant?\" I retorted, sneaking a hand down to Jenna's side and tickling her gently, squeezing the spot just below the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickling made Jenna throw her head back and laugh as she squirmed away from me. \"Nohohofaiirahahaaa!!!\" she protested as I held on and continued to give her ribs tickly pinches, making her jump and giggle for some time before she gave in. \"Ohohoookahhaayeheheee!!! Youwinnhahahaaaa!!!\" she giggled before I finally stopped, letting her catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm not just a servant then?\" I asked, beaming as Jenna smiled up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore. Now you've been upgraded to some guy I know,\" she said, and just managed to dodge my outstretched hands as I tried to tickle her again. She stuck her tongue out at me playfully and I had to chuckle as well. Jenna always managed to get people to smile, most of the time even without tickling them. Most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked out onto the beach together, chatting away about where would be a good spot when we found a rather secluded area between two dunes. It was protected from the wind and gave us a good view of the sea itself while also having the sun shining down on it. It was a perfect place to sit and we set our stuff down, wondering what to do. Then Jenna looked over the beach and saw something...</span></div></div>",

You and Jenna decide to walk over to it, looking down at it you see it is the metal tip of a canoe.  Jenna reaches down.  \"Help me get it out of the sand.\"  She says as you reach down and help pull the canoe out of the sand.  It looked big enough for two people and had paddles in it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks nice.\"  You say looking at the brown skinned beauty if front of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It reminds me of the canoes we have at our high school.\"  She replied, you nod.  \"Come on lets take it out.\"  She says pulling it towards the water.  You have to problem with the idea as you follow and help place the canoe into the ocean.  The two of you hop in and start to row out to sea as you enjoy the blue sky and light breeze in the nice warm day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you warm with that t-shirt on?\"  You say smirking.  Jenna blushes just a bit and raises an eyebrow at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you forward.\"  She says smirking, you hold your hands up innocently.  She chuckles and shakes her head.  Reaching down she pulls het t-shirt over her head and your jaw almost drops as you see your friend in a strapless brown bikini.  Her brown skin is showed off, from her nice looking legs to her toned and sexy tummy and nice curves.  Both of you blush as you look around the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice day.\"  You say.  Jenna just shakes her head.  You and Jenna chat for a bit as you continue to row out and enjoy the few of the shoreline.  Eventually the two of you stop paddling and enjoy the rocking of the boat.  Jenna flicks her dark brown hair out of her eyes as she comes and sits down next to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love this weather.\"  She says.  You smile at her as you wrap an arm around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\"  You saw running your fingers over her silky smooth and soft tummy and sides.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha-stahpthat!\"  She says trying to push you away.  You over power her however and have her pinned on the floor of the canoe as you tickle her brown belly as her her tone belly rises and falls.  Your fingers dance along her skin as she bucks and squirms.  \"Nono-hahaha-ples-hahahah-stahp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is so much fun.\"  You say as you blow a raspberry onto her sweaty belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahaha!\"  Jenna calls out.  \"Please-stahahap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I stop.\"  You say, however you do give her a break as you turn down the tickling to only gently running your fingers over her gorgeous bare belly, making Jenna lightly giggle.  You then start to give her a belly rub as she lays her head back and closes her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels nice.\"  She says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your belly does feel nice.\"  You reply, Jenna just chuckles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me up.\"  She says, you nod as she sits up and looks over the side of the boat.  She turns her head and smirks at you.  \"See if you can catch a mermaid.\"  She says as she hops over board and starts diving under water.  He swims down to the bottom which is now about thirty feet down and picks up a seashell before pooping back up and dropping it off in the canoe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello mermaid.\"  You say smirking as she dives down under the canoe before popping up on the other side and rests her arms on the side of the canoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello sailor.\"  She replies smirking.  You reach over and grab her by the waist as you pull her back into the canoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I captured a mermaid, I hear you are helpless out of the water and deathly ticklish.\"  You say squeezing her sides.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha-no-youhahah-dont-wanttotickme!\"  She squirms out of your grasp and dives back into the water.  She appears on the other side of the canoe smirking, taunting you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you dont.\"  You say trying to grab her.  Suddenly there is a flash of green and Jenna starts to be pulled away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-help!\"  She cries out as she is pulled away, you see a whirlpool suddenly appear in the distance.  Paddling quickly you try to catch up as you and Jenna near the whirlpool.  Reaching down you grab her arm before it slips from your grasp.  \"No!\"  She cries as her cry becomes a gurgle as she is pulled under.  You are also in danger as your canoe starts to fall down the whirlpool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa-whoa-ohuh-WHOA!\"  You call out as the canoe tips and you fall down the whirlpool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minuets latter you open your eyes as you see a large silhouette in front of you.  You're to groggy to move as you feel yourself hoisted in the air and you fall back asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open you eyes groggily to find your arms shackled above you head.  You look around and realize that you appear to be in one of the lower decks of an old wooden ship.  Looking around the space was crowded and damp.  Looking to your left you see Jenna.  She was also just now waking up.  Her clothes had changed however.  They were very similar but now appeared as a mud brown patch of fabric that was in the same place as her bikini, it was skimpy to say the least, her bottom piece didn't cover much either.  You felt your heartbeat faster just by looking at her.  You also realize your clothes now also appeared to be from the 1700s. Suddenly you hear footsteps coming down the stairs.  Two men appeared, both looked to be in their thirties or forties, one wore a tricorner hat while the other didn't wear any head cover but had a blue tunic.  The one with the tricolor hat seemed to be in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the two we picked up?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Captain.\"  The man with no hat replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.  The girl should fetch a good price, the boy we can find a use for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  You and Jenna ask at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet.  I bet you have a lot of questions.  You fell through a portal yes?  Well your actual bodies are still in the real world.  Im sure youll wake up there in a few hours.  But this is now where you dream.  And this is were I am able to run this little ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about prices?\"  Jenna asks nervously, not quiet digesting the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still need to make a living in this world while I sleep.  In this world most girls and women are bought and sold as tickle slaves, people are obsessed with tickling here.  You're a pretty girl, what are you Puerto Rican?\"  The man asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly.\"  Jenna replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep I bet selling you to a tickle slaver will fetch me a lot of money.  Not sure what to do with the boy, but Im sure we can find a use.\"  The man says pointing at you.  \"Most people aren't interested in male tickle slaves, but perhaps I can find a buyer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just sell us into slavery!\"  Jenna replied fuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\"  The Captain replied rolling his eyes.  \"Johnny get a crate ready for her, well need to store her during the trip to ticklekingston-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain ship coming from the north!\"  Another man said running down the steps.  \"Red and black flags sir!  Reavers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnation!\"  The Captain yelled.  I wont be struck down to respawn without a ship, or eaten alive by one of them to by tickledigested by them!  Get ready to fight.\"  He looked at you and Jenna.  \"Ill return to finish this talk later.  Pray we win, theyll not differentiate between us and you.\"  He looked at Jenna.  \"Especially a ticklish thing like you.\"</span></div></div>",

These reavers don't sound good though.\"  Suddenly your heard cannon fire from both the ship you were on and the Reaver ship.  You and Jenna yelled as a cannonball came screaming through the room.  You look up to see that the cannonball destroyed your shackles, liberating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going up to the deck.\"  You say to Jenna.  \"Stay safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, Ill do all in my power.\"  She says rolling her eyes at you annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way up to the deck you see troops boarding.

One look at them told you who's side you had to join.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get up here?\"  The Captain said spotting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a sword, Im going to protect this ship!\"  The Captain pauses for a second before tossing you a sword.  Suddenly the Reavers rush the crew and a battle ensued.  You soon find yourself in a one on one battle with a burly shirtless man who screamed in rage.  After a few parries you strike for his heart and hit it.  The man doesn't seem to die, instead he fades away.  You remember what the Captain said about 'respawing'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good strike boy.\"  The Captain says defeating two opponents by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you spot a reaver wearing a large feathered cap.  He seemed to be the enemy captain.  You walk up to him and begin to fight.  \"Prepare to respawn!\"  The man howls in rage.  A flurry of strikes and parries followed.  Sparks flew from your swords as you battle.  You tried to strike him but he grabbed your arm and used your momentum to throw you to the grown.  \"Ha!\"  He yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it!\"  You tell blocking his blows even from the ground.  Suddenly he is able to knock the sword from your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye!\"  He yells.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\"  The Reaver gasps and fades away as you see the Reaver Captain fade away.  The pirate captain stands there smiling as the reavers gasp in shock with the fall of their captain.  They shout a flee to their ship.  \"Don't let them escape, fire broadsides at will!\"  The captain yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes captain!\"  The crew yelled as cannonball after cannonball was fired at the fleeing Reaver ship until it started to fall apart and sink.  The Captain help you up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  You say thanking the Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you, that was fine sword play.\"  He smiles and calls his First Mate Johnny and whispers in his ear.  Johnny nods and runs off.  \"Crew gather around!\"  He yells.  \"Today this fine young man joined us by his own volition.  He struck down Reavers, and fought their own captain competently.  I think he has earned a place among our crew!\"  The crowd cheered at this and threw their fists into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, uh, I guess.\"  You reply.  The Captain chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This state of dreaming takes a while to get use to.\"  The Captain replies.  \"Welcome to the crew of the Raspberry.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice name.\"  You say smiling.  The Captain chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You helped save the ship.  I think you earned a reward.  Many of this crew has their own tickle slaves on our lands back on shore.  But I think I can help you right now.\"  Looking up you see Jenna led out in her skimpy clothing with her hands and feet shackled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna.\"  You say smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will having your friend as a tickle slave suffice as a reward and first payment?\"  The Captain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\"  You reply grinning from ear to ear.  Johnny comes up to you and hands you a multiended whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To claim her you need to flog her belly six times.\"  He says as Jenna is tied down onto an altar.  You nod and head over to Jenna and enjoy looking at her body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Im a gift to you.\" She says matteroffactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"  You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to sting.\"  She replies.  She sighs and closes her eyes.  \"Make it quick.\"  You nod as you bring down the lash.  She gasps and flinches at the strike.  You come down a few more times making her whimper and curl her toes.  The fifth time creates tears on her face.  \"Ow.\"  She whispers.  One last time and she bucks against her bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its done Jenna its okay.\"  You say bending down and giving her a belly rub on her stinging stomach.

He then hands you what looks to be a watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are called T-cuffs.

Jenna puts on a pouting face when she hears that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, but no. Don't worry, her laughter won't bother anyone here.\" he says with a laugh as he exits the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go see what else I can find out about this place. Don't go anywhere now!\" You say smiling. You knew if her hands weren't bound, you'd have a sore shoulder right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave to go talk to the captain.</span></div></div>",

He is sitting at a big table next to a girl wearing nothing more than a bikini and a set of T-cuffs. Her arms, however, were currently free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the one who fought against the reavers with us. He is the reason any of us are alive\" He says to his slave who looks you up and down with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking we were screwed either way and you all were at least more civilized.\" You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what brings you here?\" He says as he pours a drink into three glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted some information on were exactly I am.\" You say. He smiles and begins to tell you the tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in the realm of Tickle-Romania, A dream land where the main obsession is tickling. Our main energy source is the laughter of our slaves.\" As he says this, he tickles the side of the woman next to him. She falls to the floor in a fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues, \"We don't know how this place got here, but our scientist in Ticklekingston, the capitol of Tickle-Romania, have concluded that this world must've been dreamt up by someone. It is he sworn duty of the political leaders to find this creator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are blown away by this. Remembering the reaver from earlier, you ask \"What happens when someone respawns?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're transported to a realm parallel to this one. It is the same in every way except that the women are the ones who put men in tickling slavery. It is called Tickle-Womania.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clever.\" you say sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, quite. When men die here, they are transferred to the other realm to become slaves themselves. Once a slave here is tickled to certain point, they respawn to become the owners. Fair is fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the captain's slave gets up, you notice her boots. Like the T-cuffs, they have a brass finish. You wonder what they can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's she wearing on her feet?\" you ask. The captain smirks while his slave looks at you in fear. He presses another button on his watch and she immediately falls to the ground in a fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The scientists really are amazing here. These boots conform to the shape of the wearer's foot and customly tickle the victim in the most effective way possible. Plus, it's powered by the laughter of its victim, so it'll always run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get a pair for Jenna?\" You ask hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see when we get to Ticklekingston.\" He says smiling. Your fantasies of remotely tickling Jenna with a pair of magic boots were suddenly interrupted by a scream coming from the bottom deck. You and the captain look at eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna!\" You both yell. You bolt down to your room to find Jenna...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As soon as she is given the ability to speak, you hear her yell<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a trap!\" As she says this, you feel a sharp pain in your back. You turn around to see Johnny who has just plunged a knife into your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't belong here. Have fun in the other realm\" He says menacingly.

Sprinting to the top you see the Captain obviously upset and yelling.  \"Are you serious helmsman!  We've entered tickle-Havana a dozen times!  You now there is a reef here!\"  He turns and sees you.  \"Ah, I was expecting you would be tickling your goregous slave for some time.\"   He said smirking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I intend to.\"  You replu thinking about your sexy puerto rican friend.  You cant wait to tickle her brown skin somemore and make her squirm.  \"But I do want ask more Answers first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot boy.\"  The Captain says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first I suppose I should make sure the ship isn't sinking?\"  You said raising an eyebrow.  The captain snorts and chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we're not sinking.  Our great helmsman got careless and hit a reef before we could enter port.  Well be stuck here for a few hours until its repaired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  You reply.  \"I suppose I should ask where exactly are we?  You mentioned something about a 'weird state of dreaming' earlier.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.  You are asleep boy.  You and your tickle slave, as am I and everyone else here.  For now on this is where youll come when you sleep.  And when you sleep here youll go back to the real world.  It is interesting how it works.  Are we both asleep at the same time?  Or is this dimension playing with time as well as location?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So its like a second world to live in when we sleep?\"  You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.  In the real world I'm a dentist.  Here I'm a Pirate Captain.\"  He says shaking his head and smirking a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a slaver.\"  You reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy everyone in this dreamland is for the most part.  Its not us being cruel to each other.  People here are obsessed with tickling.  It use to be mostly men that had the ships and most of the women who came through like your friend were young girls in bikinis.  So over time most of the women were captured and sold into tickle slavery.  I didn't see you complain when we brought your friend out for you to have.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  You reply.  \"Though I was surprised by the lack of ropes below.  And impressed by the technology.  Johnny was enthusastic about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes he can get on a bit of a tangent when it comes to that sort of stuff.\"  The Captain replied.  \"We've been at sea for a while.  Got some gold.  So all the rope is currently being used for actual sailing.  Ill get you some more in port if your prefer more traditional bondage.  But yes the technology is mixed here.  We live in wooden houses that look old, yet our candles work like electricity, you flip a switch.  We don't have ac, but we have fans that turn as if powered by magic.  And yes we have magnetic cuffs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is this world just a duplicate?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what we can tell.  We're in the Carribean obviously.  I stay down here.  I hear tales of a far off Europe and the Americas are here.  But everything is in a 1700s style set up.  Oh and the countries are all multiethnic.  Heck the countries sure aren't duplicates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\"  The Captain replied.  \"We put 'tickle' in front of the city we go to in order to keep track of the real world and this one.  I am offically a member of the Ocean Tigers Confederation.  Its developed into a country, if still a loose one.  After being formed by a group of colleges students who ended up here on spring break some fifty years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\"  You reply looking out at the coastline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The capital is tickle-Kingston.  So we control Jamaica and some other islands.  That city there is tickle-Havana.  That I guess matches up with the real world a bit better.  Mostly hispanic since a lot of people from latin america spawned there.  They're the Latin Unidos, I think.  They control what in our world is Cuba, Hispanola, Puerto Rico and Florida.  Your friend- or should I say slave, would fit right in.  Whenever someone wants a pretty senorita for a slave they just come to their capital of tickle-Havana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice.\"  You say blushing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Of course there is also the Maurading Federation.  Those guys are obssed with the tickleslave trade, economy runs on it.  They rule parts of the mainland. Then there are the Mercs.  Literally they're just a bunch of mercinaries, or privateers that control what we would call Tampa and New Orleans.  Bid for their service and they'll serve.  Then they'll go back to their safe haven.  There are many others but I can tell you about those later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\"  You say looking around.  \"Another question.  What is with the respawing?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one dies here.\"  The Captain replies.  \"If you get killed, or your ship explodes youll appear somewhere on land with the worse hangover of your life.  Then you have to find a way back.  Most crews have a rally point.  For us its an inn north of tickle-Kingston.  Its quiet the hassle, and you have to pay and build a new ship.  So we try to avoid it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So people don't die, but are people born, can a woman become pregnant here?\"  You ask again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you thinking about pumping a junior into your friend?\"  The captain asks smirking.  You blush at this comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh- no of course not- I mean.  Me and Jenna are kind of dating.  But we're not there yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I understand.\"  The Captain replied.  \"No I don't believe women can become pregant here.  In fact one tickle slave, this firey Indian girl.  Told me that she was seven montsh pregant in the real world.  Didn't show at all here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\"  You reply.  Suddenly a voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain well be ready in about an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"  The Captain replied to one of his crew members.  \"I want to be ready to go into port the second after repairs are made.\"  He turned and looked at you.  \"Glad to have you aboard kid.  But now I need to go check on some things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay captain.\"  You say.  You then go back downstairs.  You and Jena smirk at eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master.\"  She says slyly as you sit down to your scatily clad friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave.\"  You reply squeezing her sides.  She burst into giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe-ha-thahaha-tickles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you compalining slave!  Do I need to gag you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha-mayahahbe.\"  She replies smirking as you push her down onto the bed.  \"But first can I ask some questions?\"  She asks as you let up for a moment as you straddled her thighs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.  But for every question you ask I shall tickle you for a minuet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay <i>master</i>.\" she replies grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since you just ask one.\"  You start to savagely attack her swarthy and silky soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahah-ohagahahaha-plemaster!  Hahahahaha!\"</span></div></div>",

You shrug and squeeze the puerto rican's side.  \"Hahaha okay-hahah-sorrymasterhaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now come along slave.\"  You said pulling her leash.  A man runs up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Collins.\"  He says shaking your hand.  \"The Captain sent me to make sure you were okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  You say walking into Tickle-Havan.  \"Lots of little shops.\"  You say as you walk into a outdoor style shopping area.  People sold food, weapons, shops.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Tickle-Havana is a rather large city.\"  Collins says.  \"Wonderful buildings, good shops, can rent a tickle slave if you feel the urge to tickle someone.\"  You smile as Collins chuckles.  \"You seem to have that covered.\"  He says look Jenna up and down in her small  brown bikini and short miniskirt outfit.  Jenna stuck her tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice archietecture.\"  You say looking around.  It did indeed look like something out of a documentary of the pirate golden age.  It was a nice day, the sky was blue, it was warm, but with a nice breeze.  And you couldn't wait to get some more tickle toys to use on Jenna.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thats a nice store.\"  Jenna said looking at a large tent covering a stage.  You smiled, there a group of what you assume to be pirates stood around a coffle of young women.  Tickle slaves no doubt, these girls looked mostly chinese and filipino.  All lovely with toned bodies dressed in the 1700s equivalent of bikinis.  One chinese looking girl was unhooked and lead over.  She wasn't moving fast enough which ended with a flog going across her stomach, elicting a shout of pain which made the girl increase her pace.  To your surprise an older looking woman, maybe in her 40s or 50s, was the one pulling out coins to pay for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up slave!\"  The man grumbled.  \"Or else it will be a dozen lashes and an hour of tickling as a demonstration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master Riley.\"  The tickle slave quickly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice.\"  The woman replied, she had pale skin and red hair.  She felt the girl's belly with nails that even from a distance looked long and hard, if well kept.  \"Yes I will tickle you for hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your business.\"  Riley replied.  \"Okay who's next.  Come one and come all, California high school girls here!  Broken and ready for tickle slavery!  Standard coin for your own slave.  Young, lovely, submissive, and ultra ticklish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice place.\"  You muttered pulling Jenna's leash jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be wary of them.\"  Collins muttered adjusting his bandanna.  \"Those are Marauders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tickle slavers?\"  You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\"  Collins replies.  \"In this world they do nothing but hunt for tickle slaves, selling tickle slaves, and enjoying tickle slaves.  Their entire territory and economy runs on it.  Cruel and ambitious.  Keep your slave close.  They wouldn't hesitate to take her in order to make some extra coin.\"  He looked Jenna up and down again.  \"A lot of extra coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flattering.\"  The brown skin beauty says dryly, flipping her dark brown hair out of her eyes.  Collins shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'll show you where we can get some tickle toys.  This way.\"  You grin as you follow Collins through the city.  Eventually you walk into an indoor shop that looked straight out of an amusement park.  Around the walls were feathers, cuffs, flogs, and other tickling tools.  You look at Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this stuff doesn't cost too much.\"  You mutter.  Jenna groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im here to cover some of your purchases.  Also Im buying rope for the entire ship, so you'll get some as well.\"  Collins said taking out a modern looking wallet that was big as a pouch an held gold and silver coins.  You look at Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this, I buy one thing, and I let you buy one thing.\"  She raises an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, my master.\"  She replies in a mocking Darth Vader voice, you chuckle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me first.\"  You say leading Jenna through the shop.  You stop and grab a flogger.  Jenna winces as you smirk.  \"For when youre bad.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\"  She whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me test it.\"  You say straightening her up and raising her arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master....\"  You mockingly say as you lightly whip the flog against her belly twice.  She winces and gasps.  \"A good deterrent for my slave.\"  You say looking at it.  \"Wouldn't you agree Jenna.\"  You say smirking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggh.\"  She groans rubbing her lightly stinging belly with her bound wrists.  Eventually yall continue to walk until Jenna picks up a interesting contraption.  \"This could actually be fun.\"  She says, it looked like a blender with a bunch of colorful feathers sticking out of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see.\"  You say as she hands it to you and raises her arms.  You press the trigger and it spins, send the feathers dancing across her belly.  Her belly contorted in laughter as it sent ticklish sensations across her belly.  \"Yeah this will work.\"  You both giggle as your group of three exit the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll stay in town for the night.  There is a nice inn this way.\"  Collins states leading you and Jenna through a couple of alleys and streets until you come to a nice looking three story inn.  Its seems to be a large square structure with a fountain in the middle.  Walking up you were surprised to see the woman at the slave store.  She had the chinese tickle slave tied to a pole.  She was squirming with a gag in her mouth and tried to escape the woman who ran her long and hard nails across her belly.  Next to her was a man around her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the O'Neil inn, Im O'Neil, that redhead is my wife.\"  The man said shaking your and Collins hands.  \"We own this inn as well as its employees.\"  You try not to get distracted as Misses O'Neil tickled her beautiful tickle slave in the background.  Her giggles filled the air.  \"My that is a beautiful tickle slave.\"  He said looking at Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  You replied.  Looking inside the inn you saw many young ladies of all types with exposed midsections and dresses that exposed leg in someway or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisses O'Neil looked over her shoulder while still tickling her tickle slave.  \"Ask if you can borrow her Michael.  Leah here is fun but two slaves tonight would be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.\"  Jenna asked stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, quiet right.\"  Mr. O'Neil said smiling.  \"If you let us borrow that lovely Latina for a night of tickle torture we will give you a room on the house.  Along with each of you getting your own tickle slaves for the night for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cant be serious.\"  Jenna muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These arent too bad people Jenna.\"  Collins replied.  \"Theyll tickle torture you unconscious, but they'll give you delicious waffles in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now had a decision to make.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She was of average height with blonde hair to her shoulder blades. Her eyes were a deep blue. She was clad in a tiny white bikini top and thong bottom, leaving her slim, shiny stomach and deep bellybutton revealed fully. Her skin was the perfect shade of tan from hours on the beach. And to top everything off, she had lovely feet. High arches. Shapely toes, painted red. And not a single wrinkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that one!\u201d You said, pointing at the blonde beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScarlet!\u201d Mr O\u2019Neil shouted \u201cYou\u2019ve been requested for the night\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe submissively walked to the door you were standing at. Mr O\u2019Neil unlocked it and led you and Scarlet to a room, before letting Collin into the room across the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow!\u201d Collin said \u201cEnjoy yourself tonight!!\u201d He then winked at you and closed the door to his room behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then led your temporary slave inside, while Mr O\u2019Neil explained that he should hurry back to Jenna to make sure his wife (Riley O\u2019Neil, a.k.a Mistress) had not begun torturing Jenna and the Chinese girl without him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun and remember, she all yours!\u201d He said before walking away. You closed the door behind you and found Scarlet sitting on the bed, patiently awaiting her next orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014-In the O\u2019Neil\u2019s Room\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr O\u2019Neil entered into his room and luckily found his wife only tying up their two slaves and not tickling them into madness just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause this was their room in their hotel, the O\u2019Neil\u2019s has some special contraptions designed just for tickling in their massive room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contraptions Mistress O\u2019Neil had selected were benches about a foot off the ground. They had stocks that were raised three feet above that with the leg holes spread wide apart. There were also straps on the wall to bind the girls\u2019 arms in to leave them stretched tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jenna and the Chinese girl were stripped naked before being bound in these contraptions in a \u201cY\u201d position, with their legs elevated, leaving the backs of their legs and butts exposed for torture, in addition to essentially the rest of their bodies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry honey, I didn\u2019t start without you. I just tied the slaves up and explain to them that our names are now Master and Mistress, but they\u2019ll either be laughing or gagged (and blindfolded) so they won\u2019t be talking to us much.\u201d Mrs O\u2019Neil explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sweetheart you\u2019re too good, Mr O\u2019Neil said as he gave his wife a kiss and a quick tickle to her sides (after all, she\u2019s not exempt to the rules of women tickle slaves when it\u2019s from her husband)</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I followed Jenna's gaze and soon understood her mood shift. Walking over to us were Alicia, Mary, and Kimberly, three eighteen year old girls who stuck together tighter than glue. They all came from wealthy families who lived on the edge of town, and each of them was daddy's little girl. They banded together at a young age and since then have always needed to be the center of attention of everything. They constantly talked and talked to anybody willing to listen, and then anybody who wasn't willing to listen for that matter. I had begun to hope that with school over I wouldn't have to see them again, but I guess I was sorely mistaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of the trio was named Alicia, a strawberry-blonde with curls down to her shoulders and cold blue eyes. She was the shortest of the three, her small body clad in a red bikini, but she also had the loudest mouth of them as well. What she lacked in size she compensated with volume. A hundredfold. She had a cute button nose that was more often than not twisted into an arrogant smirk, usually when she was degrading somebody else or boasting about all the cool stuff she had. And when she wasn't boasting or taunting, she was lounging around in barely acceptable clothing, doing her best to show off her body at all angles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was the tallest and most athletic of the group, her blue bikini doing nothing to hide the years of gymnastics class. Her jet black hair was always tied into a ponytail, which reached her lower back, so it wouldn't fall into her green eyes when she went running. Always right behind Alicia, she often supplemented the blonde's insults with a few jeers or threatening gestures, happy to let blondie do all the hard talking. Despite her less frontal role, most of the devious ideas and tricks that the group did were her's and as such you could always expect to see a sparkle of mischief in her eyes whenever she looked at you. Maybe she'd be planning just how to embarrass you enough to keep quiet and stay out of their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was the redhead, Kimberly. Her ginger hair fell freely down her back, and a splotch of freckles dotted her face. And most of her upperbody too, as the yellow bikini she wore exposed a lot of skin and freckles covered a lot of it. Despite clinging onto Alicia and Mary, she wasn't actually a bad girl. In fact, had she never met the other two, I could definitely see her being a naturally popular person. But Alicia somehow managed to get Kimberly to cling to them, doing whatever they said. She was that timid good girl that ended up in the wrong crowd. And it was too bad as well, she had a very lovely smile when she wasn't around Alicia or Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one thing they had going for them, it was that they were, by every standard, smoking hot. It was something they make clear at all times, both in what they talked about and what they wore, and I must confess my eyes were drawn to their bikini-clad bodies more than I would have liked. They had gathered quite a following by the end of high school, a club that treated them like Queens and served their every whim. And anyone who wasn't part of this club was beneath them, and they treated these people (which was most of the school actually) worse than dirt, though Jenna always got the worst of it when she was around. Her natural friendliness and popularity got her pegged as a rival from the start, the three brats constantly trying to pull attention away from Jenna and towards themselves. Jenna managed to keep above it through good humor and sometimes just leaving, but I felt for a while that she was reaching the end of her patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look at this. If it isn't Jenna and her little boyfriend,\" Alicia sneered as she walked over to us, Mary and Kimberly in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're here to have a good time. If you don't like that, feel free to stick your head in the sand,\" Jenna replied, and as I visualized the three of them actually doing that I couldn't help but snort, which got Alicia and Mary glaring daggers at me. I shrugged apologetically, but still couldn't resist smiling. It had happened many times before, it would happen many times again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we came here to issue a challenge,\" Alicia said, her eyes narrowing, clearly displeased that we were trying to blow her off. \"The three of us have a beach ball net set up further into the dunes, nice and secluded. I want us to have a match there, you and your boytoy against me and Mary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was probably one of the worst trap setups ever. That didn't matter to Jenna though. \"Why?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn evil glint in Alicia's eye told me that she was ready to reel Jenna in, and also mentioned volumes of mischief she had in store for us. \"I just want to take you on in a fair game is all. I'm tired of you acting like we're not important, that you're somehow better.\" Jenna rolled her eyes, clearly tired of this girl's hypocrisy. I shrugged, trying to take a relatively neutral stance, though I too was growing weary of hearing the double-standard these three constantly used. Alicia glared at both of us before continuing. \"As I was saying, I'm tired of your attitude and want to settle this once and for all. If we beat you, then you have to pay a penalty forfeit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same for you when you lose Alicia,\" Jenna snapped, although from the look on Alicia's face I could tell that thought hadn't even crossed her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, whatever,\" Alicia replied with an arrogant shrug. \"So are you up for it Jenna, or you too scared that we'll humiliate you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mentioned previously, this was possibly one of the worst trap setups ever. Outnumbered in a secluded area with three girls (well, two) that hated us? It practically yelled trick. And I highly doubted that these girls would play fair. But when I looked at Jenna, I could tell she was a bit more conflicted. She'd endured these brats for years, and now she was being directly challenged. She figured something was up too, but the chance to rub it into these snots if we won? The thought was very appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Jenna to reply as she said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jenna agreed to the challenge, Alicia and Mary both wore really nasty smirks, and I definitely was having second thoughts. They had something planned and weren't even trying to hide it. Nevertheless, we were in now and there was no backing out . \"We'll take you to the spot,\" Alicia said before looking down at Jenna's shirt.  \"And leave that behind. If you're going to play volleyball with us, at least leave your rags so I don't have to look at them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're jealous of my clothes, Alicia, don't be afraid to admit it,\" Jenna retorted, but she did take the shirt off as we both knew it'd just get in the way during a volleyball match. Underneath was a tye-dye bikini, the same patterns and colours of a 60's hippy shirt and it actually looked really good on her. I couldn't help but ogle her a bit, and when I brought my eyes back up to eye level I saw a hint of jealousy in Alicia's eyes. Throwing the towel over to the rest of our stuff, Jenna regarded the three standing before us with a smirk. \"So, you going to take us to this secret spot? Or you having second thoughts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your dreams,\" Alicia replied with a glare as she turned and started walking. Kimberly and Mary followed suit as Jenna and I made up the rear after we had picked up our bags. To anybody watching, we could have been old friends going to play a friendly game. We were anything but.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You sure about this?\" I whispered, my gaze cast forward and downward. I must admit, there were worse places to be than behind three very attractive girls with equally attractive butts. That each butt was wearing only little more than underwear made it even better. Even if two out of three of them belonged to arrogant bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, we can take them in volleyball easily,\" Jenna replied. Then she noticed I wasn't looking at her, and when she followed my stare she elbowed my ribs. \"That is if you can keep from drooling at their eye candy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it, I'll just drool at yours instead,\" I answered, looking down at her bikini-clad body and earning a playful swat on the arm. Both Jenna and I started to giggle, making the three in front of us turn around and look at us oddly. Deciding it wasn't important, Alicia continued on without a word, evidently not wanting to get into an argument just yet. Mary glared at us suspiciously for a few seconds before following, and Kimberly just nervously tagged along. My voice dropping to a whisper, I continued talking with Jenna. \"You know there's no way they're gonna play fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she whispered back, \"but we're good enough that a few miscalls shouldn't matter. Don't worry, we got this.\" She gave me a huge smile, and I couldn't help but share it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just wished I could share her confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was five minutes before we reached the spot Alicia spoke of, finding that the net had already been set up. The setup was near a sandy cove, with dunes blocking us from both the wind and any passing eyes. A five-minute walk was quite a distance, and the chances of anybody passing by were slim. I realized with a sudden shock that it was just the five of us on our own, and I began thinking of how potentially vulnerable I and Jenna were. Looking at the three brats disarmed me. I couldn't see them being physical threats. Though you could never be too careful, and I was sure they'd thought of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dropping our stuff over at the bottom of a nearby dune, Jenna and I checked out the net and couldn't see anything suspicious. It wasn't until I scanned the surroundings that I noticed two big holes in the ground nearby. They couldn't have been made naturally so I called over to Alicia. \"Lemme guess, those are for the losers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia nodded. \"Yeah, those are part of the penalty,\" she replied. \"The losing team, that will be you two, will lie down in those and get buried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly did a mental calculation, looking at the sea and the sun. The tides wouldn't reach this far inland, so murder wasn't her objective. \"What sort of penalty is that?\" Jenna asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say we've noticed that you two enjoy tickling,\" Alicia answered as she grinned at us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to be honest, we want to see why you like it too,\" Mary followed up with, sharing a look with Alicia that told me they were honestly interested. Behind them, I noticed Kimberly was nervously looking up at me and back at her feet, blushing deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt heat grow in my cheeks as well as I realized that the holes were short enough that anybody in them would have their feet sticking out and deep enough that a few body parts could be dug down to without freeing the victim. On the other hand, Jenna was grinning from ear to ear. \"OK, not a bad idea. Anything that lets us make you three a pile of giggling wrecks is OK by me.\" She got into position by the net while Alicia and Mary fumed at the thought of getting trapped in those holes. Kimberly just blushed even more furiously. \"So how do you want to play this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rules should be simple enough for even you to understand,\" Alicia replied as she and Mary got into place. \"First team to score ten points wins. Kimberly will be keeping count from the side to make sure neither of you cheat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna rolled her eyes again at the hypocrisy, the notion we'd be the ones cheating when the ref was clearly in their pocket. Then again, Kimberly might be a bit more fair than either of the other two. Alicia had the ball first, and as she got into position I briefly imagined her in one of those holes, her feet sticking out and subjected to the tickling Jenna and I were giving them. Tearing my mind away from those happy thoughts, I focused on the match at hand as Alicia threw the ball into the air and struck, starting the game.</span></div></div>",

Jenna took it, and another good rally ended up with us being up 2-0. At this point, Mary and Alicia began to look at each other nervously, and Jenna took advantage of their concern. \u201cAre you two worried? You looked SO confident at the start. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust shut up and serve,\u201d Alicia retorted, getting into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it,\u201d Jenna cheerily stated as she served the ball.

Oh, I guess I probably should do that again since that was our point.\u201d Jenna caught the ball when Mary fired it at her, and she served again.

Mary ran and sent it back over, and I hit it back to them. It went back and forth for a little while as we all tried to score a point, but we proved more or less equally matched. That impasse to an end however as the ball sailed over the net towards Jenna. She raised her arms to whack it, only to stop short as Kimberely leaned over from the side of the net and skittered her fingers up and down Jenna's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"StahAHAHaoopThahhAHAHATT!!!\" Jenna cried out, partly out of shock as she brought her arms down to protect her ticklish torso. The ball landed at her feet and Kimberly quickly withdrew, offering us an apologetic glance before motioning with her hand towards the other team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point to Alicia and Mary,\" Kimberely announced as the two on the opposite side of the net celebrated with a high five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cheated!\" Jenna almost shouted, having got over the tickling on her bare sides and she stamped over to the net. \"You got Kimberely to tickle me so that I'd miss the ball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Jenna's flaring attitude, I quickly joined her by the net not only to support her but calm her down. In all my books, cheating was only fun or even acceptable when nothing was on the line, and there was a good deal on the line here, but Jenna wasn't exactly the best negotiator. Not that these brats would listen to her even if she was. Alicia sauntered over to us, her arrogant look never leaving her face as she stood directly across the net. \"What's the matter? I thought you enjoyed the kitchy koo treatment?\" she said. \"Besides, I thought that since you two are <i>clearly</i> so much better than us, you could do with an extra challenge.\" Alicia suddenly shot out her hands and tickled both me and Jenna on our bare bellies. Her fingers teased around our navels with surprising quickness and both Jenna and I reacted with loud shrieks of surprised laughter, backing away to avoid the sudden assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, that was fun,\" Alicia said as Jenna fought through her embarrassment and tingling belly to glare at her. \"I can see why you two might enjoy it so much. Although I'd like to see you in the holes before I make a proper judgment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to beat us before that happens.\" Jenna retorted hotly. \"We'll play your weighted game, but we're still going to win and you'll wind up buried!\" Judging at her face, she looked just short of tearing through the net and getting physical in the not-funny kind of way. I put a hand on her shoulder, trying to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All talk, Jenna,\" Alicia sneered as she picked up the ball. \"Soon to be all laughs as well.\" With another smirk, Alicia then went back to her position and got ready to take her shot. With no other choice, I got into my spot and got ready to send the ball back over the net, with Jenna stomping over to her spot, fuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia made a beautiful serve and it went sailing over the net towards me. I raised my arms to send it back only to feel ten fingers dig right into my underarms. I let out a shriek of laughter as my armpits felt ten wriggling fingers go right for the hollows, tickling them with light scratches and pokes. \"GehhehEHHEHETTOOohohoOFFF!!!\" I called out and brought my arms down just in time for the tickling to subside and for the ball to bounce off my leg onto the sand beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alicia and Mary celebrated yet another tainted point, I turned around and saw Kimberely, who was proving sneakier than I'd originally thought. Her face was saying sorry a thousand times over, but all she did was shrug and return to the side of the net. \"Two points to Alicia and Mary,\" she announced quietly, glaning at Jenna and me every other second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was about to blow a gasket. I couldn't blame her.</span></div></div>",

Not that I minded- there was nothing wrong with being tickled by three beautiful girls. It was just that I didn't want to be at the mercy of these three particular girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI figured that if they were using underhanded methods that gave us the green-light too. I positioned myself behind Jenna and slightly closer to the side than she was. They noticed but didn't care- if I put myself where a dive for the ball would be futile that was my problem. But I wasn't going for the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia served. Jenna ran for it fast as she could. Kimberly moved faster. I moved fastest. My fingers dug into her taunt ribs and she screamed at the ticklish contact. Jenna hit the ball. Alicia and Mary were too distracted by Kimberly's sudden outcry to react and the ball landed squarely in their court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" They glared daggers at me and I shrugged with an apologetic look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" I replied weakly, \"I know I should be playing the game but I just got distracted y'know?\" I turned to look at Kimberly and grinned. Grinned as I wriggled my fingers menacingly at her. \"She's just showing a lot of skin. Really ticklish skin as it happens...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hoped that translated across as, 'do it again and see what happens.' Kimberly swallowed nervously at least.The other two just huffed and rolled their eyes. That didn't matter. So long as Kimberly got the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe scored two more points in quick succession allowing us to take the lead and telling us that Kimberly wasn't ready to chance my counterattacks, no matter how many times the other two gestured. It was eight, three to us before long and any confidence they'd possessed was long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, er...\" Alicia said as she hesitated on her serve, \"Those pits were a stupid idea. Tickling's just weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're waiting,\" Jenna replied and tapped her foot on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We never really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think you're going to lose; you could forfeit already,\" I suggested innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up freak.\" she spat at me. The anger in her throw made it an easy ball to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNine. Three. Game point. Jenna enough was smart enough to not let her premature glee get in the way of her throw and served brilliantly. Mary dove for it and managed to hit it back. A valiant effort on her part, but as soon as it was on our side I tapped it down to land in front of Alicia before she had time to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen points. Oh dear, oh dear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia looked from me and Jenna in horror then at Kimberly who shrugged solemnly. \"They win,\" she announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now wait a minute...\" Alicia began as I ducked under the net and headed towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was a stupid idea,\" hissed Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Hole time?\" I asked as a beaming Jenna came to my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen...\" I sighed. They could dish it out but they couldn't take it. Figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Jenna grinned. Kimberly had decided on the former and was already lowering herself into a hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't hold all of us. There's only one more hole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you can put Mary in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?!\" Mary turned in horror to Alicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was your fault we lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You threw that last serve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls!\" I said silencing them, \"You realize it's deep enough for both of you, right?\" I turned to Jenna who nodded. Before they could react we charged, me grabbing Alicia, Jenna Mary. She put all her strength into fighting me but I got her over to the hole easily and pushed her in on her back. Mary followed a moment later, landing face down on Alicia's body and we set to burying them before they could escape. Two heads and four feet were visible above the sand. And if I was right the way Mary fell with her hands either side of Alicia meant that if I dusted off the top layer of sand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenna buried Kimberly I excavated around Mary's torso, exposing her back and sides. She struggled but it was clear she was going nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so going to make you regret this Alicia spat at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cute,\" I smiled as I retrieved the seagull feathers stuck in the sand that had clearly been meant to tickle us. I handed one to Jenna as she lay down parallel to the two, her eyes locked onto Mary's bare back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll just get in the way,\" she chuckled and undid her Mary's bikini and pushed the strings away to fully expose her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you won't need it,\" Jenna grinned, clearly relishing the moment. I knelt by their feet and made myself comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys ready?\" I asked as I twirled the feather between my fingers.</span></div></div>",

Jenna and I exchanged confused glances and shrugged. We assumed they were just tickling each other and the writhing sand by Mary's ribs just looked like Alicia's fingers. Then we realized that Kimberly was screaming with laughter too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" Jenna began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god! It tickles so much! It tickles so muhuhuhuch!\" Alicia screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make them stohohohop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna?\" I asked as I looked over at Kimberly then back at the two girls writhing with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you an earth bender?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just checking.\" She sighed and brushed away at the sand around Mary's side. Then recoiled as she exposed the hundreds of pink tentacles stroking and wriggling across her skin. She recoiled but they were apparently put off by their cover being blown. Before she could react the sand beneath Jenna bubbled and dozens of tentacles wrapped around her body and pulled her to the sand. Then she screamed as they began wriggling over her barely covered body. I rushed over to help her but pulling as hard as I could did nothing. If anything it just encouraged them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I heard a sound like a hiss. I looked over at Kimberly. Turned out it wasn't a snake. It was the sound sand made when it fell. Taking Kimberly with it. Nope. That wasn't good. A redoubled my efforts but to my horror my wrists and ankles became ensnared and the sand beneath me shifted as tentacles reached up for my belly. I could only scream with laughter, unable to move as they brushed lazily over my ribs and stomach. It tickled so much that I didn't even notice the sand swallowing Alicia and Mary. Or even Jenna. I just noticed everything going dark and then what I saw underneath in the cavern beneath the sand.</span></div></div>",

The panel they were extending from opened wider and we were unceremoniously dropped into the gaping hole. I landed inside, almost bouncing up into the air again as I hit the squishy pink floor. It felt like. The girls were spread out around me and Alicia and Mary were trying to untangle themselves from each others bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone okay?\" I asked as I looked over at Kimberly and Jenna. Kimberly nodded and Jenna shot me a look asking if I knew how stupid a question I'd just asked. Point taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood and took a more in depth look at the room. The walls and floor were made of a matrix of rubbery pink stuff and was oval shaped like an egg. A more conventional looking door made of metal was the only feature this place really had. And... That was it, nothing else. Which was somewhat anticlimactic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sharp intake of breath like a gasp behind me as Alicia and Mary finally disengaged from one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna!

The ceiling soon gave away to the sight of dozens of squirming tentacles, causing pretty much everyone to try and find a hiding place. There was absolutely none available in the bare room and as the tentacles descended, a rather unpleasant feeling of hopelessness hit me, soon followed by the tentacles themselves. Five of them wrapped around me, grabbing onto my wrists, ankles and waist and hoisted me up, despite my attempts at struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tentacles were rather warm and rubbery to the touch, not exactly unpleasant, discounting the position we were all in of course. My protests were joined by the others as we all tried to pull away and curse at whatever was controlling the tentacles, but to no effect. Instead, we were all soon stretched out and unable to move out limbs, suspended by the tendrils around us. I had to admit, the view could be worse, surrounded by four ravishing beauties, one of whom, was without her top. Without much else to do after a minute or so of being hung in mid-air, my eyes began to wander over to Mary, seeing her ample breasts out in the open made for a welcome distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you looking out?!\" She shrieked once she noticed I was looking and I quickly turned away with a blush. Further embarrassment was spared on my part as the scream from Mary seemed to gain the attention of other tentacles and two of them lowered themselves down to her, stopping just beside her breasts. Before she could offer even the slightest objection, the two then began to flick over the side of her exposed breasts, tickling them with little flicks and strokes that started slow, but steadily got faster as Mary's defences instantly broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OhhNohooohOOHOpllEHEHASEENNOohoooo!!\" She screamed as the tickling went on, her breasts jiggling from the touches of the tentacles as well as her laughter, the tickling soon spreading to the undersides as the soft stroking went all over the sides of Mary's breasts, not giving her a moment's rest as she howled and thrashed in her bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Kimberly and Alicia looked nonplussed, having no idea of what to do before them while Jenna watched with a grin, enjoying the sight of her rival brought down to a giggly mess. Looking closer than the others (Purely for curiosity you understand), I noticed that the teasing of her breasts had made Mary's nipples stand out quite a bit. Apparently our little Princess rather enjoyed being tickled more than she let on. Or, the tentacles themselves had an effect on people under their tender mercies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could digest this information properly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite our best efforts, both Jenna and me fell to Kimberley's probing fingers each time she poked and wriggled them into our sensitive skin. Every time the ball came near, a quick tickle on our sides or belly left us giggling and completely unable to send it back. When the final score was tallied, Alicia and Mary had made a clean sweep of the game, ten points to our zero. All Jenna and me had to show for our efforts was a little embarrassment and sensitized skin from all the sneak tickles we were given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite our loss, and the penalty that came with it, Jenna remained defiant as Alicia and Mary celebrated their win by bouncing in the air and hugging each other. I had to admit my eyes wandered over their bodies at that point, but I pulled myself together once Jenna called out. \"So you can win by cheating, that means nothing!\" I winced inwardly. Leave it to Jenna to anger a bunch of brats who had a one-up on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the shout, the two stopped celebrating and turned towards us. Alicia smiled and nodded her head as Kimberly and Mary spread out, trying to outflank us. Moving under the net, Alicia walked towards us slowly, my eyes trying to keep focused on her and Kimberly. It tried to stay focused as she drew loser, but her striking attractiveness caught my attention more than I cared to admit. \"Of course it means something, Jenna,\" Alicia purred. \"It means that you two get into those pits, we bury you, and then tickle whatever sticks out.\" Alicia looked both me and Jenna up and down and I was glad I was wearing loose shorts. The sneak attacks and sight of four gorgeous girls around me was having an effect. \"Or whatever we can dig down too,\" Alicia finished as she eyed our bellies, making me shiver slightly - whether from fear or anticipation I cannot say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step back, Jenna brought up her hands to defend herself. \"You'll have to get us down in them first,\" she challenged. \"And even if we're outnumbered, I doubt you three rich girls can take us on.\" I just glanced around uneasily, ready to bolt. Jenna may have had a thing for putting up physical resistance, but I was one of those people who believed in that saying 'the greatest victory is the battle not fought' that someone said ages ago - most likely after a big bag of weed or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia merely smirked in response as Kimberely and Mary stood poised, ready to attack us. \"Well if that's how you feel, I suppose we'll just have to do this the hard way,\" Alicia said before suddenly dashing towards Jenna and me. Showing surprising speed, Alicia ran in between us, grabbing onto one of our arms each and pulling them with her as she ran. With momentum and surprise on her side, Alicia pulled me and Jenna around, spinning a full 180 before she let go of our arms. Her maneuver left us vulnerable, allowing Mary and Kimberely launching their attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn't wait long as I felt a pair of hands attack my ribs, long fingers with sharp nails grabbing onto my ribcage and squeezing rapidly. I instantly burst into laughter at the effective assault and my legs buckled, my skin was already on edge from being tickled by Kimberely constantly before. A squeal from Jenna made me realise she'd fallen under the assault of Mary and I managed to peek over to see that Mary's hands were moving at a fast space, her nails skittering over Jenna's barely covered torso, spider-tickling on her ribs, sides and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna and I were defenceless from the tickling on our bodies. We squirmed and struggled, but Mary and Kimberly were relentless in their ticklish assault, their fingers tickling us without stopping as they pushed us back. Neither Jenna or I realised how close we were to the pits until a final push from Mary and Kimberly sent us both tumbling in. I landed on my back and let out a gasp of air from the sudden bump on the ground, still giggling from the tickling my body had endured when I felt sand fall down onto my body. I had no time to react before my hips and torso were buried in sand from Alicia pushing it over me. Already weakened from the tickling, I was unable to get the increasing amounts of sand off me and I was soon completely submerged in it. Soon, only my feet and head sticking out, just as Alicia had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over to my left, I saw Jenna in a similar position to me, Mary and Kimberly having buried her in sand as well with only the top and bottom of her body poking out. \"You OK?\" I called over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna turned and gave me an apologetic look. \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" she answered, although a look of guilt on her face made me realise she was regretting having me involved in all of this. Although I secretly had to admit the situation was giving me a thrill. \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned from Jenna to face Alicia, Mary, and Kimberly who were standing over our feet with a look of obscene triumph about them. \"About to be tickled pink.\" I answered jovially and I was relieved to hear Jenna give a slight giggle at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny,\" Alicia said sarcastically as she sat down directly between mine and Jenna's highly vulnerable feet. \"But you'll find this situation even funnier when I start tickling you two. But who to start with?\" Alicia turned from me to Jenna, measuring up which one to go for. As her gaze swung back to me, a grin broke out across her face and she spoke with barely concealed glee. \"I believe I'll go with...</span></div></div>",

Girls, fix Jenna's attitude, this one's mine.\" I burst into frantic giggles as her sharp nails skittered over my souls. I was definitely surprised at how adept Alicia was at tickling. Having gotten into many ticklish situations,, I know what a skilled tickler feels like, and this was it. And even scarier, this was definitely just her warm up. It probably wouldn't be long until the other two joined in on my torture and sent me into new levels of hysteria. Not that I was ding to well to begin with. I was nearly in tears at the mercy of Alicia's finely manicured nails which was non-existent. The worst part was that I was surrounded by for beautiful women and was being tickled too much to appreciate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still, through my roaring laughter, got a few peeks at how Jen was doing at the hands of Mary and Kimberly. I looked over to see Jen in pure hysterics as Mary and Kimberly scratched her soles, occasionally bending down to nibble on her toes. I didn't know how much more Jen could take, I had to help her. \"Oh nonohoho!\" I yelped as I felt Alicia start to nibble and lick between my toes, interrupting my already scrambled thoughts. \"Hahahah! Stohohop tehehkling heheheher!\" Immediately Alicia stopped, as did her friends. \"Ooooo, looks like someone thinks he is a hero. Is my little hero sure he wants all the attention?\" She started nibbling on my incept making me convulse in my sand prison. \"Yahahahahhas!\" I heard Jen give a weak thank you but it was barely audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two other girls, Mary and Kimberly, situated themselves in front of me while Alicia straddled me, digging down to my sides and belly. When she had finally gotten there it was a terrifying sight. I could see Mary and Kimberly each situated at one of my feet, while Alivia lied on her belly, her head six inches from my own, as her fingernails rested on my hips.</span></div></div>",

Here were three beautiful girls, although brats, who would tickle me senseless if I agreed for a week, and if not would tickle me senseless right now. Even if I agreed, I couldn't just leave my life for a week. \"And what if I said no?\" I asked. All three girls started laughing. \"well, that's not really an option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere al three girls tickled me in earnest.

I actually wouldn't be bothered if it were just Kimberly, but Alicia and Mary were arrogant, entitled bullies. Not to mention, if the three of them tickling me already had me laughing myself to insanity right now, what would happen with all three of them when they had free reign to do whatever they wanted? Of course, there's always possibilities, no matter how small, that they might be more merciful in that situation than they are now. Or that Alicia would get selfish and cut them out. I also had Jenna to think about. I already demonstrated that I'm willing to suffer the attention of all three of them in order to spare her. They might just tickle her to get me to agree. I wasn't exactly in any room to negotiate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it hit me. I might actually be able to negotiate! She obviously liked the idea of tickling, as evidenced by this trap, and how much of an expert she was, and a whole week of it was much better than a few hours tops. Especially since I wouldn't be limited to tickling if it was servitude. Not to mention the jealousy in her eyes earlier. Granted, I wasn't entirely convinced that I hadn't just imagined that. Either way however, she obviously wants me to agree, if I make it seem like I'd rather just take it here and now than agree, she might be willing to talk over terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's say, hypothetically, that I decided to agree. What are the terms of this servitude?\" This question seemed to shock them. Jenna too, given by what I could see in my peripheral vision. I don't think anyone actually expected me to even consider agreeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...well. We'd dig you up, let you get whatever you need from your house, and then you would stay in my guest room, and do whatever we say for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting terms, but full of things that you didn't cover. What will happen to Jenna? What am I supposed to tell my parents? It's kinda difficult to just up and leave my life for a full week.\" Alicia didn't have a response. Everyone was kind of staring at me wide-eyed, I could swear Mary's jaw was even hanging open a little bit. \"I have new terms. You dig out both of us. Right now. Drive me home, so I can get my things. I'll come, and serve you from eight to eight every day for the next week, and I only take orders from you.\" I knew they wouldn't go for that, but from here I could negotiate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. You staying there all week is required. As for the others...\" She looked back at them. Mary seemed to shake her head vehemently with a scowl that seemed to say don't-you-dare, Kimberly didn't say anything, but she seemed to look worried, and I might have imagined it, but she seemed to shoot me a slightly disappointed look. I glanced over at Jenna real quick, who was gaping at me wide-eyed. Alicia looked back at me, a stubborn look set in her face. \"You have to listen to them too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting offer, but I think I'm going to have to refuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA briefly annoyed look crossed Alicia's face, before a mischievous one crossed her face. \"Have it your way. We'll just tickle you now then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Your loss. A few hours of tickling is nothing compared to the week you could have had.\" The bait was set...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...is a very good point...\" Bait taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what. How about this offer. Let Jenna, and I out. You, but only you, can tickle Jenna for twenty minutes. Tops. Drive me home. I'll tell my parents that I have a house-sitting job, that involves staying there full time. I'll stay the entire week there. However, I get at least six hours a day where I don't have to listen to what you tell me. Six less than my original terms, six more than yours. I'll take orders from all three of you, but only one of you gets to tickle me at a time, or I go home. A pretty fair deal if you ask me. More than fair if you consider the fact that you cheated during the game, and basically shoved me into this hole. Despite the fact that I've been nothing but polite to you all these years no matter how rude you were to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them had the decency to look abashed at that. Alicia seemed unsure, and chewed on the bottom right corner of her lip in an admittedly, rather adorable expression that I had never seen before. \"One moment.\" She said in a voice quieter than normal but louder than a whisper. She turned back toward Mary and Kimberly and the three of them started conversing quietly. I probably could have heard what they were saying if I wanted to, but I turned and looked at Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" I mouthed at her. I expected her to be angry about me letting Alicia tickle her for twenty minutes. I only said it because letting Alicia tickle Jenna somewhat bettered the chances of her saying yes, and honestly, you'd get to see one hottie tickle another. Bonus. She looked significantly more concerned about me than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?\" She mouthed back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably. But they would have tortured you otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a hero for me! Not this much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it bothers you that much, think of it as me making sure you don't hate tickling in the future.\" I accompanied that with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ha ha.\" She couldn't help but smile though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. I'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Alicia turned back to me and said...</span></div></div>",

Alicia got down to dig me out and I climbed out of the sand. She then walked over to Jenna and knelt at her feet, bringing her hands up to her soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up for a second!\" I said. I quickly went over to your belongings and took out my phone, headed back to the group and got up 20 minutes on a timer. \"To make sure you stick to the rules,\" I remarked. Alicia and Kimberly once again looked abashed, Mary less so. I started the timer. \"20 minutes, go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia started to drag her nails down Jenna's soles slowly. Jenna started to giggle. I felt very bad for Jenna, but could do nothing but wait for the time to expire. Alicia is starting to speed up her tickling. Jenna is straining against the sand keeping her in the hole, but is stuck fast. Alicia is now focusing her tickling on one foot after another, using all ten of her expertly cruel fingers on Jenna's sole, incep and toes. Jenna was really laughing now. I looked down at the timer, but there was still a few minutes left. Alicia seemed to also guess that time was almost up, so she grabbed Jenna's foot and began to lick it vigourously. Jenna was in hysterics, tears streaming down her face. Alicia stuck Jenna's big toe in her mouth and attacked it with her tongue, then began moving across her feet to do the same to her other toes. Jenna was struggling to breathe, her laughter becoming silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"20 minutes, now stop!\" I showed Alicia the timer that was now at zero. She stopped and got up. I ran over to Jenna and frantically dug her out. I held her and stroked her hair, trying to calm her down and get her to take long, deep breaths. <br>\r\n\"Jenna, are you okay? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I should never have made that part of the deal. I shouldn't have decided for you. I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay,\" she replied. \"If it wasn't for you and your deal, I would have been tickled like that for much longer by more than just one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. I tickled her for 20 minutes, like we agreed. Get the stuff you brought and we'll drive to yours, then my place,\" said Alicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me a few minutes,make sure she's okay,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she's fine, now let's go!\" I looked up at Alicia snapping at me, and once again saw the same look of jealously in her eyes that that I had seen earlier, before the volleyball game. I knew I wasn't imagining it now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you walk? Can you get home on your own okay?\" I asked Jenna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll be fine. Will you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always fine Jenna,\" I said with a cocksure wink, even though I didn't remotely believe it myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good luck, You'll need it.\" Jenna hugged me goodbye and I walked off with the three girls after collecting my stuff from the beach. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I sat in the back of Alicia's flashy, expensive convertible, in the middle seat, sandwiched in between Mary and Kimberly, while Alicia drove. I assumed this seating arrangement was to stop me from escaping. But I wasn't intending to to. I always keep my word, even to those that I don't particularly like. And being sat in the middle of two gorgeous, bikini clad girls wasn't exactly the worst thing in the world. <br>\r\nI arrived at my house, a little further down the road from it so as not to draw attention to the nice car I was in, and the less nice company inside. I got out of the car, went in and explained the \"house sitting\" job I had just been given to my parents. It took a bit of time to get them onboard. I went upstairs, packed some clothes, toothbrush, shower stuff, whatever else I thought I needed. Refused the offer of a lift from my parents, told them I'd get the bus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI arrived back at the car. Alicia popped the trunk for me to put my stuff in, then I got back into the middle seat. <br>\r\n\"Mary has come up with a lovely idea,\" Alicia said from the front. \"Has she now?\" I replied, looking to my right at Mary. She was grinning right back with eyes of mischief. Most of the groups most devious and cruel idea's came from her. <br>\r\n\"Am I allowed to know what it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, not yet slave. Not until we're back at mine. Oh yes, we also decided while you were gone that your name for the next week would be slave, and that during the 18 hours a day you serve us, you must address us as Mistress Alicia, Mistress Mary and Mistress Kimberly.\" Alicia pulled the car away from your street and began driving to hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just great,\" I said with all the sincerity I could muster. Mary poked me in the ribs, causing me to yelp. \"That's just great what, slave?\" she threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just great, Mistress Alicia,\" I forced out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, slave. And thank you, Mary. We also had Kimberly type up your contract on her phone for us to print out and have you sign before you properly start your week of servitude,\" Alicia said. I turned to my left to see Kimberly, looking at me with a very apologetic look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, me and the girls arrived at Alicia's house,. It was huge, white and modern with balconies, a fence and automatic gate and a large garage that looked like it could fit about 5 or 6 cars. I also knew a pool was there from the gossip I heard about the almost ridiculous number of pool parties Alicia held here. <br>\r\nWe parked and entered the house. The girls stopped me and printed out the contract. I read the contract over very, very, very carefully in order to make sure they didn't sneak anything by me, but it was only the stuff we agreed on the beach and about calling them mistress. Nothing about Mary's idea though. <br>\r\nI signed and took my stuff upstairs to the guest room. It was bigger than my room at home, with a large bed that had railings on the head and foot of the bed. Three guesses about how they would be used. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put down your stuff slave,\" Mary said. The three girls had entered the room, and stood near me. They had also gotten stuff to tie me up with. Not just rope, but proper looking bondage equipment. \"Take off your shirt slave,\" now said Alicia. I did so. \"Now your swim trunks slave,\" Alicia added. I was embarrased about getting naked in front of these girls that I didn't particularly like, but did so. I tried to face away from them, or cover myself. \"No slave, stay still so we can see you,\" said Alicia. <br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress Alicia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lie down spread eagle on the bed.\" I obeyed and the girls started to tie me to the bed. I was starting to really worry that they were going to go back on our deal and tickle me all together. I knew I would never survive the day, let alone the week if that happened. <br>\r\nThe girls stepped back from the foot of the bed and admired their handiwork. Me, nude and spread eagle, completely at their mercy. Alicia began to speak. \"You see slave, Mary pointed out that, it was only 6 hours that you had to yourself, to not be ordered or used by us. And she figured that that 6 hours could be used by you sleeping. Now we all want to tickle you and whatnot, but we agreed to one at a time. So what we're gonna do is lock this door while we go elsewhere and have a tickle fight. Whoever wins gets to tickle you and play with you for the first 6 hours, when you're the most fresh. Then the person who submitted second gets to have you as her tickle toy and plaything for the next 6 hours. Then the loser, the first to submit, gets you for the final 6 hours when you're completely spent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The three girls giggled and all left, closing the door and locking it with a click. I had wondered (and secretly hoped) why they didn't have the tickle fight in front of me. Seeing the three bikini clad, smoking hot girls tickle each other in front of you would have been amazing. But then I quickly realised the psychological torture Mary's dastardly idea instilled. Wherever they were in the house, they were far away, so only muffled laughter and screams could be heard in the guest room, and I couldn't place who each sound belonged to. I had no idea who was winning or losing. The anticipation, the dread was killing me, but it was also so thrilling and arousing. The longer it went on, the harder I got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea how long idea how long they were gone for. There was no clock in the bedroom and my phone was with my stuff. Suddenly, the door was unlocked and flung open, with a single girl, the victorious girl, entering the room and locking the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems the winner and your tormentor for the next 6 hours was Mistress... </span></div></div>",

I agreed to 6 hours of doing my own thing, doing stuff for you other than tickling for the whole day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia stepped towards me and ran her nails across my feet. \"That's Mistress Alicia, slave! Well, if you're not prepared to meet your end of the deal, we won't meet ours. Mistress Mary. Mistress Kimberly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia and Mary moved to either side of me on the bed. Kimberly stayed where she was, a very uncomfortable and uneast look on her face, then rushed to Alicia and whispered something quickly in her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very interesting Kimberly,\" said Alicia. \"Kimberly wanted to give you a chance.\" Alicia went and got a blindfold. \"We'll put this on you, then leave and have our tickle fight as agreed to see who tickle's you first. Then the winner will come back and tickle you for, let's say 20 minutes, for the 20 minutes you gave to me to tickle Jenna. At the end of that 20 minutes, you have to guess which one of us was tickling you. If you guess right, you're set free. Maybe we'll have you do other stuff for us, but no tickling...yet. If you guess incorrectly, the tickler tickle's you for the rest of the 5 hours and 40 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI were stuck between a rock, a hard place, and a very hard place. \"It's either this, Mary's original idea, or we all tickle you for breaking our deal.\" <br>\r\nI looked at Kimberly, the one who suggested this idea. She was looking at me with frantic eyes, trying to nod at me to agree as subtely as possible. I sighed. \"I agree to Mistress Kimberly's idea, Mistress Alicia,\" using their mistress titles to try and get in their good books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia and Mary grinned. \"Good, and thank you for showing respect slave. Let's go girls,\" Alicia said, putting on the blindfold, then heard her leave with Mary following her out the door. <br>\r\nI heard Kimberly dart towards me. \"I'm sorry,\" she quickly whispered. \"I'm sorry about all this. That idea was the only one I could think off that they would probably have said yes to. Sorry. I'll try and win so that I can come back in the room, say it's me so you can guess me and you're let go. Or you could guess incorrectly, you're in here with me for 6 hours and I'll go easier on you than they will.\" I then heard her leave the room, and close and lock the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wait was agonising. You could hear the laughter. You had no idea how long you were alone. Fear and antici[ation filled your body. As bad as this situation was, it was also the sexiest situation you had ever been in and you became very aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

Plus,\" she says, her whispered tones becoming more seductive and sensual, \"I think I'm owed for getting you out of 6 hours of tickling by Alicia or Mary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything in objection, I felt nails drag along my belly. \"Hahahahhhaahah!\" I leapt upwards off the bed as much as my bonds would allow. Kimberly started to tickle all over my belly. Her nails were not as cruel as Alicia's had been at the beach, but they still were still torturous against my sensitive skin. I then felt Kimberly climb onto the bed and straddle my hips. Before I then felt her fingers dig into my armpits. \"HAHAHHHAHAHHHHAHAHAAOOHOHHHHOHAHAHAHGAHHAAHHD!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a while, before I felt her hands leave my body. I then felt her slightly reposition. Then her tongue entered my navel. I exploded with laughter, which only increased when her fingernails began to skitter across my ribs and sides, as her tongue continued to poke, circle, and torment my bellybutton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had explored all she could with her tongue, I felt Kimberly get off from on top of me and stand next to the bed. With one hand, she started to quickly, and quite heavily, skitter her nails across my balls, and with the other hand, stick one finger, with it's torturous nail, deep into my bellybutton and wiggle it ferociously. <br>\r\nMy laughter went up 10 octaves, and was the loudest it had ever been. \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHOOHOAHAAAHAMAAHAHAAIIIIIIGAHAAHAHD!!! PLLESAHSE STAHHP!! PLEASE!!! KIMB-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was just able to stop myself from saying her full name. That was followed by Kimberly quickly covering my mouth with her hands to silence me. The tickling, and my laughter, stopped. The room became as silent as a crypt. I was mortified, and I'm sure Kimberly was too. If Mary and Alicia were outside, had they heard me? Did I say enough of the name for them to make out that Kimberly had told me it was her, or that I least somehow knew who was tickling me? Was I even intelligible enough during Kimberly's tickling onslaught to be understood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all these fears rushed through my mind, knocking on the door came from outside. The 20 minutes must have been up. And as the door lock clicked and the door was being opened, I had only precious seconds in my delirious state of mind to decide. Should I guess correctly guess Kimberly so that I might be let out and not be tickled, but be ordered to do god knows what else by the trio? Or should I guess incorrectly so that I might be locked in here with Kimberly, the most friendly face out of the three for the remainder of the 6 hours? Hopefully she would go much easier on me, especially after how she'd just tickled me earlier.  </span></div></div>",

Who do you think was tickling you?\" You decided to try guessing incorrectly so that you would be tickled by Kimberly. That way, she'll hopefully take it easy on me, and the time I was being tickled now would limit tickle torture by Alicia or Mary later on during my week of servitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it was you, Mistress Alicia, who was tickling me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia eyed me with a continous, calculating stare.

And his belly. And his, uh, balls.\" <br>\r\n\"Excellent. We'll have to keep those in mind for later. But do his feet first Kimberly.

I began to giggle incessantly, but could tell that Kimberly was trying to take it easy on me as best she could. <br>\r\n\"Come on Kimberly, make him scream!\" I heard Mary yell. She began to up the speed of her fingers, spidering them up and down my soles. My giggles turned to laughter as I strained against the straps and cuffs, trying to break free, but to no avail.<br>\r\n\"Do what you did to his feet on the beach Kimberly,\" Alicia said. I fought to remember what Alicia was reminding her off until I felt Kimberly's tongue on my foot. I yelped and jumped in my bonds. Kimberly licked every inch of my soles, then darted her tongue between my toes, before beginning to nibble the ticklish flesh, being spurred on by an enthusiastic Alicia and Mary, baying for me to laugh so hard I cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're doing more than one thing Kimberly,\" giggled Alicia. I followed Alicia and Mary's gaze to figure out what they meant, and saw my cock hard at full attention. Kimberly stopped to see it as well, and blushed bright red immediately. <br>\r\n\"Don't stop Kimmy,\" Alicia said, and Kimberly went back to wrapping her mouth around each of my toes, sucking and licking, lightly using her teeth to torment my nerves, sending ticklish spasms through my feet and up my whole body. In my torment, I saw Alicia whisper in Mary's ear, smile, and they both got up and came towards me on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait?! What are you doing? You said you would only tickle me one at a time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we did. And we're not tickling you.\" With that, Alicia grabbed my shaft and began to stroke. Mary bent down and kissed my nipple. The pleasure radiated through my body before my mind unfortunately caught up with it. I was torn between the soft hands of Alicia and the soft lips of Mary, and the ticklish tongue of Kimberly. Alicia began to target the head of my cock, wrapping her thumb and one finger around it and jerking just the head. Mary would kiss and lick my nipples, but would always have her hands lightly rubbing them, her fingers playing with them in a way that drove me insane. And I was unable to fully enjoy it as Kimberly tickled my feet with her fingers and her tongue. I laughed and moaned in this heavenly hell as after minutes of teasing, Alicia began to stroke me to completion. Finally overriding the tickles, I groaned with pent up pleasure as I came, not caring about the servitude or who it was under as I had the best orgasm of my life. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmmm, though that boytoy of yours looks pretty fun to tickle, I reckon we really have to give you a long overdue attitude adjustment, Jenna,\" Alicia smiled evilly as she gestured to her friends to come over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey surrounded Jenna, with Alicia sitting comfortably in front of her right foot. Mary was at her left, and Kimberley near where Jenna's head poking out of the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and you'll love what we found on the bench before you two arrived,\" Mary smirked, brandishing a fistful of seagull feathers and passing them out to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you realize this means war. We'll definitely get you back for this,\" Jenna threatened, narrowing her eyes, trying to intimidate them. Of course, in my experience, intimidation worked better as a tactic if you were in a position of power or at least physically imposing. Suffice to say, with her head sticking harmlessly out of the sand and her toes curled up defensively, she didn't look all that scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia just scoffed at Jenna's threat. \"Whatever. I'd like to see you try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, heck, we're having a pool party tonight. If you think you're such hot stuff, why don't you gatecrash?\" Mary said mockingly as she wiggled the feather right in front of Jenna's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a bit alarmed when I saw an evil determined grin spread across Jenna's face. Now that she had gotten the idea, I was fairly certain that she was actually going to try to get back at them at the pool party. And if past experiences were anything to go by, she would almost certainly rope me into this. And we would both get caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Jenna, don't let her bait you,\" I said, trying to talk her out of doing something rash. Revenge on these three beautiful brats was something I would definitely support, but Jenna could be really reckless when she set her mind on something. And I definitely recognized her 'setting-my-mind-on-something' face right now as she glared at them. That's a face I've seen far too often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your boy is the brains in the relationship,\" Alicia chuckled, as she leaned over and stroked a gull feather down my foot, making me giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm willing to bet that those cute tootsies of yours are way more ticklish than his though,\" Mary added, as she looked at Jenna's wiggling bare feet. Jenna's mahogany feet wriggled nervously, her pink toenails flailing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia laughed as she gestured to her friends to begin, making Jenna gasp as the feathers chose their marks. \"You know, I wouldn't actually bet on it. From what I can tell, they're one of those ticklish power couples,\" she teased as she used the fluffy feather in her hand to lightly dust all over Jenna's right foot. Jenna tried to keep her laughter in, but she couldn't handle the three-pronged feathering attack and quickly burst into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI yelled at them to stop, but after they ignored me for the third time I gave up and decided to sit back and enjoy the show. Hey, this wasn't the kind of thing that happened everyday, and I might as well enjoy it before it was my turn to be on the receiving ends of those fluffy feathers. I filed away the information about how feather-ticklish Jenna was. It was the kind of info that seemed like it would come in handy later. I also wouldn't have pegged these three popular girls as being tickling veterans, but as I noticed their technique I came to the undeniable conclusion they had done this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia was wielding a more fluffy feather that she was using to tease in between Jenna's toes, which based on all the flexing and wiggling her toes would do, was quite a soft spot. Alicia was methodical and ruthless in her attack, she would tickle her toes till they curled up, and then she would simply slide the feather up and down Jenna's long arch till the toes opened up again and she could again easily access the ticklish undersides of her toes. Every now and then she would get impatient and just use her hand to pry her toes back, and drag the feather all around her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary, armed with a long stuff feather was stroking the tip of the stiff feather up and down Jenna's arches in a slow, cruel way, adding in quick strokes every so often to throw her off more. Every now and then she would just focus on one spot at a time, provoking that same spot over and over again till Jenna feet stop flopping about in almost an act of surrender and just took the tickling. This was Mary's cue to move on to find another vulnerable spot to attack, as the last thing she wanted was Jenna getting comfortable with the tickling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberley had joined in as well, using her fluffy feather to tease the sensitive spot where Jenna's neck met her collar bone. Jenna giggled, throwing her head back and forth to try to evade the feather, but all it managed to do was make her sweat more and her shoulder-length dark hair begin to stick to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna's feet twisted and thrashed towards each other, trying to protect each other's sensitive bottoms, but the way her ankles were they just couldn\u2019t reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three are all such, hahahaha, such cheaters!\" Jenna said, her voice cracking mid-sentence as she burst into hysterical giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think we've teased these feet enough,\" Alicia declared, just when Jenna let out a little sigh of relief, she added: \"Let's stop teasing with the feathers and tickle her for real.\" She grinned as she pulled the toes on Jenna's right foot back, pulling her tanned feet taut. Jenna gulped when Alicia did the same on her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last chance. Tell us, who's better?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna look like she was beginning to actually consider appeasing them, but the girls didn't give her a chance to really mull it over, as a few seconds later, Mary giggled shrilly, scrapping her nails up and down the arch of Jenna's trapped foot briskly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tooooo slow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving from fluffy feathers to sharp fingernails was a sharp contrast, and Jenna was laughing hard now, shrieking and screaming with laughter as Mary and Alicia raked their nails up the arches of Jenna's poor feet. Kimberley was also now using her fingers to tease her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Jenna looked like she couldn't take much more, I tried getting the attention of the most reasonable member of the group. \"Kimberley! Give her a break! Look at her!\" I yelled. To my surprised, I saw Kimberley give a bit of a guilty nod as she looked to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, guys? I think we should take it easy, she's going a bit blue in the face,\" Kimberley said, looking a bit reluctant as she took her fingers from the nape of Jenna's tanned neck. \"I think maybe we should give her a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia let go of Jenna's desperate flexing toes as she nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, let's be good girls and give her a little break. Besides, her boyfriend is starting to look a little bored,\" she said, grinning evilly at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBored isn't what how I would describe it, I was actually rather enjoying the show. Seeing three hot girls in bikinis tickle the living daylights out of a fourth seemed like something you'd see in a hot youtube video, not in real life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but instinctively give a little gulp though as Alicia gave me a mischievous smile and swept her blonde hair behind her ear as she took at seat at my feet and began tracing the feather experimentally up my left foot, making me giggle at the soft feathery touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, he is so ticklish,\" Mary cooed. \"I can see what you're so attached to him, Jenna,\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? You look like you could use a good tickling, or would you rather we have another session with Jenna?\" Alicia asked, she clearly meant it as a sadistic choice, with but options being bad, but she was unaware that I would probably actually enjoy both rather a lot. I was rather glad I was buried in sand at this point to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, uh, um...\" I stuttered as the three alluring females looked at me expectantly. I glanced over at Jenna, who was still panting and recovering from their first assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have five seconds to answer, or we tickle both of you,\" Mary smiled cruelly, sticking her tongue out at me.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Tickle me, just leave Jenna alone for a while.\" I asked, looking forward to any tickling I could get from the three girls as long as they stopped before it got too much. Mary and Kimberly started to get up in order to answer that but was stopped short by Alicia bringing her hand up to stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want us to tickle you?\" She asked, the tone in her voice not unlike a predator's and I started to feel uneasy \"Even though your little girlfriend has earned everything we're giving her?\" Alicia emphasised her point by picking up the feather she had used before and brushing it up Jenna's foot, earning a tired squeak from my exhausted friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's had enough!\" I almost shouted, really wanting Jenna to get a break \"Look, tickle me as much as you want, just let her recover please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleading tone in my voice seemed to only encourage Alicia as she continued to brush the feather lightly up and down Jenna's foot, the soft plume on her arch once more earning a series of giggles from her. Jenna's face creased up as the tickling on her already highly sensitized foot got even worse as Alicia took care to bring the feather all over her foot and tickle every inch that she could. She didn't pull Jenna's creased up toes back this time, simply content to give Jenna light, but constant tickling. I could see she was fast approaching her limit of taking the torture and she wouldn't be able to take much more of even that light tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alicia!\" I called out \"Jenna's had enough tickling on her feet! You can do whatever you want with me, just give her a rest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat finally stopped the tickling and Jenna took huge gulps of air, giving me a grateful look as Alicia regarded me coolly and then turned back to Jenna \"You see, if you had been as polite as your boyfriend, maybe this would never have happened.\" She said, earning a glare as Jenna tried to look fierce through her desperate deep breathing although it only looked only mildly comical \"And since he asked so nicely, we won't tickle your feet anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a sigh of relief at that and Jenna gave me a look of sheer gratitude as Alicia whispered something in Mary's ear. I felt my confidence in the situation ebb as I wondered just what they were up to as Alicia motioned for Kimberly to come over to her. Another bout of whispering followed and I noticed Kimberly look very reluctant at what she had been told but a sharp glare from Alicia made her drop her head in defeat \"As I was saying.\" Alicia said, turning back to us \"We'll leave poor, ticklish Jenna's feet alone... And try out the rest of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my jaw drop at that announcement. She couldn't do that! But I was proven wrong as the Kimberly grabbed onto Jenna's feet and held on tight as Alicia and Mary started digging Jenna out. Normally, Jenna would have put up a good fight at all of this but she had been weakened too much from the tickling for that. As soon as her hands were free of the sand, Alicia and Mary grabbed onto them and dragged Jenna out, pulling her up and setting her down on the ground nearby. Jenna squirmed as much as she could but the tickling had taken its toll and she could only offer a token protest at most before she was set down on the ground. The three got to work and buried Jenna's arms and legs with sand, covering them completely up to her hands and feet, leaving everything above the knees and below the biceps completely vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, this is even better.\" Alicia said, dragging a finger up Jenna's belly, earning another drawn out giggle \"So much more to aim for now. What about it Jenna? Do you want to go another round of tickles over your body, or shall we see how ticklish your boyfriend is instead on his feet? Your body, or his feet. Your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick my feet Jenna!\" I called out, hoping to make the choice for her \"I can take the tickling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna looked over to me, obviously torn on what to choose as she didn't want to go through with any tickling on the rest of her body, but certainly didn't want me to go through a similar treatment. After a few seconds, she let out a sigh and gave her answer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenna looked like she had betrayed me as she asked the girls to tickle my feet, even though she was doing the smart thing. The fact that it looked as if I was going to get tickled by three beautiful (if incredibly bratty) women was a plus as far as I was concerned, so long as Jenna was given time enough to recover from her ordeal. Once again though, Alicia threw everything out of order with an evil smile. \"Well, well. So Jenna's boyfriend is willing to give himself up for her, but not the other way around? That's cold Jenna, really cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you show how warm and loving you are by letting us go then?\" Jenna shot back as she struggled under the sand she was trapped in. I noticed some grains shift and realised she could escape with enough time and effort. But that wasn't something she had right now as the Alicia sat on top of Jenna's hips, straddling them as she picked up the feather she had used earlier to torment her feet. \"W-Wait!\" Jenna protested \"You said you'd leave me alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was before I found out what a nasty person you are Jenna,\" Alicia responded as she looked over to Mary and an ever increasingly nervous Kimberly. \"What do you say we show Jenna here the power of karma?\" she asked, twirling the feather in her hands. Mary grinned in response as she moved next to Jenna's exposed ribs and Kimberly slowly made her way over to sit on Jenna's sand covered calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing?!\" I demanded. \"You're supposed to be tickling me!\" I saw Jenna glare at her captor that was soon stopped as Alicia took the fluffy feather in her hand and brush it up and down slowly across her belly. Instantly, Jenna let out a series of giggles out of her mouth that sounded quite sweet. The feather twirled around the sand covered stomach, brushing the grains off and then tickling the soft skin underneath, trailing the plume slowly in a circle around the toned belly. Jenna spluttered and giggled as she failed to hold in her laughter as the feather traced around her stomach in a slow and torturous fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my shouted protests for the tickling to stop, the three ignored me as Mary started with her own ticklish assault, poking her ribs, one after another as she start to keep count. Mary prodded each of Jenna's ribs in turn, the constant poking finally bringing Jenna's laughter higher and louder as the floodgate opened from that and the feather tickling her belly. Jenna started to laugh hard as Mary simply started squeezing her ribcage with both hands, her fingers digging in with obvious glee on Mary's part as she smiled in delight at Jenna's screams of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly remained the most reluctant to start tickling, but seeing her friends do it, she seemed to resign herself to the fact she had no choice. She began by tickling Jenna's thighs lightly, her nails gliding over the skin without pause as she tried to avoid Alicia's wrath. The tickling drove Jenna over the edge though as the three way assault, even if one was from a feather and the other half-hearted soft tickles on her thighs, completely overwhelmed her. Jenna arched up her chest, her breasts poking upwards in a way that caught my eye despite the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was torture for both of us. Jenna had her boundaries trodden on and shoved in her face, and I couldn't bear to see my friend like this. Though despite the fact Jenna was far beyond her limit, I had to admit I was enjoying the sight before me as the terrible trio tickled Jenna out of her mind. Jenna's body writhed and wriggled as the tickling did its magic \"OHHHHAHAHHAAGGGAAHHAADD!!!! ICAAHAHHAANNNTTAHHAEKEEHEEIITEEEHTTTT!!!\" Jenna screamed as her belly, ribs and thighs were tickled and exploited at the same time. Alicia's eyes gleamed as she tickled around Jenna's navel, the feather stroking just along the edges, provoking even higher screams of laughter from Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my protests and Jenna's screaming with laughter, the tickling went on for a good long while before Alicia finally stopped and the other two followed suit. Beneath them, Jenna panted heavily, her hair sticking to her face and her body shining with sweat from her exertion. Jenna's chest heaved as she tried to get breath back in her lungs and I noticed that she looked ready to start begging for mercy if the tickling started again, pride or no pride.</span></div></div>",

Isn't that right?\" She asked, reaching down and pinching Jenna on the cheek. Jenna, who was still gulping for air, couldn't even form a proper response and simply took the insult, her face plastered with hair sticking to her from the sweat. The sand trapping her legs and feet hadn't moved much considering the fact she must have been wriggling madly underneath it. I just hoped that she would be able to break free at some point, I doubted Alicia and the others were going to be that eager in digging us free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK?\" I called over to Jenna who looked over to me and nodded. She seemed too exhausted to make a proper response but she went for a smile to reassure me, something I returned in kind. At least I knew she hadn't gone insane from so much tickling. I turned back to face those in front of me and saw that Alicia, Mary and Kimberly had already taken up position by my feet. Mary was at my left, Kimberly on my right and Alicia sat in between them, her hands able to go for both at the same time. Not wanting to appear spooked, I wriggled my toes at them daringly \"Like what you see ladies?\" I taunted, awaiting for the attack with equal amounts of dread and eagerness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia raised an eyebrow at that and I noticed they hadn't brought the feathers with them, they were going full force from the outset \"Now that's the attitude I want to curb.\" Alicia announced as she brought her hands close to my feet, wriggling her fingers and long nails a hair's breath away from my soles. I couldn't stop myself from smiling in anticipation and clenching my toes in defence of the oncoming onslaught \"Ooh, someone is ticklish aren't they?\" Alicia taunted \"I can see why you want him Jenna, ticklish little boys like this one must be a lot of fun to have around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to make a response to this only for it to be cut short when Alicia struck my by surprise, raking her long nails up my exposed soles. I let out a howl of laughter as that proved to be the signal for Mary and Kimberly to strike. My thoughts about them having tickled before gained more weight as I felt them pull back my toes, exposing the base of my digits before they started tickling them with their nails wriggling against my toes. Alicia joined in with a hand on each foot, tickling the heels of my feet with constant flicks of her nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the sand, I threw my head back as much as possible and screamed with laughter from the four hand tickling assault on my feet. I was denied the luxury of even wriggling them about as Kimberly and Mary kept a firm grip on my toes, not letting them budge an inch. Now more than ever I was glad of the fact I was buried in sand as the fact I was enjoying this would have obvious if I'd been free. Despite that though, I had to make sure they didn't realise that, they might have just gone back to Jenna if they knew I wanted more tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STTAHAAHHAAPP!!!\" I screamed through my laughter, the pleading only seeming to encourage their efforts as Kimberly and Mary tickled all of my toes at the same time, their fingers scratching at the very base of my toes, teasing as high as they could before going back down to the bottoms to start all over again. The tickling on my soles also sped up, Alicia moving up from my heels to the rest of my feet in a flurry of ticklish assault. Her long nails scraped against my feet from the arches to heels at random shots, the tickling never ending as she found new spots to tickle and tease all over my hyper-sensitive feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure how long the punishment lasted for but I was screaming the entire time, half enjoying the punishment I was being given until I started to feel tears fall down my cheeks. As ticklish as Jenna was, I was finding out I was even worse as the triple tickle attack was getting too much even for me and I went into silent laughter, trying to gasp for air through the silent screams I gave out under the ticklish treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, I felt the fingers leave my feet although it took me some time to stop laughing. My feet still tingled overwhelmingly with the aftermath of sensations from the tickle attack given to me. I took in deep breaths of air to help recover and blinked through my tears, seeing the trio sitting by my feet still as Alicia regarded me with an obscenely smug expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK?\" I heard Jenna ask and looked over to see that she was still trapped as ever. Unable to call back, I simply nodded in response and she gave me a smile that made me feel a little bit better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, look at the love birds looking out for one another.\" Alicia sneered as Mary smirked behind her \"While this has been fun, I think it's time to...</span></div></div>",

Getting up to her feet, Alicia regarded Jenna and me with the utmost contempt before answering \"I'd have thought that was obvious. I did this for your own good you know, so that those haughty attitude of yours would be curbed. Really, we were doing you two a favour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could barely contain the anger I felt then at her sheer arrogance and tried to yank myself out of the sand but to no effect. Jenna wasn't so constrained however and shouted back \"Just you wait for when we get free, we'll get you back ten times as bad! I bet you're even more ticklish than us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew taunting Alicia now of all times was a bad idea and she turned around with an evil glint in her eye as she walked over to Jenna \"Looks as if someone still has an attitude problem.\" She said \"Let's see what I can do to fix that.\" With that, she reached down and underneath Jenna, ignoring my friend's struggles and protests as she managed to untie Jenna's bikini top and yank it away from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna instantly let out a scream of protest as her chest was bared and I couldn't stop myself from looking, noticing that Jenna's breasts were of regular size with soft looking skin that was the only pale part of her skin that I could see. Jenna went red with anger and I myself felt blood rushing to my cheeks and elsewhere from the sight. Alicia laughed at our embarrassment and dangled the bikini top over Jenna's nose \"Maybe this'll teach you to adjust that attitude of yours.\" She said before snatching the bikini top up and putting it over her shoulder \"I'll take this as a souvenir to remind me of our fun little romp today... And the rest of your items.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Alicia's command, Mary and Kimberly snatched up our stuff we had brought with us before taking out a single water bottle and throwing it at the space in between where me and Jenna were trapped \"A small gift to show that I'm not completely heartless.\" Alicia said with a smug grin before she and the other two left us, the three giggling amongst themselves until they went over a dune and were out of sight and soon, out of earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone finally, I got to thinking on how to escape when I heard Jenna grunting. Looking over to her, I saw that she was twisting from side to side as she tried to pull her arms and legs free of the sand on top of her. I watched a bit more closely than normal as her breasts swayed in motion with her and that was rapidly coming close to making this whole ordeal have been almost tolerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some moments of watching Jenna struggle...</span></div></div>",

Pushing up her arms, she broke out of the sand holding her down and sat up before shoving the sand covering her legs as well. She managed to stand up unsteadily on her feet, looking unsurprisingly groggy after what she'd been through before crossing over to me. Not even bothering to cover her breasts, she dug away enough sand for me to eventually push up and free myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got out of the whole, Jenna grabbed the bottle of water the trio had left behind before opening it and taking a good, long gulp from it. She drank over a third of it before passing it over to me where I did the same, glad of the cool water going down my parched throat \"I'm sorry.\" Jenna said meekly after I finished drinking and placed the cap back on the bottle. By now, she was looking down at the ground, her arms crossed over her chest and looking distinctly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to kick her while she was down (Although it was all her fault we'd gotten into this mess), I patted Jenna on the shoulder in a comforting manner \"It's OK, it's made for an interesting afternoon.\" I looked down to her bare chest even as she tried to hide her embarrassment \"For me more than you I'll admit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna managed to chuckle at that before giving me a playful swat on the shoulder at that. She stopped and sighed \"It's going to be tough getting home without getting spotted by someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as if we've got much choice in the matter.\" I said, knowing that the walk back home could have plenty of people who wouldn't object to an ogle of Jenna in her current state \"But we may as well get going now. At least we're not being tickled anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at the moment anyway.\" Jenna commented darkly as we started to head off along the beach, keeping down among the dunes to avoid being spotted by the various people along the place. It was going to be a tricky job indeed...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well what have we here?\" asked a deep familiar voice from the top of the sand dune. \"If it isn't tweedledee, tweedledumber, and their tagalong ditz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy gaze swung up to the top of the dune, as did the Alicia's, Kimberly's, and Mary's. The diversion gave Jenna a much-needed rest as she vacuumed air into her lungs. Standing at the top of the sand pile was someone I was usually happy to see, and given the circumstances I was thankful he somehow managed to find us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here Nick?\" Alicia asked vehemently. \"How did you find us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was a classmate and friend of mine, an Asian teen with long unruly black hair that reached his shoulders and two unreadable brown eyes. Today he was wearing a pair of loose gray swimming trunks, clearly intending to enjoy the water at one time or other. He was relatively short, a sore point for him, so he made up for it with a good amount of muscle and a piercing stare. Like the brats His parents were loaded as well, but unlike the three girls he was aware there were other people in the world besides himself. In fact, he was pretty much the polar opposite of Alicia and Mary, going out of his way to help people and being the class comedian, making everyone laugh at almost anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I simply followed the stench of arrogance and bitchiness to the source. Seriously, it's amazing you three don't attract flies.\" And he had quite a mouth too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got all three of them glaring at him, and it looked as if Mary were seriously considering jumping up and going hand-to-hand right there. The four of them were rivals since the day Nick first attended school, the fighting going back and forth between the princesses and the clown. All were rich, all wanted to be popular. Nick was just better at it than the other three, a fact that stung badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're quite a dog, to be able to smell us from so far away,\" Alicia sneered, doing her best to look nasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick just laughed. \"Bet you've been waiting to use that one. I must admit, I'm impressed. It only took a few weeks for your impaired brain to figure out what a dog is, blondie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vein started beating against Alicia's skull, threatened to burst when I broke out laughing. It was a nasty thing to say, but sometimes the only way to fight a dirty opponent was to get down in the mud with them. And Nick could fight dirty. The three brats were standing up now, waiting for their worst enemy to come down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I hope you don't mind having a blue and gray striped car, Mary. I tried parking next to it, but you know how horrible I am at driving. I may have accidentally scratched the paint job once or twice. Or several times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Mary's forehead that was risking an explosion. \"If you scratched my car you little snot, I'm gonna kill you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that Nick did better than anyone else I knew was talk. Whether it was negotiating around an argument and keeping the peace, telling jokes and making people laugh, or insulting a bunch of brats and getting them worked up, his voice always made people pay attention. His message, both spoken and unspoken, always got across clearly and most of the time it had the effect he wanted. It was partly why he was such a good comedian; he always seemed to know what to say. Most of the time it was hilarious one-liners, but now and then during spats like these, he used his gift for a more devious purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, the glove compartment of an open convertible is not the best place to put your keys,\" he said sternly as if giving them a lecture, a glittering keychain dangling from his fingers. \"I figured you three wouldn't be wearing enough to carry them on you, and knowing how <i>incredibly</i> intelligent you all are, I looked in the first place of greatest convenience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little shit!\" Mary screamed, bolting up the incline. \"Give me those!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, come and get them,\" Nick taunted, looking down as if finally noticing me and Jenna. \"Now there's an idea, how about I bury them like you buried my friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood rushed to the athletic girl's face as she tried harder than ever to dash up the sand dune. Unfortunately, sand dunes tend to be made of sand, so trying to run uphill was difficult to say the least, and in her rage Mary slipped a few more times than she should have. Nick spent a few seconds laughing before turning to run, then turned back again, pretending he'd just remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, thanks for the phone Alicia!\" he called. \"You forgot it in Mary's car, and I thought I should pick it up to make sure somebody doesn't steal it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Alicia yelled, following Mary up the dune. \"Give me my phone you twerp!\" With the other two doing their best to climb the dune, Kimberly looked nervously at the ground before following them, unsure of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick just laughed and ran, disappearing beyond the crest of the dune. Less than a minute later, Mary and Alicia followed suit, Kimberly stumbling behind them, not wanting to be left behind. And then the cove grew eerily quiet, without Jenna's laughter or the giggling of the three brats to fill the space. Only Jenna's panting, which was slowly subsiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill breathing deeply, Jenna nodded. \"Why... Why did they leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled as I thought about what just happened. \"Nick showed up,\" I told her. That was an answer all on its own, no explanation necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that makes sense,\" she said. \"Good thing he showed up when he did. Except how do we get out now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a very good question. I was still buried deep in the sand, almost completely immobile and unable to get up. Jenna was a lot more free, but after her intense session there was no way she could get free. Drained as she was, I doubted she would be able to do much of anything for a bit aside from talk. The brats had gotten her good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to get out was pointless, but Nick had opened an opportunity for us and I wasn't about to pass it up. My entire body spasmed, all my remaining energy put into moving the tightly-packed sand. After a minute of struggling, all I had to show for my efforts was a new sheen of sweat on my forehead and aching muscles beneath the sand. I was even more tired now, and if the brats came back I doubted I'd be able to resist if they decided to restrain me as they had Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, some footsteps on the sand alerted me to someone at the top of the dune. I looked up and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cresting the dune was Nick's short yet muscular frame, shoulders shaking from laughter. He sauntered down the hill exuding an aura of victory, and I could tell just by looking at him that we wouldn't have to worry about any of the brats for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how'd you manage to piss them off enough to get them to do this?\" he asked amusedly, looking at my compact prison and Jenna's vulnerable position. \"They may be rascals and bitches, but this is something new.\" As he reached the bottom of the dune, he did a quick scan of the surroundings, no doubt looking for anything else the bullies had left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story,\" I said quickly, trying to duck the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the rush?\" Nick asked. \"It's not like you two are going anywhere. Though I can probably guess what happened,\" he finished, looking at the pile of seagull feathers near Jenna, whose cheeks began heating up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, they just kind of challenged us to a volleyball match - and they cheated! The damn brats cheated!\" Jenna yelled, her temper flaring at the memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're surprised... Why? Those three would throw someone off a boat for a Klondike bar. Hell, they'd throw <i>you</i> off a boat just for kicks. If something's on the line, expect them to cheat. It's what I'd do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very excellent point, I thought. It wasn't really a surprise, as both Jenna and I saw the trap coming long before it happened, but I'm sure Jenna still smarted of indignation that the brats helped themselves to a prize they cheated to get. Then again, Jenna had a huge amount of pride, which was what got us here in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking very nice in that position by the way, Jenna. Wish I could've been here, I'm sure those tits of your were bouncing all-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it Nick,\" Jenna said frostily. Did I mention he had a mouth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, he walked over to Jenna and reached out. She flinched, somewhat afraid he would start tickling her. I wouldn't put it past him to be honest, he had a very ruthless reputation when it came to tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" he assured Jenna, smiling warmly at her. \"I'm mean, but I'm not cruel. I'm sure whatever those brats did to you was more than you're used to, I wouldn't dare take advantage of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing slightly, Jenna looked away as Nick began digging away at her limbs, being mindful about where the sand went. \"Speaking of whom,\" I piped up, \"where are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for Mary's keys and Alicia's phone,\" Nick answered, chuckling. \"I actually buried them in the beach. Come high tide, the phone will be ruined and the keys will be lost forever. That was plenty incentive for them to find their items quickly, so we don't have to worry about them returning anytime soon.\" He had just freed Jenna's left arm, which she moved and stretched to remind her muscles how they felt naturally, and began digging away at her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I asked incredulously. Nick was famous for pulling pranks on bullies, never had his stunt risked permanent damage to anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, once we're outta here I'll call Alicia's phone. Knowing her, she's got that thing on full volume. They'll hear it blasting away from anywhere on the beach. If they've got anything between their ears, they'll find the phone and keys well before the tide comes in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, relieved in knowing that he hadn't crossed that line yet. Again, his ability to plan things out stumped me. \"Wait, why do you have Alicia's number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prank calls, duh. There's no way I'd consider dating any of them,\" he said, pretending to barf right there on the sand all over Jenna's arm, which she did not appreciate. \"They've got a nice bounce, both up high and down low, but it's the kind of thing the looks better window shopping - as soon as you take it home, you'll ask yourself 'why did I get this thing?' and dump it as soon as possible.\" I laughed, thinking just how true that was. More sand flew away from Jenna's arm, and pretty soon her entire upper half was free. \"Think you can take it from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she told him, reaching down to start digging away at her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Nick then walked over to me and started digging. I was down pretty deep, a fact that Nick kept saying over and over again while he tirelessly shoveled sand, and it was a few minutes before I was able to move at all. The three brats had managed to bury me in only a minute, but then again it was a lot easier to dump sand than dig it out. And there were three of them, compared to one Nick. Sometimes I wondered how he managed to keep up with all of them, and decided now was a good time to voice the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that hard really,\" he answered. \"It may be three against one, but really they cling so tightly together it's like insulting one of them insults all of them, and since it's all collective it's pretty easy thinking of things to all them. Besides, they're so used to simply overwhelming their target that they don't know how to use their group advantage so well.\" Just then, his hands brushed against my arm, and I saw him shovel sand with increased vigor now that the end was in sight. \"And... Ah, done!\" he shouted triumphantly as he hauled the last few large handfuls of sand onto the beach next to me, allowing me to sit up and stretch my tired muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Jenna, I noticed that she had already gotten out and was helping herself to a water bottle over by our stuff. When she came up for air, she looked at me and smiled somewhat tiredly. \"You okay?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said, taking another swig. \"My pride got the worst of it, but it's not like anyone was around to see us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded in agreement, but Nick looked a little uneasy, scanning the surrounding area again. I'm not quite sure what he was looking for, but he seemed pretty serious, nothing like when he was searching for more stuff to steal. \"Um, Nick? What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say it was very embarrassing, but no one was around to see it?\" he said, finishing one scan and sweeping back for another pass. \"It sounds way too good to be true. If there's one thing I know about the brats, it's that they don't pass up a golden opportunity. Having you two buried and the sand and getting tickled to death-\" Both Jenna and I stared at him with shock. How did he know what had happened. He noticed our stares and quickly made a gesture. \"Oh come on, what else would they be doing with a pile of seagull feathers? Anyway, such a humiliation is too good for them to pass up. So there has to be... Aha!\" he exclaimed suddenly, getting up and marching over towards a spot on the dune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis target seemed to be a little break in the sand, a little niche that seemed out of place. I was too far away to see what it was, still flexing my sore body. Nick walked over, reached down, and grabbed something in the sand. When he came back up, a video camera was in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna and I gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, knew it,\" Nick said, fumbling with the edge of the camera and retrieving the memory card. \"Never trust those three. If they issue a challenge, just deny it. They don't play fair, and they only actually confront people when they want something from them - that's why they rig the games. I've been caught in a trap like this before, though thankfully not at the hands of the brats.\" He turned back to us, smiling. \"Experience,\" he told us sagely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks,\" Jenna half-whispered, still not believing that her entire ordeal had been caught on tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no problem. You guys are my friends, and denying the brats a victory is a nice bonus.\" We all shared a smile before Nick, leaning back as if he was about to pitch a baseball, jolted forward and threw the memory chip all the way into the ocean, where the water would ruin anything it had gotten. \"I'd like to have seen that, but probably too risky to keep.\" Jenna nodded, grateful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You arrived just in time,\" I said. \"There's no telling what more they would have done given the chance. Tha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop thanking me,\" Nick ordered. \"It makes me feel all weird. Besides, I took Jenna's gratitude for both of you.\" I complied, smiling. This guy was a really something, no doubt about that. \"You two probably need some rest. Want to head back to my house? My nan's cool with almost anything I do - no seriously, I could probably get away with murder - so it's no trouble. Or we could head somewhere else on the beach, away from this place.\" He eyed Jenna none too subtly. \"I'd certainly enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Jenna moaned. \"If I wasn't so tired, I'd probably kill you.\" We all looked at each other, just before we broke out laughing. What a day this was turning out to be.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her ordeal had taken a lot out of her it seemed, although I wasn't surprised. Having her feet and body tickled as relentlessly as that must have made her absolutely exhausted. I walked over to where we dumped our stuff and grabbed my bag, Jenna lazily rising and picking up her own things. Seeing how tired she was, Nick quickly moved in and helped take a load off her hands, hefting the heavier bags. Together, we made our way across the beach, away from that hidden cove where we got tricked and trapped. As we crested the top of the dune, we say the line of parked cars in the distance, and started heading for them. Nick blazed ahead while I hung back with Jenna, still not back to full steam. For a while, silence stretched as we made for the cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Jenna said eventually. \"I shouldn't have let myself fall into their trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made a mistake, they happen,\" I responded as I got a little closer, putting a hand on her shoulder in a comforting gesture. \"Just remember not to go for it next time and tickle them before they can say anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" Jenna laughed, a glint appearing in her eye. \"I'd love for that to happen! A few minutes alone with a trapped Alicia is all I need.\" She then turned back to me with an apologetic smile. \"But seriously, I'm sorry for almost getting you humiliated like that. If Nick hadn't shown up, that video of us being tickled half to death would have been all over the internet tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'd tell everyone where to find it too,\" Nick called back. \"I promise you, that video would've gotten hundreds of views by the next day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, three girls tickling a really hot girl would have caught some attention,\" I agreed with a grin, Jenna looking up at me before playfully pushing me away. I chuckled at her response and went on. \"And thanks to those three, I know what parts of you are ticklish to feathers. Certainly info I'll be using soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do that and I'll truss you up like a turkey and hand you over to Alicia myself!\" Jenna threatened, trying to glare but failing. As bad as it had been with the bratty trio tickling us, Jenna still had an enjoyment for tickling that wouldn't go away just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowing this guy, being trussed up like a turkey and being handed on a silver platter to three girls with the intent to tickle him shitless sounds like paradise,\" Nick laughed, and I couldn't help but agree. \"Anyway, here we are,\" he told us as he motioned towards his car, a very nice green convertible number. He dropped our stuff in the trunk, got in the driver's seat, then reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone.\"We've gotten to a safe distance,\" he told us while dialing. \"Time to let those three where their stuff is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenna and I put our stuff in the boot of the car, Nick tapped a rhythm on the wheel and waited on his phone, suddenly letting out a chuckle when the ringing stopped. \"Congratulations, turns out you're not a complete idiot!\" he said into the phone, quickly switching it off. I swear I could hear Alicia screaming through the receiver before Nick cut her off. Putting the phone on the seat beside him, Nick started the car and off we went. We drove with few words, me and Jenna just happy to be having a moment's rest and Nick concentrating on the road ahead. Though he turned the radio onto a light rock station at one point, at which Jenna had an animated argument with him about what music was worth listening to at the time. She won after a bonk on Nick's head and he turned the radio off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before we got to Nick's house, a sprawling two storey place built for a family but big enough to shelter two. Leaving our stuff in his car, Nick took us into the house, where the furniture was large and cushy, the floors were a mixture of tiles and carpets, and the general decor was just generally very stylish. He directed me to one bathroom with a shower on the first floor and Jenna to another on the second floor. As soon as I turned on the shower, it was milliseconds before I was stripping and jumping under the hot spray. I don't know how long I stood in there and washed sand off, but I was reluctant to get out while the warm water soothing the ache in my muscles. Eventually, I decided that I'd had enough relaxation time and grabbed a towel from the linen basket in the bathroom. Just outside, Nick had left me a pair of clean boxers and a t-shirt to get changed into. As I slipped them on, I made a mental note to pay Nick back somehow. Between rescuing us from the clutches of three brats and saving us from being taped and blackmailed, I figured he'd earned a few favors from me and Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked out of the bathroom and into the living room where Nick was lounging. He'd swapped the trunks for a pair of jogging shorts, but he still left his chest bare, proud of the substantial muscle that he was building. Seeing me walk in he glanced at the clock. \"Took you long enough, thought you'd never get out of there,\" he said with a grin before motioning to the table in front of the couch where some sandwiches and cans of drinks were sitting. \"Help yourself, looked as if you could do with a pick-me-up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation I began helping myself to the food and a drink when Jenna walked into the room as well, sporting a similar looking shorts and t-shirt combo as me. \"Ooh, food!\" she exclaimed and hopped over to the table, grabbing some sandwiches and a drink before tucking in. After her experience, Jenna proved to be famished as she wolfed down the majority of the sandwiches in a short amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was largely silence (well, not so much) between the three of us for a while, Jenna and I eating and drinking as much as we could with Nick often chuckling or outright laughing randomly at comedy central. Annoyingly he kept this up the entire time, and I made another mental note to unplug the TV next time he was over. When every crumb had finally been devoured, Jenna sat back on the couch and sighed in contentment. \"So, yummy,\" she said before sitting back up. \"Now then, it's time for us to think about getting back at those three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I asked, my mind performing three one-eighties and about seven backflips before I could respond. \"I thought we'd have a short break before we got to that!\" I protested, having just gotten comfortable on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna went on regardless.\"But I've got an idea that'll let us get back at them big time! Don't you want some revenge after what they did and planned to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They might not expect retaliation so soon,\" Nick pointed out helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused in thought at that and had to admit, going for revenge against the three was something I desperately wanted to do. But head straight in for it? I took a moment's pause and decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite my better judgment on the subject, I sat back and nodded my head as I waited to hear what Jenna had to say. Looking over to Nick, I noticed him doing exactly the same thing although he generally seemed a lot more enthusiastic than I felt. I got the impression that this was because he enjoyed someone getting tickled half to death, regardless of who it was. It could've been the brats, Jenna, me, some random person - hell, even himself - and he'd enjoy it all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alicia's hosting some kind of pool party tonight, right?\" Jenna asked, bringing my focus back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, it's going to be the usual rich club there,\" Nick interjected. \"I heard Sally talk about it a few days ago. Alicia's invited the elite of the school there, going to be about a dozen or so included, not including the three who got you earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odds didn't seem very good to me but Jenna simply smiled in response. \"That's great! The more there are, the worse it'll be for Alicia and the other two when we get there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jenna's enthusiasm was to be commended, I wondered if she was really thinking this through. \"And what are we going to do once we get there?\" I asked pointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it, those three are going to be in nothing more than bikinis,\" Jenna replied, and I did indeed think about it. I  thought about girls wearing nothing more than bikinis a lot to be honest. I brought myself down back to Earth as Jenna spoke. \"That means it'll leave us plenty of spots to tickle them, right in front of everybody. We'll sneak in, get through the party and then start tickling them in front of all their friends. When we're done with them, they'll be absolutely humiliated and then we'll have had our revenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to admit, that was a very tempting plan. A party full of bikini clad girls, all watching us tickle torture Alicia, Mary and Kimberly out of their minds? Sounded like a very fun way to spend an evening. But there were some flaws I had to bring up. \"And what if we're caught by them instead? You really want another round of being held down and tickled by those three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind seeing that.\" Nick answered with a grin, earning himself a swat on the head from Jenna, but it did little to discourage him. \"Hell, if I knew something like this was going to go down, I would've invited everyone here myself. Maybe even double the guest list since two thirds of everybody will likely not show up to one of their parties if it were their last day alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna rolled her eyes and went on to ignore Nick as she looked back at me. \"Look, it's just going to be a short thing. We'll hop over the fence, find Alicia, tickle her until she cries uncle and then get out of there. Alicia herself made the suggestion, there's no way they'll be expecting us to actually do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa whoa, time out,\" Nick suddenly blared, holding his hands up in the classical time out fashion. \"Alicia <i>told</i> you about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why?\" Jenna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's a trap,\" he explained. \"If she mentioned it, then the thought has crossed her mind. There's no way she'd count on you two not going for it, she's careful enough to prepare just in case even if she doesn't think you're going to go through. Best case scenario, you'll fall into a trap and surprise them before they tickle you. Worst case scenario, you walk right into their bratty claws and get tickled, likely by the entire party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, that's ridiculous,\" Jenna said, though I didn't totally agree. Then again, Nick was known to be a bit paranoid, and it was a win-win thing for me either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I'm saying is that it's better to err on the side of caution,\" he said sagely, interlacing his fingers behind his head. \"Fine, just let me say I told you so when I haul your laughing butts out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to be fine,\" Jenna tried to assure him, though I felt that it was partly directed towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that about the volleyball match.\" I pointed out although if we were to do this correctly, I would have loved some revenge against those three and I could see Jenna was burning with anticipation in the thought of getting some payback. But the plan was thin to say the least and filled with risk. If it went wrong, we'd just wind up in the clutches of Alicia again and with no Nick or anyone else to come save us this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter mulling it over, I decided to...</span></div></div>",

Jenna was dead set on getting revenge after what the trio had done to her and what they had been planning on doing to the both of us. A shot at hunting down Alicia while she was wearing a bikini and tickling her in public until she begged for mercy in front of a crowd of her nearest and dearest? It had to be done \"OK, I'm in.\" I said, earning a grateful look and hug from Jenna, making my choice worth it from the outset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you going to help or what?\" Jenna asked as she broke the hug to turn to our rescuer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick shrugged. \"I'll give you two a lift to Alicia's house and wait nearby with the getaway vehicle, but don't say I didn't warn you going in. I got a gut feeling telling me you two are going to regret this, but I won't stop you if you're bent on doing this. Just means I'll need to save your asses - again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for that vote of confidence,\" Jenna said sarcastically as she rolled her eyes. Despite that tiff though, Jenna seemed eager to see the plan through and even I admitted to myself that it could be fun. And even if it failed, over a dozen bikini clad girls taking their revenge on me and Jenna by tickling us? I had to admit that had something of an appeal to it but Jenna had probably been through enough for one day. Nick still seemed supportive, but that was probably because he was looking forward to hearing us howl with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few hours to go until the party, Nick offered us some spare bedrooms to nap in to help regain some of our strength. Me and Jenna took the opportunity to do so, the beds being large and soft and I didn't have to wait long before I drifted off into a deep nap. When Nick came to wake me up, I found it hard to believe it was time but looking out of the window into the sinking Sun clued me in that evening was fast approaching. Getting up, I made my way downstairs where me and Nick were soon joined by Jenna, looking a great deal more energetic than I would have thought she'd be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another round of sandwiches and drinks, we got into Nick's car and drove off towards Alicia's house, arriving soon after and we clued in on the party as we heard the sounds of loud music coming from the sizeable back garden surrounded by a large fence. Getting out of the car, me and Jenna sized up the situation. \"So, any plan on getting in?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna stared at the large house and garden before us in thought before answering...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I hesitated, wondering what to say. On the one hand, the three of them concentrating on my feet at the same time would tickle insanely, as well as a little embarrassing, to be completely powerless to stop them. On the other hand, they were all quite the lookers, so it wouldn't be that bad to be tickled by the likes of them. And I knew from experience just how sensitive Jenna's feet were. It was a testament to her will power that she wasn't outright begging and still had the strength to glare at them at all. \"C'mon, boytoy. Who's it gonna be? 5,4,3,2,1...\" threatened Mary cheerfully, unconsciously fingering the long feather she was still holding.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well, that's it. Looks like we get to play with both of them at once!\" exclaimed Alicia, bringing her hands to my feet. I burst into annoyingly high-pitched giggles as the light scratching of ten delicate long nails tickled my arches, my feet flexing to try and lessen the sensations shooting up my legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary moved to help her, but Alicia scooted over, blocking off  the rest of my feet while still skittering her fingers all over my soles relentlessly. \"Not now, Mary, this one's mine. Why don't you two go discipline the brat? I think I'll tickle this one alone for awhile.\" Mary pouted cutely, moving on her knees back over to Jenna. She really did have a nice rear, especially when clad in a tight bikini, and it was a great annoyance that Alicia's constant tickling prevented me from properly appreciating it. \"Ahahhaha! God-that tickles!\" I laughed, though still noticed Mary had tightly grabbed hold of Jenna's foot, once again pulling her toes back.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No-wait! Not again! Ahahah-I'll get you fohor thhihis!\" she yelped as the athletic brunette started rapidly sawing the feather across the sensitive skin between her delicate toes and the foot proper, before going on to take the pointy end of yet another feather and pretended to write something on the arch of her captive's other foot simultaneously. Her irritation at being forced to torment the same target twice in a row soon seemed quite forgotten in Jenna's screamed laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, I was too busy roaring my head off and straining against my sandy prison to notice Mary's skilled technique in detail. Alicia seized my left big toe, pulling it over to the right one and holding them together and back with the same hand, while reaching around behind her to grab hold of a long feather from the pile. I gulped at the sight of it, and she smiled sweetly at me before lowering it to my completely exposed and helplessly stretched out soles. \"Oh nonhoho! Hahahah! Stohohop!\" I screamed. My reflexive begging drove her on, and she leaned her head in. My feet were already clean from the feathers dusting away at every inch of it continuously, and now she started to lightly nibble at the side of one arch.  I flipped my head around wildly, becoming well acquainted with an unforeseen fact; being tightly packed in the sand resulted in me not being able to struggle at all, so there was no where for my excess energy to go, unlike if I had been tied up and could at least thrash around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat alone was a torture. I felt her tongue slipping between my toes now, the sharp tip of the feather scratching at the ball of my other foot. To her credit, she held it almost vertically, so when she dragged the point up, the soft, fluffy feather proper brushed maddeningly against my toes. They were free to twist and wiggle now, but whenever her little feather tip dragged along my foot, they jerked forward, just in time to catch the rest of the feather in the grooves of skin. They would fling themselves back, thrusting my heel forward to avoid the tickling, which resulted in it being perfectly positioned to catch the down scratch of the feather tip. It was a maddening cycle that seemed impossible to break. Beside me, I could hear Jenna laughing at least as hard, and managed to snatch up my wits long enough to glimpse at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly was back at her post by Jenna's head, watching somewhat nervously with a blush tinting her cheeks, and then flinching slightly as Mary found a sweet spot at the base of Jenna's big toe and let go of the other digits to really dig her fingers in. Kimberly put down her feather and slowly started digging away at the sand around Jenna's head, scooping up clumps so that she was excavating all around her shoulders. I felt a moment of excited hope - before Alicia found that one nerve cluster at the ball of my foot and began to concentrate her torturous tools on it, stealing any focus I might have been feeling. Kimberly must have been too sympathetic to their captive's laughter filled screams and decided to free us! I anxiously looked back at the other two, but they were much too engaged on our spastic feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahaha-Oh my Gohod! Stohohohop! Hahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us gohoho! We've had enough! Hahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n          <br>\r\nI could feel myself beginning to tire under the relentless tickling. Sweat was running down my forehead and everywhere else on my body, which ached in some places from being pounded against the sand fruitlessly for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued laughing away, the chuckles slowly dying down as Alicia thankfully began to slow. \"You're in luck, big boy. I'm tired of just using my hands on you. So I'll go find a few more tools for us to play with!\" She smiled that infuriating, princess grin - somewhere between smug and cute - again, and then sauntered away with the most incredible hip-twist I had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing laughter still going full force to my right, I anxiously looked over at Jenna, before glancing back to check on Kimberly's progress. With Alicia gone, we would have the advantage if she managed to spring us. I looked back at the freckle-faced girl, and slumped in disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had stopped scooping away at the sand around Jenna. Now her shoulders, chest and a large part of her toned stomach were visible. When she fell, she had flung her arms out to either side to break her fall, and they were still stuck there under the pounds of sand. She bucked around frenziedly in her half sitting/half lying down position, swinging back and forth in her excess energy. The motion, uh... How to put this? The motion set a couple other things swinging as well, and it was quite captivating to watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snapped out of it as Kimberly took her own huge feather - I don't know what bird it could have come from, but it almost definitely was not a seagull - and started teasing almost all the skin she could see with it. Around Jenna's neck, down towards the base of it, and finally, down around and in her top, letting her other hand stroke around Jenna's tanned belly a bit for some extra giggles. Jenna's laughing reached a surprising new pitch, and I made a mental note to remember the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kim, do you think we should tickle her someplace else?\" Mary piped up, leaning forward to nibble at her captive's helpless arch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, how exactly?\" asked Kimberly, still twirling the feather in Jenna's cleavage. \"I think we should maybe give her a break, she looks pretty worn out... And we haven't had a crack at her cute boyfriend over there yet either!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I have an idea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got up, leaving Jenna still giggling and shaking in the sand, sweating profusely, and started up a quick conversation not far away. \"Wow, Jenna, are you okay? You were really turning red there,\" I asked, worried. Her feet were at least as ticklish as mine, which was saying a lot, and I hadn't been tickled for nearly as long as she had. She wearily flopped her head over to look at me, panting and squirming still, trying to loosen the sand weighing her down. \"I don't now. I really can't take much more of this. When we get out of here, we are so gonna get them!\" She noticed that my torturer was absent.\"Hey, where's Alicia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She went to get more tickle tools. Let's hope they get bored of this soon...\" I explained, glancing at where Kimberly and Mary were still deep in discussion, the former appearing reluctant at what was being proposed. As she was the least sadistic of the party, I took it this did not bode well for us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia came back, arms full of bits and baubles she must of thought could be useful, and raising an eyebrow when she saw we were left unattended. She dropped the goods, giving my foot a little scratch while she was down, eliciting an exaggerated giggle from me with my sensitized skin, and then sauntered off to where her friends were talking.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I watched in horror as I saw Kimberly pick up the tools Alicia had dropped. \"These will help a lot, was planing on saving em for latter but I am sooooo bored.\" I saw that she had fetched a bottle of baby oil, a pair of blindfolds,some rope, and the most torturous looking of all an electric toothbrush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fingers were getting tired but I don't want to stop\" said Alica with an evil grin like a clown out of an unholy nightmare. I watched as Jenna's eyes opened wide and she began to try to free herself and scream. \"Please no not that let us go\" she screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Are you sure we should be doing this\" Mary whimpered with a guilty look across her face.\"She might actually pass out if she couldn't handle our little warm up\" Mary said with a taunting tone as she poked Jenna's well toned stomach sending her into a giggling fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be fine, besides I want to see how ticklish her little boyfriend is over there. \" Alica said while staring me down and opening the bottle of baby oil. I began to feel my stomach drop out on one hand I had never been held down on tickled on the other I found it kind of exciting. I might have even enjoyed this if my friend was not in such a bad situation I could tell she was more ticklish then me and our captors were focusing mainly on her.  I went dead silent as I felt Alica's warm hand run across my feet with oil on it I shivered at its touch. She made special care not to tickle me yet to build up the tension. By the time she was done my feet shined in the sun as she traced her fingers across my arches sending me into a fit of laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please no stop it tickles so bad ahhhhhhh nooo stop\" I got out in between laughs. Wow you really are ticklish the attractive blonde said as she turned to face Jenna. \" And what about you miss. Know it all Jenna are your feet as ticklish as his?\" She asked in a mocking tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlica took out some of the oil for herself before handing it to Mary and Kimberly who had been watching her torture my feet like a bird watches its next meal. Jenna closed her eyes and began to squirm trying to get out of the hole she was in. The three girls began to rub the oil all over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Jenna, where not going to hurt you just make you smile\" Kimberly said in a reassuring voice while lightly rubbing her stomach. \"Yeah\" Mary said Its like having a massage at the beach what could be better then that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't look like much could be better then this from my view seeing there girls massaging another more attractive one was something I didn't mind watching at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna continued to shriek in horror as the blindfold they brought went over her eyes. \"No peaking, we have a present for you\"Alica told her. This sent Jenna into a frantic wiggle to get out \"NO, Ive had enough stop please I beg of you I've had enough anything but this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe....Little baby Jenna is afraid of her gift girls lets make her smile ladies\" Mary said as she bit her lips. The three girls' attacked her ribs belly and feet all at once sending her into a deep laughing attack. \"Poor girl should have known better then to mess with us\" Kimberly taunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us go she has had enough, she is about to faint please do what ever you want to me but leave her alone\" I screamed in a pleading voice. Kimberly looked at me with a smile as if to taunt me and picked up the toothbrush that had been sitting by her. I gulped knowing that no matter where she put the It would be torturous for one of us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOO Please i cant take it anymore im about to SNAP ahh ahah aha hah ha ha ha ha ha\" Jena said when she could get it out the girls had moved to different parts of her body. Mary attacked her feet with her long nails and would stop to let her catch her breath while, Alicia poked her belly button and played all of her ribs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly walked over to me and Whispered in my ear\" Enjoying the show?,  Where should I use the toothbrush first on her?\" I declined to answer instead going on with my plea to let her go.  \"Ah I bet you have never been tickled by a tooth brush before so you cant answer that let me show you big boy\" She said. in a flirty voice. I closed my eyes As I heard her switch the switch the ominous buzzing filled my ears along with Jenna's laughing. The evil girl pressed it on my feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHH NO NO NO STOP PLEASE THAT TICKLES SO FREAKING BAD, AH I CANT TAKE IT MAKE IT STOP.\" I said in the loudest most desperate voice I could muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See how good it feels Where do you thing your girlfriend would like this more at?\"She asked me as she stopped it. I slumped my head over to breath as I heaved out breaths. \"Speechless I see, well Ill just assume that Jenna would like it better if I used it on that cute little tummy of hers, quite sensitive to\" Kimberly whispered in my ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO NO Jena watch out Kimberly is going to use the toothbrush on you\" I screamed. If she heard me I couldn't tell over her laughing and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly looked back at me and grabbed my mouth so I couldn't speak back\" Honey if you ever do that again I will tickle Jenna for hours on end and make you watch. And, it will be in a \"More private spot\", Understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded yes as she let go and walked to Jenna. Mary and Alica had slowed down enough upon seeing Kimberly come over with the dreadful tool, to let Jenna catch her breath but still were going fast enough to keep her at a light giggle. After about 30 seconds of this the girls stopped allowing Jenna to catch her breath. Tears filled her blindfold and Her bikini was begging to slip off, her hair was a mess with sand in it but, she still looked amazing as she gasped for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's had enough for know\"Kimberly said in a serious sounding voice, Jenna sighed in relief. \"Enough from our fingers that is...\" BZZZZZZZZZZZ, Kimberly put the toothbrush right into poor Jenna's belly as Mary and Alica held her tummy and legs down sometimes tickling her themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, OH MY GOD NO, PLEASE THIS IS  TOOOO MUCH, WHAT EVER YOU WANT, ANYTHING BUT THIS. Jenna cried as Mary began tickling her under her now exposed knew caps, Kimberly not leeting up the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But all we want is to tickle you sweetie\" Alica said as she kissed Jenna on the forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you insist there is something you could do for us\" Mary said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please what?\" Jenna cried out in relief, Mary grabbed a confused looking Alica and Kimberly who were still half tickling Jenna's poor body, and whispered something that caused them all to smile and laugh. The dental tool stopped as the girls got off of Jenna and stopped to let her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary spoke for the group loud enough for me to hear\"We are having a party tonight like we said earlier, We need someone to help us with setting up the house. and keeping the guests happy. If you do this for us we might let you go, then you to can tickle each other to your hearts content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything\" Jenna replied as she finished catching her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need your boy friend to help to the more the better\" Alica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feared for my friends sanity and didn't want to see her go through anymore torture and this wasn't so bad Id get to go to the rich kids house and party so I quickly said yes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, but you two still owe us and we don't trust you two so were going to make sure you don't get away from us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like this I said as I felt a blindfold go over me as I was dug out the sand, Before I could protest there was rope around my hands and I was being lead into a car\"<br>\r\n I heard Jenna ask to have her blindfold removed but every time she would ask Kimberly would tickle her and cause her to scream and threaten to call off the deal.<br>\r\nWe reached the car and were put in the back seat we were made to lie down as a cover went over us. 'Move and we will tickle you both to insanity and show everyone in school\"Kimberly said in a commanding voice. I was to afraid to speak to Jenna on the way there, something told me she was to. After 15 long minutes the car stopped and we were taken out and  the blind folds went off to revel sunlight. I saw a huge house, no less then 3floors with a pool in the back. Large hedges concealed most of the house from the road. A fence went around the property and a large garaged was opened showing 3 sports cars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"were here\" Kimberly said as we were lead up to the door she cracked the door to reveal a grand living room. Me and Jenna were both told to sit on a couch as they untied the ropes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to rub my wrists which had rope burn on them as Kimberly began to speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight my parents are out and I am throwing a party, bad news is my last party sucked and there was nothing to do.

After that we left, Jenna put her t-shirt back on and we decided to go out searching for a couple of people to take our place at the party.  We went back to the beach and was driving around before I had an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jenna I have an idea.\"  Jenna looked at me, I explained my idea and she nodded.

She seemed to have had just finished a run and wore a sports bra and short athletic shorts.  I let out a low whistle and chuckled as Jenna slapped me on the shoulder.  \"What?\"  I asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's Ella.\"  Jenna muttered.  I nodded, Ella was Jenna's little sister.  Not really little though as she was only a bit more that 2 years younger than  Jenna, she had curly hair and a nice body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's cute.\"  I quipped, annoying Jenna even more.

Ella wore a tank top and work out shorts.  \"Me and Jenna are just hoping to um- shoot a short film.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"  Ella asked interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a robbery parody.\"  Jenna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I robbery parody.\"  Ella replied looking at her sister with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She means like the old gangster movies.\"  I explained.  I looked at the two girls.  \"Basically we act like we rob a bank-one of our houses- and we decided to take the two banktellers as hostages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Sharon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  I replied.  \"Could we use you two in a rehersal?\" I asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure what would you need us to do?\"  Ella asked looking at me curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just need to tie your arms and legs together and drive you to are secret hideout where we demand our ransom.\"  I replied with the most fake evil voice I could muster.  Ella grinned sheepishly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be fun.\"  Sharon said giggling and grinning.  She was a very bubbly person.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.  Could we do it now?\"  Jenna asked smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure sis.\"  Ella replied.  Guiding them to my truck we had them each sit in the back seat.  First was Ella.  She like Jenna was very pretty, with a nice brown body and curly brown hair that fell in deep locks around her face.  She giggled shyly as I took her wrists and put them together and duct taping them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to tight?\"  I asked Ella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  She said quietly, smiling as she looked over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\"  I said trying out my evil voice again.  \"Henchmen!  More tape!\"  I said to Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I have to be the henchmen?\"  Jenna asked handing me the duct tape that I ran around Ella's elbows.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I drive the truck.\"  I replied as I lifted up Ella's knees and ankles and bound them together.  \"How's that?\"  I asked.  Ella wiggled around for a minuet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty helpless.\"  She said smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helpless.\"  I replied with a smirk.  Her tight tanktop show just a sliver of her midsection that I ran a finger along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyofairhaha!\"  She said trying to squirm away.  \"Hahtahpahaha!\"  After a minuet I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last touches.\"  I said before putting ductape over Ella's mouth and taking a towel to make a blindfold that wrapped around her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youre up.\"  Jenna said to Sharon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  She said sighing, as though she really was a hostage.  I smiled as I admired her brown athletic body in just a sports bra and spandex shorts.  I started binding her arms but my eyes kept looking at her belly and sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try it.\"  Sharon said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try what?\"  I looked at Jenna.  \"Jenna can you tape up her legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  She said.  With that I started to lightly poke Sharon's  sides.  She squeeked and went from side to side at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, hey stop that!\"  She playfully yelled while giggling.  Jenna bound her ankles while I started to savagely squeeze her sides.  \"Hahahnhahatstomuchahaha!\"  She tried to squirm away, her toned belly felt so nice and her attire didn't cover an inch of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh be quiet.\"  I muttered still squeezing into her warm skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahtorhaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"  Jenna replied squeezing her exposed thighs.  After a couple of minuets we stopped.  Sharon was also gagged and blindfolded.  Then we laid them both down in the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No talking you hear!\"  I tried to say in my tough guy voice.  Ella and Sharon nodded.  I liked the sight of the two soontobe tickle slaves.  Then I covered them with a blanket.  Getting in the driver's seat Jenna and me grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will work.\"  Jenna said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minuets of driving we were back at the girl's house.  Their driveway was long and their house a bit away from the main road.  Kimberly met us out in the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are back soon.\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have two soon to be slaves in the back seat.\"  I whispered.  She smiled and nodded.  She went and opened the door and had two bodyguards come out to helps us carry Ella and Sharon inside.  They squeaked a bit as they were tossed onto their shoulders.  Taken back inside the huge beach house I looked around at the place.  Sharon and Ella were placed down, they could stand and they were placed against a wall for balance.  Two female bodyguards now came out as well and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice.\"  Alicia said smiling.  \"Annoying Sharon and- is that your little sister Jenna?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"  My puerto rican friend replied.  Sharon and Ella raised their eyebrows at Alicia's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should take off their blindfolds.\"  Mary said looking at me and Jenna.  We nodded and went over and took the blindfolds off.  Sharon and Ella looked around confused at the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should explain.\"  I said.  \"We kind of got into a predicament earlier.  We were offered a way out.  We uh- well they're throwing a party tonight and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We needed them to get tickle slaves.\"  Kimberly said with a wave of her hand.  Sharon and Ella's eyes went wide.  Sharon slowly shook her head while Ella started babbling into her gag.  Kimberly had a cruel smile on her face.  \"Yes you two slaves will be the main entertainment tonight.  Will help us keep the party going.\"  She walked up to Ella and pulled up her tank top.  \"Nice body.\"  She poked Ella in the tummy making her squirm and whimper into her gag.  \"And ticklish too.  Good job.  Mary take Little Jenna, Alicia get Sharon.\"  The two girls nodded as they and two female bodyguards carried the two squirming tickle slaves away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we did our end of the bargain.\"  Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes good job.\"  Kimberly said smiling.  \"Thank you.  This party is going to be special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we can stay?\"  I asked, really hoping for a chance to tickle Sharon and Ella mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes.  You can stay.  You were very helpful; and I must say while you are annoying, youre almost kind of cute.\"  Kimberly said, almost seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me?\"  Jenna asked crossing her arms, annoyed.  Kimberly turned to her and did her best to grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes of course you can stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  Need to make sure my sister doesn't get too tickled.\"  Jenna replied sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah of course.  You should obviously stay; how could you be entertainment otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\"  Jenna asked, her eyes quickly widened.  \"No!\"  She yelled as a female bodyguard and a male bodyguard quickly grabbed her.  She struggle fiercely as she was locked in a tight embrace.  \"We had a deal!\"  She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\"  Kimberly asked putting her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me!\"  Jenna shouted at me.  Kimberly turned to me and smirked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love tickling, why would you help her?  You've done well.  Heck you can oversee the tickling entertainment tonight.  Think of it.  Jenna, her cute sister, Sharon.\"  Kimberly was right, it was a dream come true.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Jen.\"  I replied shrugging and smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"  Jenna yelled.  \"Nonononono!\"  She continued to struggle as she was carried away.  After a few minuets of chatting Kimberly looked at her watch and asked me to follow her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this.\"  She said.  Right in front of the glass doors that lead to an obscenely large patio, which lead to a obscenely large pool, which lead to the beach.  There was two couches in front of a large TV.  Right behind them there were three tables, spaced apart but still pretty close.  Each one had a squirming girl on in.  I smiled walking over and looking at them.  Their nice bodies were stretched on the table, their arms locked above their head with their elbows also locked.  Their ankles and knees were also (in Jenna and Sharon's case) snapped down while Ella's were only shacked, allowing some movement.  Sharon had duct tape plastered on her lips, while Jenna had a cleave gag and Ella had a tiny red ball gag that actually fit into her teeth meaning there wold be no jaw ache.  Each also had a collar around their necks that had the word 'Tickle Slave' on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like?\"  Alicia asked.  I smiled.  Jenna had been stripped back to her black strapless bikini.  Sharon was left in her sports bra and spandex shorts that really covered around the same amount of Jenna's bikini.  Ella had been stripped to her blue bra and panties.  They were all struggling and the bodyguards and Mary lightly poked and scratch them.  Jenna was angry, Sharon struggled the hardest, while Ella squirmed and babbled into her gag as she had tears of anger and fear roll down her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun tonight.\"  Kimberly said smiling and running a hand along my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I will.\"  I said looking at the two Puerto rican and one indian beauty.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This is going to be fun slaves.\"  I said meancingly as I ran my fingers down Jenna and Ella's midsections.  They squirmed and cried out into their gags.  \"Ill be the tickle slave overseer tonight girls, so don't worry, you'll be tickled relentlessly.\"  Jena tried to talk into her gag, she was furious.  \"I'm sorry what was that.\"  I said sinking my fingers deep into Jenna's sides.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Nohahahastahapahaha!\"  Jenna cried into her gag.  I smiled as I stopped and got tools for the party.  Soon it was sunset and the party was starting.  The girls were a great attraction as plenty of party goers loved to tickle their bodies.  Soon they were all bucking and squirming as dozen of pairs of hands tickled their warm flesh.  Ella was very popular with the high school football team who all took turns tickling her belly, tighs, arms and legs, constantly.  They rotated to make sure the Puerto rican girl was continuously tickled. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nElla struggled in her chains as the football team enjoyed making her brown skin convulse from the tickling.  A couple of the seniors joked that perhaps they shouldn't have ignored her just because she was from a lower grade.  This infuriated Jenna who received similar comments  as many party goers dug their fingers into her warm flesh.  I enjoyed just sitting back and watching the three slaves be tickled for hours.  Jenna in her small black bikini kept stuggling as her sides, thighs, arms, belly, and feet were all tickled.  There were probably a hundred teenagers at the party and at least a third of them at any one time were trying to tickle the lovely tickle slaves. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSharon, the lovely indian beauty couldn't stop laughing as a bunch of cheerleaders and other rich girls raked her thighs and blew multiple raspberries into her lovely tummy that was toned from years of running.  Sweat covered her body and her sports bra and running shorts were soaked. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Having fun?\"  I looked at saw Kimberly walk up holding a drink.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a very enjoyable sight.\"  I replied grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, get in there.\"  Kimberly grinned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and decided to have fun.  First I walked over to Sharon.  She looked at me, her dark brown eyes seemed to be betrayed.  I just smiled as I ran my finger tips down her soft body.  Her warm skin felt wonderful.  Working with the girls I had one hand squeezing her muscular thighs while another hand scribbled all around her sexy tummy.  Sharon closed her eyes and laid her laughing into the duct tape that covered her mouth.  Slowly the hand squeezing her thighs went up and soon I had my hands just beneath her bra.  I then savagely tickled her ribs, slowly moving down her wonderful midsection as she bucked and squirmed as her skin became hot from scratching.  I tickled her sides before going all the way down to her waist.  She tried to buck her hips but failed as I then focused on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begged into her gag as I tickled her for half an hour.  All three of the girls were exhausted from the endless tickling.  The party had started at 7 and now it was after 10.  I decided to walk over to Jenna.  Her dark brown hair was plastered around her from sweat as her breasts rose and fell from being out of breath.  Her cleave gag was soaked but still held back her protests.  Not to mention the girls had been given water and a gag break every hour or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well.  How does it feel being nothing but a slave Jenna.\"  Kimberly asked putting her hands on her hips.  Jenna could only mumble a protest, though I realized she was still mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she is slowly accepting it.\"  Alicia said giggling as she pinched Jenna's side.  She tried to squirm away.  A mix of jocks and other boys and girls, a group of almost ten was torturing her.  Alicia had decided to torture Jenna some more by finding a pingpong paddle and slapping her belly- alot.  Jenna squirmed and moaned in pain as her belly stung and her brown skin was made a lightish red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets have some fun.\"  I said leaning down looking at Jenna.  Yeah, she was still angry.  I liked seeing her in her black bikini and I wasted no time squeezing her sides.  She burst out laughing as Kimberly and Alicia tickled her thighs and feet.  She cried out into her gag as our fingers wiggled around on her skin.  She kept mumbling angrily into her gag as her hair went flying as ticklish sensations went through her body.  She hated everyone tickling her and making jokes at her expense.  But I liked seeing her body squirm in her bikini.  Kimberly slapped her thigh making Jenna squeal.  \"Calm down Jenna.\"  I said before leaning in and blowing a raspberry into her salty tasting skin.  Jenna couldn't stop laughing and leaned her head back.  I patted her belly and walked around running my fingers along her body as I walked to her other side.  \"Is your little sister just as ticklish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmphnooomphahahahahaha!\"  Jenna argued as I tickled her tummy with one hand while joining in with the football players by tickling Ella's tummy.  The younger puerto rican girl had the cutest laugh and she looked good with the red ball gag and she was defenseless in her blue bra and panties .  The sisters squirmed as dozens of fingers tickled their body.  This went on and on.  A little after midnight Kimberly and Alicia left.  Mary came over and kept poking Ella while giggling herself.  Soon Kimberly and Alicia came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets have some more fun.\"  They said holding up whip cream and syrup.  The three girls moaned.  Sharon was first.  Her brown body was covered in cold and slimy syrup that was even darker than her skin.  Kimberly went in zigzags over her belly.  She got applause as she filled up Sharon's bellybutton with syrup until it was overflowing.  Her legs were also covered.  Then whip cream went below her bra and above her shorts before going down her legs.  Turning, Jenna and Ella had the same done to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon appetite!\"  Soon the girls were squirming as raspberries and licks tickled their bodies.  Sharon had people put whip cream on her duct tape as a joke.  The football team loved Ella and her squirms as the syrup and whip cream was lick off, sending constantly ticklish sensations across her body.  I decided to focus on Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking yummy Jenna.\"  I muttered as I went down to lick some of the syrup out of her navel.  \"Yum.\"  What followed was an hour of annoying my bestfriend/kindagirlfriend by licking the whip cream and syrup from all over her body.  Me, Kimberly and Alicia had her all to ourselves and I got her upperbody.  I nibbled her tummy and sides making her jump.  \"Yum.\"  I muttered again.  The 'ingredients' got passed around for a couple of hours.  Some places made Jenna angrier than others.  She was definitely angry with me.  Tickling, licking.  By the time some people start leaving it was after 3, almost 4.  The three tickle slaves were exhausted.  \"Well.\"  I said tired myself as the last few guest walked out.  \"I think you guys earned a nap.  I think well just leave you there for tonight.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke of groggy from the previous night.  It was past 11 and a stretched as I stood up.  I was still at Kimberly's house, the mess from the party had largely been cleaned up by the house bodyguards but the three tickle slaves still slept in their bondage on the tables. They were all goregrous and slept peacefully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good youre awake.\"  I looked to my right to see Kimberly come in wearing a blue blouse and jeans.  Alicia and Mary followed her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for helping us throw such a memorable party last night.\"  Mary said giggling.  The three girls strapped onto the tables were slowly starting to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on slaves wake up!\"  Alicia said clapping her hands.  Sharon, Jenna, and Ella slowly woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still have plans to tickle them some more?\"  I asked smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you have no idea.\"  Kimberly said, smiling slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was the sound of a door unlocking as as women walked in.  She was tall and elegant, she looked about forty.  \"Kim, I'm home.\"  The woman said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom.\"  Kimberly said running over and hugging her mother.  \"I have wonderful news!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a gift for you.\"  She said dragging her mother by the hand who smirked when she saw the three bound girls.  \"I got you some slaves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh how wonderful.\"  The woman said smiling ear to ear.  She wave some bodyguards over as the three bound girls were now awake and groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well tickle slaves at least.\"  I muttered smiling.  Kimberly looked at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.  Actually slaves.  Remember that law the state passed.  If a teenager's parents agree they can sell their child into servitude or slavery for a certain amount of time.  I talked to Jenna's and Ella's parents.  We're rich and they agreed to take a very hefty sum in exchange for their two daughters become our actual slaves.\"  I nodded remembering the obscure law that got passed.  I smiled looking at Jenna and Ella who were wide eyed and scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very impressive.\"  I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Kimberly replied, she pointed at Sharon.  \"Im still negotiating with mister and misses Rina, but Ill have a deal by dinner.\"  She said grinning.  Sharon tried to gasp behind her duct tape.  Kimberly turned to the body guards.  \"Have my slaves showered and put into some nice bra and panties.  My mother would love to tickle them later when theyre not so sticky and sweaty.  Right mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes dear.\"  She replied as the girls slowly moved their limbs after being released from the tables.  Kimberly turned to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you.  I bet you need a summer job and I owe you for setting this all up.  How would you like the job of my overseer.  Im sure you can think of all sorts of fun to have with those three.  Especially Jenna.\"  I blushed before nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"  I muttered not believing my luck as the three slaves were led away.  \"How long did you purchase them for?\"  I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were still working out some details, but well probably settle on a decade.\"  Kimberly said as though it held no weight.  Ella started babbling into her gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\"  Kimberly's mother said swatting Ella's thigh.  She turned back to me.  \"That sounds wonderful dear.  And you mister can call me Cathrine if you would like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay miss Cathrine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to have so many tickling adventures now.\"  Kimberly said brightly.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A month later you were enjoying being paid 10 dollars an hour to live out your fantasies.  The three girls who were free currently watched TV.  They sat around a coffee table, on the table was Ella, the puerto rican girl who had been sold by her parents to Kimberly's family as a slave.  Kimberly and her two friends Alicia and Mary sat in chairs as they tickled the poor girl who was tied spread eagle on the table in only a strapless bra and panties.  They merciless dug their hard fingernails into her smooth brown skin as she begged into her gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drinks Mistresses.\"  Another slave said.  It was Sharon, the Indian Beauty, with her long raven hair in a pony tail, she wore a pair of black bra and panties and had her ankles and wrists shackled so she could serve drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave Sharon, come here.\"  Catherine, Kimberly's mother, ordered.  The athletic Indian girl nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master Catherine.\"  Sharon replied submissively, Catherine preferred the term 'master'.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, follow me to my.\"  Catherine said coming into the room with a feather duster.  \"I want to see how well this works on you.\"  With that she lead her slave out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI meanwhile enjoyed tv with what use to be considered my girlfriend in my lap.  Jenna, Ella's older sister.  The gorgeous Puerto Rican latina.  Her wrists and elbows were tied tightly behind her, and her legs were bound at the knees and ankles in red tape.  I lightly waved my fingers over her sexy tummy and thighs, making her lightly squirm in my lap.  Being an overseer she knew she was my favorite slave to tickle torture.  She wore a tiny strapless bikini and bottoms.  \"Great show, wouldn't you say slave.\"  I said pooping her toned side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mppphahahahhamphs!\"  She laughed into her duct taped lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sure does love tickling Jenna.\"  Kimberly said smirking.  She looked at her friends.  \"And I think Jenna secretly likes being his favorite slave of ours.\"  Jenna blushed as she continued to squirm in my lap.  \"You know, you can go into the guest bedroom if you want to have some more private and intimate fun with her.\"  Kimberly said.  I raised an eyebrow as she grinned.  \"Lets face it yall were made for each other.\"</span></div></div>",

I turned to return the favor and she grabbed my cheek gently and pulled me into a deeper kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat together in quite embrace for what seemed like several minutes before she slowly began to rise while still holding the kiss. She slowly pressed her mouth against my head, pushing me back into the bed. She took her hand away from my cheek and gently grabbed my shoulders, guideing me further into a resting position with my legs still hanging off the bed. She supported herself by resting an arm on either side of me, lifting her warm body just slightly over me as we continued our pationate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cautiously moved an arm from my side and grazed a hand over one of her breasts. Her smile against my mouth told me she was okay with it and I began slideing my hand in a circular motion about my girlfriends small breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna wrapped her arms around my chest and lowerered herself onto me, pulling us into a deep hug/kiss. I felt my penis strain against my pants as Jenna pulled her nearly nude body into mine. I wrapped my arms around her and returned her hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna pulled out of our kiss and looked into my eyes. \"Ready?\" She asked me, I whispered out a, \"yes\". I felt her legs straddle me as she pulled herself away from my chest. She was quite the view, her skin seemed to shine in the lowlight and her perky breasts were given the spotlight in my vision. She lifted her bra, allowing the two cute mounds free. Yep I was pretty fucking ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted her waist about my own till she lined up with my penish, which had been trapped flat across my waist, pinned against my boxers. She looked at me and exhaled deeply, then slowly grinded her mound along my shaft. I felt a deep gasp get let out of my mouth as she reached my head, then she grinded back to the base of my shaft. She looked away from my face and her glance moved to where our sexes were being rubed together. A paces was quickly set and I felt a new type of pleasure then any from masturbation. After a minute of this she slowed and got off me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at her and saw she had gotten on her knees and was moving to remove my pants. My hardened penis readily sprang out of my boxers once she moved to remove them and I quickly put on one of the condoms as she played with my balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her hands from the bed and glided a finger along my penis. The sensation was dulled but still more then enough to stimulate me as she formed a circle with her fingers and began slowly pumping my sensitive dick. Whenever her fingers went across my glans I felt a wave of deep pressure and soon I was letting out deep moans. I felt her hands stop and I looked down at her to see she was moving her head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips wrapped about my throbbing penis and I felt her tounge playing about my glans as she put the first few inches of my cock into her mouth. When she began bobing her head it was too much and my hips began grinding against her as I reached my peak. She kept going as I climaxed and shook.</span></div></div>",

Jenna moved back to my penis, removing the condom and replacing it with a new one. She then removed her bikini bottom, revealing her shaved, wet pussy. She was clearly enjoying this as much as I had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed on top of me and slowly slid onto my throbbing erection. She gasped and let out a little moan, while I moaned along with her. She then started to bounce up and down, moaning and gasping more and louder. I started to thrust against her until we found a rhythm together. As she rode me, she repositioned slightly, leaning a little forward and placing her hands on my chest as she bounced. I could start to feel myself getting close again, and I could tell she was on her way to an orgasm as well. </span></div></div>",

I took her wrists and bounded them together with duct tape.  I then did the same with her elbows.  She grunted at this, I made it uncomfortably tight, her breasts being jutted out.  I reach around and gave them a squeeze, making Jenna moan.  I then went down and rubbed her sensitive stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets get started then.\"  I said unbuttoning my pants.

I changed into a gray shirt, black knee high shorts, white crew length socks, and a pair of sneakers.<br>\r\nAs I left my house Jenny was outside waiting for me. She's wearing the same shorts as before and a tank top that showed less of her midriff but still showing some. Instead of pink sandals she is wearing shoes and pink crew length socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey ready?\" I asked, while Jenny responded with a yup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenny began leading me to the wrestling contest I began asking questions about the wrestling contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it about.\" I asked, hoping that Jenny knew something about this contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny stopped, which made me stop. She put her hand on her chin and doing a hmmm and began walking again which I follow her. \"Well all of the group consist of mostly female and few males, however they allow all genders and ages 12 and up to wrestle. They are a group of wrestlers that love tickling and or being ticked. They travel around wrestling anyone who asks to wrestle them. Also they are a somewhat private group like you would have to go to their website to watch, to know where it is at and to participate, people would have to tell you about it. Lastly there are rules however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst they aren't allowed to use wrestling moves that would hurt people, they can however tackle you or push you down or things like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond you can only win if you make your opponent Tapout or scream I quit but there are special matches like a item match which you can use items to tickle your opponent or a two out of three match or a slave match which makes the losers become the winners slaves for however long the two groups agree to and they can do anything to the losers however they want. Like this once I saw the losers being tickled for a  hour and another is the losers were made to kiss and lick the winners feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe matches are either one on one or a tag team. There is no ref and there can't be people another person on ringside beside the wrestlers. If you are in a hold you can grab the ropes and the person must stop after three seconds If someone cheats then the match must be redo. Besides all that everything else is fun.\" finished Jenny nodding to herself. Everything that she said made me blink for a few seconds. Wow she knew more about this then I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm surprised that you know all this.\" I said surprised, which made Jenny giggle nervously and scratch her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A older friend of mine that I went to summer camp is now a wrestler and she got me to come one time with her and wrestle with her against another team.\" said Jenny before she shook her head. \"Anyway when she told me about that they are coming here in town I got excited and went on their website and got there information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs were we getting close to our destination Jenny suddenly said \"Oh and also even if we lose we can still make some money off by this.\" Which caught me by surprised. Both of us were doing this for fun but I wouldn't mind if we get some money out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" I asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny just grin. \"Well if we signed some papers they can post the matches up on there website and if they get any money out of it we also get some. Oh and don't worry about getting recognized and embarrassed, they can blur our faces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, ok let's try it.\" I responded which made Jenny smile and gives a small cheer and said \"Yes, free money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we finally got here it was a normal looking building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure we are at the right place.\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" said Jenny as she looked at the flyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked inside the building we saw a woman with blonde hair leaning back on a chair, showing us her size 9 lightly tan, bare feet up on a desk looking at her phone. Jenny seeing me staring at her bare feet and gave me a little squeeze on my side, which I responded with a EEP. I responded with giving a dirty look at a giggling Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a new giggle, me and Jenny look at the source, which was the woman with a amused smile on her face, which made me slightly blush and Jenny only smiled. As we got closer I saw she is wearing a sleeveless white top, black pants and white sandals next to the floor. There are two doors one on her left and the other on her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you two are here for our contest?\" asked The woman still with a amused smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny and I only nodded. She pulled out two papers and gives them to us. \"This is for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the woman could say anything else Jenny cut her off. \"To allow you guys to tap our match and put it on your website and yes we would like that and also yes we would like to be blurred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich made the woman blink in surprise and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess someone did some homework.\" said the Lady with a amused smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we both read the papers and signed them we gave them back, which the woman set them on her desk and stood up  and put her sandals back on. \"Well then, if you too would follow me.\" said the woman as she began walking toward a door on her left side, we follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked through all the hallways until we arrived at the gymnasium. As we stepped into the gym we were surprised, in the middle of the gym there was a big wrestling ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe pass multiple many doors and few hallways until she stopped in front of a door and open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a big plain looking room, however in the center of it is a big wrestling ring. There is stepping to get into the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slightly gulped realizing that I was about to wrestle. Jenny seeing me nervous gave me a shoulder hug and said with a smile. \"Hey don't worry about it, this is just for fun remember.\" Which I responded with a light sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman cleared her throat, which making us blush, remember us that she was still here walked further into the room. As we walked into the ring I realized that the floor is patted down with soft matts and not just the floor, everything in the ring was also soft. The walls also looked soundproof probably to stop sound from escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman begins walking back towards the door but then stops turn back to us and cleared her throat getting our attention on her \"Oh, yeah by the way...</span></div></div>",

Once they were nice and friendly in middle school and lower but when they got into high school they changed. They became arrogant and daddy's girls thinking they were better than everyone else. But then during a semester a couple of students got annoyed by there attitude, which was everybody, and tickled them for hours and tickled them so bad they cried, which I'm pretty sure Jenny was a part of or a leader of it. After that they became somewhat nicer and less arrogant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am a somewhat friend of theirs, a couple of times I hang out with Kimberly multiple of times and a few times with Mary and Alicia, but I'm usually that type of friend that is a friend with everybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia is the leader of the trio, a strawberry-blonde hair with her hair down and cold blue eyes. She is wearing a pink tank top, black short shorts, black stockings which showed off her legs, and short white flat boots. She is the shortest of the three but always the most talkative. She was usually taunting everybody, and was more arrogant but every since the incident, she became less arrogant and somewhat nice, except she was still taunting Jenny whenever, which is why I think that Jenny was in that group from the incident<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary, a jet black hair teen with a ponytail that reached her lower back with green eyes, is the tallest person here and the most athletic of the trio. Showing off her fit, muscular body, she is wearing black yoga pants, a muscle shirt, white short socks and gymnastic shoes. Mary was the right hand and the somewhat enforcer of the Trio, but like with Alicia she is much nicer than before and somewhat friendlier with everybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast and not least is Kimberly, a ginger hair girl with her hair freely falling down her back. Her face has green eyes and has a splotch of freckles dotted her face. She is wearing a blue tank top, black shorts, has white socks that are between my own and Jenny socks length and ankle socks, and blue tennis shoes. Kimberly is the nice and somewhat innocent one, even before the incident, but after the incident she became nicer and friendly to everyone and personally I think realized that she was being mean to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll five of us are surprised, or I believe so due to the fact I heard Jenny did a sharp breath while the girls that I'm looking at eyes are widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one to change their expression was Alicia who smirked and looked at Jenny. Mary on the other hand looked at me, then Jenny, then back to me before she smiled while Kimberly was still surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny only slightly narrowed her eyes at Alicia, while I did a nervous wave, due to the fact even before middle school Jenny and Alicia were always rivals and wondering how this was going to turn out. Alicia ignored me instead of focusing her eyes on Jenny, Mary only did a really small nod, while Kimberly did a wave back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia was about to say something but the woman cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, first you three\" pointing to the trio. \"need to figure out who is going to wrestle while the other one comes with me either watching or fight against a competitor. Then I can explain the rules of the match.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Behind her are Katelyn and Jean who are sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatelyn is a high school freshman. She is cute, looked to be around sixteen to seventeen, with long brown hair that reaches her back and almost to her long legs and bright mischievous blue eyes. She is also the leader of a all girl gang that likes to prank people, though their pranks were all harmless, and tickling people. Of course I got pranked by them few times, and got tickled by them multiple of times but I managed to tickle some of them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatelyn is also known as the most mature girl of her group and the most teasing girl of her group. She is wearing a short blue tank top, blue shorts, regular white socks, and slip on shoes. She was just as tall as me and Jenny was, which surprised me. But due to her sister I'm pretty sure that being tall is in her genetics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister made me and Jenny slightly gulp. Her name is Jean and is on the girls wrestling team and one of the best players. She is also one of the most tallest girls in the school and the tallest person here. She is also a nice popular girl at the school. She is nice, friendly, somewhat positive, willing to help other students when ever they need it, and other things. Of course being the older sister of the leader of a prankers gang put her odds with some people but not me or Jenny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if she was as ticklish as her sister and as skilled tickler as her sister. She has blue eyes like her sister and brown pixie hair cut. Showing off her muscular, fit body, she is wearing a red sports bra, black shorts, which showed off her also muscular legs, thick black ankle socks and black trainers. However that makes you think, why did she wear barely nothing in a tickle wrestling match, was she not ticklish or maybe overconfident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Jean stopped and gave us a surprised look, while her sister look at us and lick her lips, I don't know why but I suddenly curled my toes out of ticklish reflex, she then suddenly smiled and gave us a wink and wave. I responded with a slightly nervous wave while Jenny responded with a more enthusiastic wave back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean, after a few moments of surprise, walked back again and looked at her sister with narrow eyes, while her sister ignored her sister. The two followed the woman and walked up the steps and step in to the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman standing in the center and cleared her throat getting all of our attention. \"Ok, you four sign the papers, I can now tell the rules.\" The woman then went to explain the same rules that Jenny said, you can't use wrestling moves that would hurt people like from a powerbomb, or hit somebody, you can only win by Tapout or scream I quit, there is no referrers, you must tag in your partner to have them in the ring, if someone has you in a hold and you grab the ropes the person must let go before three seconds, and once a opponent Tapout out the opponent that lost can't interfere with the match, however there was a new rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a small but long piece of rope on each of your turnbuckles, if your partner has your opponent in your corner, while holding your string turnbuckle you can then get into the ring and help tickle your opponent or you can use a body part to tickle them while not holding the string.\" said the woman explainer the rule. \"For example if you\" points at Jean \"sat on his\" pointing at me \"back and his feet near you corner, your partner\" points at Katelyn \"can either get into the ring with the rope and sit on his feet and tickle him, or while outside of the ring and near her corner she grab his feet and tickle him. There are multiple tapes near your corners indicating that between the tapes and your corner that doesn't count has a rope break. However if his feet is outside the tape then that is a rope break.\" said the woman done with her example. \"Understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe, Jenny, and Katelyn nodded, but Jena was shocked and said \"Wait, tickling.\" She looked at her sister and in a harsh whisper but still loud enough that we can hear her, she said \"You said this is only a wrestling match.\" Katelyn only blinked and tried looking innocently but nobody felled for it. \"Oops did I forget to tell you that part, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean looked down realizing that most of her tickle spots are wide open for tickling and slightly blushed. She then looked back at Katelyn with a glare but her sister only scratch her head and said \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho goes first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Excitedly I slipped on shorts and a t-shirt, knowing that they'd come off once I got over there anyway. I've always looked forward to Katherine's experiments, and since I was her only test subject they happened at least once a week. Occasionally I even got the privilege of trying some of her machines on her, but she much prefers to be the one at the controller and I'm better strapped to the table than behind the controls. Still, it goes to show that she has a sense of fairness despite her cold analytical demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick jog and I was over at her place ringing the bell. Both Katherine's parents are robotics engineers, and it is often suspected that they are the source of her mechanical aptitude. Her parents are actually the source of many of the robotic parts Katherine acquires, them being spare parts from her mother's or father's research. They maintain a steady supply of whatever she needs, and she accepts all parts given to her happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps pounded on the wooden floor inside. Katherine burst out of the door, grabbed me, and pulled me inside before I could even respond. Apparently she had been awaiting my arrival anxiously, as she wasted no time dragging me into the enormous basement. The room was filled to the brim with all types of machines both large and small, from ingenious robots to modified house items to even mechanical furniture specifically suited for the purpose of tickling. It always amazed me how much this girl could do in so short a time. The room looked like a mess, but it was a given Katherine knew where everything was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks inviting,\" I joked, looking at some of the things she made. One particular invention looked particularly complex. Red cushions lined a metal recliner, except instead of ending in a single footstool it split up so that both my legs would have their own resting places. Multiple drills were stationed up and down the length of the chair and legs, each one with many white fluffy feathers attached to the drill bits. I suspected that they were intended to tickle me to hell and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't it? Spent days on that one, quite proud of how it turned out.\" Katherine stood there in her white tank top and booty shorts, her brown hair tied back into a ponytail that fell to her waist. She dislikes sleeves and pants legs because they get in the way of her work, though I suspect she also dresses like that to show off her butt. \"Before we go any further; strip. Naked. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly obeying, I lost all shreds of material that I wore. Some might feel uncomfortable in such a position, and I felt a blush growing in my cheeks, but I was on the whole okay with being nude - so long as it was in private and among friends. \"Done, now what did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine smiled and gestured to the machine I just looked at.\"That's something I'd like to try out today. As you've probably guessed already, the feathers are going spin across your entire body at speeds I control. It's simple, but I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or if you prefer lying down,\" she continued, pointing at a bed with a large machine suspended over it. \"I could chain you to this one. That machine is host to tons of robotic arms, and I've been writing the automatic script for a while. Don't worry, I've got manual control too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, there's this baby.\" This time the object in question was an examination rack, currently lowered. Above it was a hulking machine, from which protruded several arms each ending in a wheel of soft bristles. \"I've spent months on just the blueprints for this thing. It's unconventional, but I'm sure you'll like it.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Trying not to blush too hard, I chose the feather chair as feathers, while tickly, weren't quite as bad as the prospect of several dozen robot arms or brushes tickling me all over. Although I had a love of tickling, it was still morning and I preferred a softer start when it came to Katherine's creations. Sitting down on the recliner, Katherine soon got to strapping me into place \"I'll look forward to see you sitting in here at some point.\" I said, my blush remaining as Katherine's chest got very close to my face as she strapped in my arms above my head, trapping me completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot appearing amused at that at first, Katherine gave me a clinical look. \"Not while you're still the test subject,\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember the last time you were the test subject. Certainly seemed to enjoy yourself Kitty,\" I teased back, getting some satisfaction as I saw her face gain a slight red tint from the memories she had when I tickled her last. Her nickname wasn't just from her own name but how I could get her to make cute mewing noises with a few soft touches of a feather to her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly breaking out into a smile, Katherine reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, fluffy feather. \"Time to begin the preliminary examination,\" she announced before bringing the feather down to my thighs and brushing it up and down the bare skin, getting close to my groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheennoohoofahhaaiirreheee!!\" I tittered as the the tickling sent electric shocks through me. I knew exactly what she was doing: tickling me to make me aroused and, thus, more ticklish. It was a trick she had discovered during the first experiment and had exploited it mercilessly ever since. I couldn't complain really as I loved the caress of the feather on my skin and would have gotten in a similar state the instant that the feathers on the chair had started tickling me, but starting early like this seemed kinda unfair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject seems to be experiencing some discomfort. Alternative methods shall be used to remedy this., Katherine whispered in my ear before I felt the feather suddenly tickle my erection, brushing the underside with long, slow strokes. The sensations that effected me before turned from electric to fire as the tickling of my cock made me scream with laughter and built up the pleasure I was feeling considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOHOOHII'MMFIIANNEHEEHEE!!\" I cried out in protest to Katherine's teasing scientific words, unable to resist at all as that soft, small feather tickled my cock from base to tip, always keeping up a slow pace that allowed the plume to linger in an excruciatingly ticklish way. I tried to bounce in my chair to escape but without much luck, the straps holding me down doing their job well. I continued to laugh and squeal, realising that if only one feather could do this to me, the dozens lining the chair would be even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the feather was pulled away and I was left a giggly horny mess. Katherine looked down at me and I could see she was smiling broadly. Tickling me into states like this one always made her chipper \"Subject appears to be experiencing enjoyment of the experiment. Time to start the process completely.\" She looked down to the feather in her hand before giving another smile before continuing in the scientific talk she loved to use during our games \"Or perhaps the experiment can become a little more... intimate,\" she said, her eyes shining as the feather twirled in her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a shiver of pleasure at her words and waited for Katherine to make up her mind. She eventually...</span></div></div>",

Initiating torsal probing...\" Catherine declared with enthusiasm, getting even farther into the quasi-scientific spirit of the moment. I twitched nervously as the two 'drills' positioned on either side of my ribs whirred slowly to life and began to move inwards. I closed my eyes tightly, anticipating the feeling of contact as the spinning brushes contacted my chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few seconds went by, with myself just sitting there, tense and braced -but suffering a conspicuous lack of tickling. Slowly, I cracked open my eyes again. \"Say... Are you dragging this out or something, Kitty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, there's no point in it now, I suppose.\" She hmmphed playfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The drills lightly moved in another centimetre or so, and the spinning increased. Trailed by tingling nerves-ending, the feathers started lightly tracing away over my chest, following a pre-set pattern that a small part of me realized was likely adjusted to my size. The delicate, pointed plumes traced just their tips over my body; as my ribs were bearing the brunt, and ususally less than overwhelmingly receptive to such soft measures, it didn't tickle that much. But it still caused me to squirm and giggle no small amount, almost actively <i>wanting</i> it to intensify. It  was as if I was building up energy in an instinctive but futile attempt to ward off the feathers, but the effective retraints and only limited laughter I could produce wasn't allowing me to vent it; it was getting hopelessly bottled up inside of me. I was starting to feel, in a bizarrely pleasent way, that I would simply explode if Catherine left the machine on too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That wasn't the only effect of this interesting setup. As I mentioned, the feather tips had a specific route that they followed, guided by the drills. They started by dragging against my skin midway up my ribs, and then sloowly folowed the curves of my rib-cage down and over the top of my belly, before flicking perfectly up over my nipples. As me and Catherine had learned some time ago, they weren't to be overlooked where extra-sensetive regions were concerned, and their receptiveness seemed to be directly related to how aroused I was. The annoying/fortunate thing was; the more I was tickled there, the hornier I became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From there, they traced onward to the very bottom of my underarms, not tickling the armpit proper but producing a tingling that spread fully across it and no doubt sensetized it quite alot for the attacks that would be going their way in the near future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kitty had pulled up a padded chair shortly after starting the machine and now gazed at me shuddering and squirming away, getting exhaustively aroused and tickled almost painfully slowly, with a look normally reserved for either a peice of art one was proud of or a half-dozen adorable puppies crammed togethor in a woven basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cahahahthy? Hehehee! Cat?! Turn it up or some-hehehe!-thing, darn it!\" I giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed as if I was the very embodiement of people who were hard to please, and casually flicked a switch without looking away from me. Two slowly rotating, dough-nut shaped peices of fluff on jointed arm emerged from the fabric beneath my feet. These also had been measured, or so it seemed, as the size of the circular peices perfectly matched the curvature of my arches, which they very firmly pressed into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Had I been able to twitch or move at all, I would have lept a meter in the air at the unexpected, heavier feeling! It was shocking how much thet fact that they were rotating, dragging dozens of miniature little brushes forcibly down my foot produced an added ticklign affect. My legs jerked uncontrollably, torso temporailry relegated to the back seat, as now I started  laughing in earnest.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Hahahaha!\" I yelled in pleasure while throwing my head back, feeling the location of every exact little bristle sweeping across my soles. I twisted my legs around in their straps, wiggling my fee and rotating my ankles side to side. My hands grabbed and clenched at the air, waiving in their restraints involuntarily, jerking as maniacally as the rest of my body. From having to touch the ground only rarely in comparison to the other parts of my feet, my arches were a lot softer than the norm - and far more sensitive for it. The waves of tickling pulsed through me gloriously, exciting every nerve, inflaming every perceptual node. Something that, in the quietude of the basement, I was free to give full vent to. \"Ahahahahahahahahahahaha yehehhahahs hahha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 At the edge of my vision - most of the time; my head was shaking about as much as the rest of me - I could see Catherine pull up her chair closer to my big feet. Once she was close enough, she pulled a lever set in the end of the limb restraints. A metal bar, also attached through two small mechanical 'arms, shot upwards, fitting neatly into the groove of my toes, stretching them back and effectively immobilizing my feet even further. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The shock of the fresh onslaught froze me for an instant, before I snapped to, feeling my nerves thrumming with sensation. I felt electrified; if being blasted by lightning could be a positive experience, then I felt that I knew full well what it would feel like. My body was not under my authority; the consciousness, unfeeling, inert machine that held me helpless and merely needed to touch it and it leaped to the tune, playing the endless reflexive game. I felt groggy but alert, restrained but free, not fully aware of my surroundings and yet inhumanly sensitive despite (or because of) it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wasn't aware of it in what I'd typically call a 'conscious' sense, but the feathers spinning on my chest were gone; instead , there were now two other instruments. A pair of rigid, miniature feather dusters pressed lightly onto my nipples, swirling and vibrating. It tickled monstrously, and yet, it was deadly erotic... <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was on the verge of completely silent laughter now, eyes clamped shut and tearing up, heaving in the chair and feeling my strength waning as I tested it again and again. Part of my mind and body was exhausted; it wanted nothing more than peace. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On another level, the tickling, the endless tickling, constantly sought out it's attempts at mental seclusion and dragged it to the foreground, insisting that my body move and move <i>now</i> to stop the sensations flooding rampantly through it. And, at the back, the part of me that was just <i>loving</i> this, the most basic, primal part, even below the instinctual repugnance of tickling, never wanted it to end. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The last two parties were not mutually inclusive; my erotic desires came up against the tickling sensations and they clashed furiously, vying for the position of control in my body, grappling with each other and with the physical tethers that held me.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Both internal, both driven by unceasing external stimuli, both constantly reinforced in their duel, their battle would have no end. The anatomical war raged vibrantly, viciously, meeting on all fronts and rebounding back, fighting like it was trying to escape my body itself. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And still the unaffiliated tickling itself continued relentlessly, giving strength and reinforcement to both sides. My muscles felt like jelly, worn through and through from their unsuccessful bidding at freedom; but the bindings still held. I was reduced to merely lying unanimate and taking it, scarcely able to muster the energy to laugh aloud. I was so damn horny; I wondered if, in the fallout bunkers at the base of my brain, I would literally explode. The spirit and will were in full attendance but the flesh was simply unable; none of my limbs were going anywhere to relieve the mounting urges. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This was getting desperate; perhaps I should call out the safe-word...                      </span></div></div>",

She leaned it back as far as it would go, and she made sure the cushions supporting each of my ankles were spread as wide as the chair would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManeuvering behind me, Katherine commanded, \"Lift your head.\" I quickly obeyed, and my vision was soon enveloped by a thick blindfold. My heart raced, and I tried to brace for the tickles that would surely come. Katherine lazily dragged her nails across my torso as she made her way to the foot of the recliner. Her nails eventually settled on the tops of my feet when she finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to try something different today,\" Katherine explained as she guided her nails up my legs. They were now fluttering around the tops of my knees, occasionally tickling the sides as well as underneath. The tickling was mild, but I still couldn't help myself to stop giggling. Katherine always seemed to know how to change the pace of her attack, constantly changing her timing and technique to keep my brain confused. One thing was becoming clear though, and I think I knew where this particular experiment was headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under normal experimental conditions, the subject would experience sensations all over his ticklish body...\" Katherine began an all-out assault on my helpless form. She squeezed my thighs, prodded my hips, scratched at my belly, and kneaded my ribs and armpits, all in short succession. I busted out into hysterical laughter, unable to control myself. I twisted and pulled at my bonds, but I was no match for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The effectiveness of different methods would also be tested...\" Katherine announced as she planted a raspberry on the side of my belly. Several more followed in various spots, but she eventually honed in on my belly button. Kat knew my belly and belly button were my most ticklish spots. She also knew how raspberries were my absolute favorite kind of torture. After ten or so more raspberries and an adventurous tongue, Katherine stopped the enjoyable torture, and my silent laughter subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you've been an excellent subject thus far. And good subjects get rewarded,\" Katherine whispered in my ear as she gripped my shaft, surprising me. As she slowly handled me, my breathing settled down, and a single gasp escaped my lips. \"But this gift doesn't come without a challenge...\" I could almost sense the grin on Katherine's face as the plumes of that devious feather made contact with the underside of my cock. I giggled in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's today's experiment. I have a timer set for 15 minutes. I'm going to use one feather, and only one feather, to tickle this cock of yours. If you cum before time expires, you're going to be in big trouble. However, should you outlast my methods, you'll win a prize...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts were racing through my head. I really wanted to know what I was fighting for, but I recognized that losing this challenge would be just as enjoyable as winning. Being tickle tortured by Katherine instead of her machines was a rare treat that I looked forward to. Nonetheless, my competitive mindset overruled my submissive thoughts and I became focused on winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept your challenge.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Getting dressed, I couldn't help but think about Phoebe and why she wanted us to be alone. We've always trusted each other with things, and she did act flirtatiously sometimes, but it didn't feel like our relationship was going in that direction. Sure we were good friends, but she never once suggested she was looking for a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I pondered the reason behind Phoebe's private social call, I walked through the house and into the front yard, where my bike was propped up against the side of the house. It was the same red bike I'd been taking around with me for nearly five years, and it got me everywhere I wanted to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride was short, and a few minutes saw me leaning my bike against Phoebe's porch several streets away. Her house was a two floor structure, with many slanted roofs crowning the stony walls. To my right was the tall garage, which I'd seen from time to time and it actually looked a lot cleaner than our own. The porch was a few square meters, with one of those hanging benches on the left beside the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMounting the wooden platform, I got a wiff of the well-grown flowers that were planted in the garden I passed through earlier, along with the earthy smell of dirt and grass. My strapped sandals padded loudly against the porch, and a loud classical <i>ding-dong</i> noise was heard as I pressed the ringer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawn by the doorbell, the sound of bare feet came from the other side of the entrance, stepping quickly. They stopped, and as the door swung inwards I caught sight of Phoebe standing there, smiling warmly at me. Before I could say anything she embraced me, drawing me in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for coming,\" she whispered into my ear, as she rested her head against my shoulder. I was happy to let the moment last a little longer. When she released me, she took my hand and led me inside, me closing the door behind us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sleeveless blue blouse hugged her chest and shoulders, ending just below her ribs and showing off quite a bit of belly. Her shoulder-length brown hair shimmered in the sunlgiht, which was cast through the windows, and smelled like the flowers outside. White booty shorts swayed with her hips, complimenting her nice ass. The hand that pulled me was manicured, her purple nails sharp and filed, and her nice smooth legs led down to two pretty bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat, I'll get us something to drink,\" she told me, leading me to the kitchen counter.  She gestured to one of the stools and walked towards the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed her hand before she could leave. \"It's okay, I'll get it,\" I offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so sweet, but really, it's fine,\" I was reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelinquishing my grasp on her, I sat down and she opened the fridge. After pouring us some juice, she sat down on a stool next to me and explained our options while I sipped at the refreshing liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got everything I need if we're heading out. There's a clearing in the woods I found, secluded and alone. Also there's a nice place by the river where we could picnic. Or if you'd like, we could just stay here.\"</span></div></div>",

It's a great little place... almost like the entrance to some fairy tale world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled, taking my freshly-drained glass to the dish-washer. \"Well, I hope we run across Sleeping Beauty. I gotta tell her to stop hanging with dwarves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe rolled her eyes at my terrible joke, but kept smiling. \"That's Snow White, you dummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehhh you sure?\" I asked, scratching my head as if deep in thought. My friend responded with a playful shove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I have no idea why I put up with you,\" she giggled, moving to the fridge to collect our picnic supplies. I glanced at her upthrust butt as she rumaged, ignoring the hormonal urges that told me to keep staring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe either, I replied in my mind. I was quite curious about this little excursion, due to the fact that Phoebe had never asked to be alone with me before. She had always been somewhat mysterious, but I wasn't one to look a gift horse in the mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she had collected the supplies for our picnic, and we made our way to our bikes. I took one of the bags of food while Phoebe hooked the other onto her bike's handle. \"Ready?\" she asked, brushing her brown hair aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was born ready!\" I growled, adjusting my bike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Phoebe smirked. \"Let's see how fast you can ride, buddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, she peeled down the street towards the forest. Never one to shirk a challenge, I bolted after her, admiring her taut body as she screamed down the street. She looked back with a laughing grin. \"Is that it? You'll never catch me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling at the challenge, I pumped my legs harder, dodging parked cars and trash bins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half-hour of riding, we were deep in the woods, well off of the riding trails. Tired but exhilirated, we emerged into a small clearing. Just as Phoebe had said, it was like something out of a fantasy novel. Almost perfectly circular, trees lined the edges of the strangely short grass. The air was hazy, and an occasional butterfly drifted lazily between the leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty cool, huh?\" Phoebe smiled, her blue blouse damp with sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, breathing heavily. Hopping off of my bike, I set it down near the edge of the clearing. Kneeling down to pick up the picnic bag, Phoebe suddenly yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning on my heels, I looked to see...</span></div></div>",

It had a plunging neckline revealing pinkish skin and amble bosom. Her face was angular, and almost...  elfin? Startled, but mostly curious, I took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she spoke instead, raising a gentle hand. \"I beseech you, young adventurers of the wooded glade. I have need of your talents.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe and I glanced at each other, our eyes narrowed with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I think you may be lost,\" I muttered, trying to figure out if this woman was trying to play a trick on us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, fair child of Adam. I know precisely what realm this is, and precisely whom you are,\" she smiled an aluring but curious smile. \"Your arrival was foretold by the Prophet Xalos, and he has sent me here to ask for your aid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked stupidly. Foretold? Realm? Prophet? Just what was this woman on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe took a step forward herself. I admired how she took charge, thrusting her finger at the woman. \"Lady, we get it. You're some actress at a renaissance fair, and you need some poor saps to come and buy tickets. There's no need for all of this theater stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, smirking at my gorgeous friend. \"Yeah. If we feel like it, we'll check it out later. But now, we're about to have a picnic.\" I paused, dismissing the woman with a gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So thanks, but no thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strangely-clad woman continued to smile, and whispered softly, \"The prophet does not falter in his weavings of fate...\"</span></div></div>",

A purple sparkle overhead finally got our attention though, and both me and Phoebe felt our mouths drop open as the sky above us seemed to have turned a deep dark purple with tiny little lights flickering across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Prophet does not falter!\" the woman cried out as a wind blew up, kicking up dirt and leaves around us as it started to swirl in a tornado pattern. \"Even if I have to take you to our realm myself!\" With that, she raised her arms and lightning shot across the small expanse of sky we were under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a hand grab onto mine and saw Phoebe holding on tightly while looking at me. \"RUN!\" she yelled, and I really didn't need to be told twice as we both tried to make a run for it from the clearing. We proved to be too late however, as the winds whipped against us and prevented us from running too far before tendrils of light came down from the purple mass and pulled me and Phoebe up towards it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was pulled into the purple sky, I could only make out a burst of light and a strong tingling sensation all over my body as Phoebe and I were completely enveloped. I had to shut my eyes as the light turned bright enough to hurt them. I don't know how long we were in the space between time and dimensions, but eventually I felt the wind on my back and opened my eyes just in time to be dropped unceremoniously to the ground. I landed with a grunt onto some thankfully soft grass and took a moment to get my bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, I saw that I was in another forest clearing similar to the one we had just left, although I saw a dusty road in the distance, showing that I was not at home. The trees around me also looked different with plenty of vines hanging down from them, so thick as to obscure the sight of the rest of the forest in the distance. Sitting up with a groan, I saw Phoebe in a similar state in front of me and I let out a sigh of relief that she's OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to my feet, I shakily walked over to Phoebe, still feeling the effects of going through that portal or whatever it was, and helped her to her feet \"Thanks,\" she said, looking as dizzy as I felt. \"You OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" I replied, shaking away the cobwebs. \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been better,\" she said with a grim smile before looking around and giving a shiver. \"This place is giving out one weird feeling,\" she said and I had to agree. There was a tingle in the air that I couldn't quite place, but it left goosebumps on my skin. \"Won't get any answers here I suppose,\" Phoebe said, pulling me from my thoughts. \"Let's see if we can find someone who isn't the crazy witch who sent us here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, I looked for a way to head off. The path was clear but it might lead us directly to the woman who'd brought us here. But we could get lost in the forest if we took that way...

Venturing into the forest seemed like a no-go, considering the odd feeling both of us had about it. Sticking to the path, although possibly leading us to the witch, was still the best plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That woman must have sprayed us with some sort of hallucinogen, or stunned us with a chemical. What we just saw... it wasn't real, was it?\" Phoebe said in a bewildered tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"Beats me. I don't feel hung-over or anything, and it certainly felt real.\" I didn't want to mention the word 'magic', but it was clearly something supernatural. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friend straightened her blue blouse, now covered with grass stains, and pointed to the dusty path. \"Let's just get our bearings. We can worry about that crazy woman once we figure out where we were dumped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, and led the way. The forest was much different than the one we were planning our picnic in. The trees enclosed the edges of the trail tightly, and thick vines weaved through the gaps like curtains. If I didn't know any better, I'd say the plant-life was actively blocking our sight. I didn't mention my thoughts to Phoebe, although I did glance back at her occasionally. Her brown hair was slightly mussed, and her blue eyes looked concerned, but she was still the image of a beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted, I clumsily tripped over a root and landed facefirst in the dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow. Son of a bee!\" I muttered. It was more of an injury to my pride than anything, and Phoebe helped pull me up. Once I was back on my feet, I noticed a sign enveloped in the vines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe noticed it too, and read it aloud: \"Darkmoon Graveyard... Beware.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing my skinned elbow, I repeated the words. \"Beware? Must be private property or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or.. something much worse. I really don't like this place.\" Phoebe hugged her body. \"Maybe this was a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, probably, I thought to myself. But I couldn't show weakness now, despite the fear I was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need answers, Phoebe. We can't just hang out in this forest all day.

After what had already happened today, the last thing me or Phoebe needed was to spend time in a place like that. The trees pulled apart to show that the village was sandwiched between the forest behind us and a river just past the buildings with clear fields after that. Phoebe stepped forward a few times as she sank in the sight before her and then let out a sigh. \"This isn't a hallucination, is it?\" she asked in a resigned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't feel like it,\" I admitted, although I wasn't about to voice all of my fears just yet. Phoebe looked downhearted at this and I wrapped my arm around her shoulders to give her some comfort. \"Look, we'll go ask someone for help. There's bound to be someone who can lend us a hand.\" I gave Phoebe a squeeze for reassurance and she gave a weak smile in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, we'll go ask,\" she said although I could see she wasn't as optimistic as she was trying to be and I honestly couldn't blame her. We walked into the village in silence. It was a collection of several dozen wooden buildings that looked rather picturesque and quite clean, like a postcard you got from a Medieval show or something similar. We soon found the village center, a large space between some of the larger buildings in the village and my eye was drawn to a series of six sets of stocks that were grouped close together. From the looks of the grooves on them and the seats that people sat on while in them, it looked as if they were used on a regular basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing my eyes away from them, I felt Phoebe grasp my arm and point towards a large building. \"Sounds like we'll meet people in there,\" she said as I listened carefully and heard a ruckus coming from the building. A sign hung above the door showing a crown balanced on a feather, pointing towards the place perhaps being a pub or tavern of some kind. Phoebe started to walk towards it but I held out my arm. \"Wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know what we're getting into here,\" I said. \"Maybe we should look around some more and find one person to speak with rather than a huge crowd. We are strangers here after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe looked at the pub longingly before saying \"But that's the only place we know there's people.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The smell of roasted pork and bitter ale hit us as we opened the heavy door to the tavern. It was warm and dry inside the building, probably due to the massive fire nestled against one of the wooden walls. Resembling a medieval long-house, it was oddly cozy inside, with huge log rafters holding the wide roof above the dirt floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I say we take up our weapons and defy the monsters!\" shouted a gruff voice from somewhere inside the structure. Phoebe nudged me, and pointed to a crowd that had gathered at one end of the pub. Apparently no one had noticed our entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would have the demons burn our village to ashes then?\" replied an equally fierce sounding man from the same group. \"It is better to accept our fate, appease the demons, and live in safety. It is a small price to pay.\" Some voices agreed with the statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was clearly a serious debate going on, and from the bewildered look Phoebe gave me, she was as equally confused as to its content. \"Demons?\" I whispered to Phoebe's blank stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is easy for you to say that, Harwald, when it is not your daughters who must be presented to the demons every night! My young ones must take turns being... tormented... by those hideous creatures!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man identified as Harwald responded. \"It is a burden, of no question, Finberg, but there is no harm done. A few hours of harmless sacrifice and the whole village is safe for another night. We would all agree that if the demons accepted one of us elders, we would jump at the chance. But you know that the creatures will only accept a youth for the sacrifice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harmless!\" shouted Finberg, chuckling sarcastically. \"Do not mistake their laughter for mirth, my dear fellow. My daughters are positively exhausted by the dawn, touched and teased as they are by the demons that stalk our woods. Every youth that endures a night in the stocks would agree that it is not mere harmless fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was beginning to piece together the situation in this bizarrely-medieval themed town. But I had a hard time believing what exactly these people meant by 'demons'. Surely it was some sort of Halloween prank? I noticed Phoebe was nodding as we listened in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These people... or actors?... must present their children to some sort of ritual every night. It sounds really...\" Phoebe paused, her eyes lost in deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was hoping she would say 'exciting', but I bit my tongue. I stole a quick glance at her taut stomach, imagining it swaying to some quickly dancing fingers. Was I a bad friend for thinking such devious thoughts? Probably, but I didn't have time to regret it, because that was when the crowd turned to look at us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" I muttered, waving pathetically at the crowd of peasant-folk. Their faces were grimy and their clothes were well-worn, but their eyes seemed to sparkle at our presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the name of Theras the Overking are these two?\" The man named Finberg asked, rubbing his deep-set eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their garb is foreign,\" wondered Harwald, to agreeing voices. \"And quite hideous. Perhaps they are vagrants from the East?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to say 'it takes one to know one', but decided to keep quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we may have solved our little problem, Harwald,\" muttered Finberg, his grime-soaked face scanning us greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe and I shared a quick glance, noticing the crowd rapidly advancing on us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What the hell had just happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of dust and mildew wafted over me, and I realized I was in a very rustic-looking room. The walls were wooden and decorated with items that wouldn't look out of place in a history museum. Apparently, after the villagers cold-cocked me, they were sweet enough to dump me in a straw bed. How nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing off the covers, I staggered to my feet. The room had a single door which had a heavy padlock on it, meaning I was stuck. There was a small round window at the opposite end of the room. Perhaps I could smash it and climb down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the walls for balance, I ventured across the creaky floor and peered out the viewport. The glass was dirty (much like everything and everyone in this hellhole) but I could see that center of the village was below. And to my chagrin, I realized that the stocks were not empty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was locked into the middle stocks, and she squirmed continuously against the bonds. Her hands and head were secured at an even level, and her back and rear-end were protruding from the wooden frame. It certainly wasn't appropriate considering the circumstances, but I couldn't help but admire the view. I quickly dismissed the thought. I had to figure some way to free her before the demons came. On our way into the village, I had noticed that the stocks were extremely well-crafted... they could probably take a lot of punishment. She wouldn't be able to get out on her own, so it was up to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little time to waste, I looked around the room for something to smash the window. I wasn't going to let my good friend be tormented by anything! Unfortunately, I realized that the window was almost directly over Phoebe. If I smashed it, shards of glass would rain down on her... not something I wanted to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was helpless, and dusk was falling quickly. I tried to tap the window to get Phoebe's attention, but she couldn't look up if she wanted to. These sadistic villagers had thought of everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI resigned myself to watch Phoebe, hoping that perhaps this was all just an elaborate prank. However, something happened...</span></div></div>",

The dim torchlights of the village seemed to falter, and shadows began to move amongst the trees. Phoebe, still stuck in the stocks below, froze in her struggles... and she craned her neck to look around. Clearly, she had seen the same movement that I had. Unfortunately, she was in the front row, while I remained in the bleachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rubbed as much of the grime from the window as I could, but it was still too dark to make out any clear shapes. But there was no doubt about it, there were <i>things </i>out there. Things that moved as no human could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn this village,\" I said, cursing my luck. Of all the places to wind up, why did it have to be a medieval village besieged by demons?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to watch the village courtyard, I focused my sight near one of the torches. A small halo of light, about ten yards from Phoebe, seemed to have smallish figures dancing around the edges, as if they were avoiding the light. Suddenly, one of the figures dashed through the light, revealing a greenish blur. I didn't get as good a look as I had hoped but I saw <i>something</i>. It seemed about the size of a small monkey, and hopped and skipped with the same enthusiasm. But when the light reflected its skin, it wasn't furry... it was leathery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a shrill cry from Phoebe, somewhat muffled by the building I was in. She had seen the same thing I had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to watch below as my heartbeat accelerated. Another of the tiny creatures dashed through the light, revealing a bit more of its nature: it was a spindly thing, with a leathery hide and a jagged snout. But my main focus was on its thin tail. Nearly a yard in length, it ended in a pointed prong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" I heard myself say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice from behind startled me. \"And what do you know of hell, outlander?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned on my heels, and a peasant woman stood in the doorway to the room. Her face was serious and calm, but not without a hint of worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those things?\" I shouted at her, with my voice nearly breaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peasant woman answered softly. \"They are the first ones to come. The imps. The weakest and stupiedest of the Dark Horde. They are child-like in their curiosity, and merciless in their fury.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI barely heard the words as I returned to the window. The courtyard was swarming with the creatures, some dancing in the shadows, some openly running through the torchlight, but all were closing in on Phoebe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The imps stopped short and went silent at the sudden wind and slowly started to move away from Phoebe, forming a circle around her. One side had a gap, making room for something else. I went to question the peasant woman behind me about this when I saw a figure coming from out of the darkness, as well as Phoebe ceasing her struggles to peer at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, I thought it was a person coming from out of the darkness. But when they stepped into the light I heard a gasp from behind me. I looked towards the peasant woman, whose face had gone pale. \"A succubus!\" she whispered in horror as I looked back to the figure. My initial impression had been wrong as the figure was certainly not a human. She was tall, standing a full head above an average man. Her skin was a dark blue, almost black, and there was a lot showing as she was wearing little more than a dark leather bikini with shoulder pads, not offering much in the way of modesty, a long dark cape flowing behind her. Jet black hair flowed down her back, and her beautiful face was in a serene expression as she gazed at Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus stepped into the circle of imps and smiled as she looked at Phoebe. Suddenly I was hit with a wave of warmth over my body. I gasped as I felt a tingle in my loins and the peasant woman yanked me back from the window. She must have burst into the room once she realised what was happening down in the village square. \"Don't look directly at her!\" she ordered. \"She's a succubus! Simply looking at her can eventually drive anyone wild with desire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering the warmth I felt all over my body, I had to admit that it seemed entirely plausible, and I turned to look at the woman. \"Who are you anyway?\" I demanded. \"What's going to happen to Phoebe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Celina,\" she replied before peeking over my shoulder. \"And if your friend is lucky, then the worst that shall happen to her this night is hours of laughter and frustration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if she's unlucky?\" I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelina went silent at that and her expression was pained. \"If the tales from the rest of the realm are true, she could very well be taken by the Dark Horde.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way in which she said the last sentence filled me with dread at what could happen to Phoebe if she was left in the stocks. But even if I got out of here, I didn't know what I could do to help her. The imps were dozens in number and it would be difficult getting out of this room without Celina alerting everyone. I looked back through the window and saw the succubus was now standing directly in front of Phoebe, my friend's face having an odd flush on it that indicated she was falling under the power of this demoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's thought, I decided to...</span></div></div>",

Phoebe would be helpless, forced to gaze upon the succubus and all her diabolical beauty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chanced a quick look at the scene below. The succubus was peering over my trapped friend, examining her with cold indifference. I noticed a long slender tail, not unlike that of the imps, dart back and forth from beneath her cape. The dim torchlight impeded my vision, but I could see the voluptuous shape and sensuous curves of the demon even from my vantage point. It was unreal how the mere sight was increasing my blood rate and arousing... other parts of me. If the effect was the same on Phoebe... I shuddered at what she must be experiencing so close to the demonic aura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly felt Celina's strong hands cover my eyes. \"You fool! Don't look upon the creature!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI half-heartedly fought her off, but I knew that I had to look away. \"Fine. But tell me everything! What that thing is, and what's going to happen to my friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" the peasant woman said, removing her hands from my face and sighing. \"It's the least we can do, considering the horrible things we've already done to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was weathered, but held a certain beauty. Green-grey eyes sparkled in the candlelight. \"You see, outlander, the Dark Horde is what you see in our town. Imps, succubi, minotaurs... and other, worse things... they are ravaging our realm, and no one knows their source. All we know is that they first appeared in the eastern swamps, and have spread far and wide in the past months. They do not destroy us, provided we offer them gifts. Gifts such as your young companion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the scene below for a moment, and quickly looked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why can't you fight them? Don't you have soldiers? Or weapons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine smiled a cruel smile. \"Fear runs rampant in these lands. Perhaps it is the work of the Legions of Darkness, but the fact is that no army dares raise a sword against them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought for a moment, remembering the fear in the eyes of Finberg and Harwald. \"But didn't some villagers want to fight? Why can't you organize a militia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fear the men are no warriors. Whoever takes up arms against the demons loses their nerve within moments... it's almost as if they can exude terror into their enemies.\" She looked thoughtful for a moment. \"Perhaps just as the succubus produces her aura of desire, the other demons produce auras of fear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. As ridiculous as it sounded, there was a certain logic to it. What better way to keep your enemies subdued than to keep them cowardly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you have to do something, and I can't leave Phoebe down there!\" I was frustrated with these villagers. Magical aura of fear or no, I had to do SOMETHING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelina spoke gravely. \"It appears that your friend won't be down there for much longer.\" She was peering through the window, with a worrying expression. She motioned for me to look, and I braced myself for the blast of desire from the succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, strangely, the stocks were now empty! Phoebe was nowhere in sight! \"What the hell-?\" I started to say, before Celina pointed to the distant tree line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo figures stood in the dim light, just on the edge of town. One was obviously the succubus, with her great height and well-shaped curves. And the other was Phoebe! She was walking slowly behind the succubus, almost as if in a trance, surrounded by happily-dancing imps. I then noticed the long black rope that hung around Phoebe's neck, being held by the succubus. My friend was apparently now a willing pet of the demoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God,\" I said, as the whole host of demons disappeared into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelina shook her head. \"No gods are here, outlander. Just evil.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I turned around and pushed past Celina, who offered little resistance. I made my way through the open door and down the stairs of the tavern, which appeared to be empty. I guessed that the village people were mostly hiding in their homes rather than face the demoness themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wrenched the door of the tavern open and ran out into the night, finding it surprisingly warm. A tingle was in the air and I felt a shiver go up my spine from the tang that was in the air. It seemed that a trace of tha succbus' power was left behind her. I shook my head to clear the effects and started to run out of the village, heading in the direction I had seen them. I found that the trail was on the same path me and Phoebe had entered the village from only hours ago, although it seemed much longer. I ran down it as fast as I could, the moonlight piercing through the trees to help light my way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too long before the sound of the jibbering imps alerted me to the fact I was on the right track. I stopped running and walked off the path to hide myself. Then I realised I had run after Phoebe with no plan and no aid and no weapons. Suppressing a groan at my own stupidity, I started to slowly walk along the edge of the path, hiding behind the trees and foliage as best I could as I followed the sound of movement in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light of the moon helped illuminate the path ahead of me fairly clearly, and it wasn't long before I saw the imps following behind Phoebe and the succubus. I was relieved to see she was alright, but she walked slowly and without any sign of struggle. The rope was still around her neck and the succubus walked in front of her, swaying her hips seductively even when alone and I wondered if succubi walked like that naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt myself slowly drawn into the demoness' entrancing figure, waves of desire washing over me. The aura effect she had was powerful, and I had to shake my head several times to clear it.

I ducked behind a mossy tree, having nearly tread on the last imp in line as it drew up, and turned my bearings on the various monster's new focus. I had been too busy concealing myself to truly notice, but the terrain had become much wetter and swampier, the strangely grown and shaped trees forcing out the once prominent lunar illumination. Long streamers of moss hung from the trees we passed on the trail, which twisted and wind erratically through the marsh. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A hill loomed before us, it's size or details hidden beneath the carpet of brush and covering of trees. The only outstanding detail in the mossy bank were a set of wooden double doors, without any visible handle, every inch of their worn faces covered in strange symbols. Eyes, chains, tentacles, feathers, claws, stockades- these were the most familiar ones, by a long shot. The majority were indistinguishably, inarguably, alien.          <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Loosening her hold on Phoebe, the demoness sauntered up before the doors, hands waiving slowly through the air. Her delicate fingertips traced slowly over the engraved runes, following paths over the wood whose reasoning I couldn't fathom for the life of me. After a few twitches, a line, cutting perfectly straight down the door, the precision at odds with the liquid organic flow of the glyphs, glowed bright red. Silently, the portal opened outwards, not unlike a bomb shelter or basement door.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come dears, inside and prepare to welcome our guest.\" The succubus commanded to the smaller demons, who cheerfully resumed their insane song and trooped inside, before she flicked her tail in a minute gesture at my friend. Phoebe resumed her corpse-like walk forward, straight for the entrance of the cave. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I hesitated, unsure. The alpha-demon was alone for once, and this might be my last chance to ever accost them before- The succubi put a sculpted arm around the younger girl before leading her under the gaping teeth of the doors, the rims of which flashed red again as she passed. It was now or never, I leapt for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For once on that day and night, I was fortunate. While the darkness and my diverted attention had prevented me from getting a good view of the interior of the lair, I could now see it's front entranceway quite clearly. A smooth rock staircase led down, curving swiftly to the left, where a bright glow, changing intensity from second to second oddly-or odd at least until I considered that I had been used to electrical light until then. This light was probably being produced by a few torches or something. A noise, not all that quiet really, but faltering and indistinct, rose from below, and it seemed most likely that the succubus had taken Phoebe down that way. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As I prepared to sneak down and more closely examine the monster lair that I was in the process of discreetly storming, something caught my eye. Another, smaller door yawned with unpleasant semblance to an infected bodily cavity to the right of the entrance. It was smaller than the main stairwell, which, as I reckoned, sloped too gradually around for me to get a good look at the activity beyond without a good chance at destroying my cover. Maybe I could head down the darker, quieter passageway and scout out the place a bit first? See what else I was up against? But then, Phoebe was almost definitely down there, and I had to save her, now! Okay, then, I would                <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

At first I thought they were about to curbstomp me, but I was surprised when the imps leaped on me and instead of trying to tear out my neck, mercilessly tickled me to the ground. They all jumped in at the same time, some poking at my ribs, some around my waist, some at my underarms, some grabbing my legs, and two more showed surprising dexterity at my feet by untying and ripping off my shoes, and pulling my socks off as well. And right after my feet were lain bare, a handful of imps swarmed over them as well, imps pulled my toes back, almost painfully as dozens of small, but enthusiastic fingers laid siege to my helpless soles. Their nails scratched all over my skin, occasionally they fought over the same spots, and other times they would work together to tickle separate spots at the same time. At this point I was shouting with laughter as I lay in shorts and a t-shirt, being tickled mercilessly, by a horde of hooting and snorting imps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We rarely see a human offer himself willingly,\" the Succubus smiled as the gestured to the imps who stopped their tickling attack and released me. I stood up, rubbing my tingling skin. \"And you do not resemble the humans from that village, what brings you here, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill gasping for air, it took several moments before I could catch my breath and even attempt to reply. \"That's... my friend... you captured,\" I said between pants. It was kind of hard to look at this Succubus in the eye, it was like trying to stare directly at the sun, if you looked for too long, you felt yourself growing dizzy and you had to blink and look away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, and you wished to join her, now is that it?\" She said seductively. \"That can be quite easily arranged...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was a tempting prospect... but I snapped out of it, by biting my lip, the pain jolting me back to reality. I had to save Phoebe. This wasn't the time for this. \"Wait!\" I said. \"What did you do to Phoebe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe? Your friend? I did nothing to her,\" the Succubus insisted, her long fingers on her hips. I pointed at the collar around her neck. \"These dark woods are dangerous for a human girl as pretty as herself, if I had not done that some of my less restrained brethren would have eagerly snatched her up,\" she replied almost indignant of being being accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a Succubus! I totally do not believe that you just had a friendly chat with her and she decided to follow you!\" I said incredulously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I merely asked her if she would like to experience pure joy, and she accepted,\" the Succubus said, she now turned to me. \"Now I ask you the same question. Would you like to experience pure joy?\" She asked sweetly as she walked over to me, my eyes couldn't help but glance at her swaying hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, uh, well, I, um,\" I stuttered incomprehensibly as she sauntered over and placed a soothing hand on my shoulder. It was getting really hard to not look in her face now, and everytime I tried to look away I ended up looking at another enticing spot on her body instead. It was rather like looking like a black hole, you'd just sucked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall take that as a yes then,\" she laughed, before gesturing to Phoebe. \"Perhaps it would be more appealing were your friend being tickled alongside you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI barely was about to get a word in when the imps pounced at me again. In the background I heard Phoebe's high-pitched scream as well. I tried sitting up and going over to save her, but the imps dogpiling me gave me no opportunity to do so.<br>\r\nThe horde of imps brought us together till we both lay there, eagle-spread, but right next to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe! Are you okay?\" I asked, feeling a bit silly immediately after having said that. She had just been captured by a demoness and her imp minions. How okay was she going to be? But thankfully Phoebe wasn't in the mood to mock me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been better,\" she groaned. \"That tall demon makes my head feel funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean...\" I said, as the tall demon in question loomed over the two of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather hear you two laughing than talking,\" she grinned and gestured to her imps. Immediately I heard Phoebe squeal loudly as the imps began wiggling their sharp claws all over her body. She was already barefoot from being in the stocks prior, which just made it even easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now doesn't that feel nice, human? Laugh, you know you want to...\" The Succubus said saucily as a sharp fingernail traced along my underarms before slipping under my shirt and teasing my belly. The tickling was relatively mild, but the demoness' touch was like fire. Every stroke, every touch made me want to explode. From the sound of Phoebe's frantic laughter, she wasn't having an easy time either. I glanced over and saw that the imps were taking turns blowing raspberries on her belly, which judging from her squeals was quite effective. Then the Succubus' roving finger found my bellybutton and I found it awfully hard to concentrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The slow tickling around my belly ended suddenly although I was left giggling for some time afterwards as it left a sensation like tickling usually does only much more concentrated. The after effects of the Succubus' touch also started a fire in my loins that I couldn't shake off. It was another distraction that came from being so close to the Succubus and I couldn't shake off the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill breathing heavily, I looked over to Phoebe to see that the Imps had left her alone and she was recovering in a similar way to me, panting heavily. She turned over to look at me and gave me a reassuring smile which I returned in kind. The situation was by far the best but at least we were together. A tut from the Succubus grabbed our attention as she stood over her bodies with a disapproving expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!\" She said \"This won't do. There's far too many materials on you. Imps, remove most of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Phoebe and I tried to protest this order but the Imps descended upon us before we could even shout out, their sharp claws tugging at our clothes and shredding them to pieces as we were stripped down to our underwear \"Enough!\" The Succubus ordered just before the Imps could take away even those and her eyes glinted evilly \"Some things are all the better for the anticipation. Especially when I'll have these two humans begging for it before too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe and me were bright red at having been stripped down to our underwear and I in particular hoped Phoebe was too embarrassed to notice the tent in my boxers. Although considering we were dealing with a Succubus, it wasn't as if I could help it. I glanced over to Phoebe and saw she was wearing a matching pink bra and panties combo that would have looked rather cute in most other circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, much better.\" The Succubus said as she suddenly reached down and grabbed Phoebe by her shoulders before pulling her to her feet in a swift movement that showed surprising strength. Wrapping an arm around her side so that her hand rests on Phoebe's lower back, the Succubus traced a finger across Phoebe's face to clear away the hair from it as she smiled \"You two are so adorable. Humans like you are always welcomed by the Dark Horde.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Dark H-Horde?\" Phoebe stuttered as she went a deep red all over, being caressed by the Succubus must have been driving her wild and I noticed her breath was coming out in short, sharp gasps punctuated with suppressed sighs as the aura the Succubus gave out had its effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't play coy with me.\" The Succubus giggled as she reached down and started tickling Phoebe's butt. Her fingers lazily brushed against the two cheeks and Phoebe instantly burst into loud giggles. Phoebe's butt was quite plump and the cheeks were pale and very ticklish looking. The long nails of the Succubus traced lines up and down around the edge of her panties, tickling softly over the sensitive area \"Everyone knows of the Dark Horde.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WeheheeehDOOHOoonn'ttaheheeee!!!\" Phoebe giggled as her butt was teased, unable to escape as the Succubus held her tightly as her fingers continued to trace slow lines over her buttocks. Phoebe's body shook constantly from the slow tickling and I couldn't help but enjoy it as the two scantily clad ladies were close to one another, one tormenting the other with soft, gentle tickles. I noticed the soft sighs Phoebe was giving earlier were getting louder and more frequent, her body pushing against the Succubus as the tickling went on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's telling the truth!\" I called out, trying to fight through the arousal that was clouding my mind and help Phoebe \"We were sent here by some weird woman! We have no idea what's going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickling stopped at that and thr Succubus looked at me and Phoebe as the latter was panting heavily and rested her head against the shoulder of the Succubus... was she snuggling with her? My thoughts on that were interrupted as the Succbus said thoughtfully \"So you were sent and not local then? Interesting... I'll have to let the Horde know of this later. After I'm through with you two of course.\" She added and rested her hand on Phoebe's belly, pushing her away slightly so she could look into my friend's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a strong fog come down onto my mind as I looked into the Succubus' eyes and quickly turned away, not wanting to be hypnotised by her but Phoebe wasn't as lucky and was caught full blast from the stare \"Now then... Phoebe wasn't it? How would you like you and your friend to come with me to the lair of the Dark Horde? We can show you such delights and pleasures you never knew existed. And you may even tickle your friend to your heart's content if you so wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I wasn't too unhappy with the last condition, going anywhere with the Succubus seemed like a bad idea. Phoebe stood in silence and I felt my heart pound before...</span></div></div>",

I glared at her, then realized that looking at her wasn't the best idea, and defiantly looked away, grimacing. Instead, I looked at Phoebe. She seemed to be out of it. Then I saw her look up into the Succubus's eyes, the way a puppy looks at its master. And then something changed. Her eyes were the first thing I noticed. They got sharper, but just slightly. I thought this was a good thing, and then she started to talk, clearly and concisely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want him. Whenever you aren't having fun with him, he is to be mine, personally. We will go with you.\" Phoebe said, gesturing to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe!\" I yelled, \"Snap out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snap out of what?\" Phoebe asked, looking me right in the eyes, wearing a smirk and a confident expression. \"I want you. And she will give you to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe, you know just as well as I do that going with this demon woman to all her demon friends who have been kidnapping girls and terrorizing a village isn't going to end well!\" I shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's unfortunate you feel that way,\" the Succubus chimed in, her rich voice filling the air. \"But you have no say in the matter. This is a decision I've entrusted to your friend, and she's made her decision. Now, will you needlessly resist, and require punishment when we arrive, or will you cooperate?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI risked a look at her, and become even more aroused than before. I quickly looked away, turning my head as far away as possible, only to stare right into the face of a snickering imp holding my right arm. It lifted one hand and wiggled its fingers menacingly inches from my armpit, then started laughing again. I shuddered. Struggling would do no good here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Succubus snapped her fingers, and the imps got off of me. Still exhausted from the tickling earlier, I laid still a second, then the Succubus spoke. \"Phoebe, please go help your friend up. And then we'll walk the rest of the way to my lair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe nodded and walked over to me, grabbed my hand and helped me up. She was still smiling. I could tell she was anticipating our arrival.<br>\r\nAs I grabbed hold of her hand and stood up, I decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as I was on my feet, with Phoebe's hand still holding mine, I grabbed her wrist and ran. It was a stupid, last ditch effort. The part that surprised me most about the plan was exactly <i>how</i> it messed up. Phoebe pulled against my grip and tripped me. I twisted as I fell, landing face up. Still stunned from hitting the ground, she then grabbed my arms and pinned them to the ground, sitting on top of them. For a few seconds, all was still. Phoebe's toned legs pinning my arms, my heart pumping from the adrenaline, the scent of her sweat becoming all I could focus on as we looked into eachother's eyes. Her expression had changed from the smirk she'd been wearing. It was now one of intent focus, something one would expect from a lover. Something in that gaze pacified me momentarily. I wasn't struggling to get out, like I should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, everything snapped back to reality. I became acutely aware of my predicament, I started to struggle and wriggle, trying to free my arms from under my friend. <br>\r\nPhoebe leaned in, the tips of her hair falling in my face, and for a second, I could have sworn she was going to kiss me. That brought me pause. In fact, I locked up and stopped struggling again. I was mesmerized by her barely clad body. And that pause was all it took for the imps to pile on me again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eager, are we?\" the Succubus teased. \"Phoebe, your friend is right where you want him. Right where you've wanted him for a long, long time. You may have your way with him when we get to my lair, but in the meantime, why don't you give him a taste of what's to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was beaming at hearing that. I -wait, what?! <br>\r\n\"Phoebe, what does she mean by that?!\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and laugh, I've been wanting to do this -and more- to you for the longest time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, her manicured fingernails started stroking my armpits. I couldn't move an inch in any direction. With her left hand, she started poking at my left armpit, drumming the tips of her fingernails on the soft, ticklish bare flesh. With her right hand, she simply began stroking up and down, torturing my poor hollow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInvoluntarily, I followed her command and began laughing my head off. My body heat began to be too much for me. Phoebe had a dreamy expression on her face, as if she'd been wanting this for years, and finally got it. Based on what's been said, that could very well be the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tickled me for at least 10 minutes straight, alternating her techniques on torturing my hairless armpits. She spider tickled, and stroked and poked them as if she were played a piano. But the worst was when she leaned her head in right by my right armpit and started using her soft, down-like hair as a feather, using the fluff to tantalize my sensitive skin. Mercifully, it ended. I was gasping for air, and sweating all over. But the main thing I could feel was arousal. I was ready to pop from the soft, sensual touches and teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be enough,\" the Succubus said plainly. She ordered the imps off of me again, and asked Phoebe to allow me to get up, and picked me up herself. She kept a hand on the back of my neck, and we started walking again. Finally, we reached the lair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're he~ere\" the Succubus said in a singsong tone. Her touch on my neck was warm, I felt the urge to fall to me knees, I wanted to be touched, but then I snapped out of it when I saw the entrance to the lair. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A red portal shimmered in and out of existence in front of us, and I was unable to see to the other side. I wanted to resist, to run, to do anything but go through that portal. But all that tickling, and the succubus's sensual influence, had left me weak as a kitten. <br>\r\nHer hand on the back of my neck gently urged me forward, and I was the first one pushed through the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of falling through that red maw in the air was like nothing I could describe. It was like I was motionless and moving at light speed at the same time. Like I was being pulled in multiple directions at once. It only took about a minute, but as it did I could feel the succubus's powers strengthening. Either this portal gave her power, or her lair was the font of her strength. It made little difference, as I felt myself being hurled through the other end to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFall onto a very comfortable, soft bed. I shook my head and tried to take in my surroundings. I was sitting on a huge feather bed, which took up half of a large room. This bed could easily fit a dozen people in it without touching each other. It was as if the floor itself was a bed. All over were pillows of different shapes and sizes, and feathers of all varieties seemed to lay across the bed at random. The sight of them all sent a shiver of anticipation through me, as in all likelihood I'd be experiencing their kiss very soon. Sconces with small fires above the bed lit the room, giving the room plenty of warmth. At the far end of the room was a door leading somewhere. Perhaps I could escape before the succubus arrived!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as I thought that, I felt her presence in the room. The succubus suddenly appeared standing at the edge of the giant bed, Phoebe compliantly standing at her side. \"Ah, I see you've already made yourself at home. Wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to bolt from the bed and run towards that door, but I felt something stopping me. I couldn't work up the effort somehow. The bed was so comfortable, it made me want to lie here, to feel soft and warm, to experience her touch on my\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhmhmm, I see you've noticed?\" the succubus said, smirking. \"No mortal has the strength of will to escape my prison. But unlike you mortals, I don't use harsh, cold bars. Oh no, a prison of lust and pleasure and sensation is much more preferable. You will not be able to leave this bed, young one. Not until I am through with you.\" The succubus licked her lips enticingly, and I made myself look away quickly, not wanting to get further entrapped in her spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that was getting more difficult by the moment. She was right, I couldn't leave the bed, no matter how much I screamed at myself internally. It just felt too\u2026 right. Beyond that, I was feeling the warmth in more ways than one. I felt myself flushed with arousal, each glance at the succubus making it worse. And Phoebe's intense stare wasn't making it better, either. She looked like a cat given a mouse to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm\u2026.\" the succubus cooed, enjoying her prize. \"Now what to do first\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Phoebe, I'm going to let you have your way now,\" the succubus declared. Phoebe beamed at the news. She enthusiastically jumped into the floor level bed and started crawling at me, seductively looking into my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, wait a minute...\" I began, only to be interrupted by the succubus.<br>\r\n\"No more waiting. It's time for your friend to get what she's wanted for so long. I've gone through her emotions,\" she began as Phoebe got within a couple of meters of me, her breathing picking up, \"and let me tell you, you've caused this young girl quite a lot of heartache and frustration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my shoulders felt like they were filled with lead, and my arms starting to cramp up -I felt like I needed to spread them out- my captor continued.<br>\r\n\"All those nights she spent moping because she wanted you, but was too afraid of what you would think if she pressed the issue, all those crestfallen sighs she made when you declined her offers to do things with her, and the excitement over what could be when she discovered that you and she have similar... \"interests.\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was now laying on my back, arms stretched above my head, my torso completely exposed. Oddly, my hands started to sink into the bed. I couldn't work up the effort to lift them before they were enveloped, and I was completely at Phoebe's mercy as she straddled me, sitting on my thighs. She stared intently into my eyes. Her mouth curved into a genuine smile. She leaned in, hey forehead resting on mine. My heart started to race, my breathing picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I simply liberated her of her worries. Putting her in control of you has helped her. She has all the qualities of a good dominant woman. Consider yourself lucky. If I weren't so dominant myself, I'd take a turn under her. And without further ado...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe took this as her cue. She closed her eyes, brought her lips to mine and passionately started to kiss me. She parted her lips, but I didn't part mine. As futile as it was at this point, I figured I'd defy to the very end. Besides, if Phoebe wanted to make out with me, she could very well do it without having me pinned and bound. She looked at me as a mistress would a disobedient pet and leaned to whisper in my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're going to play mean, so will I,\" she said, picking up a random feather from the bed. It looked very stiff. She didn't even offer me another chance before she started stroking my horribly ticklish armpits with the feather. With that, my dick, already hard, felt like it was going to explode. Phoebe seemed to pick up on this, and stopped after about a minute. She laid the feather down on my rib cage and, maintaining a knowing smirk, reached behind her back and unclasped her bra. She finished taking it off and I couldn't help but stare at her perky C-cup breasts. She put her hands behind her head and arched her back, pushing her breasts further toward me in a rather exaggerated gesture. Then she leaned in to whisper into my ear again as her hands moved lower, towards my boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In ten minutes, I'm going to kiss you again. If you still don't want my kiss, I'll just tickle your cock until you cum, and then start to really tickle torture you,\" she whispered, as the thought of being tickled post-orgasm made me shudder. \"If you take my kiss, then I'll make you cum in a much... nicer way. Think it over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to weigh the two options as she moved around to pull my boxers down to my calves, but she wasn't planning on letting me think in peace. With her left hand, she kept the armpit stroking up, and with her right, she starting poking at my ribs. Although I wasn't terribly restrained, my body itself was leaden and felt so heavy. It had the same effect as me being strapped to a bondage rack, with no hope of escape. I did the only thing my body would cooperate with me doing: I gently moved my head around as I laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe shortly after abandoned the feather and started using both hands to tickle my ribs, lightly scratching the surface of my skin. Then she moved down to squeeze my sides, getting even more laughter out of me. Then, she moved her hands again to squeeze my inner thighs. I threw my head from side to side as the laughter poured from my mouth. The ten minutes must have come and gone, and then some!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three more minutes!\" Phoebe announced excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. I guess it's only been seven minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since your armpits are your most ticklish spot...\" she started before I groaned as our seldom had tickle fights came back to haunt me, \"I'll try something new to tickle them. Close your eyes! And no peeking or I'll use my hair again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough to keep my eyes closed! I screwed my eyes shut and then they burst open on the sensation of my armpits being poked and prodded at by Phoebe's toes. My eyes teared up as she used her long legs and oddly shapely toes to tickle my helpless armpits. Half an eternity later, she started playing my ribs like a piano again. I was in hysterics. My laughter was silent. Finally, mercifully, it ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was clearly enjoying herself. She once more leaned her head in, very slowly this time, and said, \"Moment of truth.\" Her lips met mine and...</span></div></div>",

Who's in charge of this place?\" I wasn't about to let her depressive attitude stop me from finding Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelina shook her head. \"Finberg and Harwald are the closest things we have to leaders. But you've seen their nature. They already sacrificed your friend to the Horde. They would never go to war on your behalf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was tired of poor answers and inaction. Charging away from the window, I was about to travel to the forest and confront the succubus on my own. But a firm peasant hand grabbed my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, outlander.\" Celina, while still somewhat hesitant, nonetheless seemed to have a change of heart. \"There is a shrine near the old Darkmoon Graveyard. Legend says that a strong... holy... presence is hidden within. In ancient times, it's been used as a place of worship. Perhaps there's something there that can help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it wasn't an army, but it was something, I thought. Nodding at Celina, I turned away. The old graveyard was just outside of town. I vaguely remembered how to get there, and I would have to hurry. If Phoebe had truly been seduced by the succubus, the longer I took to free her, the harder it would be to break the spell. This shrine was the last best hope I had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way down the stairs into the hall of the now-deserted pub. A faint smell of spit-roasted pork hung in the air. It enraged me to think that these peasants had enjoyed a fine meal while my friend had been taken by demons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing my rage to hurry my pace, I left the pub and headed towards the graveyard...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The graveyard was far eerier than anything I was expecting. With the threat of demons lurking in the shadows, and nothing but simple moonlight to guide my path, I emerged into the massive cemetery with a small inkling of where to look. Apparently, I was looking for some sort of holy shrine. I assumed there was some sort of statue of an angel or something, but all I could see were endless rows of weather-beaten headstones. Vines and weeds had overtaken much of the stonework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering through the sinister-looking graveyard was causing my blood to run cold. Just as I was about to turn tail and return to the village, I spotted a figure in the distance. Half-covered in dark vines, I could barely pick out the features in the dim light. But I realized that the figure was a statue, overlooking a rather curious altar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust looking at the statue set my mind at ease... as if it were emitting some sort of calming aura. I approached carefully, and noticed that the likeness was a woman. The stonework was practically enveloped in vines and plants, as if trapping the statue. I reached out a hand to begin removing some of the plant material...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shock went through to my very bones! But it wasn't like static electricity, it was more like a shock of images and sounds and thoughts. My brain was overwhelmed with memories (or was it visions of the future?) of a lost time and lost souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI staggered back from the statue, and tried to sort the images into sense...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Strangely enough, the vision seemed to be of Phoebe... as if it were a scrapbook assembled from various points in time. The first image appeared to be of Phoebe back in middle school. I remembered that she always been a looker, and that she was the most popular kid in school. I thought it was odd how she had always hung out with me, even when the other girls would mock me for my short stature or nerdish physique. Images of Phoebe playing games with me and consoling me brought back some raw emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut those early visions were muddied. Vivid images of my friend flashed before me again, and they sent a chill down my spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was again with the Succubus, trailing her, surrounded by a gaggle of yipping imps. I realized that this vision was from mere moments ago. The Succubus, in all of her demonic voluptuousness, was happily guiding my friend through the bramble and undergrowth. The rope was still around Phoebe's neck, and a gentle tug from the demoness urged her to continue. It was clear that my friend was dazed... an imp would occasionally jump to probe Phoebe's bare legs, resulting in her yelping with a giggle. The Succubus would scold the little imp, only for another of the nasty little creatures to do the same moments later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if fast-forwarding a DVD, the images suddenly changed, and no longer was Phoebe in the forest. Instead, she was within a ghastly demonic harem of sorts. Demons, both Succubus and Minotaur, and other indescribable creatures were wandering around, chatting, laughing and doing all sorts of demonic things. Human women, captured villagers mostly, were dressed as harem slaves, and were walking between the demons, giving food and drink, or merely kneeling as pets to their various demon owners. Phoebe, dressed in a barely-there chain bikini, lay at the feet of the Succubus, oblivious to the goings-on around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear to me that this vision was not set in stone. While it seemed real enough, some strange voice whispered that I could change it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept my hand on the statue...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The visions continued, but grew more vivid and alive. I don't know if it was because of my strong emotional connection to Phoebe, or simply a factor of the time I was spending touching the statue, but it seemed as though I could almost feel and smell the scenes. Strangely enough, I felt my heartbeat fall in synch with Phoebe's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harem was grostesquely ornate, with red draped curtains and crimson-colored walls lining the room. A sinister orange glow emanated from somewhere unseen, highlighting everything with a hellish light. Definitely something a demon would appreciate. Interestingly, there were metal rings and chains dangling in strategic locations... presumably to restrain the various slaves that would brought in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI detected a faint smell of sulfur mixed with perfume. The demons themselves were a mixed bunch. Most were humanoid, although there were a couple of strange blobs and eyeballs floating about that seemed to be taking part. Succubi and Minotaurs seemed have the most numbers, with imps and gremlins joined among them. I had to say, for a bunch of creatures from hell, they sure seemed to appreciate their diversity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of the human slaves, there were probably fifteen or so. They were all quite beautiful and young, dressed in mostly skimpy (but richly detailed) clothing. It seemed like half of them were owned by individual demons, while the rest appeared to be servers. The ones owned by demons were dressed according to their master's tastes. The Succubi preferred their slaves in jewelry and metal, with intricate runes embedded with gems and gold. The Minotaurs seemed less concerned with 'fancy' stuff, and their slaves were dressed in simple leather, with various straps and buckles over their mostly bare bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe, since her mistress was a succubus, was dressed in a very scandalous outfit. Her taut body was accentuated by the silver metal bra that hugged tightly to her skin. It was designed with a spiral-like shape and studded with rubies and sapphires, and a veil of chainmail dangled from beneath her pushed-up breasts. She had a matching set of metal bikini briefs that left very little to the imagination. Her hair was braided into a tight, high-sitting ponytail. Miscellanous bracelets and necklaces pressed against her soft skin. As selfish as it was, I was entranced by the exposed body of my captured friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe was half-sprawled at the feet of the succubus, while her mistress was conversing with a minotaur and a floating eyeball. The minotaur, a grey-black beast standing at least 8 feet high, had a slave of his own: a blonde-haired villager. Thicker and more voluptuous than Phoebe, she was wearing leather straps at strategic positions on her tanned body. It seemed the minotaur didn't quite trust his slave, as the blonde villager had a leather leash tied around her neck. Phoebe had no such restraint. Perhaps the Succubus's powers of seduction made it pointless?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, I couldn't quite hear what the demons were discussing. I wondered if I could push myself deeper into the vision, and perhaps experience it from Phoebe's perspective? It might give me some clue as to where to look for her...</span></div></div>",

The villagers around us nodded in agreement and murmured their assent, that we would be the ones to go out and hunt for the witch and her demon band. I wondered about protesting but realised that doing that would only make things worse. \"Where in the forest? We're not exactly local you know and it looked like a pretty big place to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever hope I had in thinking that protest would quash their demands died once a man behind the bar of the tavern pulled a piece of paper from underneath the wooden platform and passed it over to Finberg. The tall man walked over to us and opened the paper up, showing it to be a map of the village and surrounding area. \"This here is where we think the witch's lair is.\" Finberg said, pointing his finger down to a very large area circled on the map some miles north to the village. \"Three young ladies of the village strayed there just before the witch made her demands. Two of them were captured and haven't been seen since,\" he said bitterly. \"The last managed to give us the location but fear for our lives has stayed our hands. If you find the lair and come back to report its location, then we can think about launching an assault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was risky to say the least. Phoebe grabbed a hold of the map and looked at it, her lips pursing in thought. \"Not a lot to go on here,\" she said with a hint of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all we have lass,\" Finberg retorted. \"You think we'd be sitting here chatting if we already knew where the lair was? Now unless you want to be out on those stocks tonight, and every night, instead of our own, you best get searching. And don't think running away will do you any good either. The witch has familiars that can, and will, track you down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely,\" I muttered darkly as Phoebe rolled up the map and placed it into her pocket. I had to admire her more than ever at this point. She looked ready to brave danger, and I wasn't going to let her down. \"I don't suppose you have any weapons or armour to help defend ourselves?\" I asked, wanting some sort of protection at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villagers glanced around at each other, silence reigning for a moment before Finberg turned back to us and replied...</span></div></div>",

The man then looked back at Phoebe and me, standing close to the bar at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me.\" He grunted out, then came out from behind the bar and started walking toward the back of the inn to a small, unsuspecting wooden door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened to revel a stone staircase, likely to the cellar, I mused in my head. As the man descended the stairs, I followed after him. Phoebe held on to my arm as we went down into the darkness, partly for reassurance, and partly for balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until we had been walking for more than a minute that I started to realize this \"cellar\" was much, much deeper than I first imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after what felt like hours, we finally reached the bottom of the stairs, which ended as a narrow tunnel. As we followed Finberg and his torch, I saw the passage way open up to what appeared like a massive natural cave. The room was cool, being deep into the ground, far from the sun's warmth. But beyond the chill, there seemed to be a sort of energy, almost like a static sensation which made my hairs stand on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinberg stuck the torch into a sconce that had been put in the wall, likely long ago judging from the rust that the metal had on it. The cave itself was surprisingly light, albeit dimly lit by softly illuminated green stones that sat in various positions in the walls of the cave. It wasn't until I looked up and saw a massive collection of the green stones in the middle of the ceiling, soft of reminiscent of a dim green sun, which provided most of the light in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinberg, while seeming somewhat apprehensive, perhaps feeling the same strange energy in the room, continued to walk further into the room, where in the middle sat a large stone. This upon closer inspection, turned out to be a large gray chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...\" Finberg began to say, after stopping before the chest. \"This is a treasure from my great grandfather's time. He was told by a prophet about an ancient prophecy that when an adventurer from a faraway land arrived in our town. That his would be that adventurer's great weapon and that with it, he would save us from the terrible darkness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinberg turned to us, before slowly opening the lid to the chest and sitting inside the chest I saw...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting inside the chest was an old leather-bound book, which would have looked normal if it weren't for a slight, almost imperceptive shimmer to it. On the cover the title of the book was etched into the leather. The cover read \"Gargalesis Compendium\", which was not a very reassuring title, but at the same time made me quite curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached down and picked up the book. The first thing I noticed was the leather book felt light, almost like a feather. The second was the strange feeling I felt when I entered the room, seemed to amplify tenfold, almost as if electricity were running through my body. Whatever this book was, it was powerful and more than likely dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the most holy...\" I heard Finberg mumble to himself, taking a step back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the strange feeling also grew in perceptibly considering when I looked up, Finberg stared at me with wide eyes, and Phoebe looked at me with a mixture surprise and confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I held the book, I began to feel a new sensation in my head, almost a tickling feeling. It started off almost imperceptible, but then all of a sudden hit me like a truck. All at once, I feel the room spin and turn black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up with a slight headache, moaning as I tried to move. Slowly I managed to open my eyes partially and somewhat prop myself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where.. where am I?\" I groaned out weakly into what seemed to be common room of the inn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back to the living, son.\" I heard a familiar grunt say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinberg walked over and helped me sit up against the wooden wall of the inn. Looking around I saw a few of the patrons from earlier looking at me. In fact there seemed to be more people than before I went into the cavern. Apparently whatever happened, word had got around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What happened down there...?\" I crocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Finberg to laugh a bit and rub the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping you could tell me lad.\" He said before continuing. \"One minute you were standing there with the book, next thing I know, you fell over, then a bright light started coming out of it, then the book seemed to, well... enter you body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Entered my...\"  I started to say, partially in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I started to think about the book, suddenly I could see it. Somehow it was in my head, or more accurately the knowledge from the book was somehow absorbed into my brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that moment when I realized what the feeling in the cave was, what was now in my head. Magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more I though about the book, the more things started to change. The world still looked the same, but at the same time, I could see things differently if I focused. I could see the people standing in front of me, but I could also see what made them up, their energy so to speak.I also felt that I could do things, a great tide of power was inside me and all around me, but it was shapeless, formless, a lot like water. This was only the beginning, I had only started to come into whatever weird powers I had acquired, the possibilities were endless! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I got too far into that line of thought, something struck me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoebe!\" I exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was Phoebe?

Try to flee and it shall only end with you being caught. Help us, and we shall in turn help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're doing such a great job of helping yourselves so far.\" Phoebe shot back before turning around and practically marching back to the forest. I looked back to the villagers and decided not to stick around as I quickly followed Phoebe. I felt the crowd's eyes stick with us as we reached the edge of the forest and it wasn't until we were swallowed up by the three that I knew no one was watching... overtly anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were alone, Phoebe slowed down her walk until she was dragging her feet \"Some day with you this turned out to be.\" She muttered sadly \"I didn't think this would happen. I didn't... I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprised to see Phoebe, normally so strong, act like this and I quickly put an arm around her shoulder \"It's not your fault.\" I insisted \"We're going to get through this and we'll get back home, I promise you.\" I gave her an affectionate squeeze with my arm and she gave a soft smile in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of just standing together in silence, Phoebe patted my hand \"Thank you.\" She said before looking around the trees and giving out a sigh \"I hope we get out of this soon. This place is giving me the creeps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere around us was oppressive and there was a tingle in the air that felt unnatural. Might have been because we weren't from this realm but I got the impression there was something else at work here. It was then that I decided to go for broke \"Why not just leave? They said we'd be hunted down but that could have just been them trying to scare us into doing their dirty work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe considered this and we both weighed the options. Certainly had no reason to believe the villagers and running away might give us time to come up with another way to get out of here.

Phoebe was a good friend despite being so new to me, and it didn't hurt that she was incredibly hot - and wearing clothes to make sure I couldn't ignore the fact. Rump hugged by a pair of tight booty shorts with no legs at all, a sleeveless blouse with only a single button done across her chest and ending a good few inches above her navel. She had mastered the art of teasing without moving a muscle. \"Whichever one you want, Phebe,\" I said. \"I'm not too picky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, <i>be</i> picky,\" she pouted, crossing her arms in front of her. They crossed right underneath her breasts, and I could have sworn she were lifting them slightly... \"I've been trying to decide for the last ten minutes before you arrived, and I'm feeling indecisive today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, what makes you think I can decide in ten seconds? You choose.\" I replied, knowing where this quibble would lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you.\" Her smile was beginning to fade, a look of frustration crossing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh, you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" With a loud stamp of her foot, she pushed her hands down onto her hips and thrust her chest out. \"Why do you always have to do that! Stop being stubborn and choose!\" Blood rushed to her cheeks as the cutest frown creased her brow, and her lips went into a pout that belong to a six year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're adorable, you know that?\" Suddenly realizing that she'd done exactly what I'd expected, she swatted my arm and fumed even more. Eventually she calmed down though, blushing and smiling as I continued to chuckle. Placating her with gestures, I offered an olive branch. \"Let's head to the river. Getting to see you in a swimsuit is always a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe giggled and nodded, getting over her embarrassment real quick. \"Let's go get ready then!\" she exclaimed giddily, taking me by the hand and leading me up to her room. I sat on her bed and watched as she bent over (was I imagining that her butt was swaying?) and rummaged through her drawers. After a surprisingly long time, she selected and pulling out a bikini to wear and a large t-shirt to cover it with. Standing up, she bounced over to her restroom and ducked behind the door, turning back toward me and winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No peeping now!\" she giggled, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd changed and come out, I foraged for some food and water while she gathered some towels a picnic blanket. The spot Phoebe had in mind was a bit of a distance away; it was too far to walk, so we hopped in her car and began driving over. We made small talk as she drove toward the edge of town, where the woods were.</span></div></div>",

She seemed a bit more tickly than normal, and it wasn't as if my fascination with it was a secret. In fact, it was probably the most well known factoids about me. Meanwhile, I had no idea where she stood on the subject. She wasn't totally adverse to it, as she had just shown, but it had somehow never been talked about, and I had never had much opportunity to even figure out how ticklish she even was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDowning my juice quickly, I slipped off my sandals in the corner with the others shoes before walking into the living room, and plopping myself back down on her couch, still wondering on where Phoebe stood on tickling. Most likely, she was a casual enjoyer it. Enjoying dishing out or receiving brief tickles that last a few seconds, and even the occasional tickle fight. Of course, now that I thought about it, she seemed to avoid the subject. While we had never discussed it, she had been witness to me talking about it with other people, and never commented. Sometimes, she even changed the subject. This made me briefly consider the possibility that maybe she hated it. I dismissed the thought quickly. I had tickled her in the past, and she definitely didn't hate it. Of course, there was another possibility, a wonderful possibility, as to why she would avoid it. She could actually love it like I did. People often hid their fascination with tickling for fear of being judged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I was broken out of my thoughts by manicured nails skittering across my soles, causing me to let out a quiet, but quite unmasculine shriek. \"Well. That was certainly amusing.\" Phoebe snickered. \"What were you thinking about that distracted you that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat your stance on tickling is? I don't think so. \"My surprise of course. I'm curious as to what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled warmly at me. \"Patience. You'll find out soon enough. Anyway, I brought down a couple things that we could do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, shoot.\" She pulled over a box and a movie case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first thing we could do is watch this movie. Don't worry, it's not a chick flick. At least, I don't think it is. It's called 'Your Adventure In Ancient Greece'\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a documentary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right? Supposedly it's a really good adventure movie though. The second thing we could do is play this weird board game that I found at a garage sale. 'Pero Veselo'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cocked my head. \"Is that Russian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck if I know. So what's it gonna be?\"</span></div></div>",

However, we didn't know the rules of how to play, and if it wasn't an American game, then the instructions might not be in English. Which means we'd have to look them up, which could take awhile. Not including however long the game wore on. Plus, watching a movie meant sitting on the couch. Close enough for some intimacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's watch the movie Pheobe. This 'adventure movie' piques my interest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't lie. You just want to be lazy and lie on the couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned over and tickled her ribs for that, earning a very satisfying squeal as she fell back to get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you set up the movie. I'll go get us some soda, and popcorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into the kitchen, and put the popcorn in the microwave, before getting a big metal bowl to share from. While it was popping, I walked over to the counter, and as subtly as I could looked over toward Pheobe. As she was messing with the DVD player, he butt was sticking up a bit, and swaying slightly, while her feet we positioned, so I had full of the stretched out soles. I knew she hadn't seen me, but I couldn't help but feeling that both these things were for my benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to stand up as the popcorn stopped, so I stepped away from the counter, put the popcorn into the metal bowl, grabbed two sodas, and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to start the movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You betcha. Popcorn smells good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, we plopped down on the couch, put the sodas &amp; popcorn on the ground so we could reach them easily, and hit play.

I woke up to a shocking realization. \u201cPhoebe,\u201d I announced. \u201cWe\u2019re in a prison cell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Phoebe asked as she opened her eyes. \u201cWait! We\u2019re in prison! How did we get here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I responded, surveying the cell and finding that it appeared to be from an ancient time. \u201cThe movie must have drawn us in here. This must be our \u2018Adventure in Ancient Greece\u2019; I can tell that this prison isn\u2019t modern.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the movie actually took us to ancient Greece?\u201d Phoebe wondered. \u201cThat\u2019s strange.\u201d The two of us observed our situation, trying to get our bearings in this new place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we had come to terms with our new situation, Phoebe and I looked down at ourselves to see what had happened to our clothes. Our outfits had somehow been changed so that we were both wearing a cheap linen that covered our upper bodies, but exposed a shoulder and armpit. In addition, we each had another linen that began at the hips and went down to our ankles, but we were both barefoot. We looked over each other and then I proclaimed, \u201cPhoebe, we should probably try to get out of here. Prison doesn\u2019t sound like much of an adventure to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d Phoebe admitted. We started tearing apart the cell, and Phoebe found what appeared to be a metal shovel hidden under her bed. \u201cHey! I found something that we might be able to dig our way out with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d I stated. I checked under my bed, finding another shovel-like tool. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d We both started digging near the back wall of our cell, and about fifteen minutes later,</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, I felt myself being pulled up, and I dropped my shovel. I turned around to see a guard, probably about twenty years old, holding me. Before I could try to get away, he pushed me to the ground and shackled my arms and legs together. I looked up and saw that another guard was restraining Phoebe. All at once, \u201cWe are taking them to the head guard.\u201d I felt myself being pulled up, and the two guards slowly marched Phoebe and I outside of our cell to another guard, this one probably around thirty years old. \u201cWe caught these two trying to escape. What should we do with them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave Ladies Fern and Missy torture them,\u201d the head guard ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, sir,\u201d my guard confirmed. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Right after this, we were both taken to a different room, which had two tables with chains on them. I was pushed onto a table face up, and my wrist chains were undone, but before I could try to take down the guard, he locked my wrists to the chains on the table. In addition, my ankles were put in the table\u2019s chains, and my top linen was pulled up to expose my stomach. I glanced at Phoebe, seeing that she was also tied on her back to the other table with her midriff exposed. Before long, two women dressed like you had been entered the room, each holding many feathers in their hands. \u201cLadies Fern and Missy, they are all yours. Let us know if you need anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we will be fine for now,\u201d one of the women announced. \u201cYou may head outside the room. We will let you know if we require your assistance.\u201d The guards departed, and one woman came up to each of us, with the one that had spoken coming up to me. \u201cI am Lady Missy, and I will be your torturer for today. Are you from here? You look like foreign spies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we are not from here,\u201d you proclaim nervously. \u201cThis was supposed to be our \u2018Adventure in Ancient Greece\u2019, but for some reason we got put in prison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have heard about an \u2018Adventure in Ancient Greece\u2019 before,\u201d Lady Missy declares, seeming to know something about the movie. \u201cI suppose you are actually from the future and got here through a movie. Am I correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you affirm, wondering how she knows this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then the two of you are in the right place,\u201d Lady Missy surprises you with this. \u201cThe movie is an interactive journey, and we are your guides. This will take up a couple hours back in your time, but in here, the typical journey is a few days, although some people take much longer. In the adventure, we show you all of the aspects of ancient Greece, and you begin at the bottom of the ladder in a Greek prison. Most of the adventurers try to escape, and while some succeed, most of them are captured. Naturally, a long torture is the punishment for an attempted escape, but we do not believe in harmful torture. Once we finish with you, we will take you out of the prison to continue your adventure. However, if you ever break a law, you will be brought back to the prison, and your journey will restart with more torture. This has led to some people being in here for months before they return to modern times. Do you understand?\u201d Phoebe and you both nod your heads, although you are still a little confused at why you began your journey in a prison cell. \u201cGood! Let\u2019s commence your torture now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can think about what kind of torture would be harmless, Lady Missy scribbles her nails over your bare feet. Lady Fern copies her partner\u2019s movements on Phoebe. \u201cHAHAHA!\u201d Phoebe and you react to the sudden tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, good, you\u2019re both really ticklish,\u201d Lady Fern comments as you two are tickled. \u201cThat means we can prolong the torture session.\u201d Both of the women continue to run their nails over your sensitive soles, and you try to get out of the chains, but they are too tight. After five minutes, your ticklers cease your tickling and\u2026</span></div></div>",

Looking over to Phoebe, I saw that she was going through the exact same torture, and we both struggled to get away from our ticklers. The nails continued to dance over my stomach rapidly, and I increased my futile efforts to get free. As my torment continued, Lady Missy explored all over my midriff, putting in extra time on spots where I burst out in squeals. \u201cPLEHEHEHESE STAHAHAP! IHIHIHITS TOHOHOHO MUHUHUCH!\u201d Our pleas fell on deaf ears, as our ticklish tummies were exploited by Lady Missy and Lady Fern. Eventually, I felt more and more of Lady Missy\u2019s fingers focusing in on my most ticklish spot, my bare bellybutton. I took another glance at Phoebe and noticed that Lady Fern was focusing her ticklish torture on Phoebe\u2019s exposed sides. In a desperate attempt to escape, I thrashed side to side, but it was ultimately useless, as the chains held me fast to the table. Lady Missy continued to keep her nails in my navel through my thrashing, and I resorted to begging for mercy. \u201cMEHEHERCY! NOHOHOHOHO MOHOHORE! PLEHEHEHEHESE STAHAHAHAP!\u201d Nevertheless, not even this could convince our ticklers to even let up a little bit on our torment. As the tickle torture went on, my squirming died down as I could only focus on laughing. Lady Missy began wriggling her nails all over my midriff after I stopped struggling, but even this was too much for me to handle. Following ten more minutes, the tickling focused down to my bare bellybutton again, and I was reduced to hysterical laughter. This second navel tickle torture continued for about thirty minutes before Lady Missy and Lady Fern\u2026</span></div></div>",

Willing away the hard-on I was getting imagining dancing my fingers across her soles to the sound of her frantic laughter. I tore my gaze away to look at her face, graced with a small smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, would you mind giving me a foot massage during the movie? I've been on my feet all day, and they're kind of sore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really hoped she didn't feel the twitch in my pants as she asked that. \"S-sure. I'd be glad to help.\" I said as I reached down and started to lightly massage her feet, trying not to think about how soft they felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! But be careful.\" I knew what she was about to say, and I couldn't believe my luck.  \"My feet are REALLY ticklish, and we wouldn't want my laughter to drown out the movie, now would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't even bother to try and tell myself that she didn't feel the rise beneath her feet, as I privately mused that an afternoon tickling her feet would be so much more enjoyable than a movie, and that her laughter would be a better sound than whatever the characters were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, I ignored the insistent voice in my head telling me to make her scream with laughter, and started massaging her feet. She groaned with delight at that, but occasionally let loose a tiny giggle, and we continued on like that for awhile.  Watching the movie, me rubbing her feet, and struggling to not tickle her every time I heard one of her musical giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, about 45 minutes into the movie, she chimes in with \"You know, I suppose a little tickling wouldn't distract us too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled at me as I looked over at her, my face a mixture of surprise and delight, which I promptly paid her back for by making her let loose a small squeal as I gently scraped my nails across her arches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie played, we only half paid attention, both of us more interested in the tickling she was g4tting. I lightly danced my fingers across her feet, occasionally throwing in a scrape of the nails or gently pinching one of her toes. All the while, she couldn't stop giggling. She tried to suppress it by putting her hands to her mouth, which completely failed whenever I was rewarded with one of her cute squeals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, when there was only about 20 minutes left in the movie, I totally stopped paying attention to the movie, and started chaotically wiggling my fingers all across her feet. An action that rewarded me with a loud, unsuppressed laugh that had my heart singing and my erection growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last 20 minutes, neither of us were paying attention to the movie at all, and neither of us cared, as we got caught up in the wild tickling I was giving her feet. She laughed loudly and frantically, and thrashed wildly, trying to get away. All it accomplished was forcing me to trap her feet in a headlock, which made things even worse for her as now she couldn't get away or even wiggle her feet as much. Allowing me to tease and torment her feet to my heart's content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, having tickled her feet for the better half of 2 hours, I started moving upwards, spider my fingers behind her legs, squeezing her hips. She was hysterical. When I started digging into her exposed midriff, she attempted to stop me by reaching down and grabbing my wrists, which I quickly turned around, by taking advantage of her giggly state and pinning her arms above her head with one hand, resting the other one on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave her a moment or two to catch her breath, after which she looked up at me, her eyes sparkling, a mile wide grin on her face. \"That was amazing!\" She said breathless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" I responded, matching her grin with one of my own. A moment passed between us, just staring at each other, before I continued with \"What about this?\" and l leaned my head down and...</span></div></div>",

It's pink and flowery, with a soft queen bed in the middle. Perfect for a friendly tickle-off.

It's practically a battleground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo busy looking over her room, which you havent been in in a long time, Phoebe sneaks a playful poke into your armpit, causing you to elicit an unmanly squeak.

Unfortunately, she often concealed her good looks with long bangs and heavy sweaters. I was the only one in class to see her true beauty; both on the outside and in her heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in recent months she had become far more anti-social than normal. While in the past we often walked to school together, lately she had been avoiding me... leaving for school at random times and cancelling our tutoring sessions. I was growing increasingly worried, and was preparing to confront her after school was over for the summer. But before I got the chance, she had appeared at my front door with a single message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet me at my house on the first day of summer break. Don't tell your parents or your sister.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to ask what was going on, but Maddie bolted before I could speak a word. She had certainly peaked my curiosity with her bizarre behavior. I only hoped that it wasn't anything serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the day of our meeting was here. I slapped on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt, scarfed some cereal, and told my Mom I would be gone for the day. She merely nodded, and went back to whatever motherly task she had been working on. And since Maddie lived next door, she was merely yards away if I needed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving out the backyard door, I sauntered over to the fence dividing our properties. With practiced ease, I scaled it and hopped onto Maddie's lawn. Approaching her patio door, I noticed it was slightly ajar. I assumed it was Maddie's way of saying, 'Welcome'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFully opening the sliding glass door, I entered into the cool air of Maddie's family room. I suspected that her family was more or less in the same financial position as my own as we shared similiar furniture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Maddie?\" I called out. \"You here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA response came echoing from the basement. \"Come down here. Hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a strange urgency in her voice, so I half-walked, half-ran to the basement stairwell. Racing down into the damp cold of the half-finished cellar, I spotted Maddie sitting among a stack of cardboard boxes. Before I had even taken a step, she said...</span></div></div>",

I mean, kidnapping? Really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaddie, that\u2019s ridiculous. Your parents are some of the nicest people I know. And I can\u2019t imagine my parents being involved in anything illegal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how it sounds. And before I found this book, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took another look at the old book Maddie was holding. It had worn edges and a faded cover. She opened it up to show me its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis shows how their operation works. A client contacts them with a job. Then both of our fathers pick up the victim using any means necessary; deception, coercion, even force. Then they take the victim to one of their holding facilities where they keep them for as long as the client wants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI read a page containing a list of holding facilities and the people charged with running them.  I was in shock as I read the list of people who ran the nearest facility; it included Maddie\u2019s mother, as well as my own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, this all seems a little unreal.\u201d I said. \u201cHow do you know this isn\u2019t just some piece of fiction?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie seemed to get upset. \u201cLook, I called you over here because I thought you could help me. If it is true, then we need to expose it to the world. There are innocent people being imprisoned against their will!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like she might start to cry. I didn\u2019t want to upset her, but she was kind of putting me on the spot. Ultimately, I decided it wouldn\u2019t be fair to string her along, so I had to make a decision.</span></div></div>",

The way these boxes are set up, they could fall down and hurt you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Uh...

I should have got rid of that when I finished that exercise the FBI.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what now?\" I asked stupidly, Maddie and me sharing a glance before looking back to the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, a few years back, the FBI contacted me and your father to work over an idea for them, an investigation into how kidnapping procedures could be run. It was basically how a business like mine could be a front for kidnapping or smuggling on some level. It took a few months and I wasn't supposed to tell anyone that I didn't need to. I kinda just hid that book in here and forgot about it when it was all over a few months back.\" He looked at us keenly and noticed our expressions \"No... You didn't think it was real, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt our silence, Maddie's parents burst into laughter, only furthering our embarrassment. Maddie pushed her face into her hands and let out a series of whimpers from how she'd been suckered completely accidentally. I too went bright red as the laughter went on and put a hand on Maddie's shoulder as a reminder she wasn't alone in the air of humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of hilarity, Maddie's parents calmed down and her father shook his head \"You two really are high strung, aren't you?\" He asked, still chuckling \"Come on, get out of there. If you'd like to go young man, I just need to tell me daughter not to worry about her parents' business ventures and to keep out of places I've told her to avoid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a general feeling of relief, me and Maddie stepped out of the basement and I bid her a quick goodbye as she waved back a little miserably. She's probably be in hot water for this but at least her parents had taken it in good humour. I walked out of the house as I was somewhat relieved that that particular adventure had come to naught but stopped walking when I reached the end of Maddie's road and a black car whizzed past me. It turned the corner and sped away towards Maddie's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned in thought and wondered just what was up with the car. It seemed a bit odd that it would come up now of all times and the speed it was going at put me on edge.

A speeding black car, with tinted windows, and obscured, out-of-state license plates? Heading right to Maddie's house? It seemed a bit too convenient for my liking. While I wasn't really looking forward to getting humiliated by Maddie's parents again, I needed to check out what the hell that car was doing at her place. I carefully wandered back down the street, looking as nonchalant as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they ask why I'm coming back, I'll just say I forgot something,\" I told myself. They'd probably all have a good chuckle at my expense... again... but at least it would put my mind at ease. I was certain that Maddie would appreciate it. As long as she wasn't being grounded, or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's house came into view, and I suddenly felt the need to hide behind some bushes. Call it instinct, but it seemed like the right call. Peering over the shrubbery, I noticed that the black car was indeed parked right in front of Maddie's house. Strangely, it had backed into the driveway, and the trunk was popped open. A man in a pinstripe suit stood in front of the driver's seat, looking rather displeased. He had dark skin and a thick beard, and his head was neatly shaven. Designer sunglasses completed the look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll business, I thought. I was trying to remember what Maddie's dad had said. The Feds had contacted him? How odd... considering I thought that he was in the flower delivery business. What would a man who sells plants be contacted by the government? I shook my head. Something didn't add up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Maddie's garage door opened, and her parents were standing on the inside, waiting for the suited man to approach. They looked remorseful, and there was a brief moment of conversation between them. The suited man made some animated gestures while the parents nodded mournfully. I couldn't hear them, but it seemed to be quite the eventful little talk. There was no doubt that Maddie's parents were the subordinates, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like the suited man ordered Maddie's parents to do something, and they both disappeared into the garage. The man took a quick look around, and then made a gesture to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's mom and dad returned carrying a large sack of some sort. I squinted, and realized with horror what was in the sack... Maddie! Her body was limp inside the material... I assumed that she had been drugged or something, because I saw a twitch or two while she was carried. The three of them gently guided her into the trunk of the black car and then slammed it shut. A few more words were discussed, and then the suited man returned to the driver's seat and drove off. I dived straight into the bushes as he passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in shock, I took a moment to consider what had happened. I was so dazed that i barely noticed my cell phone was received a text. It was my mom, asking me to hurry home, and be ready for a guest. My stomach churned...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My brain was still reeling from the scene that had just passed. Maddie, my shy, inquisitive childhood friend, had just been stuffed into the trunk of a stranger's car by her parents! Unless this was an elaborate prank of some kind, I had just witnessed a kidnapping. I paused, looked around for a hidden camera, and immediately shook my head. This was real, and my friend was in serious danger. I ignored my cell for now, as it was obviously a trap. I had to investigate Maddie's parents and figure out who the hell the driver was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, I noticed that the garage door was still open. I heard the familiar start-up of Maddie's station-wagon (which had taken us to school for many years), and saw her Dad pull out onto the driveway. Maddie's mom was waiting at the front door, standing with her arms folded. Her Dad gave one last look towards the house, and took off down the street... probably to resume his criminal activities. The bushes continued to give me decent camouflage as he passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI studied Maddie's mom as I weighed my options. She had been always a slim woman, but even in recent years she managed to maintain a trim physique. Wearing a baby blue silk blouse and knee-length grey skirt, her legs were rather well exposed and well toned. A dark crop of brown hair framed her face, and she was always wearing a pair of elegant secretary-style glasses. I always found it curious that Maddie looked nothing like her mother. I felt a little guilty for comparing their looks, considering the dire circumstances, but the thought stuck in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's mom spent a few more moments on her front porch before going back inside. The garage door, still ajar, was my best chance. Timing my sprint carefully, I dashed from the bushes across the front lawn as soon as her back was turned. Ducking under the automated door, I dove behind a pile of old patio furniture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't hear her scream or yell, so I assumed I had made it safely. I looked around the garage for something that would help me interrogate Maddie's mom. A few spools of rope were hanging against the wall, and a fine-needled garden tool caught my eye. Hopefully Maddie's mom was as ticklish as she was...</span></div></div>",

I slowly opened it to reveal it led into the kitchen and I was relieved to see Maddie's mother wasn't around to stop me. I stealthily walked into the kitchen, quietly closing the door behind me before making my way into the living room where I saw Maddie's mother sitting on the couch. From my position behind her, I slowly made my way into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell from the outset she was agitated, she looked to be trying to read a book but couldn't focus, her head always turning to the windows and back again, as if waiting for something. After a minute or so of this, she let out a frustrated groan and flung the book into the wall with considerable force. She then ran her fingers through her brown hair and slumped back onto the couch, her hands resting over the top as her fingers constantly fidgeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising my chance, I grabbed a length of rope and then partly tied it, needing it only to be pulled tight before I dived towards Maddie's mother. The surprise was so complete than I managed to bind her wrists together with the rope before she could even protest in surprise \"W-What the Hell?!\" I heard her cry out as her wrists were trapped together and she turned in her position to look at me, her mouth dropping open in shock and horror \"What're you doing here?!\" She demanded before trying to rise up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly put a stop to that by yanking on a length of the rope that was sticking out from the band around her wrists, the force making Maddie's mother lose balance and topple over so that her pert rear stuck up in the air as her waist balanced on the top of the couch. Losing no time, I then grabbed another length of rope and hopped onto the couch to grab her feet, using the rope to tie her ankles together as she screamed in protest and threatened to phone the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do that and I'll have them ask you what happened to Maddie!\" I retorted, making her protests end as her face darkened. I managed to finish tying her ankles together without too much difficulty, trapping them effectively together before I grabbed a hold of her and shoved her roughly down to the floor where we wouldn't be seen by people passing in the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly straddling her hips, I glared down at Maddie's mother as she returned the look in kind \"Tell me what happened to Maddie!\" I demanded \"And was what we found in the basement true?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's mother glared up at me for a good long while before she eventually...</span></div></div>",

She was taken away in a sack! Now tell me what's going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill stopped her struggling and for a moment, guilt flooded her face as I mentioned what happened to Maddie. She took a deep breath however and her expression hardened \"I have no idea what you're talking about.\" She said \"Maddie's gone out with her father, that's all and if you get off me now, we can forget that any of this ever happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found it hard to believe that she thought I'd fall for that lie but realised she was hardly going to tell me the truth straight off the bat. I locked eyes on her and saw that she wouldn't give up the truth without a fight. Trying to remind myself that this was to find Maddie and I shouldn't really be enjoying it, I lowered my hands down to Jill's sides \"You know.\" I said as casually as I could \"Maddie has rather a weakness when she's trying to hide the truth as well. But I knew that she couldn't hide it from me when I used the right... technique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I suddenly dug my fingers into Jill's sides, kneading them just below the ribs in a sudden tickle attack. Jill's eyes bugged out at the sudden tickling and she arched her back before letting out a piercing laugh. I was somewhat amused that being incredibly ticklish ran through Maddie's family but tried to focus on the matter at hand. I continued to dig into Jill's sides, my fingers probing from her ribs to her hips with constant ticklish pokes and prods over her flanks as she continued to squeal and laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STTAHHHAAPPTTHAHHATTT!!!\" Jill ordered as she bounced underneath me, her torso wriggling and writhing as she legs thrashed about as much as they could while being tied together. Her arms tried to cover her body but with her wrists tied together as well, she was unable to defend herself very well. I dug into her flanks without mercy, kneading the skin from ribs to hips at a random pace, pulling up her shirt to expose her smooth belly and bare skin underneath. Tickling without the shirt provoked another round of high laughter from Jill and she twitched constantly in a futile attempt to throw me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, I slowed down the tickling while keeping my fingers resting on Jill's smooth belly \"Now then, are you going to tell me what I want to know?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill breathed heavily, her lips still curled up into a smile a little as she looked up at me. Her face was flushed and brown hair stuck to her face from sweat but she soon regained control of herself to answer.</span></div></div>",

I then turned around to her lowerbody, facing her legs as I sat near her calves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing now?\" Jill spat, but as I noticed her voice seemed to contain a seed of fear. I casually began pulling off her flats by the heels, reveiling her light pink feet. \"Maddie always said her feet were her most sensitive spot. I wonder if it runs in the family?\" With that, I began testing Jill's soles, probing her feet for any spot that would best send my captive into hysterics. Jill had only started to endure the tickling and was already giggling uncontrolably with louder laughs continuing to slip through. I began to work my way around her feet, tickling the tops of her toes while my other hand would try to tickling inbetween the toes, her reaction to clamp them waning with the directed tickling. It wasn't too long before I had found a spot between her big toes and the ones next to them where Jill began to erupt into hysterics. I continued relentlessly, aggressively taking advantage of any area she failed to cover in time. The sight of her pitifully try to block my hands with her other foot was only rewarded by tackling that one instead, mercilessly tickling every spot that produced a laugh.

We decided to take a few orphans for ourselves. You were too young to understand what was happening, and having some 'children' would help our cover if the police came sniffing around. And until this morning, the plan had worked flawlessly. You grew up, thinking that your parents were normal and caring people. But it was all a ruse.

I must have been drugged after passing out because my body feels like it has been not responsive in some time. It was then I blinked a few times, and could start to see clearly. \"WMMHMM\" It was then it hit me, there was some heavy duty gag in my mouth, thick leather, strapped to my face with a ball on the inside to force my tongue down and keep any word formation from being possible. Upon further inspection I was hanging on some intricate suspension system. Arms stretches out at a 45 degree angle, the same with my legs. Bound firmly in place by thick leather straps along my ankles, above my knees, waist, and all up my arms, rendering my ability to move near impossible. By the way it is set up, the chains connecting these cuffs to my body could be moved, to change my position if need be. Looking down at myself I could see two things, one I was reduced to a pair of hotpants, tight hotpants, barely covering any of my skin, which felt..strange, as if something was rubbed into it from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then look forward and say Maddie, much like myself, her suspended body turned my way, bound extactly the same as myself. With that thick gag, that shine to her skin, and her attire even less covering then mine, a bikini, a string bikini. For a moment I could only stare, looking at her red hair and freckly body hanging there, she looks a little more tuckered out, only then do I remember she has been here before me. \"Yes!\" I thought, the kidnapping ring...getting kicked, which means...this can't be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the sound of a door opening and footsteps coming down into the basement drew my attention, and in coming in was a woman dressed as if she just got out from a day at the office, short dark hair down to her jawline, green eyes, she smiled at me while walking up to me, giving me a bit of a wave. I could not help but notice the nails on this woman and cringed. She came right up to me without a word, running one of those long talons up my side \"FFFMMM!\". My reaction was surprising, it really tickled, was it whatever they put on my skin? It was just a taste, the hand leaving my bare flesh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a pleasure to meet you finally, My name is Ellie, and you two have been cultivated since you were kids to be my Toys\" She turns to Maddie, making Madding cringe as well \"Since you were young, I bet you two remember special body wash you were given?....You two already more sensitive then usual\" She Then walks toward Maddie, going up behind her while looking at me, resting her head on Maddie shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two have been naughty however, uncovering the truth, forcing this early....tsk tsk....Maddie Maddie\" She pauses looking at me \"Oh, yes Maddie already got to enjoy my company before you came, but since she is the original snoop.....I think I have to be extra cruel with her yes?\" Those hands slide out from around Maddie, each long nail spider walking down her sides slowly until she has her nailtips raking the crease along her hips, each finger sliding under the string of the bikini with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie started going crazy  right off the bat, if she had that stuff rubbed into her, then really it must be horrible. I watched those nails play with her skin, and watched her completely freak out. \"MMHMHMGGGMGMGMMEAHAHAAA\" The sight was something to see, conflicting me, both wanting to help her, yet watch as this woman just works her over without any sign of remorse. If not for that gag I am sure Maddie would be making me deaf now, but try as she might, she can barely move,  but just laugh as the woman goes on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have discovered so many hotzones on Maddie here, like riiiiight here\" Her nails stay on that spot, pulling Maddie in to just keep at it. She was making me watch, forcing me to be torn as the minutes ticked on by, not giving Maddie the slightest moment of break \"Naughty girl, I want you to think about where curiousity gets you...and I want your friend to watch\" Her eyes remain locked on me \"Because this is his fate as well...you both belong to me now, and right now I am not interested in your pleas, I just want you to laugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shivered, I would lose it if I was tickled like this, much like Maddie is. Ellie just keeps her long nails in that area, they move with expert skill, sliding between her legs to tease her inner thighs, and the crease of her butt, and Maddie screams into that gag. I had no idea she was ticklish down there, but tears flow down her cheeks as Ellie does not relent. My heart rate increases, is this our life now? What is going to happen?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The string bikini offered no protection whatsoever and Ellie's fingers had full access to the ticklish cheeks. Her long nails glided up and down the area, tickling slowly at first before she started to squeeze them instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I thought Maddie's laughter couldn't get worse, a sound not unlike a Banshee escaped through her gag. The squeezing on her butt was making her howl and thrash about in her bondage although she could do nothing to escape. Ellie continued to coo and tease in Maddie's ear as her long fingers squeezed over the barely covered butt, tickling poor Maddie into further hysterics as she was tortured well past her limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it finally ended, Maddie sagged and looked far the worse for wear. Her face was bright red, her cheeks were stained with tears and she was breathing as heavily as she could through her gag. I was amazed that she was still concious after all that although it looked as though she was on the verge going insane from all the tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maddie did her best to recover from the ticklish onslaught, Ellie walked around her, her hand outstretched and almost touching my friend, keeping her constantly on edge as she waited for another tickle attack that could go anywhere. After several, long moments of this, Ellie turned to me with a grin \"Enjoying the show?\" She taunted, a part of me having to admit that it was rather easy on the eyes before it was shouted down by my conscience, common sense and everything else \"How about we make things ever more interesting then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Maddie, Ellie hid her from my view for a while before stepping to one side, revealing that she'd untied the bikini top and placed the strings on Maddie's shoulders, her breasts still barely covered by the rest of it. I realised what Ellie had in mind even before she began to speak \"Best not wiggle too much.\" She said as she started to stroke her long nails up and down Maddie's stomach, making her quiver violently \"Wouldn't want your friend her to see you without a top...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie tried so hard to keep herself from laughing as Ellie's fingers trailed up and down her belly, tickling softly but with how sensitive she was, it was still torture. The soft tickling on her belly eroded whatever defences Maddie had left as she was soon giggling up a storm, her shoulders shaking as her bikini top started to slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone has a ticklish ickle tum-tum!\" Ellie taunted in Maddie's ear \"But want to know where is most ticklish of all?\" At that question, Ellie drove her pinky finger into Maddie's navel. A scream of ticklish agony went through the room as Maddie through back her head and screamed into her gag, denied even begging for mercy. As she did that...</span></div></div>",

And such pretty nipples too. I've also just realised that I haven't tickled them yet. How silly of me!\" With that, Ellie brought her fingers up and started skittering her nail all over Maddie's breasts. Maddie started thrashing as much as her bondage would allow, screaming and laughing into her gag. Ellie wiggled her fingers into the sides of Maddie's chest and dug her nails into their underside before bringing them back to the centre of Maddie's bouncing breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"MMHMHMGGGMGMGMMEAHAHAAA,\" went Maddie as tears streamed down her face. \"Oh my god, someone has ticklish titties!\" exclaimed Ellie. \"I'm going to have so much fun playing with these little beauties all the time!\" Her nails were starting to quickly flick over Maddie's nipples. From across the room, you could see Maddie blush at the sensation and hear her stifle quick moans amidst the laughter, which Ellie wasn't seeming to notice yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't handle hearing Maddie's torment any more. It seemed  I pulled against my bonds, but they wouldn't budge. I wouldn't be breaking free anytime soon. Maybe I could get Ellie's attention. \"FFFMMM!

The rough torment continued for what felt like hours until it was joined by her other hand- shamelessly kneading the flesh of your inner thigh!

You thrashed even harder in your bonds when you saw Maddie's fake mom, \"Emma\" walk in through the open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly smile on her face, she slunk up to the top of your bed and gently placed five fingers in each armpit.

The letter were in large, Gothic print and although Maddie flicked through it too fast too read, there didn't seem to be anything overtly wrong with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" Maddie said as she finally found the page she had been looking for and showed it to me. It was an old style print you got from old books, a picture indicating a bright light in the sky with people bowing down before it. One or two were being plucked up by what appeared to be... tentacles? Seeing Maddie's expression, I decided against to make certain jokes and instead waited for her to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This book tells of when our town was first founded, that a Cult sprang up to worship a Goddess that had been followed by the old Tribes. They called her T'Calu, the bringer of laughing torment and delight. The Cult was eventually stamped out but not before their Priestess gave a prophecy.\" Maddie looked down to the page and started quoting directly from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Our defeat is temporary, the Bringer eternal. Await the night's scarlet plume so that the Goddess may break free and rule once more.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the book down on a nearby box and looked pleadingly at you \"I've been looking into this and found the Priestess was referencing a meteorite that only comes every few centuries and it's passing by Earth over the next few days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listened to Maddie as sympathetically as I could but it all seemed to be an overactive imagination more than anything \"Look, Maddie. I think you're getting away with yourself here. You sure you're not just reading far too much into this than you should?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not with my dreams!\" Maddie blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dreams?\" I asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... One dream. It's the same one night after night. I'm naked and unable to move and there are these terrible black feathers tickling me constantly! A voice tells me to give in but I won't!\" She blushes as she realises what she's just admitted to you but goes on \"Look, there's a way I can prove what I'm saying. There's a spot out in the woods where the Cult used to meet and might have evidence of what I'm talking about. Will you come with me so I can prove to you what's going on and help me stop it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused for a moment to mull over the question before answering...</span></div></div>",

The story was clearly the product of her stressed out mind, but she was my longest and dearest friend, so if I could help put the matter to rest, I would do so. \"Ok, we'll check out this spot in the forest if it'll make you happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brown eyes widened and she smiled happily. \"Thank you so much!\" She jumped towards me and gave me a tight hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this must be serious,\" I chuckled, hugging back, \"because this is first time you've been this affectionate since kindergarten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie groaned, and gave me a quick pinch on the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" I laughed, releasing the hug and pretending to be mortally wounded. Maddie merely rolled her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the mysterious book, I scanned the cover and flipped through a few pages. I could sense some apprehension from Maddie as I studied the strange writings and pictures. \"T'Calu, huh? So just what do you think we'll find in the forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy shy friend turned away, shaking her head. \"I think it's where the old Tribes used to gather for their ceremonies. It may be a site of a portal that allows T'Calu to break through into our world. Or it may simply be the last place the Cult was seen. I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, still looking at the pictures in the book. I fixated on a page that had a detailed illustration of a... something. It looked like a cross between an octopus and a crab, but because it was drawn several centuries ago, I wasn't sure if the artist was merely exagerating or trying to replicate something he had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But no matter what the purpose of the site, we should be able to find artifacts that can prove what the Priestess was up to.\" Maddie continued, seating herself on a nearby box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" I said, as encouragingly as I could. Flipping to another page, I saw a detailed drawing of a strange structure. It looked like a city built on the ocean, but the angles were all weird... not straight and rectangular like most buildings, but rounded and curved in organic ways. How could buildings support themselves into such odd shapes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only question is,\" Maddie said, her voice thoughtful, \"will anyone else be there? If the meteor is the symbol of the return of T'Calu, then maybe some remnants of the Cult will be there as well, preparing for a new ceremony. We should be careful when we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed the book, somewhat alarmed by the few pictures I had seen. I can see why Maddie had been so obsessed with this writing! I was enthralled by it, and only just looked it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose,\" I said, placing the hard-bound book carefully onto a box. \"Is there anything else we should do before we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie ran a hand through her frazzled hair, and quickly glanced at her frumpy sweater. \"I guess I could clean up a bit,\" she smirked at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winked back. \"Oh don't be silly. I'm sure the 'cultists' will love to see a little munchkin come to see them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie growled at me in a cutely sarcastic way. \"Okay, I'll get ready. If there's anything you need in the house, feel free to grab it. We'll head out soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the black-haired girl bolted towards the stairs and began to prepare herself.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although remaining more than a little skeptical of Maddie's thoughts on the subject, I decided to read through the book to see what information I could gather on them. I decided to try and ignore some of the pictures when they arose as they appeared to be what happened when M. C. Escher decided to really cut loose and were giving me headaches. Flicking through the pages idly, the words spoke of a dire threat that the Cultists stood for, bringing down order and morality for chaos and complete depravity as the spread of T'Calu spread far and wide in their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to realise some of the reasoning behind Maddie's worry as the book told of entire communities plunging into chaos as the Bringer of Laughing Torment and Delight destroyed inhibitions to send people into a lustful frenzy. Some of the woodcuts went into great delight in expressing such effects with one in particular catching my eye. It was a crude picture of a naked woman standing in a forest as several black feathers tickled her body at various points. A caption beneath it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Sable Touch. Said to be used by the Goddess T'Calu to single out believers for their level of lust. Those who were touched by the plumes are said to be the most open to the Goddess' maddening touch.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK... I suddenly realised that maybe Maddie had probably enjoyed reading this page in particular a little too much if these sable feathers were the same ones she mentioned in her dream earlier. Although I was set on still following her to the forest to help clear her mind, this would help explain a few things. Maddie was always a bit closed on sex, having never dated at all and always gotten flustered from the slightest attention from that aspect of life. Maybe coming across this book had awakened some passions that she never realised she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a grin at the thought of Maddie being into tickling like I was, certainly something I could support. But that could wait until after I helped her with the current problem. Bringing myself out of my thoughts, I realised that several minutes had passed and Maddie hadn't returned, she seemed to be taking her time. After a moment's thought, I decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maddie was taking a while, but I wasn't too worried. She'd come down when she was ready or yell if she needed anything. More importantly, the tome might've been able to provide some information as to exactly what Maddie expected to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flipped through the pages, looking for something on the original tribesmen who worshipped the goddess. This book was clearly made by the cultists who sprang up after the town was made, but Maddie said that the first worshippers of T'Calu were the natives. Whilst this book was a relic, anything by or about the tribesmen would be helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I found the drawing. To be honest it was more of a sketch, but the level of detail was astonishing. In the sketch there was a giant rock in the middle of a forest clearing. The stone was engraved with even more of the crazy pictures, probably of T'Calu and her worshippers. All of them centered around a single eye engraved into the face of the rock, from which carved tentacles wound and weaved outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow it was some mad caption: <i>The Gateway of T'Calu. Here she remains, and here she will rise again when the nightfire burns. Only the truly pious have gone through to visit our goddess, and those who return tell of unending laughter and insatiable lust. Those who do not eagerly await the nightfire, when the gate opens and all in her realm are freed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuessing from the paragraph, this was what Maddie was looking for. If not, it was what we were going to find. There was more writing beneath the caption:<i>We believe the Old Ones went through the gate when the settlers first arrived, to escape the guns and slaughter. It explains why we found this site intact, their items and prophecies and relics. They wait on the other side with T'Calu. Occasionally the ghostly form of an Old One graces a congregation bearing the will of T'Calu, but they do not talk outside of our meetings.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'Old Ones' must've been the tribesmen that first worshipped T'Calu. According to this insane book, they were on the other side of this gateway rock thingy with their goddess. Creepy, but totally unbelievable. A rock was the portal to another dimension? What were they on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept looking back towards the carving of the eye. Something about it piqued my interest, drawing me in. On the next page was a larger version of it, also with a caption. I read it curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Eye of Kietelen, T'Calu's manifestation in the mortal world. Very few have been visited by this ethereal creature. Whilst this is her manifestation, it is important to remember that T'Calu and the Eye are two different beings. T'Calu is a goddess, while the Eye is a spiritual ambassador. It looks into you, searches your soul, and gauges how closely you are connected to our goddess.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more crazy talk. Still, the eye was very captivating. I wanted to look into it forever, even if it was just on paper. The intricately drawn tentacles were so vivid, the complexity made it look like they were moving. The slitted pupil was so dark and entrancing that even when the eye blinked I was captivated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, did the eye blink? I inspected it closely, the smell of musty pages filling my nostrils. Having a staring contest with a picture wasn't the smartest thing I've done, but I wanted to make sure that I wasn't going mad. Just as I was about to dismiss it, the eye blinked again... and looked at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I had been able to, I would've jolted and dropped the book. But it was as if I was frozen in solid ice, unable to move a muscle or break my fixated gaze. The Eye of Kietelen's ink tentacles started spindling and writhing while a voice pierced my head. \"<i><b>Your connection to my goddess is incredibly strong</b></i>\" I heard. \"<b><i>She will be most pleased when she meets you in person.</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally I was in control again, and I snapped the book shut. I stood there a moment, panting, trying to make sense of I'd heard, what the voice told me. Then I spent a few minutes convincing myself it didn't happen, and failing horribly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie had enough time, I decided. Tucking the book under my arm, I bounded up the stairs and headed for the back door. As I turned into the hallway, I saw...</span></div></div>",

She had just come down from her bedroom and gave me a curious look as I had almost ran straight into her. She looked a lot better from before, having had a quick shower and gotten dressed. Rather than her usual conservative style though, she had opted for tying her hair back in a ponytail and wore a tight fitting t-shirt and khaki shorts. She looked even more attractive than normal and I stopped short to admire her new look, not realising I was staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Is everything OK?\" She asked, causing me to blush slightly. I could have told of what had happened, my vision of the Eye of Kietelen but reasoned against it. I didn't want her to get worked up over what I was trying to convince myself was nothing more than my imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah. You um... just look good is all.\" I said, trying to hide my nervousness somewhat. It seemed to work as Maddie blushed and smiled slightly before turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we still need supplies. We can get the bus to the forest but according to the book, we'll need to travel quite a way in before we get to the Gateway. Compass, water and some food would help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded along to Maddie's words before a buzzing in your ear suddenly caught your attention and a soft voice, barely a whisper was heard. With some horror, I realised it was the voice from before, the Eye of Kietelen. <b>\"Look at her,\"</b> The voice said <b>\"With feet so soft and stomach so tender. She will love to be one of us, tickled to madness and ecstasy. Take the step, introduce her to unending laughter and insatiable lust.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Maddie, I realised just how attractive she was and all I could think about was tickling her, making her laugh and squeal with the slightest of touches. I tried to fight the influence, realising it was just the Eye amplifying my own lusts, but it was hard. After some struggle, I eventually...</span></div></div>",

But Maddie was so beautiful, I gazed at her form once again, and in a moment of weakness, desire took over me, the Eye's words echoing in my head. For but an instant, my own eyes resembled the Eye of Kietelen, showing how I fell to my primal urges and given it control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Yesss... You've made a wise choice, giving into your desires. You know what to do\"</b> the Eye spoke in my mind. However much I wanted to get at her ticklish body now however, I knew if I truly wanted to fufill my dark wishes fully, I'd need...a few items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Maddie, you have those supplies in your garage?\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so,\" she replied, not looking away from her bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So a compass, water, and a few cans of food...and a coil or two of rope, just in case, right?,\" I added slyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie nodded and answered \"Yup! Should all be in there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect. \"I'll be right back then.\" I made my way to her garage through a door in the basement, and started to gather my 'supplies'. As the garage was organized quite nicely, I quickly found the coils of rope. <b>\"Yesss, good work servant. Now it is time to show the girl the beauty of her own laughter, at your own hands.\"  </b> Almost in a trance from the effect the Eye was having on me, I muttered in delightful agreement. I moved back out of the garage and called to Maddie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in my room! Just grabbing a few last minute things!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shuddered with glee, my mind totally enraptured with what desires I would fulfill that night, and ascended the stairs to her bedroom. As I entered, Maddie, who was sitting on her bed, turned and smiled at me. \"Found the rope did you? Nice, got everything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirked back. \"Yup! Hey, actually, I want you to check these ropes, see if they're ok.\" I approached her and bought the coils of cord up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seem okay...\" she replied, looking them over warily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better check.\" As the words left my mouth, I delicately wrapped one end of it around her wrist, fastening it to her bedframe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmm...Is this completely necessary?\"  she muttered, as I grabbed her other wrist and tied that to the opposing side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Completely, for what we have in store.\" My smirk slowly became a maniac grin, as I bound her feet at the ankles, and used the remaining cord to fasten those ropes to the bottom of the bed. Now, the delicate shy beauty that was Maddie was trapped, and at my fingertips! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think that's far enough...You can untie me now,\" the girl said, her situation reminding her of the dreams she was having. I looked into her eyes with my sadistic grin, and the Eye of Kietelen flashed in my Irises. \"Wa...Wait. I-isn't that f-from the...book?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Yes, my dear!\"</b> I boomed in the Eye's voice, his will overpowering myself for a moment. <b>\"I have awoken the desires of your friend. You should be thrilled! We have chosen you to be the first of many to know our brand of unending laughter!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie looked completely frantic. \"W-Wait! I kn-know what you're gunna do! P-please don't t-tickle me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back at her, the Eye's will akin to my own. \"It's a bit late for that, Maddie.\" But the question is, where did I start?  </span></div></div>",

I slipped my fingers into the edge of her right shoe, slowly pulling it form her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! D-Don't tickle me! Please! I'm begging!\" Maddie writhed in her bonds, but alas the ropes held tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Soon, dear girl, you will be begging for us to never STOP tickling!\"</b> the Eye retorted gleefully as I finished pulling her first shoe off. As delicately as I could, I teased her socked foot, and as I did so Maddie began to produce bubbly laughter along with pleas to stop. Obviously I did not desist my actions, and while I teased her right foot, I slowly pulled off the shoe on her left foot. Down to but socks, Maddie begged for me not to remove them. \"Unlikely,\" I replied evilly, as I stuck my fingers into the sides of the socks, ready to pull them off. Once inside, I began to feel the soft bottoms of Maddie's feet, and suddenly became filled with the urge to see the bare beauties for myself. I pulled them off suddenly to find the bound, soft, pale feet of Maddie, and was overcome with lust. Her feet were long and shapely, thinner but with respectably deep arches with a light pinkish hue. Also apparently, she had recently painted her toenails a light, sky blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time,\" I muttered darkly, before placing my hands on the soles of her adorable feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" she whispered, her fears becoming reality. Not only was she going to be tickled on what she knew was one of her worst spots, but she had lost a friend to the influence of T'Calu. Then her thought processes shut down and turned into hysterics, as I began methodically tickling and exploring her sensitive soles. Maddie began her descent into pure laughter at my hands, while I experienced my most sinister desires and loved every second of it. I tickled the poor girl for what seemed like hours, (but had been more like 30 minutes) before wondering what my next step should be.  </span></div></div>",

I felt a tingling along my right arm and looked down to see it had been shrouded in darkness that came from the eye. The darkness slowly moved away though, leaving a slight ticklish sensation and eventually, what appeared to be a large, thin tattoo of a black feather on my forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Behold.\"</b> The Eye announced <b>\"The Mark of the Sable Touch. All those who bear it are able to call upon a small fragment of T'Calu's power! For now, simply focus on summoning the black plumes that you may show your friend the true meaning of laughing torment and delight!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding no further instruction, I did as the Eye said, looking down to my hand as I willed a feather to appear in it. It took mere seconds before a long, black and stiff plume suddenly appeared in my hand, the tattoo conjuring wisps of smoke that formed into the feather. I smiled as I recognised it from the book before turning to Maddie whose eyes widened in amazement and fear at seeing the feather in my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No please!\" She begged, still not open to the pleasure I was showing her \"Don't tickle me with that! I can't take it! PleeeHEEEHAHAHAEEHHSSEEHAANNNOOHHOOO!!!\" She screamed as I had ignored her and simply went straight for the tickling. Her bare feet twitched madly as I tickled and teased them, the edge of the plume gliding over her soles with ease. Her creamy and smooth feet were delightful to tickle with the plume, smooth and easy to just brush over with either the tip of a side of the feather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie screamed, Maddie laughed, Maddie pleaded as I tickled her feet, either brushing her soles with the feather rapidly, or giving slow flicks with the tips along her toes that caused her to laugh harder than almost anything else.

I felt the Eye's intentions, knowing it was opening up Maddie as it had done me, letting her know the full extent of the pleasure that would await her if she would fully submit to T'Calu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, I realised the soft tickling on Maddie's toes was producing more moans than laughter.

So why bother relenting in one spot when she was so close to broken anyway? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"You are wise to never relent, servant\"</b>, the Eye echoed in my mind. <b>\"But this Maddie of yours is perhaps a bit stronger willed than I had imagined.

The more subjects she has, the quicker she can return.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood,\" I replied, pondering what else I could do to push Maddie beyond her limits and into the grasp of T'Calu. Spying a few ribbons on a dresser near the corner of the room, I suddenly was inspired with what would sure to be the Coup de gr\u00e2ce for any will Maddie had left. I stopped the tickling but for a moment, just to dash over and grab the thin strips of fabric, bringing them back to Maddie's delightful pair of feet. Maddie's laughter and moans began to subside in this cease-fire, turning into quiet grasps for air. It wasn't until she felt the ribbons between her toes did she even try to speak though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...What...Now?\" she breathed, her chest still aching. I gave the most diabolical grin I could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've decided that your precious little feet had too much wiggle room,\" I replied, as I bound each toe with the silky, pink ribbons to the bed-frame, with each knot removing any freedom she had in her state. \"It's time for you to experience true bliss.\" I tied the last knot, securing Maddie's smooth pink soles firmly in place. There was nowhere to run any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu...But...\" she tried, but without mercy I dove straight back into tickling, the feather tantalizing the tops of her toes while my other hand scratched the delicate soles. She turned directly back to wild laughter, followed by more of the sensual moans of delight. I noticed that her frequency of moans were rapidly increasing, the Eye's magic and my idea combining to turn any will she had into mush. I myself reveled in the delight of turning this once shy, but strong willed girl into a tickle servant, becoming drunk on both the power I had over the situation, and the sensual nature the whole experience gave me. And yet, I felt something tugging in the back of my mind. Memories of what we had planned, the beauty I saw in Maddie no one else did. And I knew, deep down, I had broken not just her will, but her heart as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this...Something I could live with? Could I carry this choice onward, with no regrets?

She was breathing heavily in the aftermath of the tickle attack and her orgasm, her chest heaving as the light from the Eye faded and she seemed to be dozing off <b>\"She is now one of T'Calu's.

You're not used to being tickled out of your mind just yet.\" I replied teasingly, reaching up and tickling the sides of Maddie's breasts. She jumped and let out a squeak of laughter before falling on top of me again. Getting so close together, and feeling the warmth from her body, I leaned in and kissed Maddie on the lips, almost jumping for joy as she returned it passionately.

We completed our preparations and spent some more time on reading the book before we would have to leave for the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a later chapter it read <i>\"Destruction came over the quiet fields, farms and villages. Dark clouds appeared out of blue sky. The red sister devours crop and roof. Armies of belief wage war on peasants. Only journey over the Great Water to Nieuw Amsterdam saved them. Ours were on board. De kleine Farahilde was de meest kieteligste meisje in de wereld..\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepicted was a female person, stopped in the middle of doing a cartwheel, with ankles and wrists tied to trees. Feathers zoomed in from all four directions.Maddie jumped when she saw the drawing when she understood where the feathers would go when they met the body. She hugged me tightly. It was time to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went to the bus station by bikes with our equipment distributed into two backpacks. Initially the bus driver was reluctant to drop us off where we asked him to do this because there neither was a bus stop nor was there anything else besides a large forest. When we gave him a few extra dollars he took them, chuckled, mentioned something about two teenagers doing something indecent in the forest and later wondering how to get home. In fact we had forgotten to arrange our return. Luckily the bus had a large cargo department, empty enough for both of our bikes to fit into. Minutes after the bus moved and brought us into an uncertain future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we saw the trees become more dense a tingling feeling began to spread. Maddie's grip on my hand go tighter. I looked around. Most people slept, only a few read or listened to music, bored by the endless sea of trees. Minutes after goosebumps appeared on my neck. In my mind the voice was back. \"<b></b>Your bare feet will carry you from here.\" I went to the bus driver who brought the vehicle to a halt, offloaded the bicycles and drove off, shaking his head. The other passengers did not care. If they had known...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the main road we saw a small tarmac side road lead into the forest, blocked by a barrier. We locked the bicycles to a tree hidden from view and went up the side road. After a few meters I remembered the voice, stopped and took off my shoes and socks. Maddie looked at me curiously, but also shed her shoes. After a mile the road reached a black gate, with a fence on each side. Warning signs with severe punishment for each trespasser warned anyone to enter this private ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain what to do we...</span></div></div>",

On his chest a tiny badge with a meanwhile familiar eye met out stare. Without saying any word he motioned us to approach the gate. From up close we saw that he wore a face mask. Only his eyes were signs of a human behind it. \"Show me\" he said in a low voice. Show him what? I did not want to expose our ownership of the book right at the front entrance. Maddie hit me in my ribs with her elbow and said \"Tickle me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took one step back. Maddie held both hands tightly to the iron bars of the gate and lifted her right foot. I grabbed it and started to dance my fingers over her sole. The events earlier in the day flashed back to her memory. Instantly she squealed with laughter and started to breath hard, looking directly into the guard's eyes. After a few seconds her already saw enough and opened the gate for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe narrow road went up further into the hills. After a few more bends a tiny footpath left to the right, which we followed under the icon of the eye attached to one of the trees. Soon we came onto a clearing where a small crowd of people already gathered. We were surprised to see people of all age groups, talking in small groups. Further apart stood a group of four adults who stood out from the group by their dress and air of seniority. Their heads turned to us. Two of them were indian natives. Although there was some distance I heard one of them say: \"They have arrived.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

All I could see was Maddie before me, in all her youthful beauty, with a body practically begging to be touched and tickled. The Eye's voice no longer seemed to be a whisper... now it was a urgent yell, demanding that I give in and torment my friend with laughter.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\"This one will be the first of many,\"</b> the Eye of Kietelen said with authority. <b>\"The first of your limitless harem. When you join us, you will become the Avatar of T'Calu, The Bringer of Laughing Torment and Delight. The armies of this world will tremble beneath her touch, and you shall be her strongest general, leading the forces of lust. You cannot fight your destiny.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a struggle to fight the relentless words, now embedded into my mind. Maddie, as she was, looked at me curiously, with her ivory white skin barely covered by her t-shirt and khakis. The image of the Eye was burned into my vision; with its haunting gaze and swirling tendrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie said something, but all I could imagine was the 'limitless harem' now promised to me. Would it be so bad, I wondered, to be the most powerful person on the planet? To lead a Goddess from some distant dimension into our world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...let's roll,\" Maddie said, as my reverie was broken. I nodded, half-aware of where I was. Maddie motioned to her door, and I followed, still somewhat entranced by the Eye's promises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"It would be so easy,\"</b> whispered the Eye, staring into me... through me. <b>\"To take what is rightfully yours.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head forcefully. \"No,\" I grumbled under my breath, out of hearing of Maddie. \"I will not give in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf my friend had heard my little conversation, she didn't make note of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's grab what we can here and then head downtown to the hardware store. We need to make sure we're prepared for ANYTHING.\" Maddie said, with as much authority as she'd ever had. I noticed that her personality was shifting since I first arrived. No longer was she Shy Little Maddie. She was slowly becoming a fighter... and perhaps the dark secrets of T'Calu were strengthening her resolve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hoped that the experience would strengthen me as well... but the Eye seemed to have taken a keen interest in me. I tried to suppress it as I kept up with Maddie out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whoever it was, they wore a brown hooded cloak that encompassed their entire body. The shadow cast by the cowl of their hood hid most of their feautures, but I could see their mouth move as they spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Eye has informed our goddess of your connection to her,\" I was told. The voice was obviously female, but that was all I had to go own because of the cloak. \"She would like to invite you to her realm, that she may communicate to you directly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind was bubbling with questions, but one was more important than any other. \"Where's Maddie?\" I asked her. \"What did you do to my friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman bowed her head. \"She is with us, and will stay in our until you visit our Lady T'Calu. Your friend is close to the truth, and would seek a way to prevent the return of our goddess. It can be done, which is why we are keeping her with us for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie was taken, captured by the cultists. I felt worried about her, angry that these people kidnapped her, scared as to what they might do to her. \"Leave her alone,\" I threatened vehemently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need to worry,\" the woman unsuccessfully reassured me. \"She will not be harmed or touched if you make haste to the Gateway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to leave, but I had another question. \"If the this can be stopped, why tell me that? I was in the same boat as Maddie in the first place, what makes you think I won't try to stop T'Calu's return?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth gave a slight smile. \"Because you have the desire, unconscious or not, to meet T'Calu. You want to see her realm, you want to meet her in person. And she wants to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know about that, but I had to take a course of action, for Maddie's sake.</span></div></div>",

As she turned and left, her form slowly dissapated until there was no proof of her existence at all. Whoever these people were or whatever they were capable of, it was clear that on some level the powers of this religion were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick search of the house confirmed what the cultist had said. Maddie was nowhere inside, and I very much doubted she left on her own. If she was really being held captive by these lunatics, I had no choice but to visit the Gateqay of T'Calu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leapt into the backyard, scaled the fence into my house, burst into the garage and grabbed my bike. It was the fastest and most private way to get to the forest. Although it might have been smart to tell somebody else about where I was going, something told me - figuratively - that doing so would break my promise to the cultists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book on the cult was still under my arm. I thought about ditching it, but decided that I would probably need it once I got to the forest, if only to find my way to the rock. My backpack opened and the tome slipped in, fitting alongside some supplies I keep in my bag for emergency trips like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes saw me at the edge of the forest, looking into the thick underbrush, trying to find any point of reference. I was on the edge of town, at the end of a deserted street, ironically a few meters away from the abadoned house where Maddie's dad found the book. The place was as empty as empty could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest itself was a whole other story. There might not have been anything moving, but the woodland was full of trees and branches and bushes and flowers and moss and general plant life. Healthy green vegetation was a good sign that the forest was vibrant and alive, though maneuvering was going to be difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter chaining my bike to a nearby fence, I considered my next move. Instinct was yelling at me to go in alone; I had the book, and I was fast enough to bolt if worst came to worst. But logic told me that having someone along would be better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end I decided to...</span></div></div>",

I was going through a portal to another dimension to meet a pagan goddess so I could get Maddie back from a cult of ghosts that was stamped out ages ago. It was gonna be a tough sell, no matter who I told it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, I decided going alone on this one was the best course of action. Of course, I had no idea how to proceed. The only thing I knew about the location of the Gateway was that it was in middle of a clearing somewhere in the forest. With no clear path to follow, I was stumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had to be some indication as to where the clearing was. The cultists had found it after all, and if people went to visit it then there had to be some trail that led the followers to the rock. Leafing through the old tome I brought from Maddie's, I quickly found the page about the Gateway again. Apparently there <i>was</i> a path leading there when the cult was strong, but it must've been overgrown during the many decades of misuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, I put the tome back in my bag and scanned the treeline for something. The woman said that I shoukd make to the Gateway with haste, so she was expecting me to at least find it. After about a minute of searching, I found what I was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarved into the trunk of a tree close to the edge of the forest was the Eye of Kietelen. The vertical pupil stared straight ahead, surrounded by its tentacles or vines or whatever. Approaching it, I studied the area around the tree, looking for what once was a path. It made no difference - I found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting even more exasperated, I returned to the carving of the Eye. This was getting me nowhere, and every second I delayed meant another second Maddie spent with these insane psychopaths. There just had to be a way to find the trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, as before, the Eye of Kietelen looked at me from its wooden face. This time I wasn't as shocked, but it still surprised me to see the solid wood move. Then some mad notion entered my head: what if I asked the Eye? Quickly, I buried the thought. This was a tree, I was letting my imagination get the better of me, I was desperate. But I <i>was</i> desperate. I had nowhere to go, and this might've been my only lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigning to the insanity, I turned to the Eye and asked \"How do I find the Gateway of T'Calu?\" For a moment nothing happened, and I cursed myself for a fool. But then the Eye looked down, and when I followed its gaze I saw the undergrowth slowly drawing back, clearing a way to enter the forest. Bushes bent away, moss shrunk back, all the plants simply moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done, there was a clear and obvious trail through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at the plants, and for a second considered bolting. Whatever was at play here it was bigger than me. But then I remembered Maddie, how I doubted her and thought her crazy for believing this. I owed her, and so I pushed forward into the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally a walk through the forest would have me admiring the beauty of nature, trying to identify the trees and listening for bird calls. Not that time. I was all business, marching through the thick forest, trying to get to my destination. I passed several Eyes of Kietelen on my journey, each one watching me as I passed through. I had no doubt that T'Calu knew I was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the clearing, I immediately recognized the Gateway. It looked more or less just like the one in the sketch I found, with the huge Eye of Kietelen staring forward. The markings were all either pictures of worshippers or letters in a long-forgotten alphabet. The clearing itself looked different from the sketch, as much of it had been overgrown. Nature's grip was growing stronger. But not a single plant grew on the rock, despite the rampant vegetation eveywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering my wits, I announced to the Gateway \"Here I am, now what do you want me to do?\" For a tense moment, all was still.</span></div></div>",

The appendages behind it started moving, but unlike the pointless wriggling of the previous pictures the tentacles were actually moving the various drawings and words, arranging them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the Eye's voice entered my thoughts. \"<b>Greetings mortal. I see that T'Calu's first worshippers have forced your hand in a sense. Fear not, your friend is safe and untouched. She is in the personal care of our great goddess.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's done <i>anything</i> to her?\" I stressed. If Maddie went through torture because I left her alone, I'd never be able to forgive myself. The Eye's sincerity was disarming though, as if it were personally meeting me on even grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>As I said, untouched,</b>\" the Eye reiterated. \"<b>We will not violate your friend, especially since you are so useful. Enter my goddess' realm, she awaits your arrival. Actually, she's very excited to meet you.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eye finished arranging the carvings, which made the general shape of a doorway on the face of the rock. Shining brightly with a bright white light, the Eye of Kietelen's pupil expanded until in encompassed the entire portal, creating a glowing gateway to T'Calu's realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, I stepped towards the doorway. There was no way to tell where I was going to end up when I entered, or even if it was a trap. But as before when I was conflicted about asking the Eye, I had little choice. So when I arrived at the portal, I quickly made two steps and went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT'Calu's realm was a bit duller than I had pictured it. All around me was a light blue haze shooting by me as I tunneled towards my destination. I had no idea where that was, but I suspected that the goddess was directing my journey through her dimension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on what I could see, I changed my analysis of her realm. It wasn't like looking into a blue haze, it was like looking past a thick veil. Beyond I could see vague forms in various positions doing various things, but it was all too fuzzy for me to really make out what they were doing or who they were. Though I did have a hunch. I was beginning to think that this was the majority of her realm, where the cultists and natives existed. If that was the case, T'Calu was bringing me somewhere private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon I was slowing down, entering another part of the dimension. The veil thickened gradually until all I could see was white, and that was when I landed. At least it felt that way, but I couldn't see what I was standing on. Everywhere was white. Then I felt a presence push against my consciousness. At first I thought it was the Eye, but this voice was distinctly feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b><span class=\"cgrape\">Come to me.</span></b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had really no idea where to go, but the same presence that spoke was also pulling me somewhere. All I did was follow the direction, and sure enough a dark speck appeared seemingly out of nowhere, rapidly growing until it became a room. Reality was weird here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was akin to a dungeon, just with much more expensive and comfortable restraints and more lushly decorated. Black and violet was the main color scheme to the room, projecting a dark yet soothing atmoshphere. In the center was a collection of rich furniture, probably where the goddess would meet people, and the dim lamps were stationed regularly across the three walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I neared the sofa, I felt the presence from before return. \"<span class=\"cgrape\"><b><i>Sit,</i></b></span>\" the voice instructed. Suspecting that it was in fact T'Calu, I hastily obeyed. No sooner did I lean into the sofa then a woman materialized instantly right beside me. Her sudden appearance startled me, causing me to recoil a little bit. Who else could it be but T'Calu herself? Once I recovered, I took a good look at the goddess<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was as smooth and black as ebony, the same as her eyes. Staring into them made me think of black holes, sucking in everything, even light. Her skin was a deep violet, and her voluptous body had curves in all the right places. As if that weren't enough, she wore no more than a black lace bra and a short miniskirt that barely covered anything, showing off her hips and bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the epitome of sexy. I could see how she representented maddening lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">So nice to finally meet you,</span>\" she greeted, a thin forked tongue slithering out of her mouth. In person, her voice was rich and seductive. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Ever since my Eye of Kietelen spotted you I've been waiting for this. Your spirit, your connection to myself is unique in a way I have never seen before. I'm anxious to get to know you better.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to make sure, I quickly asked \"Where's Maddie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT'Calu pouted, her lip stuck out in a strangely endearing expression. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Why? Am I not enough for you?</span>\" she asked flirtatiously, shifting closer to me across the couch. I did my best to stay focused on finding Maddie, but my hormones were focused solely on this voluptous beauty in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came because your followers took my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Don't worry, she was returned to your world when you arrived in this realm,</span>\" T'Calu informed me. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">I only wanted to talk with you, it was never my intention to harm you or your friend.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback, I found myself at a loss for words. Previously I was under the impression that they were going to hold Maddie hostage until I did what they wanted. Now that they had already let her go, that made this a completely even-footed meeting - that is, apart from the fact that she was a goddess who controlled the dimension I was sitting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're going to ask me to help you enter our world, the answer is no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess giggled sensually. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">You're so sweet to worry, but don't. The nightfire will do that for me. I just want to know if you'll join me when I'm there. You're very connected to me, and someone with that close and strong of a connection will be an excellent harbinger.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of me had to admit, if T'Calu's return was inevitable anyway, would it be so bad if I were the catalyst of her change and get in her good graces? \"I'm not sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sexy smile formed on her mouth as she writhed seductively on the sofa, literally right next to me by now. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Doesn't this form appeal to you? You see this room, full of devices and restraints that could render me immobile. Don't you want to just strap me in one and tickle me senseless, make me squeal in unending laughter?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply her talking about it made me burn with the desire to do just that. Already my sex drives were running, and I hadn't even done anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I know you do. Your eyes say it. Your spirit screams it. That is exactly what you want to do to me, to lock my sexy body into one of these and make me laugh until I can't breathe. Imagine, not just me, but whoever you wanted, any girl, any woman in the world, all of them for you to tickle, tease, and torment to your heart's desire. The whole world at your fingertips.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind was on overload, and I was at serious war with myself. Maddie called me over to help her stop T'Calu's return, and the town would likely be hit hard simply because it was right there. But the world at my fingertips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yes. And not just the world - <i>me</i> at your fingertips as well. And you at mine. I know you love being tickled as much as tickling others, and you can do both here. Become my harbinger, tickle me here and now, to your heart's desire. I want you to do it. I'm <i>begging</i> you to do it.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was torn. If her return was inevitable, then I should do it. But I owed Maddie, the town, everybody. But the goddess was right there, her sexy body demanding to be touched, caressed, teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">C'mon, you know you want to. Tickle me.</span>\"</span></div></div>",

I <i>had to</i>, or else I'd have done the same to the tantalizing violet colored body that so eagerly offered itself to me. But my eyes were glued at T'Calu and my heart was making its best effort to pump blood into my already awoken penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy divine temptress seemed to be amused by my struggle. She leaned back, inching towards me with her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I love playing with mortals. Seeing them slowly lose control. Until they reach the point where all they need is a little... push.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she said \"push\", she kicked off one of her shoe, and lifted her leg. The most beautiful foot I've ever seen was dangling mere inches away from my face. It was so clean that only an ethereal being could have it, probably size 8, with high arch and long, elegant toes. Her sole had a little lighter hue of her skin's purple, with darker \"blushing\" at the parts that seemed to be the most sensitive. I smelled a fragrance similar to cinnamon and already thought if it tastes the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bit my lower lip to keep my already excited tongue in the prison of my teeth, but my hands slowly weakened their grasp on the armrest. My willpower made its final stand as those perfect toes started wiggling, like little dancers trained to seduce anyone they dance for. I couldn't vocalize a comprehensible word, so silently shook my head in refusal, but while doing it, against my will, my face was drawn closer and closer to the tempting foot of the goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes, you like what you see, don't you? I know what's on your mind. You want to touch it so bad. Feel the smooth skin against your fingertips. Maybe against your tongue. The urge to touch, to taste... It's getting irresistible. But please be careful, because my feet are very...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew how she'll finish the sentence and that it means my defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"...ticklish.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccumbing to my one and only desire that's left, completely forgetting about Maddie, The Eye of Kietelen and the laughing-fornicating end of the world, my right hand launched forward and grabbed the strong yet smooth and soft skinned calf. My left hand's fingers dug in between her toes to stretch her foot and I buried my face into the taut sole, not even sure if I wanted to worship or tickle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started running my sensation starving tongue over the tantalizing field of soft skin and sensitive nerve endings. Her wiggling, accompanied by a tinkling laughter worthy of a siren's song, was my reward. The best thing I've got in my life<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Ahhahahahaha keep... haha... keep going my chosen one! Don't stop! Sate your hunger. Hahahahaha Right there! Aaah On my arches! Feeheheheheeel it! Feel the pleasure I feel! Lehehet my power take over you.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offered her other foot too, making me overwhelmed with pleasure. My penis was throbbing on the edge of a mind blowing orgasm as I experienced our feelings becoming one. Only what seemed to be tickle torture to the inexperienced eye, turned out to be the ultimate pleasure for T'Calu, as all I got in return was pure pleasure as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur intertwined senses made me somewhat concerned about losing control, but the way her torment was funneled into my... <i>our</i> pleasure, how raking her sole with my fingers made me feel like someone was teasing my manhood with her hand and how sucking her toes felt like the best blowjob I can get, made me delve even deeper into tickling her feet. And our pleasure never ended, only reached higher and higher. I didn't have an orgasm, but I was in more pleasure than any earthly orgasm could ever give me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I felt myself slipping away. Even as she stopped the foot tease and climbed over me, exposing her sensitive navel and ribs, while slowly grinding against my aching penis, I knew that if I wanted to keep my sanity, I have to break free and do it now, because my chances are growing slimmer by the minute.</span></div></div>",

You felt compelled to continue your ticklish onslaught against her exquisite form, and you forced your hands to explore every inch of her upper body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started with her sides, switching between playful squeezes and light teases. She didn't hold back her laughter, but you could tell this was mild tickling for her. You were determined to force frantic laughter out of her, and you therefore took a more forceful approach when it came to her ribs. Kneading them relentlessly, T'Calu's laughter reaching new levels with each rotation of your thumbs. She somehow remained in full control of her body, not fighting the tickling or even pulling away from it. You know that had you not been restrained, your natural instinct of flight would have taken over by now. Yet she remained unmoved. You thought you made some progress in breaking the Goddess when you blew a wet raspberry in her perfect navel and followed up with your right hand tickling her belly button. She squeaked in delight at this and even arched her back, practically begging for it to continue. You obliged her, and after several rotations of methodical tickling, your pleasure as well as hers reached unearthly levels, but out of nowhere, all of it ceased suddenly. Her laughter died down, and you felt your hands locked behind your head, awaiting further magical manipulation. T'Calu spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clilac\">\"Thank you mortal, for such a thorough tickling. I haven't experienced anything so pleasant in some time.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed your shirt within an instant, and began teasing your tummy with a lone fingernail. It was enough to get you to constantly giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clilac\">\"I cannot wait to repay you in full, but for now I have other matters that require my full attention. While I move forward with my plans of invading your realm, you are to be tickled incessantly by one of my two most skilled ticklers. This may take days.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo women appeared out of the thin mist that inhabited this realm. One at each of T'Calu's flanks, you noted their beauty, as well as the fact that they were completely nude. To T'Calu's left, you see a lovely young lady with tanned skin, very similar in tone with that of a Hispanic girl. She looked as if she was from Mexico or perhaps Guatemala. It was hard to tell. She was a thinner build with short, black hair and brown eyes. Her breasts fit her smaller frame, but were still ample enough to catch your eye. She sported sharp looking nails, and you liked the way she presented them to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clilac\">\"This is Erica. She's my best light tickler. Her mastery of feathers and nails will drive you mad with giggles. I must admit it is quite pleasant, especially when she incorporates her soft lips into her routine. If you're looking for a less-maddening experience, I would certainly choose her.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then shifted your attention to your second option. Or should you say <i>options.</i> You didn't notice a third young woman standing behind T'Calu's second tickler. The one at the forefront was a stunning brunette, and behind her stood a blonde with similar features. Both ladies had more meat on them than Erica, with larger breasts, wider hips, and fuller tummies. They were both thoroughly eyeing your naked torso, as if they were planning your ticklish demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT'Calu introduced the brunette first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clilac\">\"This is Michelle and her partner Naomi. They're my two best forceful ticklers. They'll ignore any build-up and try to tickle as much laughter out of you as possible. They are relentless, and they have even broken me a few times, but I'm sure that might not be such a deterrent for a ticklish young man such as yourself.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder your options carefully. Or at least you try to, while T'Calu pokes and prods your tummy once more. You can experience a more pleasurable tickling with Erica; where she will likely tease your body in it's entirety with light, pleasant tickling. Or you can prep yourself for what T'Calu's true tickling wrath will be like, an all-out assault on your senses, maddening tickling from four hands, or perhaps even more. You have no idea what kind of magic any of the ladies are capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough your giggles, you eventually decide...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I choose Erica, T'Calu.\" Erica smiled at you with lust, and all of your surroundings faded away. You felt the remainder of your clothing slip away; first your socks peeled away from your feet, and next your pants unbuttoned themselves and slowly slid past your knees and then your ankles. Your boxers followed suit, and before you knew it, your nude form was manipulated against your will, stretched out in your favorite X position. However, this time you were not held by a frame or a table, and there was not a single inch of your body that wasn't exposed to the tickling you were so eagerly awaiting. You were simply floating, yet unable to move an inch. She could strike at any moment, and the anticipation was starting to get to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Erica appeared next to you. It startled you a bit, but she gently placed her hand on your chest, easing your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my new ticklish friend, how about you tell me all of your juiciest tickle spots. I want to know everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were slightly confused. You know she could easily figure that out for herself, and it would probably be more fun for her to do just that. Yet she still posed the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the she read your mind, she followed up by saying, \"I know I could just tickle them out of you, but I can heighten your pleasure much faster with the right information. And I expect you to do the same for me when T'Calu inevitably offers you some revenge tickling against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis somehow made perfect sense to you, and you gave up your tickle spots right away. \"My tummy is by far the most sensitive; belly button raspberries are enough to drive me wild. My feet are super ticklish to nearly anything; nails, brushes, tongues, even footsies. My inner thighs are ticklish to squeezing, just like everybody else. And my armpits and ribs might be better to focus instead of my feet if you tickle them simultaneously... I think that's everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" she replied. \"Just remember, I'm not trying to tickle you out of your mind, I just want you to enjoy every bit of what I give you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she struck. She moved between your legs and leaned over your belly, dipping her tongue into your belly button and blowing spontaneous raspberries in it. You cracked right away, giggling as she expertly gave you the tummy treatment with her hair. You felt a squad of feathers appear from nowhere traveling up your spine, teasing your back and shoulders. They would run their course and then dips back down to tickle your lower back and butt. You've never been tickled so well on your back/butt before, because there is normally a restraining device in the way of such areas. Yet Erica exploited those spots with ease. She ceased her raspberry assault and stood up straight. She lightly scratched at your inner thighs with her claws, earning several boyish laughs in return. You couldn't determine which was more effective, Erica's nails, or the feathers sweeping over your back and butt. A few devious feathers would venture outside the pack to tickle your balls, adding to your mounting pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your excitement, Erica summoned more feathers, sending a few to each foot, and a squad of five to your genitalia. The feet tickling was mild, yet effective. Feathers traced up and down each foot, occasionally sawing between your toes. The ones near your groin, however, were delightful. Two were committed to your balls, endlessly circling the tender flesh. One was focused on your now fully erect shaft. It stroked up and down to no end, and the remaining two feathers simply transitioned to help either of the two sets, adding to your mania. At this point, Erica had stepped around to your right side. She delicately teased and pinched your nipples, while her feathers continued their work. Your giggles and moans seemed to please Erica, her bright smile never leaving her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued your delightful torment. It seemed like days... It was days. Despite this, you never tired and your pleasure never ceased. Erica found new ways to exploit you for your laughter, but it eventually came to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT'Calu returned and you felt in control of your limbs again. Your clothes returned to your body and the residual sensation of being tickled had vanished. After such an event, your first request of T'Calu was to...</span></div></div>",

So why don't you?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if snapping out of a trance, my brain did a complete one-eighty. Why did I even consider it? The whole point of tickling, at least for me, was that both sides were having fun. I disliked tickling for self-fulfillment, and if I lusted for every girl and woman in the world to be tickled forever would I ever stop? Would I ever be appeased? Or would I just grow more depraved?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of my mental backflip, the goddess guided my hands to her skin, placing one on her bosom and the other on one of her sheer smooth thighs. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">You enjoy this, you desire this.

I said I'd help her find a way to stop this. She needed help. She wanted my help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling my hands away, I stood up and looked down at the skimpily dressed goddess, who was still leaning back on the couch. \"I'd like to, but insatiable lust doesn't sound all that appealling. I can think of a few other things I'd rather be than warden of every female on earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown creased T'Calu's perfect face. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Fine then, go and begin your futile search to stop me.

The enroaching vegetation was all there, vibrant and healthy green colors weaving a marvelous tapestry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scanned the surrounding area, and found what I was looking for. Tucked underneath a cluster of the creeping vines was Maddie, curled up and unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddie!\" I shouted, dropping my backpaxk and racing towards her. Grabbing fistfuls of the plant, I tore away at the undergrowth until Maddie was nearly completely uncovered. She was dressed in one of her usual outfits, baggy pants and a loose sweater, and her bangs that normally covered her eyes were brushed off her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked peaceful, as if only asleep. After shaking her gently a couple times and whispering her name in her ear, she slowly opened her eyelids revealing her stunning coral blue irises. For a moment I was entranced by her natural beauty, which she tried so hard to hide for fear of criticism. Stirring, she got up and looked around puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" she asked, a little shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Gateway of T'Calu,\" I told her. \"Her followers abducted you and made me come here.\" Even with my explanation though, she seemed a little distracted. Then I knew what happened. \"Did the Sable Feathers tickle you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, looking down and blushing furiously. \"Their touches are electric,\" she said. \"But I'm still not sure whether I hate it or love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind briefly sidetracked, thinking about Maddie developing an interest in tickling like myself. Then I quickly pushed all related thoughts further back in my memory, bringing forward some recent revelations. \"Maddie,\" I started. She looked at me, giving me her complete attention. \"The comet comes by in three days. That's when T'Calu will return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn shock, her eyes widened until they were nearly the size of ping-pong balls. \"What?!?\" Maddie exclaimed loudly. \"Three days? How are we supposed to stop her in three days?!? And how did you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the part where I come forward and apologize for doubting her and admit she was right all along. \"I sort of talked to T'Calu. She asked me to help her, but I refused. On my way out she said the offer only lasts three days 'until the nightfire burns'. Look, Maddie - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could finish, I found myself tackled and pushed onto the dirt floor, tightly embraced by Maddie's hug. \"It's okay,\" she reassured me. \"I know you didn't believe me, and that's perfectly fine. I wouldn't believe me under the circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she withdrew, she hovered over my face and looked into my eyes, here brilliant blue irises stunning me again. A mutual understanding passed between us, and as we got up we began to address the more important issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, how are we supposed to find a way to stop her and actually do it in three days?\" A shrug was the only answer I could afford. We were truly stumped; that is, until a third person entered the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Perhaps I can help,</b>\" a voice said in our heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie spun around, looking for whoever spoke and finding nobody. But I knew. Looking back at the Gateway, my gaze was returned by the Eye of Kietelen, his tentacles writhing. Based on my past experiences, I didn't know what to think of the Eye. His mistress was seductive and wanting, but he himself appeared genuine and honest during our conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Maddie a bit of time to realize that I was looking at something, and following my view I heard her gasp when she saw the stone carving move around like a living thing. \"Why would you help?\" I asked the Eye suspiciously. \"T'Calu is your goddess, is she not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Indeed, that is true,</b>\" confirmed the Eye. \"<b>But I am not directly bound to her. We simply exist in the same ethereal domain: insatiable lust and endless laughter. She is the more powerful between us, which is why she is my goddess, but I am largly independent of her machinations.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis explanation made sense, though part of me still remained suspicious. Maddie was still gawking. \"You still haven't answered my first question. Why help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Because while my mistress has spent several millennia in her realm, I've spent them here on earth, watching everything since the first primate that walked on two feet. I've seen a lot, and am quite pleased with what I see. I would prefer that it remain uninfluenced by the ethereal planes of existence, including T'Calu.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still wasn't quite sure whether I was buying into this or not, but Maddie, finally with her wits about her, seemed hitched on his story. \"If we listen to you we're taking a huge leap of faith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Trust is hard-earned, and rightfully so. It is far too easy to twist the truth or outright lie about a believable story. But there are also times when you must decide to invest trust in something that hasn't earned it because of time. You have three days to stop T'Calu, and I'm offering to help. You need to either take a leap of faith, or hurry and find your own way to stop her.</b>\"</span></div></div>",

While I have no doubt that you would be among T'Calu's greatest harbingers, I can see a spirit of nobility within you. Thus, to stop the Bringer of Laughing Torment and Delight from entering this plane of existence, you must destroy her gateway.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused, looking to Maddie with bewilderment. She met me with the same expression. \"Wait... aren't <i>you </i>the gateway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eye, although merely an etching on the stone, appeared to be amused.<b> \"No. I am merely the most sentient of her gateways. There exist others on this planet, some large enough to bring endless legions of fanatics into this world. Although I can whisk individuals back and forth between the ethereal realms and Earth, I do so at great cost... and only temporarily.\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you're saying,\" Maddie began, flicking her bangs away from her face, \"is that T'Calu uses other portals to invade Earth? That this... er... <i>you</i>... are merely an intelligent one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't have the power to bring her armies through,\" I added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Correct,\"</b> the Eye confirmed. <b>\"There are two portals with such power on this planet. One is buried under the sands of the Arabian Desert, and the other is hidden under the Pacific Ocean. Each of them is sealed within temple-cities long since lost to human history.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw practically dropped at the news. Maddie's bright blue eyes went as wide as saucers once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" I started, absently scratching my head. \"That's a bit of a problem, Mr. Kietelen. You see, there's no way we could get to those places in 3 days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eye chuckled. <b>\"But you forget, young humans. I am not merely a portal to T'Calu's realm. I can only send you to either of those regions. Unfortunately, that's all the help I can give you. You must find these portals yourselves and destroy them somehow.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie looked at me, and I sensed determination in her eyes. I gulped. She wasn't quite the shy neighbor I remembered from this morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled me close, whispering in my ear, \"We can do this. The cultists will never suspect two kids will try to destroy their portals. The book may give us some help, but we may find something useful in this so-called temple cities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, I remembered what T'Calu had said to me:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I will return, and when I do I will hunt you down, strip you, restrain you, and torture you even past your limits.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had certainly burned that bridge, so there was no going back. I <i>had </i>to try and stop the goddess from returning, even if it meant delving into ancient ruins. But I had no idea who... or what... we would face in these cities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie sensed my mood, and smiled a small flicker of a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eye looked to both of us. <b>\"Then it is agreed. Which portal shall you destroy first?\"</b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seemed the easier of the two, for who knew what was under the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Very well,</b>\" the Eye replied. \"<b>I wish you two luck on your first endeavor.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint humming sound emanated from all around us, and an unnatural breeze caress my face. The leaves were blown out of the way as the breeze strengthened into a gust, the winds spiraling around Maddie and me. She looked a little shaken, but I'd seen weirder in T'Calu's realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any advice on what to expect when we get there?\" I asked the Eye before we were sent off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Be on your guard</b>,\" he warned. \"<b>T'Calu's human followers have long since died out, but some of her beastly minions still watch over the city. Expect traps and tricks, but always be on the lookout for the Guardian of the Sands.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" I had to yell over the forceful gale, but I didn't get a response because at that moment tendrils of shadow reached up from the ground and pulled us under, my vision fading as all things ceased to exist for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stumbled as we landed, my legs not used to this type of travel. Maddie fared even worse next to me, her feet giving out from underneath her as she toppled to the floor. Extending a hand, I helped her up again and received a warm smile as thanks. With our recovery complete, we examined the room we were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone walls looked ancient, their sheer smooth surfaces still sanded to perfection despite their age, leading up to a ceiling that was about a dozen feet above us. Braziers lined the three walls, each with a fire burning inside that more than adequately lit up the space. Intricate friezes ringed the room, painted red with what I hoped was berry juice. There was some wear in the art, but overall it looked pretty intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the wall Maddie and I were facing was a large doorway nearly as tall as the ceiling, with carved decorations lining the entrance and two braziers at floor level, one on either side of the opening. It may once have served as a way out, but further down the passage we saw that it was filled with huge boulders and rocks that had collapsed and made transit impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like that way is a no-go,\" I said out loud, more for the sake of breaking the silence than anything else. Pulling the book out of my backpack again, I leafed through the withered pages for something on an ancient city beneath the desert. It seemed outlandish - I mean, if these cultists were in the Americas, why would they have anything on Arabia? - but I found a whole chapter devoted to this place deep in the pages,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check this out Maddie,\" I told her, excited about what I found. \"It says here that this city was built before even the Egyptians reached their height. There are several things that suggest that whoever built this was akin to the Nubians, back when the desert was still grassland thousands of years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And look here,\" I continued, not paying Maddie much attention. \"Apparently when the Egyptians found this place - and the creatures inside - they considered it a heathen temple, and waged war with it for centuries. Then the Romans found it, and desired the artifacts of great power they found within, so they tried to take it by force too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyped, I continued without pausing for breath. \"It says that after the Romans tried and failed to take the city, T'Calu used the power of the Orb of Ethereal to sink the city into the sands, hiding it forever. The Romans searched for a while, but gave up when Augustus Ceasar became emperor and recalled the troops for domestic use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething struck me, and as I read onward a plan began to form in my head. \"That's it!\" I exclaimed. \"It says that the Orb of Ethereal is the greatest power in the city, and is placed on a shrine that keeps the magic flowing through the temple. If it's removed, the magic will stop flowing and everything here rendered powerless - <i>including</i> the gate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's shout startled me, as I had been too engrossed in my own thoughts to notice she was staring shocked at whatever was behind us. Wary, I turned around... and gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderground city? Try underground <i>citadel</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a fourth wall, the 'room' we were in opened up to an absolutely massive cavern and a wide flight of stairs leading down into the temple-city. Towering structures and proud spires stuck up from the rocky floor, with detailed carvings and beautiful engineering obviously displayed in the many structures. There were streets, courtyards, plateaus, even fountains this far beneath the surface. Sand covered the spaces unevenly, giving it an abandonded look. Everything was lit up by a yellow glow that lit up from lines around the city, as if powered by energy that wasn't electrical. Then again, a magical explanation at this point would've been probable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe layout of the city itself reminded me of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris; like spokes from a wheel, there were six streets that shot out of a ringed road in the center of the city. Within the ring was a huge domed structure, not unlike the Pantheon in Rome, though it was much larger and much more decoratively designed. Maybe this was the original inspiration. A second look confirmed what I thought: the glowing yellow lines that flowed throughout the city all began from the domed temple, in the middle of the dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" was all I could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah whoa,\" Maddie quipped back. \"Nice plan and all, but how are we even going to <i>find</i> the Orb of Ethereal in this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a point. There was a lot of ground to cover if we were going to search from building to building, no way we were going to finish in a week let alone three days. Then again, considering the planning that went into this design, we may not have had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's there,\" I said with absolute certainty, pointing at the domed temple in the middle of the citadel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at me skeptically. \"How do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinct was yelling at me I was right, but it was more than just a gut feeling. Logic was on my side to. \"Think about it,\" I said. \"Whoever planned this put a lot of thought into making it look grand. If that's the case, then you don't just stash the Orb in some random house, you place it on a shrine that demands attention. And since the orb is the centerpiece of the magic here, why wouldn't it be in the central temple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of deliberate thought, Maddie gave in. \"That makes sense,\" she admitted, \"and we have to start somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a plan of action in mind, we started descending the unbelievably long flight of stairs into the city. Little did we know that something was going to interrupt our progress.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Funny how distances look so much shorter from higher ground. As soon as we reached the bottom of the stairs (the climb took all of fifteen minutes) we were dwarfed by the immense structures that lined the road. Since this was an old world city there was no such things as sidewalks, but the ruts made from carts were still visible even after thousands of years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most of the damage came from the ages, it was clear that the descent into the desert took its toll on the city. Grains of rock were piled unevenly across the street and in the buildings, some of which were full of sand, acting like a windowless container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind us, a large cluster of bugs flew around and slowly headed towards us, its buzzing softer than our ears could pick up at that distance. We didn't know they were there, but they knew we were there, as did every creature in the city by now. Deciding now was a good time to strike, the swarm flew quickly towards its first victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, we heard an ominous buzzing noise, as we turned around we saw a throng of what looked like miniature scarabs. Each one was no bigger than a fly, but there were so many that I couldn't fit them all in a jar if I tried. Maddie screamed at the sight of the bugs and we quickly turned and dashed in a mad attempt to outrun the swarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those things?\" she asked frantically, pushing herself harder than she evr had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever they are, we know what they're going to do, and we don't have the time! Let's split up and see if they follow both of us, if not maybe something in this book will help whoever's free get rid of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in agreement, Maddie quickly ran right while I veered to the left. The swarm adjusted course accordingly, altering its direction so that it closed in on me quickly. Once it was apparent I was their target, I turned back to Maddie who had stopped running and was watching me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The book!\" I shouted, throwing it over. The tome was heavy, but my strength was something I could be proud of and the dense pile of paper sailed over and landed at Maddie's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it!\" she yelled back, but I couldn't hear because the buzzing had already caught up with me. A cricle of flying scarabs trapped me, leaving me with no escape as I looked at the wall of black insects. The pause was excruciating, as if the scarabs were taking a moment to savor their catch. It easn't the tickling I feared, it was how much time we'd waste with these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, it began. A small detachment of bugs buzzed towards me, climbing over my face and neck. The light teasing wasn't much, but it kept me on edge. Some crawled behind my ears, caressing the sensitive skin there, while others annoyed my nostrils. I tried to swat them away, but they moved far too fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen more of the swarm joined in, approaching my spastic body. They buzzed around my torso, looking for skin to tickle but finding nothing but cloth. For a second I thought I'd won, but then a new sensation pressed into my skin that elicited a slight giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, I saw what was causing it. The bugs, frustrated that I wasn't unclothed, decided to make me so. Each scarab used its tiny mandibles to tear tiny holes in my quickly vanishing t-shirt. Alone, a few scarabs would take minutes to finish the job, but this was a swarm. My shirt lasted seconds at best, torn to shreds faster than I could take it off. Soon after my backpack hit the fround, the straps which held it eaten through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately I burst out laughing. With my shirt gone and effectively destroyed, there was nothing stopping the bugs from crawling all over my defenseless torso. Their little legs were covered in prickly bristles, tickling my belly and ribs tremendously. One even climbed into my navel, forcing peals of laughter from my lungs as I fell to the ground. It only got more intense when the bug tried to fly out, its wings brushing the walls of my deep belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaintly from beyond the buzz, I heard Maddie shouting something. \"Water!\" I heard. \"The bugs hate water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we knew how to get rid of them, but I was in no condition to go anywhere. Realizing this, Maddie took the plunge and burst through the ring of bugs, helping me up and together making our way to the closest fountain.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though my upperbody was being relentlessly teased by the bugs, with Maddie's support I was able to walk without too much difficulty. For some reason the swarm seemed to focus on me and leave Maddie largely alone, though occasionally one crawled into her sweater and elicited a few giggles from her. Maybe this was some form of T'Calu's spite, that I refused her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were almost at the fountain when it happened. The swarm, as if realizing our plan, doubled their efforts to slow me down. All of the remaining scarabs buzzing around us flew towards my shorts and sandal straps, beginning to eat away at the material. Pretty soon they both had been torn to smithereens as well, leaving me in nothing but my boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they attacked. Bristly legs started brushing and climbing all over my legs, up and down my inner thighs, behind my knees, even the tops of my feet. The maddening touches sent me into new fits of laughter, and I fell to the ground unable to walk while the scarabs tickled my legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing so was a mistake however. As soon as my feet left the ground, the scarabs began crawling all over my soles. My arches, my heels, my insteps, even my toes all got the same tickly treatment as the rest of my body. I had begun to laugh silently, air forced out of my lungs as I kicked my legs in a futile attempt to dislodge the bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically, Maddie tried to brush the bugs of my legs so that we could keep going, but whenever she did the bugs just started crawling onto her, going in her sleeves while she shook them out. Then she had a horrible idea. As she tried to wipe the scarabs off of my feet, her fingernails accidently brushed some of my soles, tickling tremendously more than the bugs. She kept doing it for a while, and I thought she may be enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for me, I couldn't think too much about the situation. Too many ticklish thoughts filled my brain for me to really analyze it. To be honest it was quite a fun experience, but the time limit always sat nagging in the back of my mind, and for that reason we couldn't afford to go through too many of these encounters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally feeling that she was doing more harm than good, Maddie resigned to grabbing my ankles and dragging me across the sandy street. It was quite a scene, a teenage girl dragging a near-naked hysterical boy across the street, but then again today wasn't an average day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Maddie dropped my legs, I noticed vaguely that we were by a fountain. It was a small one, the semicircular pool protruding from the building with the water pouring a snake's head a couple feet above the ground. Already the bugs were getting nervous, which made them scamper around my skin even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult for her, but Maddie managed to lift me by my arms and kind of drag me into the fountain. Wherever the water touched me the scarabs buzzed away even more quickly than they came, dispersing far away from the liquid. When finally my feet entered the cooling pool, the last of the bugs fled, leaving me to recover in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, I sat up, soaked to the bone. While I was down, Maddie had retrieved both the book and my strapless backack, leafing through the tome and reading about the city and - more importantly - the creatures in it. She saw me rise, and she extended a hand to help me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, wasn't actually that bad,\" I reassured her, taking her hand and lifting myself up. \"Did you enjoy tickling my feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what? I wasn't - I was trying to help you,\" she stammered, her cheeks blushing furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admit it,\" I prompted. \"You liked it, even if it was accidental at first. I noticed how you didn't stop, and I know you're bright enough to see when an idea isn't working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie had no answer except to hide her face with her hair, cheeks reddening. She knew I was right, and she didn't know what to think about her unexpected pleasure of tickling me. Letting the subject drop, I stepped out of the fountain and rested an arm around her shoulders, pulling her in for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she pulled away, her cheeks were still red. Following her eyes, it was my turn to blush as I remembered that the scarabs had torn all my clothes except my now drenched boxers. I looked over to the shreds of my shorts and shirt, as well as my now strapless sandals. They were all worse than useless now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" I said. Really it wasn't that uncomfortable for me - people have seen me wearing less - but with Maddie as reserved as she was the entire situation was awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We-we should keep moving,\" she said, clamping the book into her chest and pushing forward, still blushing furiously. Lifting my bag by one of the torn straps, I followed dutifully. Both of us were determined to reach the dome before we were interrupted again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's amazing how much time passes when you're sightseeing. Sometime during our journey, Maddie regained enough of her confidence to stop hugging the book and start reading it. Whether she found anything helpful or not I didn't know, but whatever she found caught her attention as she was shortly deeply engrossed in the book. As for me, I looked around the abandoned citadel we were traveling through, looking at the magnificent and majestic buildings that stood tall and proud, decorated with carvings and balconies and stone statues. The architecture reminded me strongly of some Turkish and Arabic styles, with a hint of Roman on some of the statues and fountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently both of us were so enraptured by our thoughts that we almost literally ran right into the enormous temple. The entire thing was circular save for the entrance, which had the square opening barred by stone pillars much in the style of Roman or Greek architecture. The outside was relatively simple save for some friezes wrapped around the walls and a series of mosaics depicting various... ticklish scenarios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie just stood there for a second, looking up at the massive structure in awe, then her gaze met mine and I saw a shadow of doubt pass over her face. I'm sure I wasn't the most reassuring figure standing there in my boxers, but I did my best to smile and comfort her that way. A ghost of a smile tugged at her lips. \"You ready?\" she asked timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are,\" I replied, walking up and resting a hand on her shoulder like I would whenever I convinced her to do something incredibly stupid with me. It happened pretty often, but nothing I've ever done was as crazy as what we were doing that day. Together, we entered the large domed temple, unsure of what we'd find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a large open space lavishly decorated with wide couches and low-lying bed-like furniture. Short tables were also scattered around, covered in sand and empty goblets and plates. The room looked like it was once a grand foyer or something to that effect, maybe a relaxation lobby while people tried to get inside. Whatever was inside, it must've been popular as there was enough to easily sit hundreds of people. The empty tableware created a completely deserted atmosphere, much like those western ghost towns where everything's still there, except this was considerably older than the western frontier in America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards the back was a balcony overlooking the space, similarly furnished and similarly deserted. Two straight stone staircases led up to it on either side of the room, allowing easy access. In the center of the back wall, below the balcony, was a tall and wide door about a third of the size of the front entrance. At one time it might have been lit marvelously, and I could see the braziers lining the hall, waiting to be lit. Only it had been centuries since a flame had found this place, the only light coming from the glowing strips of light outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to go,\" I said, taking the lead and tentatively stepping into the dark corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Orb of Ethereal is placed in a chamber at the top of the temple, in the dome,\" Maddie informed me. \"Only the High Priests of T'Calu were allowed to enter, and many traps were set up along the way for those who didn't belong. We should watch our step.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good advice,\" I told her, now keeping my eyes on the clay-colored floor. A thought struck me, and after fishing around in my backpack I pulled out a good old flashlight. \"Do you want this?\" I asked Maddie, who nodded appreciatively as she took it and turned it on, shining it deeper into the building. It was nice to actually see where we were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long we came to a fork in the road. Two passages we could take to continue, each one with a carving in the wall that suggested what might be further down the path. It was like one of those bad adventure movies where the hero has to make a choice based on a carving, chooses the wrong one, then performs a stunning acrobatic feat and avoids falling into a lethal trap, then continues on like a badass. The traps for me and Maddie probably weren't lethal, but neither of us were astonishing acrobats. If we chose the wrong passage, chances were we'd fall right into the trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know which one we should pick,\" Maddie said helpfully. \"Neither look very good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hallway was marked with a feather and the other with a twisting funnel of sand like those cartoon sandstorms. The obvious thought would be that the feather was a trap and we shouldn't go that way, but then again tickling was the entire focus of this religion. It'd be what they strive to achieve. Also the Eye of Kietelen's last words before we left stirred something; 'be on the lookout for the Guardian of the Sands' is what he said. Perhaps the sandstorm meant that the guardian was in that direction and we should avoid it, like avoiding the Minotaur in the labyrinth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, I didn't have a damn clue as to which way we should go. A flipped coin would've worked just as well as my guess.</span></div></div>",

Not a crack in the floor suggested that this was a trapped corridor, and I inwardly breathed a huge sigh of relief.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, if we haven't run into a trap yet we probably-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was caught of mid-sentence with the sensation that I was falling. My back pack had landed on the ground above me as a chute just big enough to fit me opened seemingly out of nowhere. Behind me, Maddie screamed and started calling my name. It happened so fast that I didn't even have time to react until Maddie's shouts were a distant whisper, and by then nothing I could have said would have made a lick of difference. All I could do was let the chute take me wherever it led and mentally kick myself for not paying attention.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not a minute later the chute flattened out and I landed with a thud on the sand. Mourning the dull pain in my backside, I tried to look around the room. Unfortunately the yellow strips of light that were outside didn't line the room, leaving me in complete darkness. My other senses weren't very helpful either; I couldn't hear anything save my own breathing, and my sense of smell wasn't sharp enough to pick up anything nearby.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, out of the blue, I felt incredibly exhausted and spent, My body did not want to move another muscle, despite my best efforts to stay focused. My mind was cloudy, all thoughts being pushed aside to make room for one that was not my own: sleep. Every part of my body yelled and craved for it, even though I knew I should press forward and find a way out. I took a step and immediately collapsed onto the sand. Everything was so difficult now. I couldn't go anywhere like this. As much as I didn't want to, I had to sleep, otherwise I wouldn't be able to do anything. So what if I just close my eyes, put my head down on the sand for a second. The nice comforting sands, beckoning to me, calling me to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I jolted awake, only to find that I could barely move. A quick full-body squirm told me everything I need to know about how I was restrained: from my rear to my elbows was a bench or chair or whatever, over which my arms were tied over the end so my underarms were completely exposed. My ankles were also tied to the supporters, forcing my legs to either side and my feet off the ground. Just being in such a vulnerable position made my cock twitch, which brought to light that I no longer had the privilege of my boxers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was no way this happened naturally because of my sleepwalking, nor could any of the traps likely been intricate enough to expose me so thoroughly. Someone had stripped and tied me, and whoever they were would be back. The question was, why leave me?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Slowly but surely, some yellow light brightened from the edges of my vision. I turned my head, one of the few things I could move, and saw on the floor something begin to glow with the same yellow light that lined the streets outside. Once my eyes had adjusted, I recognized the shape. The object was a feather, glowing somewhat dimly in the otherwise completely dark room. A yellow outline seemed to glow faintly, giving the feather a look of gold.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, to my astonishment, the feather began to rise of its own volition. Nothing was holding it, nor was it attached to any rope and string I could see. My gaze was fixated on it as it traveled over to my vulnerable form, slowly swimming through the air. The more I thought about it however, the more it made sense with the rest of this nonsensical day. Of course the traps wouldn't just be simple like a pitfall or a chute, it had to be magical. Though a gut feeling told me this wasn't part of the trap.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Drifting down to my armpit, the deliberate feather never paused and went straight to teasing the exposed flesh with its soft bristles. Immediately I was thrashing myself and trying to escape, the incredibly ticklish feelings shooting across my underarm. Despite my attempts to escape, the caress of the feather was one that I craved for and this one seemed to do its job a thousand times better than any other that had been used on me. Already I felt my loins begin to stir. As I laughed to my heart's content, the feather appeared to glow brighter as it continued its work. The tip traced delicate circles in my hollow, sending me into hysterics. Deathly ticklish is what my many ticklers describe me as. Even this single feather had me laughing incessantly, flailing as far as able.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The longer I laughed, the brighter the feather glowed until it was shining with bright golden light, at which point it began to rise above my body. When it got so bright I had to squint, I saw another piece of magic that surprised me at first then sort of fell into line with the rest of what I'd seen. When the light died down, there were two identical feathers floating before me, back to dimness of the first time. Somehow the feather had duplicated a completely identical copy, and as the original (though it could've been the copy for all I know) went back to my underarm its counterpart joined in teasing my other one. Now I was a step further along the road to mania, my laughter and struggling increased as both my armpits got equal amounts of due torture. The feather bristles gently grazed my hyper-sensitive flesh, twirling in mad circles or tracing shapes in my taught hollows as I tried in vain to escape their pleasurable touch.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before long they were glowing again, and when they rose I looked away this time to avoid being blinded. As I suspected, when I swiveled my head back around I saw four feathers, each one with the faint golden light and completely identical to each other. No time was wasted as two returned to my armpits, giving them the same tickly treatment they'd been receiving for the last few minutes. The new pair had skipped the rest of my body and went straight for my feet, dipping below my vision. Touches of electricity sparked through my soles as the feathers glided up and down my arches, sweeping their bristles across my feet. There was practically no wiggle room for my feet as my toes were tied to something on the floor, forcing my feet to stay open and accessible.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another minute of near-mania and the feathers shone once more. When they were finished all eight descended without delay, picking out targets and tickling them as if the feather lived their whole lives tickling me. While my armpits and feet were getting their due treatment, the new four went to my ribs and played with those. The tips of each feather danced across my ribs, diving into the crevices and sweeping from my chest to my belly, covering every inch of available skin above my tummy and below my neck. My cheeks were flushed red by now, burning with all the blood that was rushing to them, my mouth frozen in a laughing position.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As I laughed and laughed and laughed some more, the feathers began to shine. Somewhere among the whirlwind of ticklish thoughts in my head I was able to make the connection that my laughter was powering this feather, which meant the more I laughed the worse it would get. Of course, the worse it got the more I laughed, and my mind went reeling with what that implied.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sixteen feathers now preyed on my body, the new ones going to my legs and looking for skin to tease there. A couple entertained themselves twirling behind my knees, earning some leg jolts as I tried to shake them off. Those that were left paid my thighs a visit, sweeping their bristles up and down my taught thighs. Literally shaking with the intensity of these tickles, half of me begged for it to end soon so I could find and help Maddie and the other half begged for it to never end. The thigh feathers traveled from my knee all the way to my groin, being sure to get my inner thigh in their sweeps. The edges of the feathers brushed my genitals as they passed, arousing me even more.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By now, the light was so blinding that I had to close my eyes and look away else risk burning my retina. When I looked up, I had a moment to find beauty in the thirty two feathers that flew around gracefully in the air, each with its own golden light. There was a certain scenic aspect to it, something that urged be to take a picture or something. It truly was beautiful, though pretty soon I was laughing too hard to care.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No part of my body went untouched. My belly alone had a squad of feathers tracing shapes and writing letters, sweeping up and down my sides or tickling the soft underbelly area between the pelvis and the belly button. One evil little feather starting spinning right in front of my eyes, then quickly flew over to my tummy and started drilling into my navel, forcing tears to my eyes and sending my to a heavenly hell. But what was far more effective were the feathers playing between my legs. A collection decided it would be fun to gather around and twirl around my ball sack, setting the bundles of nerves there on fire while another few glided up and down my hard-on. One devious feather had fun playing with the tip of my cock, teasing with its bristles the skin at the very top. I struggled as best I could for my instinct's sake, but the feather was able to follow my bouncing tip as if it were locked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in her realm, I'm sure T'Calu was enjoying herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Time seemed to stretch as the feathers continued their work all over my horribly exposed body, their number in the thousands by the end of the first hour. Along the way, I discovered that they also possessed the ability to change size, a rather ticklish revelation when a whole bunch decided to shrink and make a ring inside my navel, spinning and tickling the walls at speeds faster than an electric saw. Another group did the same to my stiff member, circling around it at similar speeds, making several rings up and down my erection, arousing me as well as tickling me shitless. At one point I began to grow faint, but on the verge of passing out the glow of the feathers extended to my face, and suddenly all signs of fatigue vanished, leaving me ready to experience another round of induced mirth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Like I said, I can't remember exactly how much time had passed, but I think it was something like nearly two hours before I heard something besides my own laughter - which was silent more often than not. Bare feet padded on the stone floor, occasionally muffled by the clusters of sand that dotted the building and the entire city. A figure entered my field of vision, but my eyes were so teary that I couldn't make out a single detail. Whoever it was stood there for a long while, watching me in my heavenly hell. It was hard to tell considering that I couldn't see a damned thing, but it seemed that my visitor enjoyed this.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As I continued to laugh, I realized with a shock that I was no longer being tickled, that the golden glow of the feathers was gone, replaced with a white glow from somewhere above the figure, and the electric sensations coursing through my nerves had stopped. It was still another minute or two before I could actually stop laughing, and even then I was still giggling slightly as the phantom remnants of the soft touches still covered my skin. Blinking away the tears, I took another look at my visitor.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Smiling at me was a tall woman, exotically clothed and beautifully shaped. A thin gold circlet crowned her head, holding back a waterfall of jet black hair that fell straight down her body like those cartoons of Egyptian women. She wore a sheer white dress that was so thin I could almost see through it, falling all the way to her ankles and exposing two cute small feet. On one of the fingers of her left hand sat a gold ring with a turquoise stone embedded in it, on which was the carving of a feather. Her irises were grey, and in those smiling eyes I sensed a wisdom that had seen far more things than her apparent youth implied.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you are the intruder who fell prey to one of my simplest traps,\" she said to me in a very rich voice once my giggles had subsided. \"You are a terribly ticklish young man with a charming laugh. Watching you being subjected to my feather was most delightful, especially when you tried to squirm away.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still gasping and recovering, I could only think of one thing to say. \"Who... are... you?\" I asked between breaths.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The edges of her mouth pulled into a grin. \"I am Qumsal, Guardian of the Sands. And you are a very ticklish trespasser, victim to the teasing tortures I have in store for you at my leisure, unfortunately for you.\" As her eyes wandered down my sweaty body, they settled on my soldier, still standing at attention. \"Though perhaps unfortunately is not the best word for it.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Guardian of the Sands. Why did that title sound familiar? The almost two-hour session I had gone through embedded a lot of my recent memories deep inside my brain somewhere. I was exploring a temple with Maddie, I fell into a trap, we were here to... to...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There is a trace of T'Calu's essence on you mortal,\" Qumsal observed, intrigued. \"It mingles with your own, intertwining to make something magnificent. You have been to her realm recently, where some of the ethereal residue must have clung to your essence.\" With her forefinger, she tapped the side of her head while cocking to one side, a classic gesture for thinking. \"Ah, you must be the young master who refused to become her harbinger. It is clear why she offered, your mirth essence is quite... marvelous. And you have the cutest reaction to tickling I've seen in a while.\" She flicked a nail across my hip, earning a jolt and unbecoming squeal for her effort. \"I would love to have been your concubine, at your side while you conquered the world...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oh yeah, now I remembered. We were here to stop an insane goddess of eternal tickling from unleashing her armies on the world and filling it with insatiable lust and desire and pleasure, effectively turning every human into a tickle-crazed mindless machine. More specifically, we were here to remove a portal's source of power so it could not open for T'Calu's armies. And now I was caught, leaving Maddie essentially on her own to solve this problem. Not only that, but this woman who had caught me was the Guardian of the Sands, the very being the the Eye of Kietelen told us to avoid and beware. Absolutely terrific.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Although I must say, this outcome is just as pleasurable, for me at least. Such a sensitive young master, exposed to whatever teases I desire. You are just so incredibly ticklish, and your reactions are just so captivating!\" She took a moment to flutter her fingers across my belly, turning me into a giggling mass of horny jelly again, shaking under her touch. A sort of enraptured gaze washed over her face, an ambrosial fascination with my quivering flesh. Pulling her hands back, she watched me recover for the second time. \"And with another source of power for the portal, the process will surely be shortened by a couple days.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you talking about?\" I asked when I was able. \"What does 'another source of power' mean?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A very sexy chuckle escaped her lips as she held up a white feather, the same feather that had put me through my torturous ordeal for the last two hours I realized. \"All magic to do with T'Calu is powered by mirth through tickling. You probably noticed it when this delightful little tool here was going at you. It duplicated each time it reached a certain amount of power. Each duplication required more power, but at the same time there were more feathers to induce more mirth and thus sustain the growing number of feathers. As wondrous as it is, it doesn't just start itself however. I needed to tickle myself with it for a second before it could begin work on you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trying to take my mind off of the image she just pushed into my head, I continued my inquiry. \"I thought that everything here was powered by the Orb of Ethereal?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It is,\" was Qumsal's mind-boggling answer. \"The Orb of Ethereal keeps this city going, and will energize the portal once the nightfire burns, but that covers only half of the magic required. Put in basic terms, the Orb provides an essential and root magical power supply. Tools more specific like this feather and the portal require a source of more specialized magic in addition to the base magics as well. The Orb provides the base energy needed to power more potent magic items like portals, and the tickle victims provide the energy specific to tickling.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My mind was dancing in circles trying to wrap itself around this concept of many types of magic, but I was beginning to understand. There was pure magic like that which the Orb provided, there was mirth magic like that which powered the feather, and more powerful tools like the portals required both kinds.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I imagine that T'Calu will want to punish you for refusing her offer, and most probably that punishment will have you kept in a perpetual state of tickling for eternity. I can see the allure, it would be a pleasant way to spend the rest of time...\" Unable to resist, Qumsal reached out and lazily dragged her fingers across my exposed ribs, rewarded with a stream of giggles. At my reaction, she smiled almost dreamily and continued the deliberate movement of her digits.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite the distraction, my mind was working quickly. We were running out of time, and we needed all that we could get. If I could only get out of here, then I would perhaps be able to find my way up and more quickly deal with the Orb of Ethereal. The only way out of here however was through Qumsal, and she showed no signs of giving me a chance to escape. Perhaps I could bargain with her, get her to help, but then I didn't exactly have much to offer. Even my clothes were stripped from me. Then, a desperate idea for a bargaining chip formed in my head, and since it was all I had I decided to give it a shot.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ihihihihif yohohohou hehelp mehehehehe yohohohou cahahahan tihihihihihickle mehehehe ahall yohohohou wahahanteehehehe.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was desperate, but I had nothing else to offer. In fact, Qumsal was so surprised by my proposition that she actually stopped tickling me. Her eyes focused on my own. \"All I want, however I want, wherever I want, whenever I want? That's a tempting offer young master.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sensing the clear interest in what I'd said, I quickly confirmed. \"Yes, however, wherever, whenever, with whatever. Just help me and Maddie stop the return of T'Calu and my body is yours to be tickled.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was obvious Qumsal was considering the offer hard. Apparently, having someone with a cute reaction to tickling meant a lot, or maybe something to do with my essence. I didn't care. With one index finger she tapped her temple in thought, with the other she drew slow and sloppy shapes across my taut belly, keeping me giggling while she pondered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Very well young master,\" Qumsal said after a minute or two. \"I accept your generous offer. Just remember your promise, and I will do whatever you ask of me.\" As she finished speaking, the rope that had once restrained me so tightly now fell slack, the knots untying themselves in accordance to Qumsal's magic. Finally free of the awkward position, I stood up and stretched as high as I could, relieving the tension in my muscles. Qumsal just couldn't resist and reached her manicured fingers into my armpits, the golden nail polish catching the light. Immediately I burst out laughing and brought my arms down, but as I've discovered many times when the hands are in the underarms it is already too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollapsing to the sandy floor, I did my best to lose Qumsal's questing fingers, but they managed to follow me. I had the willpower to raise my arms as I dropped, relieving my hollows of the devious nails, but the digits just went to work darting around my body and sneaking in a few tickles randomly across my torso: a pinched rib, a poked belly, a scratched side. They weren't outright torturous, but the little teases had me giggling incessantly and jolting every which way in an impossible escape attempt, since I had no way to predict the sorceress' next move. Pretty soon I found myself curled up into a ball on the floor, helpless before the quick attacks of those menacing fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of her fun, Qumsal chuckled and offered me her hand. \"Come young master,\" she said in her rich soothing voice. \"We should reunite you with your companion, then together we will make our way to the top of the temple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took the offered hand, and after hoisting me up Qumsal smiled warmly at me, and, surprisingly, I found myself smiling back. I'm not quite sure why, but for some reason I was beginning to grow fond of my former tormentor and jail keeper. Admittedly she was strikingly beautiful - I know of a few supermodels who'd kill for a figure like her's - but it was more than an aesthetic attraction that drew me to her. Shelving the thought, I quickly returned my attention to the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea where she'd be?\" I asked worriedly. The last time Maddie had seen me I was falling down a trapdoor, following a chute to an entirely different part of the temple. There's no way she'd follow me down, but at the same time she wouldn't abandon me either. She was probably looking for me somewhere in the temple for the last two hours. That's what worried me. She could've been anywhere, looking for me everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can faintly feel her essence,\" Qumsal told me. \"She's somewhere on the higher floors, looking for a way down. I cannot pinpoint her exactly, but it should become easier once we move to her level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then let's get moving,\" I said with conviction. Inwardly, I was impressed at Qumsal's immediate and definite answer, though I suppose having magic helps in situations like these. Leading the way, the nubile sorceress started walking down one of the passageways, a dim ball of white light illuminating just enough for use to see a bit ahead and behind. I followed closely, looking for anything that might be a trap ahead of us. Qumsal seemed to know her way around, but you could never be too careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQumsal interrupted the silence. \"Master, may I ask how you first learned of the goddess T'Calu?\" she asked. \"Her name is not commonly known amongst the people of the modern world, and those who know it only remember her as some fictional idol that insane cultists worshipped. How did you leave your ignorance of the ethereal planes and become introduced to this magical existence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" I began, \"it started with a book Maddie's parents found. A great big old thing, filled from cover to cover with details about T'Calu and the history of her followers in the new world. It had a whole history about this place, as well as a beastiary of all the known creatures here who serve T'Calu. It came in handy a couple times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A book?\" Qumsal looked at me quizically. \"How did any book from the T'Calu's time survive the ages? The ancient tomes, if left unpreserved, would have decayed centuries ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this one isn't atually a tome from T'Calu's age,\" I explained. \"This is more of a collection of pictures and written works gathered by some cultists during the post-colonial era. Some are written interpretations of ancient texts, some pages have pictures of ancient things that few people can understand anymore.\" I glanced at a particularly conspicuous slab loose slab of stone, but it turned out to be nothing and we walked right by it. \"I don't believe it's a proper substitute for any of those old tomes you mentioned, but it's enough to get by in one of these citadels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Left,\" Qumsal remarked, following her own command and turning down the left passage, her floating ball of light only a couple feet from her at any time. \"You will have to show me this book when we have finished our work here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddie has it right now, it's in the backpack I dropped when I fell into the trap.\" We spent the next few minutes in silence, Qumsal never slowing. She led us up some stairs, past a few more turns, then up another flight of stairs. Roughly ten minutes into our journey, Qumsal stopped without explanation.</span></div></div>",

Just as I went to ask Qumsal where Maddie was, I heard the faint sound of laughter echoing against the stone walls. I started to run towards the source of the sound, Qumsal following me with a look of slight amusement on her face. It didn't take too long to find Maddie, her laughter getting louder and more desperate with each step I took and I found it hard not too smile upon coming across her predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corridor we had been rushing through had opened up into a small enclave with a statue on either end, both in the shape of woman that looked (Rather unsurprisingly) like Qumsal herself. It seemed that at least one of these statues was a trap however as Maddie was hanging in mid-air, her arms having been grabbed onto by the statue's hands and she had been yanked several feet into the air. The book lay on the ground underneath Maddie as did the tattered remains of her trousers as a second pair of arms had sprouted from the statue's waist and had seemingly Maddie's lover body of her trousers, ripping them to pieces and leaving her clad only in her panties above her ankles and below her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue was using this exposure to great effect as the stomach had opened to reveal a stick holding numerous golden feathers, not unlike a very rich looking feather duster, that was currently in the process of tormenting Maddie's cute tush. The feathers rotated at an agonisingly slow pace, taking care to tease and torment as much of Maddie's butt as they could, her thin panties offering little in the way of protection against the plumes brushing up against her highly sensitive ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickling was making Maddie go wild and she thrashed as much as she could in her position, her eyes screwed up and I could even see tears trickling down her face. I filed away the fact Maddie had a ticklish butt away for a later date, would prove fun to exploit at some point. I tried to focus on the matter at hand and a steady growth in my loins reminded me of my nudity just as Maddie's begging reached a new height \"AHHAASOOMMEEBODEEHEHEEPPLEEASEHEHEHEELLPPAAAHAHAA!!!\" She screamed through her laughter, thrusting her hips forward with each swipe the feathers made against her buns but unable to ever escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I strip her of her remaining clothes before we free her?\" Qumsal asked, making me jump as I had been enjoying the sight before me so much I'd forgotten she was standing there \"Although the statue hasn't shown all of its abilities yet. We could leave her there and witness it if you so wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to admit, that idea has a very high appeal to it although leaving Maddie like that seemed far too cruel. Pondering for only a few moments, I decided too...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How do we turn off the trap?\" I asked. Sure, watching Maddie in this position was fun, but I agreed to help her stop T'Calu, and it would just be too cruel to make her suffer even more than she already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking somewhat disappointed, Qumsal answered. \"These traps were designed to capture intruders, not detain them. Each of them has an easy way of disabling and resetting the trap.\" She pointed at the other statue, opposite the one where Maddie hung laughing and screaming. \"Push my foot on that statue, and that should free your companion. It won't restore her clothes however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the stone duplication of the sorceress, I couldn't help but marvel at how remarkable the craftsmanship was. The original and the copy looked nearly identical, a fact that wasn't wasted when I reached for the stone foot, nearly as pretty as the real thing. In fact, aside from the lack of gold nail polish, I might have mistaken the smooth pale stone for Qumsal's real foot. Pushing down, I felt a bit of resistance as the rock sank into the pedestal. I heard a lot of movement behind the wall, and when I looked back at Maddie I saw the golden feathers retreat into the statue's stomach while the arms lowered my still giggling friend to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few seconds, but eventually Maddie's toes and their sky-blue nails touched the floor. When she was standing firmly on her feet, the statue's hands let go and returned to what I assumed was their original position. Giggles still escaped her lips, but for the most part she had recovered from the embarassing assault on her butt. Wiping the tears from her face, she looked up in what was at first an expression of surprise, then relief as she pulled me for one of the biggest hugs I've ever received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I thought you were gone! I've been looking for you for so long, I thought they'd gotten you for good! And then I stepped into this trap, and I thought we were gonna be stuck here forever!\" She pulled back and smiled at me, and for a second I thought she might start crying again. \"I'm so glad that you weren't taken, thank you so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she noticed that someone else was watching and turned to face Qumsal, who had been standing there and watching us the entire time. I could see a deceptively warm smile on her face, but I could feel that she was amused at the reunion. I blushed a little, slightly embarassed, but if Qumsal was helping us I could count her a a friend, so overall it wasn't that shaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Maddie began nervously, all traces of her joy replaced by a sudden fear and a hint of distress. \"Who's she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I was about to introduce her, the sorceress spoke up and did it herself. \"I am Qumsal, Guardian of the Sands and the one who helped free both you and your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction was instantaneous. Maddie jumped back, wary and scared of the nubile woman who stood calmly and expectantly, as if she knew she would react this way. My timid friend began walking back slowly, her entire body trying to shy away from the sorceress. \"You're... you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Maddie,\" I said reassuringly, putting a hand on her shoulder. \"Qumsal has agreed to help us stop T'Calu's return. She already freed me from the trap, and I believe we can trust her.\" I didn't mention that Qumsal had been the one to tie me up and set the feather on me in the first place, or what I had to offer to ger her to agree, but those were things she didn't need to know. As it was, I was half afraid she might turn and run for it, but luckily that fear was unfounded as Maddie turned to face our new ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" she asked, still hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI answered with a firm nod of my head. \"I trust her completely.\" A half-truth, but if it would get Maddie to trust her then it served its purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill cautious, Maddie slowly approached Qumsal, who was still smiling. The two looked at each other for some time while Maddie drew closer, reaching out her hand for a shake when she got close enough. \"M-my name is Maddie,\" she stammered. \"Good t-to meet you, Q-Qumsal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Qumsal reached out as if to take the offered hand, but she missed it completely and kept going. \"This is how we greeted people in my time,\" she explained mysteriously. Both Maddie and I were confused, until I noticed where Qumsal's hand would end up. The sorceress' long and pointy nails snaked underneath \u00a0Maddie's sweater and made contact with her side, pinching and kneading the skin. The effect was spontaneous. Maddie backed away, giggling, Qumsal's fingers still working on her soft skin. It surprised me, but what happened next surprised me more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I was about to tell Qumsal to stop, Maddie darted her hands forward and started fiddling with her Qumsal's sides. It was obvious Qumsal wasn't expecting it either as she nearly doubled over before responding my reaching out and tickling Maddie's other side. Both were locked in this tickling circle, Qumsal's musical laughter and Maddie's cute giggles filling the passage. Honestly, I was having a good time just watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes when it was clear neither of them were giving up, I decided enough was enough. \"Alright you two, stop it,\" I tried, but they kept at it, both hunched over trying to protect their ticklish torsos. I had to step between them before they would finally break the chain. \"Knock it off, we have stuff to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you complaining?\" Maddie asked with a spirit I didn't expect from her. \"I thought you were into tickling and all that?\" Too late, I realized that while she was talking Maddie had snuck her hands to my own sides and were now working on them like she was with Qumsal's, tickling the skin with gentle but firm pinches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, I recoiled and stepped backwards... right into Qumsal. \"She's not nearly as ticklish as you, young master,\" she told me. \"Your sensitivity is much more enjoyable.\" With that, she reached around me and started kneading my ribs. Instinctively I tried to back up, but my back was already against Qumsal's body and she wasn't letting me go anywhere. Left with nothing to do but laugh, that's exactly what I did, my arms trying but failing to push either set of hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, there were worse positions to be in than at the hands of a very pretty childhood friend and a beautiful young woman. Then again, the situation was a little urgent.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finding the energy to push off my attackers, I quickly stumbled away. Neither of them chased me, just smirked at me, amused and quite content with their fun. I took a few seconds to recover, then tried to shift their attention back to the task at hand. \"Have you girls had enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Qumsal admitted, \"but I'm willing to wait until you're in a more submissive mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done for now,\" Maddie snickered. It was different having Maddie so confident, maybe this misadventure was having a larger effect than I'd thought. Her eyes wandered, and her inevitable discovery of my nudity occurred. \"Um...\" she said, all her usual shyness returning, her cheeks flushing as well, \"why are you naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question,\" I agreed, looking at Qumsal intently. \"Why am I naked?\" It wasn't that embarrassing, but I felt like I needed to take a verbal stab at my former tormentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs serious as ever, she shrugged. \"You are easier to tickle that way, young master. Besides, what little clothing you wore was too badly shredded by your ride down the chute to serve its original purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, I wasn't expecting such a straightforward answer. Maddie looked at me inquisitively but decided not to ask anything. Deciding that we should probably move on, I moved over to where Maddie's pants laid in tatters and picked up the book. \"This is what I was telling you about Qumsal,\" I informed her. \"You can look at it later, but right now we should continue looking for the Orb of Ethereal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going though greater trouble than is required, young master,\" Qumsal told me. Both Maddie and I shared surprised glances. We weren't quite sure how to take that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, removing the Orb will deny the portal the pure magical energies required to activate, but there is a much simpler way to prevent the portal from opening,\" the sorceress explained. \"There is a talisman that is also necessary for the portal to activate, a spherical yellow stone engraved with T'Calu's emblem for sand on it. Without the talisman, the passage through realms cannot maintain a physical connection with this portal. The talisman is much easier to remove than the Orb much more rewarding as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rewarding?\" I said curiously. \"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When adorned, it will grant a small amount of magical power to the wearer, tied to the essences of vast deserts and sands. How this magic will take shape I cannot say, only that it will be a boon if you wish to continue fighting T'Calu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Maddie and I exchanged glances. This entire time, there had been an easier way to fix this problem? Removing the orb sounded easy at the time, but now we had a much more defined course of action. Having Qumsal to help us was already paying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" I said, happy that we now knew what we were doing. \"I assume you know the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, young master. The portal is in a chamber the lowermost level of this temple, large enough for ten of T'Calu's warbeasts two fit through side by side. Come, I will lead you,\" she informed us, turning and walking down the hallway we just came from, me following her and Madie following somewhat hesitantly after me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few minutes of our journey were in silence, then Maddie clung to my arm and began whispering. \"Are you this is such a good idea? She <i>does</i> work for T'Calu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, now she works for me, more or less. We have an agreement I think we're both quite happy with,\" I told her. It only made sense for her to be suspicious, after all she was seemingly randomly tickled when she tried to shake hands, but I had hoped I could've convinced her with my earlier statements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling softly, Maddie accepted my words albeit grudgingly and fell quiet again. Our travelling was largely uneventful until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After what felt like half an hour of walking, a lot of it retracing the steps Qumsal and I took to find Maddie, we came to a dead-end. It was a good-looking dead-end, a big circular chamber with six Qumsal look-alike statues lining the wall. Each one stood on a pedestal embedded with a precious stone of various colors: a deep purple amethyst, a sparkling green emerald, a mesmerizing blue sapphire, a bright red ruby, a solid black onyx, and some lively yellow citrine. At the end of the room, opposite the passage we just entered from, a gigantic stone tablet covered part of the wall, letters of some ancient dialect engraved on the rock. The seemingly random dots and sratches reminded me a bit of sand, the way the small grains move about in a sandstorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing there was no exit, Maddie immediately began shouting. \"I knew it, you've led us into a trap, haven't you?\" she accused, pointing harshly at Qumsal. \"Everything you've said was a lie, and this is where a bunch of traps or monsters jump out and tickle us into submission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur guide turned to face us and crossed her arms. \"Then tell me young fool, why has it not happened yet?\" Qumsal replied, still seemingly patient but I could sense the irritation in her demeanor, as did Maddie, who glared at the soreress before us. \"None of the mindless creatures are able to wait more than a few seonds upon seeing an intruder without rushing the person, eager to detain and tickle them. You can search the room if you like, but you will find neither creature nor trap here that I have led you to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmph-ing, Maddie actually did as Qumsal suggested and walked to the nearest statue, searching behind it and to either side before moving onto the next one. For some reason I felt like she wasn't going to be satisfied until she checked every one as well as making sure the tablet wasn't a trap or anything. She inspeted the gemstone, the statue, the pedestal, behind it all. When she didn't find anything, she moved onto the next one. I couldn't blame her for being jumpy and overly cautious, but why would Qumsal take us this far just to tickle us? I'm sure there were plenty of opportunities along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young master,\" Qumsal spoke in a quiet tone, \"beyond this point I cannot lead you with any confidence. I was only assigned to protect this labyrinth. If there is another below, I will be useless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" I asked. \"Aren't you basically the high-priestess here or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing nearly so garish as that. I was simply in charge of the affairs of the temple after it was built, they did not consult me when they were drafting the floor plans. They gave me a map of the temple that was considered mine, and they told that the portal lies beyond this room yet told me nothing of how to get there. It was not my duty to know.\" Qumsal paused and glanced at Maddie, who was inspecting the third statue, before leaning in close to my ear. \"May I confide something in you, young master?\" she asked, her voice having dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is your companion, Maddie. I am concerned. In here, everything is to do with T'Calu's influence, hence everything has to do with tickling. In this civilization, sensitivity was held in high regard and the more ticklish one was the more worthy one was. They probably built this temple with the same mindset, which will make Maddie a liability. She is ticklish, what we have previously witnessed proves that, but not nearly as ticklish as you or I. I remember first being caught in that trap, and I was howling much louder than she was.\" - I filed that information away in my head - \"That, and she does not trust me, which is both very annoying and time-consuming. I do not like people who distrust their allies, it does not do wonders for a team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddie has good reason to be suspicious,\" I countered. \"We came here wanting to avoid T'Calu's minions, and until recently you were the most powerful one here. She's still getting used to that, cut her some slack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell Qumsal was about to protest, but before she could I quickly reached out and pinched her hips, hushing whatever she might have said. A surprised girlish \"Eep!\" escaped her lips and whatever protests she had were lost in the ensuing giggles. She did not resist though, spreading her hands as if to invite more. As tempted as I was to continue, every minute counted, so I stopped and focused again on the task at hand, much to Qumsal's obvious disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can read that?\" I asked, gesturing to the tablet. \"It might hold a clue as to how we continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Qumsal approached the giant stone slab, peering at the writing. Maddie had finished her fifth statue right now, and began her inspection of the sixth. After a minute, Qumsal reported what she could. \"Unfortunately young master, most of it is unintelligible garbling. Time has worn away the engravings, but not to the point where I cannot read the characters. Below the top line, they are arranged erratically and nonsensically. Only the top line is readable. It says 'To continue to the Gateway of Sands, take the hands of the Guardian who is missing their tool.' Obviously it is hinting at something, though I have yet to figure it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what is that supposed to mean?\" Maddie asked, now finally done with her inspection and finding nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready I was thinking about what the tablet said. The Guardian who was missing a tool? Well, Qumsal was the Guardian, though I wasn't sure whether she had any tools. But the tablet referred to Guardian<i><b>s</b></i>, plural. Then it hit me. All six of the statues were exact replicas of Qumsal, and were arguably Guardians themselves. Mabe \"take the hands of\" literally meant grasping the hands of the statue who was missing a tool, something Qumsal had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if the Guardians the tablet is referring to are these statues,\" I voiced my thoughts, \"and we have to grab the hands of whichever one is missing this tool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense!\" Maddie said excitedly, then she frowned in thought. \"Though if we're choosing the one that is missing a tool, well, that would be all of them, since none of them have tools or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could voice my next thought, Qumsal interjected with her own solution. \"No, the tablet is phrased to ask which statue is missing <i>their</i> tool. I do not use any physical tools, as you can see, so none of them are missing tools. In which case the answer is none.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about-\" I started before being abruptly cut off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do we pull hands that don't exist, oh Guardian?\" Maddie asked sarcastically with a surprising amount of attitude in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you propose we pull all of the hands, young fool?\" Qumsal quipped back. An ugly arguement was brewing, and I wanted nothing to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two went back and forth, I inspected the statues, trying to confirm my earlier thought. I walked up to each one, looking at their hands, trying to ignore the din in the background. The first few tries proved unsuccessful, but just as I was about to give up hope I found what I was looking for. One of the statues was missing its ring, the one with a feather engraved on it on Qumsal's left hand. I felt the bare smooth stone, and looked at the remaining statue, which had its own ring. I was confident this was the right one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" I heard Maddie shout distinctively and I turned to look. \"All of the Guardians are missing tools. Including this one!\" Suddenly Maddie darted her fingers forward and began worming them into Qumsal's sides, minimally protected by the sheer thin garment that looked useless at protecting aganst a tickle attack. Qumsal squealed rather unceremoniously and broke into incohesive babbling among her incessant giggles, try to bat Maddie's arms away but only succeeding in making Maddie more determined. The tickling forced Qumsal to the tablet until her back made contact with the stone slab and she had nowhere to run. Of course, Maddie took full advantage, letting her hands wander and explore new areas. She raked her fingers across Qumsal's ribs, which caused the sorceress to shriek loudly. She pinched and kneaded Qumsal's hips, which caused the sorceress to grind her rear into the tablet in a futile escape attempt. I enjoyed the show for a minute or two, but I grew irritated after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding this had gone on long enough, I grabbed the statue's hands and pulled. The arms moved, and the scraping stone was loud enough to get the two girls' attention.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rumbling continued for another minute or two, eventually drawing Maddie away from her assault, leaving a giggling Qumsal to recover on her own.. When the noise stopped, Maddie and I looked around expectantly for a door or something. There was none however, and I became a little saddened. I was so confident that I'd gotten it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drat,\" I exclaimed rather loudly. \"I was sure that was the right one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well <i>something</i> happened,\" Maddie pointed out optimistically, \"and since no traps went off I assume that whatever happened was a good thing. Let's look around, maybe there's a switch or something that got revealed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in agreement, both Maddie and I began searching the circular chamber, looking for any differences. I checked the pedestals to see if a rocky button had appeared or something, but they were all as sleek as before. At last managing to subdue her giggles, Qumsal joined our search for something that indicated a way out. We had no idea what we were looking for, which made it that much harder to find it. Just as we were on the verge of giving up, Qumsal peered at the tablet once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young master,\" she called, grabbing my attention. Maddie and I turned and saw that Qumsal had her finger on the tablet, as if to keep her place in the text. \"Some of the characters have reordered themselves, I can read the next few passages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What does it say?\" I asked, getting an idea of how this worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQumsal spent a few more seconds following the words before answering. \"Most of it is just praises of T'Calu, telling of her greatness in civilizations past, but the last line is a riddle-like question similar to the first. 'Take the hands of the Guardian whose gemstone matches the color of our goddess,' it reads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what the precious stones are for,\" I mused, looking at the embedded minerals with rekindled interest. \"Though what does 'match the color of our goddess' mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it means we need to pick the color that we think symbolizes T'Calu?\" Maddie suggested. I nodded my agreement, and Maddie smiled and took that as her que to bring forward an idea. Taking another look at the pedestals, she approached the decorative onyx curiously. \"It's probably black,\" she thought aloud. \"T'Calu has lots of temples of various civilizations dedicated to her. Each one probably has it's own color to celebrate her. Since black is sort of all the colors at once...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good reasoning,\" I told her, but a recent memory was bubbling up and again I had my own answer. \"Though I think it's actually-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I disagree,\" Qumsal interjected, cutting me off. \"Throughout this entire temple, throughout this entire city in fact, T'Calu has always been celebrated and depicted with yellow, the color of the sand on a bright day. We actually used citrine as an offering on multiple occasions. Everything points to the statue with the yellow citrine embedded at its feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is just one of the many cities that honored T'Calu as their goddess,\" Maddie argued. \"I'm sure there are some temples that honored her just as greatly using other colors, and since we can't pull every pair of hands we should go for black, which is when the material absorbs all the other colors!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may very well be, but we are not in any of the other temples. We are in this one, and this temple celebrated her with the color yellow,\" Qumsal quipped, a frown beginning to crease her face. \"Here, citrine is the way we worship our goddess because its color matches her's, it is the correct answer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, ladies, I think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know black is right!\" Maddie huffed, stropping over to the onyx statue. \"And I'm gonna prove it when we get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddie, wait!\" I shouted, too late to stop her. Maddie grabbed the hands of the statue and yanked as hard as she could, starting another fit of rumbling. Before she could look triumphant however, the statue's hands quickly latched onto my friend's wrists and hoisted her into the air so that her feet dangled just above the pedestal. The rumbling continued, and the front of the pedestal turned out to be a stone hatch that slid into the floor, exposing a hole beneath the statue. From that hole emerged a cluster of golden feathers attached to the end of a stick - sort of like a mop - that extended until it made contact with Maddie's feet, causing her toes to wiggle furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what happened?\" Maddie asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened,\" Qumsal answered deceptively calmly, \"is that you guessed wrong. And it appears there is a punishment for incorrect answers.\" Her voice seemed indifferent, but I could sense the relish underneath her demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Maddie,\" I shrugged apologetically. \"I tried to warn you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What do youEEP!\" she suddenly shrieked as the feathery mop began rotating, brushing the cluster of feathers across the soles of Maddie's feet. \"Nohohhohohostahahahahap!\" she cried uselessly, kicking her feet to avoid the feathers. That worked for some time, until two more hatches in the statue's shins opened up to reveal a pair of wooden clasps that clamped onto Maddie's feet and pulled them down, forcing them back onto the cluster of feathers that continued spinning deliberately. \"Nahahahahaha!\" she continued laughing, now unable to hide from the trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should help teach her as well, young master?\" Qumsal suggested, stalking closer to Maddie's helpless body. Part of me just wanted to press on, but my urges got the better of me and I found myself following Qumsal to the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn amused smirk had spread across the sorceress' face as she reached forward with her fingers. \"Feathers were quite potent, but now let's see how you react to these,\" she teased, just before flicking her long sharp nails across Maddie's behind. Caught completely by surprise, Maddie gave a single piercing shriek before devolving into frenzied laughter and thrust her hips forward, but Qumsal saw it coming and followed with expert ease. With the shock of the new attack more or less over, Qumsal settled for lazy dragging the tips of her nails across Maddie's panty-clad bottom. If it weren't so damn fun to watch, I might've felt sorry for Maddie. Qumsal really knew what she was doing. As for me, I went around to the front of my laughing friend, I reaching up and slipping my hands underneathe her sweater. Maddie shook her head and screamed helplessly, still thrashing her rump in an attempt to throw off Qumsal's fingers. My only response was to grin and start gently running my fingers over her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this'll teach you to listen before doing something headstrong,\" I lectured her, emphasizing the point by sticking a finger in her bellybutton and swirling it around. I was rewarded with a series of shrieks and squirms, happy to let my finger draw them out for as long as I could. My other hand went up and started counting her ribs, pinching each one underneath the worn fabric of her sweater. As Maddie hung there laughing, I was beginning to forget about the bigger issue we were dealing with amidst all the fun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few short minutes, both the feather mop and the wooden clasps returned to within the statue, the stone hatches grinding shut again. Slowly, the statue lowered Maddie to the ground before returning to its original position, leaving her a giggling wreck on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping forward, I looked down and put a hand on her shoulder.\"Hey, you okay?\" I asked tentatively. What we'd put her through was rather harsh I realized, much more rigorous than I had originally intended. Qumsal didn't look the least bit apologetic though, I fact that I didn't miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I turned Maddie's face towards mine, I was met with a cheeky smile. \"Yohou're sohoho mehehean,\" she giggled softly, poking me in the side and making me giggle myself. Happy that we hadn't gone too far, I helped her up so that we could continue the puzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that this business has concluded,\" Qumsal stated, \"I believe it is time for us to continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" I said, though I seemed to have gone unheard. As she walked towards the statue with citrine at its feet, I frowned in thought. Something was bugging me. I knew the answer to this puzzle, I did! I just... Then something clicked. A memory of a forest, when I went through the Gateway and entered T'Calu's realm. The color of the room, the color of the goddess herself. I knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Qumsal, I think...\" I began, then I realized that Qumsal was already at the statue, reaching up. \"Wait!\" I yelled, knowing it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQumsal pulled on the stony hands, and a few rumbling seconds later she was suspended in the air exactly like Maddie was, feet dangling in level with the pedestal. The front of the pedestal slid into the floor, reavealing another mop of golden feathers that extended and brushed Qumsal's delicate feet, at which she giggled briefly. Then the hatches in the rocky shins opened up, letting two wooden devices reach forward and clamp around the sorceress' ankles, this time letting the anticipation of being tickled do its work before starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" Qumsal whispered, though she appeared slightly less shaken than Maddie had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone else guessed wrong as well,\" Maddie quipped snidely, barely able to contain her contempt. \"And as we all know, there is a punishment for incorrect answers.\" I raised my eyebrows. This was a different Maddie than the girl who shyly hid her face beneath some bangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the trap was listening, the golden feathers chose that moment to start rotating, swiping bristle after bristle across Qumsal's creamy soles. Immediately she burst out in peals of musical laughter, trying her best to hide one foot with the other and swapping every few seconds. The wooden restraints soon got wise to her tactic however, and the clamps pulled her ankles apart slightly so that she could no longer cross her feet and both were subjected to the incredibly tickly feathers. Qumsal shook her head, laughing deeply at the trap. She wasn't lying about being more ticklish than Maddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to give you a taste of your own medicine,\" Maddie teased, wasting no time in approaching Qumsal's equally if not more helpless body. \"Now let's see how you like it.\" Then, remembering the sorceress' tactful approach, she gently flicked her fingers across Qumsal's full buns, earning a girlish squeal with each flick. The sorceress was now trying to escape a second tormentor, shaking her hips from side to side but never really getting away from Maddie's vengeful fingers. \"Looks as if I'm not the only one with a ticklish tush. Well, am I right, Guardian?\" Maddie asked rhetorically, flicking all ten fingers across Qumsal's rump. Naturally, her only response was another squeal, louder and longer than her previous ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I climbed the statue in front of Qumsal and stood before her. She looked at me with a face contorted with laughter, tears beginning to leak from her eyes. I suppose that she really was very ticklish. \"You two really need to learn to listen to me,\" I scolded. \"I usually have my own ideas, and you'd be surprised how much I know.\" Without further ado, I reached forward and softly began tracing my fingertips down Qumsal's silky smooth arms. Knowing my destination, she began shaking her head wildly, a tear trailing down her cheek as I gently spider-tickled my fingers down to her underarms, barely touching the olive-colored skin in her hollows. Her laughter rocketed up in volume, as did her struggles. Now she was shaking all over, twisting every which way to avoid whatever tickles she could. Amused by the reaction, I left one hand in her underarm while letting the other trail down to her belly and ribs, fingers scuttling everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their random squibbles one finger accidently slipped into her bellybutton, and although she was wearing a dress Qumsal still shrieked loudly. Looking up at the sound, Maddie grinned at me, never ceasing her torturous flicks and wiggles. \"Oooh,\" she said. \"She likes that!\" Nodding in agreement, I soon had a grin of my own as I sent that little finger back to where it found the little divet. It took a bit of searching, but pretty soon my finger was deep inside Qumsal's navel, worming around and earning a mixture of belly laughs and helpless shrieks. A few more tears now trickled down the sorceress' face, falling into her open mouth that never stopped laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes passed, and eventually Qumsal was let down as well, much to Maddie's disappointment. She kept flicking her fingers across Qumsal's rear cheeks, switching to her sides when the sorceress hid her bum on the floor, until a harsh glare from me finally got her to stop. The woman sat there, drying her eyes, shaking every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kneeled down so that I could apologize, Qumsal's body still twitching under my outstretched palm. When our eyes met, I was surprised to see an excited glint in her gray ones. Standing up from her position on the floor, she looked down at my still wide eyes and said, \"Promise me that you will do that often, young master, and I will be yours forever.\" I was shocked, and guessing by Maddie's gaping mouth, so was she. \"Well, you have your own answer do you not?\" Qumsal continued. \"I believe we have wasted enough time here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, I quickly got up and marched to the amethyst. I remembered that in T'Calu's little meeting room, the theme was purple and black. I was torn between those two colors, but the goddess herself was purple so I assumed that was the better choice. And also, black was eliminated when Maddie guessed it and guessed wrong. Confidently, I reached up to the statues hands and pulled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another round of rumbling began, and judging by how I wasn't being strung up by my hands and being tickled by golden feathers I assumed that my guess was correct. This time however, something happened that was easy to see. In the middle of the circular chamber, a large hole opened and from it rose a table-sized block of stone. At each corner was  U-shaped semi-ring of rock, for what purposes I could guess. Directly above it, a diamond suspended by a chain lowered itself from a smaller hole in the center of the ceiling. At least, I think it was a diamond. It was certainly as pretty as one, though it shone whiter than a pearl. When the rumbling stopped, the stone block sat a couple feet above the ground and the diamond-thingy hung a few feet above that. We all spent another few seconds admiring the perfection of the dangling gemstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Qumsal, who in turn looked at the tablet. Without hesitation, she began following the new words that had reshaped, reading what was previously illegible scribbles. \"Most of what has been rearranged heralds the return of T'Calu, speaking of her glories and telling of the laughter she will bring to her enemies,\" Qumsal said. \"Again, the only line of any significance to our current situation is the last one: 'Lie down on the bed of stone and laugh until the mirth crystal is filled.' Ah, so no matter how knowledgeable one is, they must have endurance to make it past this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly does that mean?\" I asked, though I could figure it out well enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, young master, that hanging stone is referred to as a mirth crystal, a gemstone capable of absorbing and storing mirth magic. It also possesses the ability to transform some of the mirth magic into base magic should such a form be required. My guess is that shifting the text on the tablet and activating the traps took a certain amount of magic to activate, as will opening the way to the portal. One of us must offer ourselves on that stone table and be tickled until the mirth crystal is full before we may continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" I exclaimed. \"That means the traps you two set off drained the crystal even more, making the time for whoever gets on that longer than necessary. See what happens when you ladies don't talk to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them looked slightly abashed, though Qumsal was rather good at hiding it. She could not help but blush a tad bit from embarassment, remembering her incorrect guess and rather admonishing experience. \"If it pleases you, young master,\" she offered, \"I will be the one to fill the mirth crystal. On the condition that your friend refrains from joining whatever administers the tickling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No promises, Guardian,\" Maddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, I'll do it,\" I told them, surprising them both and earning a couple sets of raised eyebrows. \"You two have had pretty tiring experiences already, I think it's my turn to take some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, young master, you should not have to pay for our mistakes,\" Qumsal protested. \"We made them so one of us should pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm with the Guardian on this one, you don't have to be all macho and take a few tickles for us,\" Maddie agreed, looking a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouched by their concern, I took a step forward... and tickled them. One hand goosed Maddie's exposed hip, the other fluttered aross Qumsal's tummy. In no time flat the two were on the floor, doing their best to protect themselves while shying away from my devious fingers. Chuckling, I stood back and watched them huddle a bit before shaking themselves off. \"You two are still tired - and sensitized - from being caught in those traps. Nah, I think I'll take this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Qumsal smiled and gently poked my side, provoking an unbecoming squeak. \"Thank you, young master,\" she said, warmth emanating from her soft grey eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks,\" Maddie said, standing up and pulling me in for a hug, smiling. It still struck me how attractive she was when she did that, though I'd seen her smile countless times before. Returning her hug, I couldn't help but tweak her ribs once, causing Maddie to back away giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling back at them, I turned and climbed onto the relatively low-lying stone block. Now knowing what they were for, I slipped my wrists into the two U-shaped rocks at top of the table before repeating the action with my ankles at the bottom. All four closed on my limbs with the sound of scraping stone, pulling towards the corners and stretching me out as far as I would go. Before the tugging could become painful, the stone cuffs relaxed, leaving me with little wriggle room to work with. Not that I minded - I'd been in harsher conditions and loved it. Qumsal and Maddie, with nothing to really do, sat on the ground, and the three of us waited for something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was broken by the sound of cracking stone to my left. Turning in that direction, I saw one of the Qumsal statues come to life and step off of her pedestal. She stretched her hands high over her head as if just waking up from a long slumber, and though they were made of stone I could not help but stare at the smooth underarms. Whoever made these statues had an eye for detail, and the stone renditions of the Guardian were so life-like the sculptor must have had Qumsal in the room while carving them. Another rocky crack bounced off the circular walls, and the statue right beside the now-active one also stirred, flexing her back and slinking her body off the pedestal (yes, I am now referring to the statues as shes, get over it, the original is very hot). The third crack came from my right, and as I spun my head around that way I witnessed a comical scene. One of the statues hopped off the pedestal and shook herself as if just getting out of a cold shower, an amusing motion considering she was not wet. Looking around, her eyes met mine and a smile sprad across herr full rocky lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie and Qumsal watched in wonder and astonishment, though Qumsal was more intrigued than amazed. She had seen magic many times before I imagined, it was the ingenuity and the craftsmanship of whoever weaved this spell that caught her interest. \"A most useful spell,\" she mused. \"Animation is often heard of but rarely used, probably because of the steep price in terms of magical energy. Young master, you are going to be tickled for a while. Again, I apologize for acting hastily, though to tell the truth I am going to enjoy watching this a lot.\" That made me gulp, and I was wondering whether I was going to get a little bit more than I had bargained for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, six attractive Qumsal-statues stood around me smiling, taking a few seconds to take in my restrained form. One reached over and traced her fingers across my hip, eliciting a jolt and a giggle, and the six of them looked at each other with what looked like excitement in their eyes (it was hard to tell since they were made of stone), some even clapping excitedly. I found it ironic that whilst they all looked exactly like Qumsal, they acted like polar opposites. Whereas Qumsal was restrained and mature, these statues seemed giddy and barely able to suppress their enthusiasm, actually failing altogether. Another one flicked her nails (just as sharp as the original's) across my sole, causing me to wiggle my foot and giggle again. A similar reaction spread around the group, exchanged glances and eager faces ready to begin work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What are these statues, Qumsal?\" I asked, staring curiously at the gang of statues who were cooing at me. All six of them were pushing, shoving, and almost wrestling with each other as they fought over which spot they would 'claim'. To be honest, it was quite amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, young master, they are duplicates of my own exquisite form,\" Qumsal explained. Maddie scoffed, earning Qumsal's attention. \"But their demeanor is somewhat less... restrained. The sculptor - a powerful sorcerer - was one of the best I've ever met, and captured my image perfectly,\" she said, glaring at Maddie and wiggling her fingers threateningly towards her. Maddie stuck her tongue out and wiggled her fingers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are they so unrestrained?\" I asked, observing two of the statues fight over my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the sculptor always used his magic to imbue his works with personality, and he preferred spirited girls. Nonetheless, they certainly seem enthusiastic, and are very likely as proficient as myself,\" Qumsal answered, and I couldn't help but notice the excited tone in her voice, her gray eyes gleaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, thanks again for taking one for the team!\" Maddie said much too cheerily.\"We appreciate it!\" she added with a sly smile. All this tickling had changed her so greatly from the shy reserved girl I knew for years. I wondered if she was going to enjoy the show as well. Probably, I figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, uh, you're welcome,\" I replied, watching two statues fight over who would get to play with my belly. As amusing as it was to watch, I was annoyed because all this waiting kept me in suspense for a while until one of them was victorious and claimed the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there were two statues clapping her fingers in excitement at my feet, two statues giggling at my underarms, one statues flexing her fingers at my sides and one statue hovering over my stomach smacking her lips. It seems the statues couldn't resist for long, and before I could brace myself began tickling in reckless abandon. They showed no restraint, seemingly very eager to quickly tickle as much laughter out of me as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two at my underarms exploited my complete vulnerability, ten fingers spider-tickling in each one, sometimes grazing along and teasing the edges before burying back into the center. A single nail in one underarm spiraled in slowly, attacked the center of my hollow, then spiraled out again slowly before repeating. The two manning my mid-section were unbearable. One statue was squeezing my hips, which alone excited me due to its proximity to my groin, and the other was poking and prodding all along my bare stomach and sides. My navel was, at one time, subjected to an adventurous stony fingernail. The last two were exploring my trapped feet, their nimble long fingers scampering all over my soles as if they were trying to tickle the whole foot at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make things more intense, all six of them had razor-sharp fingernails that were roving all over my trapped body. They also seemed to titter and giggle the more I laughed, as if they having a great amount of fun at my expense. For some reason hearing them chuckle would make me laugh more, and then the cycle would repeat itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I laughed, I noticed barely visible multicolored lines rising from the part of my body being tickled and floating up to the mirth crystal. The sight would have been entrancing were I not being severely tickled by a gang of giddy living statues. I assumed this was the physical form of my mirth essence or whatever filling the crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahowwww muhumuch more?\" I laughed, barely about to form a coherent sentence will sixty fingers stimulating my sensitive body all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mirth crystal is almost half full, young master,\" Qumsal said, glancing up at the crystal. Shortly after that, the statues stopped moving and all looked at each other, wide grins on their faces. I was grateful for the break as I caught my breath, looking between my tormentresses nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... are they... doing?\" I asked between pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, young master, though it looks as though they may be discussing tactics,\" Qumsal replied, looking curiously at the statues. As I looked next to her, I was surprised to see Maddie doing something similar. Apparently both of them were enjoying themselves and were eager to see more. A few minutes passed, followed by the stony guardians returning to their places and giggling mutely, all licking their lips. I soon worked out why they were giggling when I felt one of the statues blow a raspberry on my stomach.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BAHAHAHAHAHA!\" I cackled, erupting with laughter as I felt tongues make contact with my skin. It was a strange feeling, being statues they had no saliva but their tongues were still slick and tickly. They could also still rather effective at blowing raspberries.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a new kind of tickling, far more intense as I felt tongues trail up my feet. They even occasionally nibbled at my toes with their teeth, the pinching sensations shooting arcs of electricity though my nerves. The pair suckling at my underarms was horrifically tickly, made all the more worse that I couldn't pull my arms down at all, leaving them open and exposed. The pair dragging their tongues all over my quivering stomach drove me mad as I felt like a pair of snakes were slithering all over my torso. Tears of laughter formed in my eyes as one of the statues slipped her tongue into my navel and wiggled it all about, hitting the bottom and walls. Through bleary eyes, I saw that the trail of mirth essence from my belly was nearly a flood, a thick solid chord connecting my bellybutton to the crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, one good thing about oral tickling was that because it was far more intense, it drew much more laughter from me and before long the crystal was full, gleaming with rainbow colors, an iridescent gemstone shining with light. Their jobs finished, the statues returned to their pedestals, seeming to sigh with disappointment that they had finished with me already. As the last one mounted her pedestal, I swear I saw her wink before freezing in the same position as her sister, the room looking more or less like it had when we first came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie and Qumsal stood up and walked over to my panting form. There was no way for me to see, but both were wearing rather devious smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looked quite enjoyable, young master,\" Qumsal commented. \"Perhaps you would like it to continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... what?\" I said, still breathless.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you had a lot of fun tickling the two of us, didn't you? Surely it's only fair we get a little bit of payback,\" Maddie clarified with a big smirk on her face. She wiggled her fingers menacingly at me, and I tried to get up. The stone cuffs hadn't opened yet, leaving me at the mercy of two tickle-hungry dames. \"Y'see? We can get along fine. Qumsal, would you like to share?\" Maddie asked, gesturing to my still stretched out and exposed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, ladies...\" I warned, before Qumsal put a sharp finger with golden varnish over my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that your friend and I are in mutual agreement. We both wish to hear your laughter, so we will make you laugh,\" she smiled as she took my left side while Maddie took my right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this was certainly something else, being tormented by a shy cutie on one side and a tickle-loving sorceress on the other. As I looked from Maddie's excited face to Qumsal's eager face, I resigned myself to the tickling, knowing that there was nothing I could do. And the fact that I was stretched out naked about to be tickled by two beautiful women already started turning me on, a fact that was rather plain to see stark naked as I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any pretense, both started tickling me at the same time as if they had shared some silent countdown. It seemed that Maddie had picked up a few tricks as she and Qumsal blew raspberries on my vulnerable belly, earning peals of frantic laughter. Maddie tormenting my left flank, tickling in reckless abandon by shooting her fingers everywhere and digging into my hips and ribs, while Qumsal teased my right, gentle flicks and pinches across my skin, was both incredibly ticklish and unbearably hot. Thankfully after a few more minutes of this, the stone cuffs opened as if finally realizing that I was still trapped. Instantly I pulled all my limbs in and covered as much of myself a I could. Good thing too, I didn't think I would have been able to take much more, in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now wasn't that fun?\" one of them asked. I expected it to be Qumsal, but to my surprise it was Maddie, offering me a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely, though maybe it should one of you on the slab next time,\" I replied, with a mischievous grin. That earned me a poke in the sides from both of them. I poked them both back, and the three of us stared at the tablet, giggling slightly as it spun back to reveal...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another bout of rumbling ensued as the giant stone tablet slowly opened, sand cascading off the top as it slid backwards into the hidden passageway. The noise of stone scraping against stone echoed throughout the chamber as the giant chunk of rock dragged across the sandy floor. Maddie and I shared a look of surprise. In hindsight, we should have been expecting something like that - we just saw six statues come to life - but I suppose that it was too much like those classical adventure movies. As the door swung back, the markings again began to rearrange themselves on the face of the tablet. When it finally crashed against the side of the hall, ending the rumbling and revealing another long passage, the rumbling ended and the markings made an all too familiar shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Eye of Kietelen,\" I whispered, looking at the familiar picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQumsal turned to face me, wide-eyed. \"What do you know of the Eye of Kietelen?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"Long story, it ties into a lot of what we're doing here and how we got mixed up in this mess in the first place. You'll meet him once we close the portal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at each other and nodding, Maddie and I approached the passageway, peering in. Qumsal looked after us incredulously before following us into the stone hall. Unlike the maze of tunnels and corridors we just came from, the walls here were lined with sconces holding little white balls of light, allowing us to see all the way to the end, where it opened up into... something. Too hard to tell from here. Qumsal let her little white wisp light (which had been following us the entire time) go out noticing the magic that kept this part of the temple in working condition. Whatever working condition was. Between the sconces, mosaics and carvings of T'Calu's worshipers decorated the passage, depicting humans in some very vulnerable positions laughing helplessly at the hands of various creatures. One that kept reappearing was a huge hulking beast, except its skin was more or less smooth across its entire body. It had arms and legs and  torso, but I couldn't see any obvious head or features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, careful for traps,\" I warned them, not wanting us to be delayed any longer. Blazing ahead into the tunnel, I kept a constant vigil against any funny looking blocks or sconces, but they all seemed genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just my own conclusion, young master,\" Qumsal said behind me, following close behind me and Maddie tagging along somewhat uncertainly, a little overwhelmed by the sudden power that this temple must have once had, \"but I do not think we need to worry about any traps between here and the portal. The part of the temple I was assigned to protect was meant to defend the portal, and that chamber was the final test. Like the tablet, everything in this hall is meant to glorify T'Calu and her armies, ornamental purposes primarily. I may be wrong, but I suspect that we don't have to worry until we reach the portal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" I conceded. She made a pretty convincing argument. \"But keep your guard up. If one of us falls into a trap, the other two should help as quickly as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The victim or the trap?\" Qumsal asked, smiling. Rolling my eyes, I turned forward again and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Qumsal had suspected, we did not run into any traps through the tunnel. I kept looking the entire time though, I guess the first trap I fell into made me a tad paranoid. Qumsal just followed me the entire time, occasionally remarking on a particularly rare creature or a common tickling ritual that was enacted in ages past. Maddie spent the entire trip looking between the mosaics, observing the creatures and the positions of the followers. When she noticed the hulking creature I saw earlier, she looked more than a little intimidated. People seemed to cling to its skin, or at least were lying on it, and what expression that could be seen depicted mad hilarity. Maddie's shyness had returned somewhat, shuffling forward, trailing behind Qumsal and me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat we stepped into was just like the circular chamber we came from times a hundred. A huge domed roof stretched from the base of the walls all the way up to a skylight looking up into the city itself, at least ten storeys above the floor. The room was twice as big as a football field, the sconces on the distant wall smaller than the width of my finger. Despite its size however, between the dozens of sconces and the light from the hole in the ceiling the room was plenty lit. No mosaics lined these walls, replaced by lines and lines, column and rows of the same scribbly text that was on the tablet. On the far side of the room was a colossal pair of rocky doors nearly half the height of the entire chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft trickling sound echoed around the chamber, and upon a more thorough inspection I noticed a tiny stream-like decoration along the wall, the water moving from one end of the room to the other, creating the trickling. I was surprised to find water in a sand temple, but I suppose that even the priests and priestesses had to drink sometime, and it certainly added a nice calming effect to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of the floor, raised on a round platform of stone, sat a giant ring of rock that looked as if it could fit in three trucks side by side. Glowing white patches covered pieces of rock, and a gleaming yellow inscription in the same script as the tablet followed the curve of the ring. The platform was surrounded by a circle of torches, stuck straight p from the ground. Beside the ring of rock sat a short pedestal, with shining white lines reaching from it to the floor to the rocky ring. Hovering just inches above the surface of the pedestal was a small golden rock the size of a marble, rolling in mid-air and staying transfixed in the same point. From what I could guess, the little yellow rock was the talisman and the giant ring was the portal. I was just guessing though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The portal,\" Qumsal said, confirming my guess. She looked at it as if entranced. \"I have never seen it for myself. It is remarkable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, very impressive,\" Maddie said quickly, her eyes darting around the room, looking for something. \"Now if we're done admiring the tool of the world's end, could we please just take the talisman and leave? I have a really bad feeling about this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" I asked curiously. \"The rest of the temple didn't seem to bother you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head vigorously. \"I know, I know, it's just, something about this room, I'm getting a really bad feeling, like a vibe. Look, I know it sounds stupid, but could we please just grab it and go? At the very least it'll make me feel better. I just, agh, something about this place-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" I reassured her, putting a hand on her shoulder. \"I'll get it and we'll leave. Can't imagine what's setting you off though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really need to harden up, young girl,\" Qumsal said with just the slightest trace of disdain. \"If this place is too much for you, then I doubt you will be able to stand up to T'Calu for very long, and if so your resistance is futile.\" I shot the sorceress a look, but she simply shrugged. Concerned for Maddie's sake, I began walking towards the pedestal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the time, I didn't notice what was happening as I was walking towards the pedestal. I was so wrapped up in my own thoughts and my guard was down. After having gotten this far, I foolishly thought this temple wouldn't have anything left to offer. I was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out!\" Maddie cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI whipped my head around to face her, but saw more than I'd planned. Like the rest of the city, this chamber was covered unevenly with sand, huge clusters of it pooling in certain areas. Now it looked as if every grain of sand was now moving towards me slowly, hoping to avoid detection. Once they were caught however, a huge truckload of sand leaped off the ground and flew towards me like a giant arm or something. Sidestepping, I narrowly avoided getting swamped with the tiny rocks, the large swarm crashing into the ground and skittering across the floor. Then they started to regroup, but instead of launching at me again they slowly began to rise from the floor and take the shape of a person. As the figure became more distinct and developed, I saw that it began to take the shape of a woman, her hand over her mouth and shoulders shaking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, her giggling resounded throughout the chamber. \"Looks like I was found out,\" said a feminine voice. \"It's a shame you dodged, you look very ticklish too.\" When her body was fully formed, she looked similar to Qumsal, except that her hair was parted and ran in two braids down her front and her skin was a shade or two darker. Sand still covered most of her body, only her arms sticking out of the mini-sandstorm the enveloped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" I asked, taking a step back and still trying to get over my shock. \"More importantly, what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sand-woman chuckled amusedly. \"My name is not important, but know that I am the Sand Keeper, a protector of this temple and loyal vassal of T'Calu.\" She spat the last few words out in Qumsal's direction, who returned her glare. \"I keep the portal's final guardian under control and direct him to our enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Qumsal,\" I called back, slowly backing away. \"How come you never mentioned there was another guardian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because there isn't. I'm the Guardian of the temple, a role of which there is no greater honor,\" Qumsal answered, still looking right at the Keeper. \"A Keeper is just a glorified pet owner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The title of Guardian only holds honor if you enact the duties of one,\" the Keeper quipped back. \"Why have you betrayed our mistress? I've heard how you refer to this male in the chamber outside. Is the ticklishness of one youngling the price of your loyalty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is more than just another ticklish youngling,\" Qumsal replied. \"His essences are unlike any I've seen before. You'd need to tickle him to understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation at that point struck me as a little weird. Even weirder was when I realized that they were talking about me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T'Calu's return is inevitable,\" the Keeper said. \"When the nightfire burns, the barrier between her realm and this one will weaken enough for the portals to pierce, creating the gateways for her armies to march through. Though I must wonder how you managed to arrive here so quickly, let alone discover the existence of these portals at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to answer vaguely until Maddie reeled over and started groaning. Looking back, I saw Qumsal with her hand on Maddie's back, concerned for my friend's health. It looked as if she had just gotten hit in the gut with a sledgehammer. When Maddie finally began to uncurl, she stared uneasily at the big door behind the Keeper, clutching her stomach, looking like she was about to be sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be... Be...\" she gasped, trying to force words between gritted teeth. \"Be... Behind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Maddie?\" I asked worriedly, rushing for my reeling friend. I slipped her arm around my shoulders, but already she was looking better. Enough color had returned to her face to make me think she would be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behind the door,\" Maddie managed to say. \"I got a... a really bad feeling about something behind the door, something big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" the Keeper exclaimed, raising her eyebrows. \"It appears this one is in tune with our ethereal plane. The level at which she's aware is another matter however, my pet is rather hard to miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean basically Maddie's spidey-senses are tingling?\" I asked incredulously, knowing neither Qumsal nor the Keeper would know what that meant. It was supposed to be a joke, but to be honest, after all this weird magic stuff, I wouldn't be that surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains why this youngling seemed so uncomfortable before,\" Qumsal mused. \"It was usual for inexperienced priestesses to have a negative physical reaction to a strong presence. Your friend is untrained and inexperienced with this ability, so it is little wonder she felt uneasy when she sensed the Keeper. And against what we are facing, it is no wonder she youngling feels sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud scraping sound was heard on the far side of the room, and I turned to see the giant stone double doors opening. Before them, the Keeper looked up into the slowly emerging shadow, gazing at whatever was inside. How she managed to cross the room so quickly I had no idea, maybe her sand powers or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Qumsal,\" I said, shaken, \"what exactly did Maddie sense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A beast of old,\" Qumsal answered, her voice infuriatingly calm. \"I apologize, young master, I'm not aware of its origins nor am I even certain of what it is exactly. Though I have been told that it is a fearsome creature of great awe and admiration, one of many. The Keepers were to control these powerful beasts and direct them towards the enemies of T'Calu. When she was forced out of this world, each Keeper was assigned to protect their respective gate until her return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as I was charged, so shall I serve,\" the Keeper responded, turning to face us once again. \"Since nearly the dawn of civilization have I served our mistress, and so it shall remain until I am incapable of doing so. For millennia I have been the Sand Keeper, and as long as the last guardian of this portal remains I will continue to be a vassal as mighty as yourself, Guardian Qumsal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, the giant double doors had opened slightly more, allowing traces of light to slide between the two giant stone slabs. Still, I could not see the formidable beast that Qumsal had mentioned very well. Neither had I heard anything else in the chamber beside the scraping of the stone doors; no roaring or growling or clawing or scratching, which led me to think of those comical moments where there's a huge build up for a giant monster in the movies and it turns out to be a little tiny thing you could step on. Then the irony would be that it's insanely strong. It was only a thought though, one clearly disproved as the doors finally opened wide enough for me to see inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs light from the hundreds of sconces streamed into whatever room was beyond the chamber, it illuminated the beast inside. Standing at least four storeys high, the monster towered over its Keeper and everything else in the room. Put basically, it was an immense headless giant with an abnormally large torso. It sounds comical, but looking at the creature's smooth featureless skin was quite frightening, especially when most of it was above my head level. And there were no features anywhere on this thing. How it saw, heard, or breathed I have no idea. But as it crashed its hulking form forward a couple steps, it was obvious that the beast was very much alive and aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behold, my ward and the final guardian of the portal, Golem,\" the Keeper introduced. \"One of the Ancient Kings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie and I stared up at the thing in awe, but Qumsal didn't seem the least bit fazed by the arrival of Golem. Stepping forward, she addressed the Keeper directly. \"What has T'Calu done to earn our loyalty?\" Qumsal asked, doing my job in trying to convince our opponent to back down. \"I am not a mere servant like you and Golem now are. This youngling has more power than you know, the power to go toe-to-toe with T'Calu. A wave of change is about to crash over the ethereal. Will you cling on to empty words and ancient promises, or take a stand in deciding your own destiny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry Qumsal,\" the Keeper replied, and she seemed surprisingly genuine. \"To me, honor and tradition still mean something, and there is still power in the ancient promises. I would rather stick with my old assurances than risk everything by turning against our mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So be it,\" Qumsal responded, her ring beginning to glow dimly. \"It pains me that I cannot convince you otherwise. Young master, I will take care of Golem. You and your friend should focus on the Keeper.\" As her ring glowed more fiercely, sand began to spiral around Qumsal's feet, causing a bit of a breeze to rush past Maddie and me. To my surprise, the mini-sandstorm grew so fierce that Qumsal was lifted off the ground and carried very quickly towards the giant clay creature. When she got close, Golem seemed to become aware of her and began reaching for her and throwing ponderous punches. He moved slowly, but each time his fist struck the ground nearly the whole rooms shook, hinting at his pure strength. When I looked sideways at Maddie, she seemed equally dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile we were distracted, the sand behind us rose and took the shape of a body. \"You should be more concerned with yourselves, younglings,\" said a voice from behind us. Both Maddie and I spun around to see the Keeper grin at us, a vortex of sand rising from the floor and racing towards...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before I could react, the billowing cloud of sand engulfed me completely. It swirled around me, each little grain feeling like a feather tip dancing across my bare skin. And there were plenty of grains. And lots of bare skin. Breaking straight out in laughter, I began stumbling around, trying to get out. However, it seemed wherever I went the sandstorm followed me, each grains of sand whipping across my skin so fast that they were off my skin almost as soon as they had touched it. They all left the tingling ticklish sensations though, staying long after they had made a pass. My underarms and feet were sheltered from the storm well enough, but the rest of me was terribly exposed. The sand tickled my sides and belly, breezing across my thighs and even brushing my buttocks. Thankfully my navel was also sheltered somewhat, though the sensations that surrounded it were tickly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering enough willpower to stop my useless attempts at protecting myself, I simply started running in whatever direction I happened to be facing. With this much sand, I didn't dare open my eyes. I shouldn't have even have risked breathing, but the sand seemed to avoid my mouth and lungs. The movement left my feet and underarms exposed occasionally, but I wagered that if I put all my effort into escaping I might be able to outrun the sandstorm. After a an excruciatingly ticklish minute, my gamble paid off and I burst into air that wasn't filled with sand zipping about. It wasn't long after that the residual sensations subsided, and I opened my eyes and saw that the vortex simply stopped moving once I had left it, the sand dropping straight to the ground. Satisfied that I wasn't in any immediate threat of being tickled, I looked to see how the girls were faring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQumsal was doing a good job battling Golem, at least as far as I could tell. Of course, with no face to any emotion it was hard to tell whether the clay colossus was being hurt by Qumsal's attacks or just becoming frustrated. The cloud of sand that held Qumsal off the floor was doing a good job of keeping her out of harm's way as she sent blast after blast of intense white light at Golem, presumably the form of 'pure' magic that she had tried to explain earlier. I don't know, I was still wrapping my head around these magical concepts anyway. Each hit exploded upon contact with the beast, eating away at the clay that made up his body, but more just filled the gaps left by the attacks. At least he didn't seem to be getting any smarter or faster, waving its finger-less hands around trying to swat Qumsal away, but it was apparent that one lucky shot or one wrong move on Qumsal's part and she would be hurled across the room. I hoped she was being careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, the sound of laughter drew my attention to Maddie and the Keeper's little duel, and it was clear the latter had the better hand. Four hands actually. From the pile of sand beneath Maddie's feet rose four arms made of the tiny grains. Two were as thick as tree trunks, holding Maddie's ankles to the ground in massive fists. The other two were human-sized, playing with her feet, exploring every patch of skin available. Unable to break the grip of her inanimate captor, Maddie could do nothing but thrash wildly on the ground and laugh helplessly as her the sandy fingers slid up and down her arches. \"STAHAHAHAHAHAP PLEEEHEEHEEHEASE!\" she screamed, banging her fists ineffectually on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears you have inherited more than just your sixth sense from your lineage,\" the Keeper observed, smiling down on her plaything. She stood over Maddie, not looking particularly threatening or intimidating, just happily watching the young girl flail herself around in a vain attempt to escape. \"I used to do this to the priestesses as well, keeping some of them here for days as their sisters performed the rituals honoring T'Calu. If our goddess was in a particularly good mood, she would take a priestess who was worthy into her realm to be tickled by her direct minions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only acknowledgment Maddie could afford the Keeper's story was a violent head shake as the sandy fingers continued to tickle her soles. Her laughter kicked up a notch when one hand wandered up to her toes, teasing the pads and underneath the stems. When it stuck its fingers between Maddie's toes, it had the fascinating ability to keep going no matter how small or large the space between was, any sand that couldn't fit just left outside the tiny crevice until the finger emerged. It meant that no matter how tightly Maddie scrunched her toes, a few grains of sand would always manage to slip through, brushing the tender skin within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying the scene but desperate to win, I ran and tackled the Keeper, a move she had clearly not seen coming as she fell to the ground, startled. I knew that the best way to combat her would be to fight fire with fire, but as I eagerly dug my hands into her sides they scooped nothing but sand. Each time I tried to tickle her, her body just turned into sand like I was trying to dig into a beach. Looking up at the Keeper's face, I was met with a genuinely warm smile. \"That was good work escaping my sandstorm, youngling,\" she congratulated. \"Unfortunately for you, I am able to turn my body into sand at will, an ability that you appear to have noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA prod in my own side made me squeal and roll off the Keeper, left exposed by her surprise attack. Another poke elicited another squeal, breaking down into giggles as the Keeper continued to prod my belly and ribs. Giggles quickly escalated into cackles as the prodding was replaced by ten fingers viciously worming into my tummy, provoking a stream of laughter from my lungs. I tried to crawl away, but the Keeper promptly straddled my waist and continued to tickle me, changing her tactic yet again. Now each finger traced random slashes and circles on my skin, soft teasing that didn't provoke as deep laughter as before but definitely more than just bubbly giggling. It was then that I decided that my navel was just too inviting as one of the Keeper's fingers dived into it and begin to swirl its nail around. It wasn't as long as Qumsal's, thank heavens for that, but it was still long enough to tickle like hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are as ticklish as Qumsal hinted you might be,\" the Keeper said. \"I am still not convinced of joining you in your futile quest, but at least your sensitivity makes this fun as well as easy.\" As soon as she said that however, she was tackled - again - by Maddie and disappeared from sight for a moment. With her went the tickling, and after a brief moment I was able to get up and see that Maddie had fallen for the same trap I had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOHOHOU'VE GOT TO BEHEHEHE KIHIHIDDING!\" she screamed as her hips got a good working over, the Keeper's thumbs pressing firmly into her pelvis, massaging into the ticklish skin beside the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got up, I noticed that Qumsal's duel had taken a turn for the worse. She continued whizzing around Golem, hurling blasts at his body with such focus that she didn't see the outstretched arm waiting for her. The collision didn't look as if it had much impact, but it was enough to knock Qumsal from her transportation, the miniature sandstorm dwindling down to the floor. However, instead of the sorceress falling to the ground, Qumsal found herself stuck to the clay arm. Golem seemed to be expecting this, and placed Qumsal on his enormous torso. Now she was stuck to the beast's body and unable to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral arms protruded from Golem's body, human-sized and with all the fingers to be able to roll Qumsal onto her back and spread her limbs across Golem's torso. Now I realized what the mosaics in the entry hall were depicting. As Qumsal found herself spread-eagle, several of the clay arms began worming their fingers into her skin, tickling her through her thin white dress. For a moment Qumsal went bug-eyed, then she squeezed her eyes shut and began laughing as little clay fingers began burrowing into her sides, tracing shapes and fluttering in her underarms, pinching and squeezing her hips, and sliding up and down her arches. One set of hands were amusing themselves by playing with Qumsal's toes, teasing the pads and worming their way underneath them as well. It looked as if Qumsal was trying to buck and squirm a lot because her muscles kept straining against Golem's sticky body, but Golem must have been made out of some kind of adhesive clay because Qumsal never moved a centimetre, just laying there screaming with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one of his three targets firmly stuck to himself and laughing helplessly, Golem began marching in my direction, apparently realizing that Maddie was more or less out of commission and that I was the only loose end. Things weren't looking up for the good guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought quickly, trying to figure out how to stop a giant creature made of clay from picking me up and doing with me as he pleases, when I noticed that Golem seemed to be avoiding the circular platform in the center of the room. It may have just been that he didn't want to accidentally crush the portal, but he was giving it surprisingly wide berth. Then I realized what he was probably avoiding - the ring of torches around the platform. They couldn't just be there by accident, meaning that they had some magical value or something. Whatever, it was my best shot at fending off Golem. I was kidding myself if I wanted to think that I could beat Golem with a torch, but maybe I could at least ward him off so I could help Maddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other option, I ran for one of the torches.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a mighty lunge, I managed to dive over to the ring of torches, barely dodging a grab from one of Golem's limbs. The behemoth stopped short from the fire of the torches and pulled back at a surprising speed. I grinned as I realised that I may have found a weakness of the creature and grabbed onto one of the torches, yanking at it as I tried to dislodge the thing and use it as a weapon. Rather surprisingly, it came away relatively easily from its holding spot and I held it in both my hands. The fire itself didn't feel particularly hot and as I waved it slowly from side to side, the flames seemed to leave a trail in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on the matter at hand, I looked over to the Golem and saw Qumsal in an even worse position than before. Instead of hands, two squares had come out of Golem at her feet and shot out multiple tiny tentacles that assaulted every single inch of her feet without mercy. There were dozens of them coming out of the side of the square, pressing against the soles as they wriggled and writhed over the bare skin. They moved at astonishing speed to the extent where each of the small tentacles appeared to be a complete blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQumsal's face shined with sweat as her bare feet were tormented without mercy, the clay hands tickling her sides, hips and underarms nothing compared to how her toes were tickled as the tentacles wiggled in between them and teased the digits relentlessly. The former servant of T'Calu screamed with laughter, her torment only added to as she was unable to move an inch in that strange clay mixture. Her eyes even glistened with tears and couldn't help but smirk a little as I realised that even she had limits. Getting back to the matter at hand, I moved forward towards Golem, bringing the torch up as it tried to lumber towards me, the flames flickering towards the construct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked as Golem's body flinched backwards as I thrusted the torch towards it. It took a step backwards, quickly followed by others as it tried to get out of range of the fire. But as quick as it was, I proved to be that bit quicker as it stumbled backwards, the flame actually nearing it and brushing against its body. The clay the flames brushed against suddenly dried with amazing speed, cracking under the onslaught of the magical fire. The tickling on Qumsal suddenly stopped when that happened and the hands at her armpits vanished into Golem's body before I noticed the clay that had been cracked was now fresh and damp again. I grinned as I realised how to save Qumsal from her predicament and pushed the flame against Golem's leg, the clay once more drying up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more of the tickling appendages left Qumsal as Golem used the clay to patch up the parts of it that had been assaulted from the fire until Qumsal was left alone completely. That done, it took her only seconds to seemingly recover before pushing forward with her body with a yell and breaking from her bonds. Falling through the air, Qumsal stopped herself by calling up the sand to help her fly once more, sailing past me as she swiped the torch from out of my hands \"Thank you young master!\" She called out \"I shall deal with Golem! But you still have to worry about the Keeper! Delay her while I subdue her beast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought that would be easier said then done when I turned to face the Keeper who was still working over Maddie, only with a bit more embarrassment thrown in for good measure. Sitting with her legs stretched out on the ground, the Keeper had place Maddie lying face down on her thighs and was holding her down with a hand on her back with one hand while the other was tickling Maddie's rear. Having long since gone scarlet from laughing so much, it seemed an extra hue had been added as the Guardian's fingers tickled the twitchy buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOTTHEHHEREEHHEE!!!\" Maddie pleaded as she tried to push herself up only to be held down with remarkable ease \"ANNYYYWHEHEEREEBUUTTHHEHEREEEEEAHAHAHAAA!!!\" She cried out through her laughter, her ass only protected with a pair of flimsy panties that did little to prevent the Keeper's nails from wriggling over her ticklish cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you say that now, but wait until I have tickled you everywhere.\" The Keeper said with a smile as her nails started giving light, ticklish pinches to both of Maddie's buttocks at random spots, only earning even more squeals and jumps from my ticklish friend \"Then you'll be begging for me to tickle you here... and everywhere else in fact.\" She added with a satisfied smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as I was enjoying the sight before me, and the thought of what might follow, I needed to draw the Keeper away \"Hey you!\" I called out in a less than original way to do it \"I beat your Golem, how about I get to have my turn at tickling you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy shouts worked in catching the Keeper's attention and she stopped tickling Maddie, leaving her in a giggly mess on the ground as she turned into a floating cloud of sand \"As you wish youngling.\" Her voice said in a confident tone \"But do not expect me to be as easy prey as Qumsal was.\" With that, the cloud dived for me and without a better plan, I ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe places I could run to were limited however and with only a second to make up my mind, I went for...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the swiftness born of fear of being tickled half to death by a powerful sorceress, I ran as fast as I could towards the miniature stream that ran through the room. I had no real plan aside from hopefully keeping out of her reach until Qumsal had taken out Golem so she could hopefully turn her attention to the Keeper. The swirling cloud of sand proved to be fast and was soon close behind me as I reached the small stream, the water splashing around me as I ran through it. I looked behind me when I heard the Keeper cry out in alarm and saw that the water had splashed the bottom of the cloud of sand and a few brief flashes of light were coming from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, some of the sand vanished as a foot seemed to pop out of nowhere and landed on the ground. I was quite disconcerting to see as it was a foot of flesh and blood, the toes wriggling as it lay on the ground. It was cut off at the ankle with an odd cartoonish look to it as the top was simply round and without any marks to show damage on it. A thin golden chain anklet decorated the foot and twinkled in the light.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Keeper seemed to pause in horror as the foot came out of nowhere and I saw my opportunity. Turning around quickly, I ran for the foot and grabbed it, rolling over the ground as I tumbled a bit from my grab. The Keeper let out a scream of protest as I did this \"Drop the foot now!\" She ordered as the cloud hovered around, not coming closer to me as if in fear of what would happen. I looked at the foot itself with its rich brown skin, long toes and carefully cut nails. It was one of the prettiest feet I'd ever seen and as I held it, I realised it had some of the most softest skin I'd ever felt as well. I reached out and dragged a single finger down the long arch in defiance of the Keeper's order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NYYAHAHHHAANNOOSSTTAHAHHAAPPP!!!\" The Keeper cried out the instant I started dragging my finger up along the foot and I started to realise that the water had splashed her in her sand form and had subsequently prevented her from using that power where it had touched her. I grinned in anticipation of revenge as I started to lightly drag my fingers up and down the sole, barely even tickling at all as I grazed my fingers up and down the foot. Even that light tickling had its effects however as the Keeper's shrieks got louder with each brush of the fingers I gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call off Golem or I'll really get nasty!\" I called out as my fingers softly brushed over her arch, the foot in my hand twitching about madly as it tried to escape but with no success. Looking over to Qumsal, I realised the threat wasn't needed as the sorceress had managed to largely contain Golem, having used the flame to dry the clay around its feet, keeping it stuck to the floor. Looking in the other direction, I saw Maddie slowly get to ger feet, bright red still from her laughter and embarrassment as she recovered from her ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done young master.\" Qumsal said as she floated her way over to me, throwing the torch to one side. I smiled in response and continued my light teasing of the foot, dragging my fingers back and forth over the sole, causing increasingly loud shrieks of laughter from the Keeper as the sand cloud churned furiously \"Time to bring you completely under control I feel,\" Qumsal announced. \"Young master, if you drag her into the stream, she will be forced to condense and take solid form. Then she will be completely vulnerable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeeding Qumsal's advice, I waded a bit further into the watery dyke, bribing the Keeper's foot with me. Funnily enough, the rest of the sand cloud followed as if on a leash in spite of the Keeper's protests, and as I pulled the sand into the water via the foot (isn't that a weird sentence) it began to gather together and take shape and solidify. The sand that follows the foot into the water became a long and pretty leg, followed by the rest of a stunning torso until the Keeper was fully tangible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Keeper blinked as she took on a completely solid form, her eyes glistening with tears of laughter from her treatment and I had to admit she was a beauty. She looked like one of those beautiful women in a Bollywood movie with long legs, smooth skin and a toned belly. She was wearing what can only be described as a golden bikini with several small gold bracelets and anklets on her that served as a form of decoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped tickling as the Keeper realised her situation and Maddie joined us, all three surrounding the unfortunate Keeper as she looked at all of us in turn, her foot still in my hand \"N-Now wait just a moment...\" She started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" Qumsal interrupted \"I think you've lost, and it's about time that we wrapped up here.\" The Keeper gulped nervously, watching as Qumsal summoned some hands from the sand...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The torches were still burning, but regardless the room suddenly became dark even as they burned. Looking around, I saw the darkness flowing forward like a wave from the bead, the talisman, hovering above its pedestal. It seemed to be oozing the shadows, which warped around the room and wrapped it in a cold embrace. The walls became darker and harder to make out, the sand went that blackish-bluish color that happens at night, the torches appeared to dim drastically. All around everything just seemed a lot darker, and already it was putting me on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie seemed equally confused and startled, looking around frantically. Actually, she seemed even more unsettled than myself, her head turning rapidly and spinning around, her eyes wide with fear as she looked at the approaching and strengthening shadow. We were in a lighter area of the room, but we were still swathed in a light shadow that was growing darker, and Maddie looked with horror at the spreading wave. I wondered why, it's not like she knew what this meant - I certainly didn't - but then I remembered what the Keeper and Qumsal mentioned earlier, something about her having a sort of sixth sense or something. Maybe she was feeling something that was putting her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, Qumsal was feeling it too, that or she knew what the shadow meant. Her gaze was decidedly more confrontational, less afraid and more wary of the growing darkness. Her head was turning as well, though much slower than Maddie, less frantic and more cautious. The Keeper on the other hand seemed celebratory, a vengeful grin spreading across her face. \"Yes, yes!\" she cried. \"Now you will all haHAHAHAHA!\" She was getting annoying, so I cut her off by absentmindedly tracing my fingers up and down her sole, playing with her arch. I wasn't in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough by far the most interesting reaction was Golem's the giant clay beast turning as if it were looking around with eyes it didn't have. Then, for some reason or other, it put a greater effort into getting out of his lock on the floor, pulling desperately at his dried up legs as he tried to turn and face the bead. As he was struggling, a deep and menacing laugh echoed around the room, seemingly from everywhere. \"So nice to see you again Golem,\" a deep sultry voice that I recognized said, and the clay monster's efforts doubled. I had a feeling I knew who this was, and I also had a feeling that so did Golem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T'Calu?\" I asked uncertainly, looking defiantly at the talisman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that direction I heard her rich sexy chuckle, and suddenly from the swirling shadows the great purple goddess stepped forward as if from some unseen door. She wore even less than when I saw her last time, completely bare and modesty only protected by shifting shadows tha covered her bosom and groin - and nothing else. \"Perhaps I underestimated you, little one,\" she said somewhat condescendingly. \"I had you figured for a brilliant general and harbinger of mine, but never did I expect you to be able to get this far. Of course, you had help.\" Those last words were pointed at Qumsal, whom she glared at as the sorceress began gathering sand around her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been more than patient with expecting my due,\" said the Guardian, the sand encasing her arms like a granular exoskeleton. \"You promised me endless entertainment and joy, and instead I have been locked in here for millennia, guarding something that may or may not work. Besides, the sands are shifting and I feel a new power on the rise. Whether it is this youngling or something else I cannot say, but your time is ending T'Calu. This is just the start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, the goddess did nothing but glare at Qumsal. Then, after what seemed like whole minutes had passed, she grinned wickedly and thrust her hand out at the sorceress. At the same time, a wall of shadow rushed forward and slammed into the sorceress, dispelling the sand gathering around her and pushing her back against the wall. \"Tell me then,\" she hummed, \"is my power waning?\" The darkness began encircling Qumsal, wrapping around her limbs and tightening, exposing her to the air as claws of shadow began growing from the wall behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I was drawn out of my observations by a violent kick to the head, causing me to grunt and sending me staggering away. As soon as I let go of her foot, the Keeper dropped and scrambled over to T'Calu, groveling something fierce. I felt a slight surge of anger at her for kicking me, but it was an instinctive reaction that was replaced with detached curiosity at the Keeper's choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most powerful and benevolent mistress,\" she begged, her face more or less planted on the floor. \"I fought for you until my last, until I could fight no more for your splendorous reign. Please, I beg of you, reward me with the betrayer's power so that I may better serve your glory..\" So that was her plan, a grab for power. It made sense, though it still made my stomach turn the amount of butt-kissing she was doing just to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the nearly prone woman, T'Calu's attention was momentarily distracted from Qumsal, allowing the sorceress to regain some freedom of her limbs and postponing the punishment of the claws. \"Yes you did, didn't you?\" the goddess spoke, and the Keeper looked up with hopeful and ambitious eyes. \"You also lost, allowing my pet to become ruined and falling to a simple youngling without a single vestige of my power. Pathetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hopeful look in the Keeper's eyes immediately gave way to an intense terror as she crawled forward and nearly started kissing T'Calu's feet. \"Please,\" she begged, \"I did my best for you, I gave my all for you, everything for you, please do not punish me for the actions of a traitor. Please, let me continue serving you!\" There were several degrees of desperation in her voice, though I could not imagine why she was so bent out of shape. \"Everything that I am is yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it is,\" T'Calu said, lifting up the Keeper's chin. For a moment, the woman in the gold bikini looked hopeful again, smiling up at the goddess. Then, without warning, a pool of shadow opened up beneath the Keeper, and tendrils of darkness snapped up and coiled around her limbs, pulling her down like a sinkhole. The Keeper immediately began pleading and groveling, terrified and desperate, until her begs were replaced with insane laughter as the tips of the various tendrils began prodding her exposed skin. The ones wrapped firmly around her wrists pulled up her arms and reached down into her armpits, tracing circles in the exposed hollows. Those that were wrapped around her torso began prodding her ribs and sides, drawing patterns on her belly and poking her navel. Her legs were already swathed in shadow, and from her struggling hips I could tell they were getting hit hard. This continued for a long while, every inch of the Keeper pulled in made her laugh even harder as her struggles grew more and more furious. Eventually, after what felt like years of deafening laughter, her head disappeared beneath the shadow, which soon swallowed up her arms as well until there was no trace left of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie and I looked at each other, fear rampant on our faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never really liked her,\" T'Calu stated dismissively. She reached down and wiped her hands off on the shadow surrounding her body, as if cleaning them from whatever muck her extensions had been covered in by the Keeper's actions. \"She couldn't even train my pet properly. I'll bet he's dying to get another shot at me, aren't you boy?\" The last question was directed, surprisingly, to Golem, who was still struggling to free himself from his cracked bindings that shackled him to the spot, a deep vibration reverberating throughout the room like a furious roar. There was obviously some history there, but right now we had some more pressing matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time, I was inching away from Maddie, realizing that it wouldn't be long before she started targeting us. Once that happened, it'd be best if we weren't close together, so that we might distract and elude her if for only a bit longer. Maddie quickly caught on and began shifting as well, neither of us straying too far should we need to run in and tackle the goddess. Granted, I wasn't quite sure what we could do against her power, but I wasn't going to submit without trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout moving a muscle, T'Calu spoke: \"Don't think I've forgotten about you two.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>T'Calu slowly turned to face me, smiling brightly but still somehow scaring me to death. With a dismissive gesture, she raised one of her hands and lifted a finger, which summoned a single tendril from the shadows that surrounded us. \"I will have you, harbinger,\" she informed me. \"Whether it's a voluntary service or not makes no difference to me, I merely need your untapped power and that precious body of yours to serve me.\" Straightening, the tendril curved downward and shot at me, speeding toward me faster than I could react...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for it and T'Calu to be his by a massive wall of sand, forcefully enough to dispel one and send the other flying. Despite the odd angle at which she was flying however, T'Calu still managed to land gracefully, her body seemingly righting itself so she could land on her feet within the darkness. Directly opposite her, Qumsal stood, a veritable sandstorm raging around her and filling almost as much space as the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not weak,\" the sorceress said, her eyes glowing like in one of those campy action movies. \"However, an even greater power is on the rise, and I intend to choose the winning side again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT'Calu merely shook her head. \"I should have expected no less from you.\" She raised her arms in a pose mirroring Qumsal's, and stands of the darkness around her flew forward and circled her, much like a hurricane. \"You're always jabbering on about powers rising and falling, about how those who retain authority gradually lose it, blah blah. All this sand must have gotten into your skull and broke something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is called entropy,\" Qumsal retorted, ignoring T'Calu's dig. \"Everything in the universe is affected by it. Even you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their exchange over, both women flung their arms forward, forcing their respective elements toward the other. It shouldn't have worked like that, but the shadow and sand clashed directly between the two, both storms billowing uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong before their fight even began however, Maddie and I were exchanging glances. Neither of us had a history of being psychic, but it was never too late to try. I was sort of half-hoping that Maddie's sixth sense could read my mind or something, but from our frantic gestures it didn't seem to. Still, through a mixture of pointing and waving, we managed to settle on a plan. Both of us nodded at each other, then ran off to get our jobs done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's was a straightforward one; if she could, she was supposed to find a way to the bead and remove it from the pedestal. All the unnatural shadows in the room were billowing from the bead, or more accurately the pedestal just below it, and our thinking was that removing the bead might upset something and force T'Calu to retreat. Of course, that was all fine and dandy in theory, but in practice it appeared to be much harder than either of us had anticipated. As we both quickly found out, anything that touched the writhing darkness around the room quickly felt a gentle wave of tickles wash over it, not enough to be torturous but enough to get us to want to avoid falling into it. And since the pedestal seemed to be the source of it all, Maddie was basically supposed to fight a current in a rushing river heading upstream <i>and</i> avoid getting wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, I was heading in almost the opposite direction, toward the giant form of Golem standing by one side of the room, near the wall beside his entrance. The shadows had begun to engulf the top of him because of his massive size, but the strange beast didn't seem the least bit affected by it. Perhaps expecting a creature made of clay to be ticklish was a bit of a leap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, this part of the plan was a little half-baked, because neither I nor Maddie (at least, so far as I could tell from a bunch of frantic gestures) knew exactly what to do with Golem or how he was supposed to help. What we <i>did</i> know was that Golem, whatever he was, had no love for T'Calu and that the feeling was mutual. Our general thinking went along the lines of freeing him, so he could do something to occupy T'Calu further, and maybe along with Qumsal start turning the tide. The only obstacle: actually freeing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind me, the battle between the two godlike women raged on, but it was clear that T'Calu had the upper hand. As ubiquitous as sand was for Qumsal to manipulate, the pedestal provided T'Calu with a font of power for herself. It was also apparent that T'Calu was just that much stronger, because even while Qumsal's sandstorm was being overrun on either side the two storm-fronts were slowly edging toward Qumsal, who would routinely force the shadows back an inch or two with a massive burst, but not routinely enough to start winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on T'Calu's face was obvious, and it looked as if she weren't even trying. \"Surely you are not this weak, Guardian?\" she asked, giggling. \"It appears to me that the boy would have made it this far with or without your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond them, Maddie was having a difficult time doing what she'd set out to. Simply getting to the pedestal was tricky enough and required a lot of coordination, since the constantly billowing shadows meant that the currents (or whatever shadows had) were fickle and continuously changing. The was no safe spot for Maddie to stand and rest on until she got closer to the pedestal, so one delay or misstep could begin a chain reaction that would end with her being swept into the darkness entirely. After that, who knew what would happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI myself had gotten to Golem fairly easily, but once there I had no idea what to do. His feet were still dry and locked up, heavy and unable to move. As big as Golem was, T'Calu was too far away for him to do any good. As I ran up to him, his entire being tilted downward, again as if he had eyes and were watching things unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what am I supposed to do with you?\" I asked rhetorically, not expecting an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResponding to my voice, Golem turned and reached for the edge of the room with one hand, while reaching down toward me with the other. He was too big for me to simply step back and avoid him, and I thought for sure that he was just going to pick me up, plop me on him and start tickling me to death, but instead he just shepherded me in the direction he was pointing. Surprised that he was actually answering me, I once again wondered briefly what exactly Golem was that he understood human speech. The creature was insistent though, and so I hurried over to where he was pointing, toward the edge of the room and down slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I reached it, forging my way through clouds of darkness and breaking out in giggles whenever I stumbled into one, I looked around for what it was that Golem wanted me to find. I turned back to him, as if he could say something to guide me, but he just kept reaching for something toward the edge of the wall and near the ground. For a while I wondered just what he was gesturing toward, but I had my own answer before long as I took three more steps and splashed into the man-made river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course! Golem was stuck because the magical torches had dried up enough of his clay that he needed to suck it away from his legs, locking them in place. If I could moisturize them again, then Golem would be free to move and fight! The only trouble was, Golem was too far from the river for me to just splash some water onto him, and I had nothing to carry it with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind me, I saw something hopeful and something frightening. Close to the center of the room, Maddie was nearly at the pedestal. The billowing darkness was faster there, and she was often hit by a stray blast that send he reeling and laughing, clutching her sides or feet or whatever else had been hit, but she was making progress. She'd probably be at the pedestal in less than a minute, provided that Qumsal could hold out that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was the scary part. Over where the two magical beings were fighting, the shadows nearly entirely encompassed Qumsal's sandstorm, surrounding it like a container and slowly pushing in, strands of darkness already trying to reach through the billowing grains to get at the sorceress controlling them. The Guardian was trying her hardest to postpone the inevitable, but she was running out of juice and I could see her concentration slipping as some of the farther-reaching tendrils managed to sneak in a tickle on occasion, sending her into a fit of giggles. She wouldn't last much longer, and T'Calu still looked as if she weren't even trying. Noticing me looking, she smiled wickedly and waggled her fingers, as if to say \"you're next\" and send a shiver down my spine.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My heart sank when I saw Maddie take a bad step, placing a foot deep inside one of the dark currents flowing from the pedestal. I couldn't hear her, but I could see her squeal and yank her foot up, sending her off balancing and hopping right into another patch of shadow. Her cackles were lost in the screaming sandstorm and roaring darkness, but I could see her eyes squeeze shut and her shoulders shake with laughter. She continued dancing like that for a few seconds, lifting her feet to wipe away sensations that were already gone by the time it left the ground, before finally losing her balance and taking a tumble right in the middle of one of the many currents. Now I could hear her laughter faintly carried on the wind, as she went ballistic rolling about in the unnatural darkness, never actually going anywhere because it was not actually a river. Her feet kicked and her arms flailed, and it was clear she wouldn't be able to do anything now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar-like vibration shook me out of my concentration, and I looked up to see Golem pointing more urgently. This time, his arm was angle slightly toward my left, or my right when I turned back to face the wall. The door he'd entered from was in that direction, but although it was open there was darkness - natural darkness - hiding everything I might have been able to see. Once T'Calu's shadows were gone the light would be able to illuminate the inside, but for right now I couldn't see a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, when I looked back at Golem he seemed to be nodding enthusiastically, pointing in the same direction. So I took a few step forwards for a closer inspection, hoping to find something of use. It turns out I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the man-made rivers were still water, as that would have caused all kinds of nasty things to grow. So, since they had a current, the water had to be coming from somewhere. Beside Golem's door on either side were two large grates of delicately wrought metal with rivets shaped like flowers and teeth like leaves - or feathers. As I drew closer, as close as I dared to the darkness of Golem's habitat, I saw that on the wall between the door and the grates on either side were levers with wide bars. Equally intricate in design, they sprouted from plaques that seemed embellished with the shapes of waves, suggesting that it had something to do with the water system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rested a hand on the one nearest me, looking back to Golem to make sure I was getting it right. He nodded, furiously, but something caught my attention. It was Qumsal, who was nearly completely defeated by T'Calu's darkness. The sandstorm was a mere orb of activity about ten metres in diameter, barely enough to keep the shadows at bay from Qumsal, and even then some especially long tendrils frequently reached through it to tickle her sides to make her sway, or drag themselves across the tops of her toes to make her hop from foot to foot. T'Calu, who barely seemed to exert any effort this whole time, was now grinning devilishly, anticipating the break of the former Guardian of the Sands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting another beat I pulled down on the lever. Then again, harder this time. The third time I leaned my entire weight on it, and I could hear the grinding noise of rusty gears clanking together as the lever descended slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it reached the bottom of its arc, I heard what sounded like wind. Well, the sound of billowing wind was already filling my ears, but this was different, thicker and heavier. T'Calu heard it too, and when she turned to look her tendrils abated slightly, leaving Qumsal alone for a bit. When Golem heard it, he almost clapped his hands as he turned to face the purple goddess. Then I realized what the sound was: it was the sound of rushing water, from behind the grate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if they were waiting for my realization, two floods of water burst forth from each grate and cascaded out onto the floor. The rivers promptly overflowed, spilling out into the main area as well. Within the span of five seconds the water level had risen to about my ankle - throughout the entire room mind you - and the water kept on coming. It rose to my shins, my knees, my thighs. A shiver ran through my body as the water rushed above my groin and hips, finally coming to a stop at about the height of my ribs. The cold was a stark contrast to the earlier warmth of the room, and I quickly submerged to lower my own body temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready the water was changing the dynamic of the room. While the darkness wasn't washed away by the water, it did seem to dissipate to the point where it didn't have nearly the same potency, and more importantly was no longer under T'Calu's control. Maddie sprung up to the surface over by the pedestal, gasping for breath but otherwise alright. Qumsal too was saved by the water, since she could refocus her efforts just on what was attacking her from above. From her - now cold - position of authority, T'Calu watched as the battlefield changed before her, but she could do nothing to stop it as she shivered much like I had. Apparently her immortal form wasn't completely devoid of all vulnerability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most importantly, it washed over Golem's legs, giving them much-needed moisture. Sure, he was so big that it effectively only reached the tops of his feet, but his body soaked it up fast and moved the water to the parts that needed it most. His legs grew back to their original size as if they were balloon animals, and though it was comical it was also a welcome relief. Too cold to stand, I half-swam back toward the action that was unfolding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was unfolding fast. With two loud <i>squelches</i>, Golem's feet left the floor and squelched their way over to where T'Calu stood. The purple goddess now looked genuinely worried if not afraid, and sucked all the shadows she could from the room into a massive cloud around her. She even recalled her attack on Qumsal, who collapsed and received a much-needed break. All the unnatural darkness formed two banks of almost pitch blackness, from which T'Calu sent blast after blast at the approaching Golem, who was approaching fast, each one colliding into him full force but only serving to knock off bits of clay. There was nothing tickly or cheeky about her attacks now, each one was meant to outright destroy if they could, but for all her effort she may as well have been trying to move a boulder by huffing and puffing at it. Whatever Golem was made of, he had a lot of it and the water did the rest, as he just regrew whatever T'Calu blasted off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds Golem was on her, bringing his two massive arms down in a crushing blow that would have flattened any normal person. Before they connected however, T'Calu took what was left of her shadows and made two giant fists of her own, crossing them and blocking the attack. Both shadows and clay went flying, the former disappearing into nothing and the latter splashing into the water. Both regrew almost instantly what they had lost, and soon an exchange of blows occurred for what could have been forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, it just went until T'Calu's shadows <i>didn't</i> replenish themselves after every hit. The goddess noticed this as well, and when she looked to the source of her power in the room she saw an empty pedestal where the talisman used to be. A few meters away, Maddie stood huddled in the water, clutching the yellow bead-like object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the she was fighting a losing battle, T'Calu spent all her remaining darkness in a massive burst that send Golem reeling and knocked off a good amount of his arm. If he had been human, it would have been grotesque, but as it was the creature just grew it back in a matter of moments. But by that time T'Calu was already on the raised dais, standing within the ring of rock above the water, wearing nothing but two scarves of shadow. The portal wasn't operational, but inside it was a small circle of darkness, enough for one to walk through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when she turned, her looks was not one of frustration of anger, but one that was coquettish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until next time,\" she bade, waving coyly before taking step backwards - and disappearing the next step as she entered the dark portal, which snapped shut and out of existence as soon as she was inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sound of scraping stone didn't stop the impromptu tickle fight at first, it was only as the statue pushed itself forward that the sound finally got the two off each other and staring into the next chamber \"The young master chose well.\" Qumsal said breathlessly, shoving Maddie aside but not before hooking her nails into her top. With a rip, the material, battered and torn at during our adventures, came away from the sudden tug and Maddie squeaked as it fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow clad only in her underwear, Maddie glared furiously at Qumsal as the sorceress smirked in response \"If we are to waste time, at least let us do it so that the young master can enjoy watching it.\" She added with a grin, making me realise that keeping out of the way of these two didn't seem a viable long term option. At this rate, they'd be locked in a tickle duel to the death unless they calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you two focus?\" I snapped, gaining the attention of both of them \"We've only got a limited amount of time before T'Calu breaks through to our reality and while I admit I'm enjoying the sight, this could really wait until later, OK? So just calm down, we're all working towards the same goal. No more snapping at each other, no more distrust, let's just do what we're here to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Maddie and Qumsal remained silent throughout my speech and when it was done, both looked slightly admonished although I could still feel the tension between them as they shared a nasty look. O...Kay, not the peace I was hoping for but at least they'd stopped arguing. The peace temporarily restored, I turned and walked into the room that had opened up to us, Maddie and Qumsal following close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a huge, circular place, carved out of stone with the ceiling extending high above us. As we walked through the entrance way, I saw that the walls had twelve panels carved into them, each showed a beautiful woman in a pose and looking closely, there was something odd about them. Some held animal like characteristics, a Centaur for one or another was a Mermaid and even another one had the horns of a bull on top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned in thought as I tried to piece the odd decorations together before Maddie suddenly gave out an exclamation \"The Zodiac!\" I looked towards her and she motioned towards the carvings with her hand \"Each of these is a representation of a Zodiac sign. The Centuar is Sagittarius, the woman with the scales is Libra and so on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are correct.\" Qumsal said as she stepped towards the middle of the room where an odd looking device stood. It was pole that came up to the average person's waist, carved out of black rock. A handle sat near the top, golden and shaped in the likeness of a spearhead, that could be pushed around the entire pole. It was then, as I was walking over to the pole and tripped over, I noticed there was a series of grooves in the floor that led from the pole directly to each of the carvings in the wall. Righting myself, I walked over to the pole and tugged on the handle, noticing that it could by pushed up or down to the top of the bottom of it and slot into the grooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's another puzzle, isn't it?\" I asked Qumsal as Maddie and I investigated the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed young master.\" Qumsal replied \"It would seem that these carvings could lead to another room or perhaps the talisman itself.\" Looking to the walls, she read the engravings above the carvings, most had been lost through the wears of time but she eventually spoke \"The carvings tell us that the key to this room is to select the guardian to the door. Only one of these carvings is the true door while the others are decoys. We need to point the device in the right direction and fit it into the grooves towards the guardian. Whether it will take us to another puzzle or the talisman itself, I cannot say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we get is wrong?\" Maddie asked, eyeing the carving that showed a woman with claws and feline eyes that represented Leo nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the decoy shall open and unleash a trap upon us, something that is bound to try and tickle us into submission.\" Qumsal answered with a bit more enjoyment in her voice than I liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you tell us which one is the guardian?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alas, I do not know young master. All I can offer you is a hint that is carved into the engravings 'Though I am bound to humanity, like hand to glove, never shall I feel, a person's love'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clue made us all stop and think. A rhyming couplet? Well at least it offered something. I frowned in thought as I tried to fit this to any of the Zodiac but came up short. What did love have to do with stars? Qumsal seemed equally stumped and none of us could think of an answer for some minutes until Maddie perked her head up \"Virgo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virgo is known as the Maiden in the Zodiac, never to feel a person's love? Maybe it's meant... um... you know...\" Maddie blushed slightly in an adorable fashion as she tilted her head towards the pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see Virgo isn't the only maiden among us then.\" Qumsal said with a bit of nastiness, making Maddie flush a deeper red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed a bit of a stretch but it was better than nothing \"Let's give it a go.\" I said as I grabbed onto the handle and started turning it towards Virgo \"Although if this fails, you're going to be the one in the trap Maddie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie looked panicked for a moment before she noticed a grin that showed I was joking. I held the handle over the groove that pointed towards Virgo before taking a deep breath and pushing it down so that it slotted into place. A golden light shot forth from the tip of the handle and went directly to the carving. The light flooded the image until it shone as bright as the Sun and then vanished, leaving only a passageway before us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done young one.\" Qumsal said to Maddie \"You were correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie gave a bright smile and tried to hide her embarrassment somewhat with a smug grin \"Well... You know... I only pointed out the obvious-EEEK!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get a big head now.\" I teased as I dug into Maddie's sides, tickling them as I wriggled my fingers into her bare torso. After a few tense moments like that, we needed someway to blow off the tension and Maddie had earned a bit of tickling for her attack on Qumsal. Qumsal herself needed no encouragement to join in the tickling, sneaking her hands up to Maddie's armpits and wriggling her long nails right in the centre of her hollows. Maddie's half-naked body bucked and writhed in between the two of us, caught between four hands that were busy tickling the life out of her. She jumped, giggled and squealed with each stroke and poke on her sensitive skin although this playful style of tickling didn't get her begging as it had done before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, enough.\" I said after a minute or so and Qumsal reluctantly stopped tickling as I did the same. Maddie continued to giggle after our hands left our skin and she leaned against me for support, her rear pressed against my manhood in a way that made me never want to move. Her face flushed, Maddie continued to softly giggle and smiled at the both of us, something that we returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we're friends again.\" I teased \"Let's get on with our search.\" Qumsal and Maddie nodded as we looked towards the passageway that had opened and started to walk towards it. Beyond its opening, I could see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm sorry young master,\" Qumsal apologized, \"but I crave the power that T'Calu has promised me, so her servant I remain.\" With that, another sudden wave of fatigue washed over me, and before I knew I had blacked out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments of struggling told me I was no more free than last time I woke up. This time I was suspended in a square stone frame; my ankles and wrists were encased in glowing blue stone cuffs, every one of my limbs being pulled in the direction of each corner, stretching me out into an X. Surprisingly, I felt no strain on my wrists whatsoever, and chalked it up to the cuffs supporting my ankles well enough. Or maybe just more magic, I don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike before where darkness gathered in overwhelming groups in every corner, this room was well lit and surprisingly clean. Not a single grain of sand covered the blue floor, which was arranged in tiled rings around the middle of the room. Friezes decorated the curved wall, along with sparse mosaics of feathers and creatures and a woman that looked suspiciously like Qumsal. Small balls of shining white light floated over brazier-like protrusions in the domed ceiling, more than adequately illuminating the space. The fact that the ceiling was a dome suggested that this was the top room in the temple, meaning I had somehow made it to our objective in my sleep. On the far side of the room, opposite from where I was, a doorframe of stone lined the open space and the stairs which led down to the rest of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what captured my attention was the object in the center of the room. From the floor rose a circular pedestal that reminded me of a well, about a meter in diameter and filled with sand. Hovering a foot above the sand was a glass ball, inside of which was smaller orb blacker than night. From it streamed inconsistent lines of ebony liquid; dripping from the bottom, pouring from the sides, overflowing from the top. It looked absolutely revolting, pooling in the bottom of the glass ball and then poured from a single point in the bottom of the ball and into the sand well below. Strangely, the sand was not blackened anywhere around where the vile liquid fell, as if the sand was soaking it up faster than it poured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That liquid is the physical form of the magical energies the Orb of Ethereal provides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my head swiftly to my right, and saw that Qumsal was also in the room with me. Her sharp grey eyes were focused on the oozing orb, as if it were the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. The effect the little thing had on the sorceress must've been mesmerizing, because her eyes became glassed over for a second before she pulled out of her reverie and focused on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the object which you and your companion are trying to remove, thus depriving this city of its magic and denying the portal the necessary power. Those sands soak up the magical energy and channel it throughout the city - including the portal - acting as a conduit between the various magical apparatus in the city and the Orb. So you see, Guardian of the Sands has a literal meaning as well as symbolic. I've been charged with protecting those sands and the Orb, a duty I have performed for millennia. With the nightfire nearly upon us,T'Calu's return to this world is almost inevitable, and soon my duties will be complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you bring me here? The nightfire isn't for another three days, and you seemed to be enjoying me so much that I'm surprised I'm not locked in some tickle chamber or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I earned a smile, as beautiful as it was the first time. \"Believe me young master, I was very tempted to. Unfortunately, your companion is still somewhere in this temple, looking for either you or this orb. She'll never guess they're in the same place. Anyway I need to direct the majority of my attention to finding her - I can only scry locations in the temple, not people - but it would be much more convenient if more of the traps were operational.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, I shrugged. \"I still don't get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what I told you before young master? About mirth magic powering the magical tickling items in this city and in general? You fell into a non-magical trap, luckily in a place where I found you quickly, but there are so many more magical based ones. I was devoting myself to finding you two, and will continue to do so, but now that you're here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization dawned on me. \"You're going to tickle torture me to power your traps,\" I stated. It wasn't a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly wink was given to me by my captor. \"I might even jump in and do some of it personally for a while. This stone frame you're in is currently directing any mirth magic you create to the traps around the temple. Fortunately, there are a lot of traps, so you can be sure this will be very intense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her left hand, the turquoise in her gold ring began to glow, light shining from beneath the cracks made by the carved feather. Then her entire hand began to glow, then her other one. As they did, pale white copies of them emerged from the originals, flying around the air in front of her as another emerged, and so on. Pretty soon there were nine translucent left hands and nine translucent right hands all faintly glowing were filling the space around me. Only now did I notice what wickedly pointy nails Qumsal had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, young master, the feather may have been methodical and torturous, but you will learn that these will have a bit more life in them. Be sure to power <i>all</i> the traps.\" Another sly wink and she pulled up an image of a passageway somewhere in the temple, zooming through it like a camera on a rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghostly hands flexed and quivered, as if excited to start with me. Quickly they flew around me, claiming parts of my body, even providing me with some entertainment as they swatted each other away from claimed areas. This didn't last long though as open spots were disappearing fast. They didn't all start at once, instead starting when each hand was confident that none of the others would challenge them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose at my feet were the first to start, a little isolated from the rest of me and therefore less challenged than the rest. Hands were doing a good job at keeping my arches squirming, sometimes scratching away and sometimes tracing shapes on the smooth surfaces. Another pair was having a good time worming between my toes and itching underneath them, causing them to flex madly in an attempt to block out the tickles. I'm sure they were lamenting the loss of some toe ties right then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to start were the ones at my belly and ribs. Like my feet, four claimed this area and were busy exploiting it to its fullest. Nails explored every dip and crevice above my stomach, counting every rib and then going back to start all over again. My sides were being scratched and belly being drawn on with the ridiculously sharp points. A finger dipped into my navel, and, like last time when something was adventurous enough to go there, it was a peak in my already hysterical state. I swear that hand stayed there for minutes, and came back periodically just to watch my spontaneous explosive reaction whenever it dipped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a lot of other places popped in. Hands tracing circles that spiraled in towards that sweet spot in my hollows, starting from the edge and making their way in. Nails gently stroking my inner thigh, getting close to my genitals but never touching them, teasing the tender flesh. One pair, with nowhere else to go, scrabbled their fingers on the back of my knees, occasionally squeezing them too. A minor tickle, but it contributed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I was tickled in a place that few had ever done before. Just the barest tips of the fingernails made contact with my behind, lightly scratching away at my cheeks. The completely unexpected tickle sent my hips bucking forward to escape. However, the final pair of hands kneaded and squeezed my now completely exposed hips, sending them flying backwards into the spidery tickles on my butt, which sent me forward into the squeezes, and so on. From beyond my completely manic haze I caught a glimpse of Qumsal glancing my way, a smile spreading across her lips as she watched me dance forward and backwards within the confines of my restraints. To her - and to T'Calu, who I'm sure was watching as well - my dance was very amusing, a side show to go along with my torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon I lost all fight within me and resigned to just hang there limply and let the hands do their work. To be honest it was an enjoyable torture, and I knew that the chances of me escaping were almost zilch, but I struggled to pay attention to Qumsal's scrying, maybe distract her when Maddie appeared so she would be overlooked. I could not have predicted what happened next though.</span></div></div>",

You figured there had to be some type of magic that would alert Qumsal to Maddie's presence, but yet there she stood. Qumsal was in her own little world, scanning the various cameras in hopes of spotting Maddie. She would occasionally smile at hearing my frantic laughter, and luckily for Maddie, she wasn't in her line of sight. While the ghost hands worked over my helpless form, I made eye contact with Maddie, and tried my best to make her aware of the Orb of Ethereal, which was merely across the room from her. If she could dislodge it from its pedestal, we would be one step closer to preventing the return of T'Calu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie seemed to pick up on my signals, and she slowly made her way towards the Orb. Just as she started to get close, however, Qumsal seemed to develop a sixth sense and spun around quickly, spotting her. Maddie made a break for the Orb. Qumsal merely gasped and raised her palms towards my determined friend. Her hands glowed the same way they did when she summoned those tickling ghost hands (which were still going at me with great enthusiasm). She summoned a new pair, which traveled towards Maddie with great speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I could do was giggle madly and watch as Maddie...</span></div></div>",

As the ghost hands closed in on your friend, she frantically pushed herself harder and harder to make it in time. With an impressive leap, Maddie collided with the Orb, clearing it from its pedestal. With a booming thud, the Orb smashed onto the floor, and the dark, magical liquid that T'Calu so desperately needed for her return was now covering the cold stone where Maddie lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost hands that were tickling you faded away, and since the Orb no longer channeled energy to the frame holding you, you was released, now kneeling to regain your strength. Maddie was back on her feet, and she rushed over to help you up. You exchanged your feelings of relief that the other was okay, but you couldn't help notice that Qumsal stood motionless, her life's work, and honestly her sole purpose, crushed before her very eyes. Even as you made your way towards her, she just stared at the Orb, shattered and oozing all over the floor. She sank to her knees and sobbed. You and Maddie exchanged looks and actually felt kind of sorry for her. Luckily, you think you knew just a way to help ease her sorrow, if only for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, you wrapped the sobbing Qumsal into a hug and gently eased her onto her back. Maddie picked up on what you were doing and took hold of Qumsal's wrists while you straddled the girl's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to stop with the tears, Qumsal,\" you demanded. Her tears stopped flowing, but she sounded hurt when she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just move on with your mission and leave me here to suffer! You got what you wanted; my beautiful Orb, gone! My life, destro-hehehehehehehed.\" You cut off her tantrum by squeezing her hips, earning a constant stream of giggles. You know that even though she was emotionally in pain, she loved every second of tickling she could get. You stepped it up by going at her belly. Even though you were only using two fingers, she writhed under you and let out wave after wave of frantic laughter. Eventually, you stopped to let her catch her breath and speak. \"Thank you for trying to cheer me up, young master, but I am afraid that I won't be able to recover from such a failure,\" Qumsal sulked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to comfort her, \"Who says this has to be <i>your</i> failure? If you join us, you can totally count this as a victory. Oh, and remember that offer I made you earlier? It still stands, but there's no way you can cash it in if you stay behind.\" Maddie gave you quite the confused look, but Qumsal certainly perked up a bit from hearing those words. Even though you had been tickled quite a bit today, being tickled by Qumsal without any of her magic was still something to look forward to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the tempting offer, she still looked deeply conflicted. She eventually made her decision.</span></div></div>",

I sense that the Guardian of the Seas, Tymeira I believe, will be extremely prepared for your arrival.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that,\" I questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\"There is no doubt that Tymeira felt the destruction of the Orb. Upon shattering, the potent magical energy within the Orb was released quite rapidly. A surge of magical energy that powerful would be sensed in any of T'Calu's devotees, regardless of which realm they may be present. Point being, the element of surprise you enjoyed with Qumsal will not be a luxury in your next endeavor.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, at least we have an extra troop this time around, there's no way she expects that.\" I announced while giving Qumsal a poke. I continued my efforts to cheer her up, and I think I was starting to get to her. She let out a less than satisfied giggle and lazily brushed my hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young master, I must warn you,\" Qumsal spoke up. \"I was rather disciplined in my approach to capture and torment you, but I fear that Tymeira has much more magic to work with. Not to mention she is probably aware that we are coming. There will be many more magical traps to avoid, and it might prove difficult, perhaps even impossible, to avoid detection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And I'm sure you were thinking my escape was impossible when your feathers and ghost hands were going at me earlier, but here we are.\" I remained as headstrong as ever. Before we could continue our back and forth, the Eye interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\"Enough. I must return to T'Calu's realm. Step into the portal, and once again, good luck on your journey.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Making haste, the three of us stepped into the void, and one by one we appeared in a dark, musty cavern. Thankfully, there was enough light present for us to group up and observe our surroundings. The source of the faint light was rather high up on what appeared to be the cavern's equivalent of a ceiling. Glowing plants, resembling a type of moss, had grown in clusters, and emitted shades of green, blue, and yellow streaks of light. As my eyes adjusted, I took note of the surfaces around us, and was surprised to see the stone floor, albeit not level, was smooth. There were no pebbles or rocks anywhere to be seen, and my bare feet appreciated such an accommodating surface. I was finally able to make out structures in the distance. Several large buildings stood in a row, as if they were carved out of the cavern itself. One seemed to tower over the rest, and I decided that would be a great place to start our search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Getting there might prove tougher than the search itself. There were three possible pathways that lead to the structure. The most direct route would be a tunnel that offers a straight shot to the stone city, but there's no telling what could be waiting at the other end, or even inside. To the left, a rather large pool of water had formed at a lower elevation, just below the tunnel. I'm not sure how a lake can form under an ocean, but  that's hardly relevant. Crossing would require us to swim, which could prove quite noisy if we aren't careful. Lastly, to the right of the tunnel, a series of jagged rocks had compounded over time, forming a bridge of stone that overlooked the entire area. Taking this route would offer us the most information about our surroundings, but we would be the most exposed should anybody be watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maddie and Qumsal hadn't broken their silence, and they patiently waited for me to make up my mind on which route to take. Eventually I chose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn't quite consider the fact that the girls might not be so comfortable with the swim. It was an easy thought to have though, as you've been naked since your initial capture at Qumsal's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Qumsal, the dark haired beauty finally interjected. \"I've heard tales of a creature that guards these premises, we should be extremely cautious from this point on. Young Master, I'm not sure if swimming this lake would be good or bad for us, truthfully.\" Maddie's eyes lit up like they usually do when she has a good idea. Remembering the Book, Maddie quickly cracks it open and begins flipping through page after page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no mention of any creature here,\" Maddie states. \"There's only mention of Tymeira, Guardian of the Seas, and her loyal pet.\" Maybe her pet is this fabled creature. It would make sense, but the vague description gives you little to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever this creature might be, we're likely to face it at some point no matter what,\" you said. \"My gut is telling me that swimming is our best bet, and time is always working against us, so we better get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made the executive decision to go for the swim. The water was quite warm and surprisingly clear. There were absolutely zero pollutants, and as you ventured further across the lake, it got considerably deeper. Maddie and Qumsal quickly followed suit, but their clothing slowed them down slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Swimming in a dress turned out to be somewhat difficult for the young sorceress. Maddie's sweater, despite being soaked and thus much heavier, didn't seem to give her many problems. Maddie's screeching voice pierced your thoughts and snapped you out of your trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out!\" she shrieked as a black tendril gripped your left ankle. You tried to kick your foot free, but the tendril, as black as night, merely tightened and held your foot in place. Maddie tried to swim towards you to help, but she wasn't fast enough! A second, slippery tendril found your right wrist, and a third gripped behind the base of your neck. Before you could even react, you were pulled underwater at surprising speed. Thankfully, you managed not to swallow a bunch of water, as it would've been a shame to drown during this great adventure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to twist and turn, but the creature had remarkable control over your limbs. Even though it was hard to tell with all the thrashing, it didn't seem like it was pulling you downwards, but guiding you with a natural current, somewhere. The panic would come to an end after about 35 seconds, as the beast, with one powerful movement, hoisted you in the air of a new cavern. Precious air filled your lungs as the beast held you in place, giving you a view of your new setting. Where the cavern in which you began your swim was rather dim, this new cavern was extremely well lit. Bright orbs of pure white lit the space in its entirety, revealing a massive cavern made mostly of water. Several rocks formed convenient islands, five in total, that could support a person or two each. You started to worry about your friends when suddenly, more tendrils shot out from the water below. You let out a sigh of relief when your friends' gasps for air could be heard behind you. A subtle feeling of guilt washed over you, as you led them to be captured alongside you, but you found some satisfaction that they were at least unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted as the tendrils spun you around, giving you a view of your friends. You shared the same predicament with each of them, one tendril supported each of your limbs. Getting a better look at them, some were rather thin and slippery looking, while others looked more like tentacles. Tentacles with purple undertones and greater thickness probed around Maddie's sweater, earning a few giggles as they found a home in her armpits. Qumsal's laughter soon followed once a few slippery tendrils started fiddling with her tiny feet. To your surprise, you remained untouched, simply hanging there as the warm air caressed your nude form. Your peace didn't last very long, however, as you spotted several figures coming your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart rate picked up considerably at the sight of seven women approaching. The way they were approaching was most interesting. Six of them traveled via massive wings on their backs sporting vibrant colors. Every shade on the spectrum was covered, from bright yellows and oranges to deep purples and calming blues. The women were very beautiful as well, and they all shared the same tone of ashen grey skin. You gulped hard as you realized these women were likely from T'Calu's realm. You took a closer look at the seventh woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman who looked considerably more human from the others was being carried by the same kind of tendrils that still held your giggling friends in the air. She was rather cute and had fiery red hair that fell to the middle of her back. While her six companions were barely clothed, she wore a fitting magenta wet-suit that accentuated her curves rather well. No doubt this was Tymeira making her grand appearance. Your friends continued to giggle and laugh obliviously as the beauties were finally near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my, what ticklish intruders we have!\" Tymeira exclaimed. \"Ladies, why don't you welcome them while I chat with our third guest here.\" Tymeira eyed you and licked her lips as your friends were hauled a bit further away. Three of the flying women claimed Maddie and the others made their way to Qumsal. Maddie's soaking sweater was peeled away from her and discarded to the waters below. Her ribs and armpits were relentlessly kneaded and squeezed by two of the ashen women while the third played with the sweet spot on her hips. Qumsal didn't fare much better; each foot had its own tormentor while a raven-haired woman expertly raspberried her sides and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Tymeira's right hand to guide your vision away from the sight of your friends being tickled. She pulled your chin towards her  and locked eyes with you. \"Let them have their fun while we talk, unless you'd like to join them?\" Tymeira questioned. \"My pet and I could show you quite the fun time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is there to really talk about?\" You responded. \"Aren't you just going to trade me to T'Calu the first chance you get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knew that a Chosen's spirit could be broken so easily.\" Tymeira started poking and pinching around your belly. \"Maybe I was wrong to bring you here.\" Tymeira stated teasingly. You probably had a confused look plastered all over your face despite your giggles. You had no idea what she meant by Chosen, but maybe there's hope for a bargain after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whahahat does Chosen mean,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Chosen is a person of prophecy, destined to overthrow the corrupted Bringer of Laughing Torment and Delight, T'Calu.\" Tymeira explained. \"It is said that the Chosen has a strong connection to these realms and to tickling in general.\" She sped her fingers up and explored more of you, forcing more laughter from your lips. \"So, convince me that you're indeed the Chosen, make me an offer that only a Chosen would make.\" Despite the ticklish distraction, the words practically leaped out of you. You made the same offer to Tymeira that you made to Qumsal not too long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you hehehelp me, you can tickle mehehehe whenever you wahahant.\" Tymeira stopped her ticklish assault on your tummy and was seriously considering the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I think I need some time to think it over.\" Tymeira deviously grinned. As if she could communicate with her pet, the tendrils holding you started to react. They laid you out horizontally while several more participated in supporting your weight from underneath you. Slippery tendrils slithered over your torso, covering your skin in a slimy liquid from the depths of your armpits to the crevices between your toes. Even such mild action was rather tickly, and you found yourself giggling madly as the tendrils lathered up every inch of you, including your more private areas. The tickling progressed as two tendrils began stroking your feet with consistency, occasionally worming between your toes for added effect. Your armpits each received a probing tendril, sliding around searching for the sweet spot in the center. Several others swirled around your rib-cage and sides, while a lone tentacle strategically placed its suction cup over your belly button, mimicking the effects of repeated raspberries. Your laughter was frantic and unrelenting by this point. Tymeira smiled as you wiggled around in your inescapable bonds. Eventually, the tickling stopped and your laughter died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've made my decision.\" Tymeira stated.</span></div></div>",

The Chosen is said to have a strong connection to these realms, and it has been foretold that the Chosen would one day usurp control over the realms and restore order and purpose among the various factions that exist here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head was spinning from all this new information. \"Wait, so, you mean to tell me that I might be T'Calu's replacement? I'm supposed to steal her power and become the new Bringer of Laughing Torment and Delight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, essentially yes,\" Tymeria assured, \"but you would be free to forge your own path. You see, T'Calu wasn't always so determined to conquer your world. There was a time when she was rather laid back and dare I say caring. Over time though, the power slowly took over her and transformed her very being. Now, she only uses tickling as a weapon, and nobody has the courage nor the means to stand up to her, until now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think I could possibly stop her?\" You say. \"I'm only here to prevent T'Calu from conquering my world and enslaving me forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really so hard to believe though?\" Tymeira questioned. \"The Chosen is said to have a strong connection to these realms, and I definitely believe that to be the case. Qumsal wouldn't have followed you if she didn't believe the exact same thing. The Chosen loves all aspects of tickling. Tickling others. Being tickled himself.\" Tymeira forced a laugh by pinching your ribs a few times. \"But most importantly, his intentions are pure, and you've already proven that by standing your ground with T'Calu in the first place. Any normal boy would've accepted her offer, but not you. You saw past the immediate pleasures she offered you and thought of not only your future, but everybody else's as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made some good points, and this really was your best chance at stopping T'Calu's return anyways. \"Okay I see your point, thanks for your help.\" You smiled at Tymeira. \"Now can you let me down please?\" She smiled back at you before a few parting tickles were bestowed upon you. She lowered you to a smooth rock platform below, but she remained suspended in the air. You forgot that during your entire conversation, Maddie and Qumsal were being tickled relentlessly by the ashen beauties from T'Calu's realm. Tymeira turned to face them. They were so focused on tickling your friends senseless that they didn't notice you being let down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could react, the ashen women were ambushed by a flurry of new tendrils, gripping their wrists, ankles, around their waists, etc. They flapped their vibrant wings in complete panic, but it was too late. Each woman was unable to escape, tendrils slithered all over their exposed flesh, earning belly laughs and giggles. Meanwhile, your friends were being lowered to the same platform as you. They were exhausted, and several spots on their bodies were bright red from all the tickling. They looked at you in confusion, but seemed to understand that you once again managed to pull off the impossible. They looked behind them to see their former tormentors getting their just desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your friends catch their breath, you decide what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Maddie's ankles had been seized only a few feet from where the Orb of Ethereal floated on its pedestal. They dragged her away from the Orb when the other hands showed up to help out. They took control of her wrists and managed to flip her onto her back. The remaining hands did what they do best and began tickling her. Her sweet laughter filled my ears as the hands worked their way underneath her sweater, tormenting every tickle spot they could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQumsal let out a huge sigh of relief and made her way towards me. \"Well, young master, that was a close one. Your friend has proven quite resourceful; she managed to avoid being detected by my eyes in the sky. Quite impressive, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a point you're trying to make here,\" I said with a hint of animosity, \"or are you just trying to rub it in my face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQumsal merely smirked, took a step closer, and started tickling your right side. \"Well, young master, I was going to give you the chance to reward her efforts personally, but now I think I have a better idea.\" With Maddie's cute giggling still echoing in my ears, fatigue washed over my body yet again, and I fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI roused from my sleep the same way as before, not groggy in the slightest. I squirmed around to find out I was still restrained and naked, yet again. \"Man this is kind of getting old,\" I muttered under my breath. I was much more comfortable than I was before. I had been placed on my back, soft leather hugging most of my body, but it stopped just before my knees and my elbows. Both my calves and my forearms formed a 90 degree angle pointing downwards. They were completely enveloped by some sort of cushion that was secured to the floor. Although the cushions holding my arms in place stretched out my torso, at least my feet wouldn't be exposed for any of the tickling that was sure to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get used to it, young master,\" Qumsal's voice echoed throughout the chamber. \"I took the liberty of moving you to a more appropriate location, now that both you and your friend are no longer a threat to T'Calu's return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took note of the surroundings. The current setting was definitely more akin to the tickle dungeon that Qumsal and I had discussed during our last encounter. Despite not being able to move my head much, I was able to make out the room to be circular, with high walls. Qumsal had positioned herself in an enclosure nearing the top of said wall, sitting on what seemed to be a type of throne which overlooked the entire space. Various restraint tables and frames filled the room, and I was sure that I would end up in most of them before my time here expired. Numerous racks with no shortage of tickle tools were present as well. Everything from simple feathers and hairbrushes to claws and robotic arms were present here, and I was starting to get nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fret, young master, I decided that you've had enough tickling from my magics for one day. I opted to take you a more... human approach.\" Seemingly out of nowhere, Maddie approached your helpless form, stripped down into a rather cute set of pink underwear. I gulped as Maddie rested her soft hand on my chest, a look of defeat in her eyes. \"I'm sorry I couldn't save you,\" she pouted. I was quick to console her, \"Don't worry about it, I could see that you tried your best, even if you came up a little short.\" Maddie took mock offense at my comments. She responded by skittering her nails up the side of my neck, forcing a giggle. \"Be careful who you talk to like that while you're tied down to this table, mister.\" Despite the helpless feeling of being defeated by Qumsal, I simply played along. Might as well get a good laugh out of the end of the world... \"Do your worst, lady. You'll never break me no matter how hard you try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie smiled brightly as she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Minutes passed, then an hour. Qumsal's phantom hands ran ceaselessly over my body, exploring every minuscule patch of skin and each nerve that existed. The hands often swapped places, offering me short lapses of minimal respite, but some went to explore new places. For example, one hand wasn't satisfied with the back of my knee and so went searching for an unclaimed spot. Then it discovered that I had genitals that were completely left alone and went to work tracing its nails across my dangling balls, sending fire through the bundles of nerves. Soon my other knee was abandoned and the hand flicked its nails across my cock and tip, furthering my state into a horny ticklish mess. Nowhere was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, my body began to sag ever so slightly. Initially I wasn't able to pay much attention to it, distracted by the multitude of tickles shooting through me, but then I realized that my cuffs were lowering - both the ones at my wrists and ankles. I didn't know why, maybe there was a short circuit or a glitch or something, but I did know amidst my manic thoughts that I would have an opportunity soon that I likely would never have again, and it would only last for as long as Qumsal didn't notice me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProgress was slow, but at least I had something to occupy myself with while I waited. My mad bucking from the previous hour was gone (though I half-heartedly brought it back when the nails found my cock and balls), replaced with a limp doll that made laughter for their machine. Of course I was far from my limits, and actually found the whole thing rather enjoyable, but the need to help Maddie and stop T'Calu kept me focused (mostly).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few minutes and my toes just touched the ground ever so slightly, and my arms were also lower and closer, allowing me more wriggle room. The hands just went about their business as if nothing was wrong, finding a new place if I denied them access to their original. If anything, they enjoyed my new freedom as it allowed them to play 'ping pong' with my torso: a bunch of hands would tickle one side of me - say my left hip, my left side, my left ribs, and my left armpit - sending me flying over to the other side, which would then be tickled by another group - my right hip, side, ribs, and armpit - and send me back the other way, set on infinite repeat. They certainly seemed to enjoy themselves, and I made a mental note to tell my ticklers in the future to try this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now my feet were firmly planted on the ground, a fact that would have worried my phantasmal tormentors and led to them alerting their master were they not having so much fun sending my body back and forth. Suddenly my wrists went slack and dropped to my sides, my restraints failing and giving me a window of opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore my tormentors could react I rushed Qumsal from the side. She turned in time to see me just before I tackled her, and the look on her face was positively priceless. When we landed she got the wind knocked out of her, and I took the chance to start digging my fingers into her ribs. Immediately she burst out in laughter, and I noticed when I looked back that her ghost hands flailed around and started to fade. Now with a sudden advantage, I pressed the attack, tickling her everywhere I could, changing techniques as well as location to make it more difficult for her to avoid or block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was maybe as ticklish as me, her laughter sweet and unending, her body writhing and wriggling instead of struggling and thrashing. Most of her hands were gone now, leaving only four left and even those were winking in and out of sight. Quickly they came to their summoner's aid, flying towards me and tickling my exposed sides and feet in a desperate attempt to shake me off their master. Suffering a ticklish assault of my own, I hesitated for a moment before resuming. It was now a face-off between me and the ghost hands - would I be able to tickle Qumsal enough to make her lose focus and dissipate the remaining hands, or would they succeed in tickling me off their master?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One by one the hands disappeared, letting me continue unhindered. My fingers explored up and down her torso, kneading her hips, squeezing her sides, digging into her ribs and tracing shapes in her armpits. As I'd noticed before, her physical reaction to the tickling wasn't to protect herself or try to escape, rather just sort of squirm in place at the mercy of my fingers. To be honest it was rather sexy, though I kept my mind from wandering too off track. She hadn't said a single thing during my entire assault, so I was the first to make a proposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're reconsidering my earlier offer,\" I said. Without waiting for a response, I assumed the negative and kept tickling her, loving her reactions as much as she loved mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQumsal didn't reply, just kept laughing musically. Turning around and sitting on her shins, I began to focus on her pretty bare feet. Her momentary break was interrupted with the feeling of fingers tracing up and down her arches, from the balls of her feet to the heel, scratching gently all the way. I noticed how her toes flexed randomly in response to the tickles, and decided this was a good chance to worm my fingers in between them. The result was explosive. Her laughter rocketed up in decibels and her wriggling became more intense. When I started playing 'this little piggy' with her toes, I thought she was going to lose it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes I stopped, letting her catch her breath. \"Why help T'Calu return?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because... she will... give me... power,\" she answered between breaths, her chest heaving for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want to rule the world or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not necessarily. Just the raw ethereal power, the magic, the potency. T'Calu will grant me these upon her return to Earth, since I will be at her right hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't sound like you'll get a lot of free time though.\" I could tell it was a sore spot that weighed heavily in her mind. A look of remorse flashed across Qumsal's face, but it was gone just as quickly. Her ring started to glow, and I started playing with her toes again, sending her back into mad hysterics. She was not going to use her magic to jump me. Once I had stopped and she'd come under control again, I asked, \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill recovering, Qumsal did her best to answer. \"I want... power... and freedom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was thinking furiously, trying to find a way to convince her and coming up dry. How did you grant even more magic to a sorceress? Especially since I didn't have a lick of magic to spare. \"Is there anything we can offer, any way we can give you power without you serving T'Calu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorceress was quiet for a long time before she answered. \"If you are willing to help, young master, it is possible for me to replace T'Calu as goddess of lust and mirth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to be honest, that threw me. She wanted to become a goddess? Frantically I sputtered, \"What? Why? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I want is powerful magic and the freedom to use it as I please, and who has more ethereal power or freedom than a goddess? I do not fancy world domination, there is no purpose in a society that lives only to tickle itself. The only reason I bind myself to T'Calu is because she has promised me great magics if I aid her return. But if I were to usurp her, then those magics would be mine anyway, and more. You've seen T'Calu's realm, young master, all the mirth magic that is being produced there every second, all the dark desires she wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I knew what it was like in T'Calu's realm. I remembered the blurred figures I saw as I traveled straight to T'Calu's abode, the helpless victims, manic laughter, burgeoning lust and satisfaction. It was pure madness, a perpetual state of tickling. Such things would grant an infinite supply of the mirth magic Qumsal desired.\"And you want... you want to become the goddess of insatiable lust and eternal laughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have ambitions mortal, but I know what I want. Conquering this world has never appealed to me. The different realms were created differently because each one was meant to be unique. Each has its own beauty, each has its own ugliness. A true goddess should seek only to build on her existing power instead of expanding into a whole other realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside my mind was a hurricane of thoughts and questions. Qumsal as a goddess, overthrowing T'Calu? Would that be better or worse? Was that even possible? \"How do you overthrow a god?\" I asked out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know, but I know of someone who does. There's only one being who is in tune with T'Calu's plane of existence to answer that question in detail: the Eye of Kietelen. I don't know where he stands on the goddess' return, but he is the closest vassal to the goddess and our chances of persuading him are slim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, they're better than you think.\" Of course, the Eye. T'Calu's ambassador, and her most directly linked portal. Currently the highest ranking being under the goddess' influence, he might object to overthrowing her entirely. Although if I brought Qumsal along and the two had a chance to talk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you help me young master? All I desire is the magic, but if you cannot offer any than I must stay with T'Calu.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a bit of thought, I decided that if Qumsal swore to keep her power within her realm it would be a better alternative that T'Calu who would keep trying to invade. Although I wasn't the most educated in terms of this spiritual ethereal godly stuff, so I'd let the Eye be the final judge on this one. \"If I let you talk to the Eye, will you help me disable the portals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see the sorceress thinking. It was a far cry from her original demand, but it was a step in the right direction. Eventually, she replied, \"I agree to your terms. I'll help you if you let me talk to the Eye of Kietelen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, I offered my hand to both shake and help her up. \"So, we have a deal?\" Without saying anything else, Qumsal nodded and took the offered hand, pulling herself up until she was right beside me. \"So what do I do to the orb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply removing it will deny the portal of the power necessary to open,\" Qumsal told me, taking my offered hand and pulling herself up next to me. \"However, the base energies that it provides will pool without the sands and magical apparatus to use it, and eventually it'll flood the city with raw energy. That's a bad thing before you ask, too much base energy without a purpose tends to be unstable and could cause a catastrophic disaster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we destroy it?\" I asked, moving in closer to examine the glass ball and the black orb inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible. There is no way to destroy the Orb, and all attempts have failed miserably. You'd have better luck reaching the center of a star - there's more energy in the tiny orb than the combined power of every star in the Milky Way galaxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought for a moment, trying to come up with a solution for this seemingly impossible task. \"You said that the energies this Orb creates will not disappear unless used in magical equipment. So if we found another item that uses these energies, then we could move the Orb to that and both use the energies to do one thing while depriving the portal of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could work,\" Qumsal said thoughtfully. \"There's a backup magical lighting system with a finite source of energy, designed to kick in if the main lighting fails for whatever reason. It's separate from the main magical system, so moving the orb there would keep the lights on but deprive nearly everything else of the energies. The receptor is in the bottom of the temple, not far where you fell into that trap actually. We'll bring the Orb there, and I'll reconfigure the backup system to take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like a good plan, and I wasn't coming up with anything else. \"This temple was built to be like a maze, how am I going to find a specific room in the very bottom of the temple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a solution,\" she told me. Waving her left hand around in the air, I saw faint green lines shimmer around it, slowing gathering together and forming a shape. Her hand stopped moving, and when she put her thumb and forefinger together a green feather appeared between them, held by her pointy nails. \"This is another mirth magic tool, though its purpose is a bit mundane. It will hover around you, a short distance from your body, until you snap your fingers. When you do, it will move in and start tickling you, using your laughter to create an arrow pointing towards your destination. It takes a minute to fully form, so let it run for a short while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she let go, true to her word the feather approached me and started floating around my body in random circles. The little tool kept its distance, but from its writhing it looked like it wanted to do nothing but dive in and start stroking me as soon as it could. \"Anything else, mortal?\" Qumsal asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you find my friend, Maddie? She's part of this too, and we need to find each other before we leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorceress nodded. \"I'll bring her to the front foyer of the temple, then meet you at the receptor. A few things before we part.\" Her ring began to glow, and in her hand appeared a white cloth sack. \"Put the glass protector in this and tighten it. Those magical energies won't stop flowing, and they have a notorious reputation for being highly unpredictable when brought into contact with a mortal. Also keep in mind that there are still many perils between you and your goal. There are lots of traps lining the passages - the magical ones are powered by small reserves of mirth magic - and various creatures roam the temple halls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few steps forward and pulling me to face her, she rested her left hand on my belly. A tickling sensation began to spread out from where she touched me and I withdrew only to find that they tickles followed me. I giggled as the sensations formed the shape of a feather, starting just above my hips and ending with its tip in my bellybutton. Eventually the feelings faded, leaving behind a golden tattoo-like impression on my skin exactly where the tickling was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will allow me to scry you directly while you're in the temple,\" Qumsal explained. \"It'll tickle whenever I'm scrying you, letting you know when I'm looking at you so you can talk to me. Anything can happen between here and the bottom room, and if you get lost or trapped or captured I want to be able to find you and help.\" She offered the sack. \"Good luck, netelig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, I took the sack from her. \"Netelig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means 'ticklish one' in my original language,\" she explained, winking, \"though it can also translate to 'honored one'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she walked towards the stairs, getting to her task while I attended to mine, sliding the white sack around the glass ball and sealing it tightly, surprised at how easily the Orb was removed. At the stairs, Qumsal had stopped and turned with one last piece of advice just as the lights disappeared, quickly replaced with a duller blue light that ran throughout the temple this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, one more thing. There's only enough backup power to maintain one hour's worth of lighting. After that it will be pitch black until you and I reach the receptor. Do try to be there before then: it's much harder to find your way in the dark, and a lot of creatures in this temple thrive in shadow.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Funny how distances look so much shorter from higher ground. As soon as we reached the bottom of the stairs (the climb took all of fifteen minutes) we were dwarfed by the immense structures that lined the road. Since this was an old world city there was no such things as sidewalks, but the ruts made from carts were still visible even after thousands of years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most of the damage came from the ages, it was clear that the descent into the desert took its toll on the city. Grains of rock were piled unevenly across the street and in the buildings, some of which were full of sand, acting like a windowless container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind us, a large cluster of bugs flew around and slowly headed towards us, its buzzing softer than our ears could pick up at that distance. We didn't know they were there, but they knew we were there, as did every creature in the city by now. Deciding now was a good time to strike, the swarm flew quickly towards its first victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, we heard an ominous buzzing noise, as we turned around we saw a throng of what looked like miniature scarabs. Each one was no bigger than a fly, but there were so many that I couldn't fit them all in a jar if I tried. Maddie screamed at the sight of the bugs and we quickly turned and dashed in a mad attempt to outrun the swarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those things?\" she asked frantically, pushing herself harder than she evr had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever they are, we know what they're going to do, and we don't have the time! Let's split up and see if they follow both of us, if not maybe something in this book will help whoever's free get rid of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in agreement, Maddie quickly ran right while I veered to the left. The swarm adjusted course accordingly, altering its direction so that it closed in on her quickly. Once it was apparent she was their target, I turned back to face Maddie while opening the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry!\" she shouted, never pausing. There was evident fear in her eyes but something else. Excitement? Anyway I couldn't waste too much time, so I turned to the chapter about this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of searching, I found a beastiary on T'Calu's minions, listing everything from snakes to birds to these snake-woman things. Some of the pages were crumpled, forcing me to waste time smoothing them delicately for fear they would tear. I scanned the names, looking for anything to do with bugs, the buzzing a constant reminder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scream of fear pierced my eardrums, followed by a scream of laughter. Looking over, I saw that Maddie had been brought to the floor by these things, laughing too hard to be able to stand anymore. Her loose sweater and t-shirt had been reduced to rags on the floor around her, exposing her bare torso and silky pink bra for the city to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bugs must've been really tickly, for all they were doing was crawling up and down Maddie's belly and ribs. A nest had formed in each of her armpits, and I could tell they were driving my childhood friend mad. One even dipped into her navel with explosive results. \"I HAHAHATE BUHUHUGS!\" Part of my brain filed this information away while the rest returned to focusing on the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I found the bugs. They were called the Seeker Swarm, for their ability to collectively hone in on a victim, reducing their clothes to shreds and the wearer to tears. However, they drowned easily in water because of their unbelievably small size. I had my answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water!\" I shouted, trying to make myself heard over the din of the swarm. \"Hang on, I'll take you to a fountain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we knew how to get rid of them, but she was in no condition to go anywhere. So, true to my word, I took the plunge and burst through the ring of bugs, helping Maddie up and together making our way to the closest fountain.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I moved towards the pool, I couldn't help but notice the tingling feelings of stray bugs climbing over me. A few giggles escaped my lips just as I was about halfway to the fountain. The next thing I knew, I was overwhelmed by the bugs crawling over me, and I collapsed, the bugs now starting to eat my clothes. In my laughter I managed to lock my gaze on Maddie, and boy was I glad I wasn't her! She had 5 times the amount of bugs on her, crawling over her neck, arms, pits, breasts, ribs, belly, sides, her cute little bellybutton, her hips, her thighs, knees, feet, pussy....pussy? <br>\r\nIt was then that I realized that the bugs had now eaten straight through her panties, giving them (and me) full view of her clean shaven pussy and nice round butt. However, I think the bugs got the better end of this, as they had begun crawling over and inside her clit and anus, driving her to a new height of hysterics. \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!\" Was all she could get out before falling back into hysterics. Just before I turned my head to the fountain, I  notice one go inside her love hole, and I can only imagine how much that must of tickled.<br>\r\nAs I had only a portion of the bugs on me that she had, I was able to locate the fountain and begin to crawl to it, inching my way painstakingly forward as the bugs reduced my shirt to shreds. As I neared the fountain, I heard strange noises behind me. Only when I looked back did I realize that, every now and then, through her constant laughter, a moan would escape her lips, long, loud, and erotic. I shook my head once to clear it, then continued, determined to save Maddie.<br>\r\nIt had taken me a good 10 min to reach the fountain, and, as I did, I heard Maddie scream hysterically once before falling back into her moaning laughter. It was hard with my diminishing strength to pull myself up and over the lip of the fountain, but once I did, and fell into the cool, crisp water, all the bugs stopped, and my strength returned. I quickly got up, and ran over to Maddie, and as I did, she screamed again. I swooped her up in my arms, and ran over to the fountain. Surprisingly non of the bugs tried to get to me, I guess they were satisfied with their current prey, who bucked and moaned and laughed in my arms.<br>\r\nShe screamed once more as I gently tossed her into the deep fountain. She came up seconds later, gasping for air. As I helped her up, I could not help noticing her small b-cup breasts, perky and at attention, and her slender form all the way down to a clean-shaven and throbbing clit. What a sight! I did not have long to look though, as she quickly wrapped me in a huge hug. This was the first time I noticed that I was bare-chested and my pants where now shorts. She was still laughing slightly as she looked up into my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for saving me, but you could of gone quicker next time!\" I saw a new spark in her eyes as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I had a group of those things on me too, ya know!\" I retorted playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No excuse!\" She scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yea?\" My voice warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea.\" The mischief in her eyes was unrelenting, and neither was her stance, which seemed to want to reveal her breasts to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then.\" With that I attacked her sides, and they seemed to be even more sensitive than before, if that was possible! Although she wriggled and squirmed, she did not fight back either. This struck me as weird, but enjoyable, until about 3 min in, after I had worked over her entire upper body, minus the breasts, I took notice of a pitter patter on the ground below us. I looked down and lone behold, a pool of liquid, with a trail going up both her legs, converging on....<br>\r\nIn disbelief, I stopped tickling her. It all came together, the moaning the screaming, now I knew exactly what those bugs had done to her. I looked up and meet her gaze. In that instant, she knew I knew. A smile spread across my lips. \"Well, it would seem somebody likes being tickled.\" The mischief in my voice was thick. \"And...and so what?\" She tried to sound defiant, but it came out so weak. After a moment, she relented, and turned to putty in my strong arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, they made me really horny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the point that you came?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed madly at this, but replied. \"Three times, in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not quite believe my ears \"Well, I shall keep this in mind for later then.\" I tried to keep myself calm, but I could feel a bulge in my pan...whoops, shorts now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says your gonna be able to use it?\" She poked me once in the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, considering you no longer have any clothes, and there are bound to be more traps along the way, I  think I will have many chances to admire, and tickle, your luscious body.\" With that she melted, her eyes turning to slight lust as she melted into my hug, snuggling close to my bare chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, she said.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wish you luck on your quest.\"</b> With that, a low humming was heard from the Eye as it worked its powers to open the portal to us. Maddie and I felt the winds stir and the forest around us turn silent as the humming sound got louder and louder. I felt Maddie cling onto my arm as the winds stirred around us, the air turning dark as we were swallowed by shadows forming from out the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I thought that this wasn't my wisest move, we were swallowed by the darkness and for a long moment, all we could see was sheer blackness and all there was to hear was silence. I started to breath fast, trying not to panic in case we had fallen into a trap of some kind when the darkness suddenly lifted and we stood in a large chamber. First thing I noticed was how damp it seemed, not cold oddly enough but humid and warm, like having just got out the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside me, Maddie gave a gasp as she looked around and took in the chamber. It was huge, but looked as if it had been naturally formed as the walls were curved in the way of a cave. Murals decorated the walls from one end to the next, showing hundreds of men and woman in various states of undress being tickled by black feathers, apparently they were depictions of T'Calu's Realm. I felt a blush cross my cheeks at the sight and looking to Maddie, also saw her redden from the images which made me smile more than a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on the task at hand though, I walked forward, Maddie still holding onto me as I took the book and started reading through for any clues regarding the portal. After skimming through the pages, we found a drawing which showed a triangle holding an eye in the middle, the three points glowing as I started to read the paragraph underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The Eye of Vellica. The Water portal that would allow T'Calu's aquatic denizens into the World. When the time for T'Calu to return comes, the statues of the Water Palace come to life to bring the Eye to full power. The statues were fiercely guarded by the Old Ones while they dwelt on the Earth, for should even one of them be disrupted during the spell, the Eye's power would be broken for millenia due to the disruption of such power.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie and I grinned at each other as we had read the passage, seeing a way to stop the first portal already \"Let's go!\" Maddie said, eager to get this done with and we rushed through the humid chamber to a corridor carved out of the rock nearby. Side by side, we went forward and didn't notice until too late the creature drop down from above us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like a mass of tentacles, a dark green in colour and stretching out in all directions as it fell and landed on...</span></div></div>",

The closest description I could think of was an enormous amoeba, with various tentacles and gooey apendages flailing about. The gelatinous mass of protoplasm undulated and pulsed as Maddie was enveloped into the translucent interior. Her cries of alarm were quickly snuffed out as the creature spread and writhed around her, creating a Maddie-shaped cocoon of slime! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddie!\" I yelled, watching in horror as my friend was practically consumed by the living goo. I took a step towards it, unsure of how to tackle such a creature, when one of the tentacles suddenly snapped at me... it was as if it was warning me to back off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, I looked around for some kind of weapon. But the large cavern had nothing but rocks scattered around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The book!\" I muttered, slapping myself upside the head. I frantically scanned the pages, searching for anything to do with 'giant slimes'. Meanwhile, I thought I heard a curious sound emanating from the creature... was it muffled giggles? Surely this abomination wasn't <i>tickling </i>Maddie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! C'mon!\" The descriptions of the denizens of the Water Palace was surprisingly brief, with little or nothing to do with the creature before me. The authors must have rarely set foot in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my horror, I realized the giant protoplasm was sliding away... with Maddie still trapped inside! \"No!\" I shouted futilely. Her muffled cries were growing fainter, and all I could see was a vague outline of her body, somewhere inside the creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear the book was useless against such a menace, and my friend was slowly being dragged away. I had to act...</span></div></div>",

I got out of the basement but left the book at the bottom of the stairs, didn't seem much point in taking it further.

Not thinking much, I started to ask \"Hey Maddie, you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEK!\" Came the cry as I suddenly realised that Maddie wasn't quite ready yet. In fact, she was only wearing her underwear, matching bright pink bra and panties which went well with her bright face. Standing near her bed, she pulled up the duvet and tried to cover her body with it, glaring at me as I stood there and gaped like a fish \"What're you doing?!\" She demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Checking up on you?\" I said lamely as I felt the heat rise to my ears from sheer embarrassment at having done this \"Look, I'm sorry!\" I quickly added \"I just... got worried I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's expression softened somewhat and she relaxed. Her hair looked damp and it seemed as if she'd just gotten out of the shower \"I'm fine.\" She said before giving a small smile \"A lot better now that I have someone to talk to over this, even if it does sound like I'm going crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping my true thoughts to myself, I simply walked over to Maddie and put a comforting hand on her bare shoulder \"Hey, I'm here for you.\" I said \"We'll sort this out, one way or another trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie surprised me by dropping the duvet and pulling me in for a hug \"Thank you.\" She whispered as she held her body close to mine. Something that got me more than a little flustered from having an attractive young woman in her underwear embracing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to return the gesture, I hugged Maddie back and, unable to resist the temptation, whispered in her ear \"Of course, there's one real tickle monster you should be worried about... ME!\" I cried out as my fingers started to tickle her bare sides and ribs, holding her in place with the hug as I stroked her naked skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie didn't event have time to react before the tickling started, her mouth opening wide as she let out a shout of laughter that was soon followed with her pleasant, melodic giggled \"Nohohooofahahaiirr!!\" She protested playfully, losing her balance as she fell back onto the bed, pulling me with her. I continued tickling her after the landing of course, my fingers teasing all down her sides as she wriggled and pleaded for mercy through her laughter although my own excitement and enjoyment of the situation made me reluctant to stop just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I squeezed her lower ribs and made Maddie laugh even harder, I decided to...</span></div></div>",

So, I figured, why not give her a good laugh before we ventured into the unknown? Besides, Maddie had always been a more... desired target of my tickling wishes. A way to satisfy two things at once! As I kept my hands busy with Maddie's ribs, I glanced around her room for something to playfully restrain her with. Looking over at her nightstand, I saw a very curious thing peeking out from one of the shelves. Reaching over, I pulled out two pairs of black, strangely furred handcuffs! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohoho... Maddie, you naughty little girl...\" I jested playfully, dangling them in front of her face. Still worn from the tickling, Maddie barely replied with a sharp gasp, as if I had found something out about her! I grinned, sitting gently on her back, and pulled her feet closer. \"These are fun little toys Maddie... What do you say we play with them?\" Tenderly, I snapped shut the handcuffs around Maddie's ankles, keeping them in place. I then took her arms and held them back, cuffing one hand at first, but moving the chain of the second pair of handcuffs over the first pair, then locking her other wrist in place, restraining her quite handily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then I wiggled my fingers all over her feet, her peachy soles no match for my digits. Within seconds, Maddie began to sing with laughter, barely able to contain herself. I explored her feet, touching toes, soles, heels, and everywhere in between, happy to hear her cry of laughter. After thirty long minutes had passed, I slowed my efforts, aiming to let Maddie breathe for a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that was fun huh?

Blinking as I tried to gain my bearings, I realised how oddly warm this place was despite the fact I'd lost everything except my boxers. I shook my head groggily and slowly got to my feet, looking around but finding that I couldn't see anything, the surrounding fog far too thick. \"Maddie?\" I called out, hoping that she was somewhere close by. \"Maddie are you there?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence was my only answer and I started to get worried very quickly. Had Maddie come through with me? Had she managed to escape? I tried not to panic as I looked one way then the other, searching for any sign of Maddie, before I finally heard something from afar. It was the sound of wild laughter that I recognised as Maddie's. I managed to pinpoint its source and began running straight for it, crying out for my friend all the way, hoping she was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's laughter got louder as I ran towards it, finally reaching something that loomed up from the ground. It was a large circle, seemingly made of stone and housing a pool of water where Maddie's laughter was coming from. I leaned over the edge and peered into the shallow pool, within which I could see a vision, as clear as a TV screen. In it was Maddie, stripped down to only her panties and flanked by two figures. They had the appearance of beautiful shapely women, but their ashen grey skin, flaming red hair, and feathered black wings marked them as inhabitants of a world other than Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two beings were currently tormenting Maddie to great effect. Her hands were suspended above her head by the handcuffs I had put on her earlier as the two Demonesses took full advantage of this fact. They each had a long, stiff feather in their hands, and were using the plumes to tickle Maddie's breasts. Maddie screamed with laughter from each touch her breasts received from the feathers, her two tormentors taking great delight in teasing the globes and going after her nipples in particular, flicking the very tips of the feathers against her nipples. As I watched, I couldn't help but notice that the attention seemed to be making her nipples hard indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's face was flushed and contorted with her laughter. She couldn't even speak through her ticklish squeals and her legs kicked impotently in mid-air. Her half naked body was bright red and I was wondering just how long she'd been getting tickled on her breasts like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"A most enjoyable mortal to play with,\"</b></i> a voice from behind me said. I twisted around to see a swirling blackness, like a whirlpool made of shadows surrounding a light which shone like a star deep in its centre. <i><b>\"For too long have I been denied a sacrifice. Too long have I dwelt in this realm without a new soul to be mine. But that shall soon change.\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're T'Calu?\" I asked, my voice barely more than a terrified squeak at seeing this manifestation of a Goddess before me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Indeed I am, mortal. And your companion is the first of what will be my many slaves now that the time has come for me to resume my place as Bringer of Laughing Torment and Delight.\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Let her go!\" I called out with a great deal more nerve than I felt. \"She's done nothing to you, so let her go now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn amused chuckle came from the swirling shadows, her deep, feminine voice making me shiver as she spoke not unlike someone would observing an interesting bug. <i><b>\"You make such demands of me mortal? Ah, such foolishness will have to be curbed. But... it has been so long sinceI have seen such defiance, and I would loathe to see it be crushed so soon. I shall give you the opportunity to save your friend, but on my terms.\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What terms?\" I asked, not liking where this was going at all.<br>\r\n<i><b><br>\r\n\"You have two choices on how to proceed. One is that your dear friend here remains in her position, enduring this torment from my minions, while you travel and explore my realm. Across it are several tasks and challenges that you must complete to ever hope to return to Earth. Should you fail too many times, both of you will remain here as my first sacrifices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your second choice is that you take this girl's place and suffer my deepest and darkest torments, but your friend will be returned to your world. From that side she is free to devise a plan to save you, which I honestly think is more likely than you succeeding my challenges. The choice is yours: stay and accept the tasks, or take her place and hope she can resue you.\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused in thought as I considered this, Maddie's frantic laughter still echoing around me. Maddie would probably have a better chance to rescue me from Earth if I took her place. But how could I be sure she'd even remember this as anything but a dream? If I stayed here, I could fight and maybe find a way to rescue her without relying on these games of T'Calu's. Then again, Maddie would have to notice when I was missing sometime and as smart as she was she'd probably devise some way of saving me. After a few moments, I made up my mind to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her family was enjoying a week away while Sharon looked after the house, which supposedly included cleaning the place up. Walking up to the door and knocking on it, I heard a series of crashes and bangs that hinted that Sharon had been somewhat lax in her duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened up to show Sharon beaming at me. Her full name was Sharon Rani, her father was from India before moving to town with her mother to live. She inherited some characteristics from her father, rich brown skin with black hair  but hers was long and was tied back in a ponytail that fell down to her back. Sharon had a wide smile and dark eyes that tended to dart from place to place to see what could grab her attention. Truth be told, while accomplished with a lot of things, she could be a complete ditz at times and tended to leave important things right up until the very last minute. But she was always happy to help and a cheerful person so I really couldn't help but like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're here!\" She said before motioning through the door with her hand \"Come on through, sorry about the mess.\" I stepped through the doorway and raised my eyebrows at the sight before me. Somehow, Sharon had managed to turn the place upside down in the two days since her parents had gone out. The floor was a mess of books, clothes and sporting equipment littered about in a chaotic manner. I then remembered this was just the living room and shuddered to think what the rest of the house was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to question Sharon over this when I saw she wasn't dressed in an outfit for cleaning. While I was in battered shorts and a shirt, Sharon was dressed in an outfit for exercise, running shorts and a bright yellow tank top. I slowly realised that cleaning wasn't exactly on Sharon's mind right now \"Forgetting the reason I came round here?\" I asked, indicating her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that can wait a while.\" Sharon said, waving her hand towards the piles \"I was in the mood for going out running this morning, getting a few miles. I was hoping you'd join me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a sigh at Sharon's lack of focus and my eye caught the one bit of cleaning equipment I could see in the mess around us. Not answering Sharon for the moment, I walked over and picked it up by the handle to reveal a feather duster decorated with bright pink feathers. Turning around and smiling evilly at Sharon, I asked \"What are we going to do this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon flinched at the sight of the feather duster and with good reason, she was easily one of the most ticklish people I knew. She had even started wearing thick socks during her martial arts lessons simply because too many people had tickled her feet during fights for an unfair advantage or to even get her to submit. Sharon held out her hands in front of her in a weak protest \"C'mon, I promise we'll clean up after we've had our run. It won't take long, honest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping the soft feathers against the palm of my hand, I considered Sharon's words before deciding to...</span></div></div>",

Then when we come back you'll feel too tired to do anything and we'd have wasted a whole day,\" I said ticking the things off with my fingers. \"I remember doing this last summer, Sharon...\" I said, as I pulled off her Nike trainers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, hey now. Let's talk about this! I'll be good!\" Sharon said, already giggling. Oh, she was so going to get it, I decided. I admit to doing this for the dual-purpose of not only persuading her to stop wasting time, but because she was so much fun to tickle. I was in her martial arts class, and I had always looked forward to squaring off against her because forcing a surrender via tickling was by far my favorite move in class. In fact, due to my constant use of it against the female members of the class, some of the girls had even began fighting fire with fire and using the same moves on me! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just going to give you a little... motivation to start cleaning up after yourself more,\" I said as I tugged off her black ankle socks, exposing her pretty bare feet. \"You should be thanking me! I'm such a good friend for doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the emphasis on 'this', I began dragging just one finger along her left foot and her toes were already she was already fidgeting. I had tried to sound serious but I couldn't help myself from smiling as her toes curled in the cutest way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon could probably hear that in my voice as she just giggled as she flexed her feet defensively.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love it, really,\" I teased as I lightly wiggled my index finger up and down the middle of my friend's sole. \"And don't worry, this is just the warm-up. If you don't use a feather duster for dusting, then the only thing it's good for is tickling the feet of a very ticklish girl, don't you agree?\" I said asked I continued lightly scratches down her friend's helpless feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nohohoho!\" Sharon said, giggling frantically as she tried to squirm free as I continue lightly teasing all her sensitive feet. They curled, wiggled and twitched as they tried to escape. Sometimes she would hide her mouth behind her hands, as if she was embarrassed by how I making her squeak and squeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Comehohohonm, stop teasing me so hahahahahaha much!\u201d Sharon said, chuckling uncontrollably. \"Weheheh, have work to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found that hilarious. So now Queen procrastinator wants to work? But I wasn't going to let her off this easily. Not when I had her lovely brown feet at my mercy. I reached out and plucked the pink feather duster from the table I had put down on earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Sharon. We do have work to do. In fact, I think I'll start with dusting your feet right here,\" I said, brandishing the feather duster as I gave her a few seconds to reply before diving in..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon was still giggling when she twisted her torso and craned her neck so she saw the bright pink feather duster in my hands hovering dangerously over her trapped feet. \"Uh, my feet are clean. Really. No need to dust them. Let's get to work!\" She said unconvincingly, curling her toes defensively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pretender to seriously ponder her offer, all the while I slowly drug a finger up and down her foot. It was adorable seeing her trying to keep her giggles in. After a few moments of this I decided keeping her in suspense was too cruel. \"Nah, more dust collects than you realize. We gotta get it off,\" I grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon shook her head, still giggling, and said 'crap' in flirty way which I took as my cue to begin. I twirled and spun the small feather duster in my hand so the bristles tantalized all over her feet. I feathered the tops and the bottoms of both feet, sometime she would try to cover up one foot with another but I would just grab each foot and spend time dusting it individually. After a while she would try kicking my arm with her free foot, but whenever she did that I would loudly say to her \"Oh, if you insist. I'll dust that foot now,\" and I'd grab that foot and dust it vigorously all the while Sharon was screaming at me saying that wasn't what she meant.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nAfter a while of this she began clenched my hands into fists and thumped them on the couch, loud boyish laughter still flowing from her mouth. I was having so much fun feathering her feet that I hadn't noticed the time. I had been tickling her feet for almost twenty minutes and we did have a house to clean...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

OK! We'll get to work!\" She answered \"Just no more tickling!\" Although the way she wriggled her toes made me think that she was trying to provoke me into more ticklish attacks. Part of the reason why our martial arts instructor allowed the tickling to continue as a technique was the fact that Sharon enjoyed it so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResisting the urge to carry on, I got off Sharon and stepped off the couch, placing the feather duster in my pocket as I waited for Sharon to get up \"Alright then, how shall we start?\" I asked, eager to get this done and finished so I'd have more opportunities to tickle Sharon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting off the couch, Sharon looked around her and gave a sigh \"From bottom to top would be best.\" She answered \"Let's do this floor and then the bedrooms and we should get everything sorted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you mess things up again.\" I retorted before looking around the place \"How on Earth did you manage to make such a mess anyway?\" I asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon simply gave a giggle at that \"Oh you know... Things just build up.\" She answered before starting things off by walking over to a nearby pile of magazines and picking them up \"Let's get rid of the clutter first and then clean underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as good a plan as any and we were soon at it, tidying up the huge mess Sharon had created and then cleaning everything underneath. As ever, once Sharon got beyond her ditzy nature and tendency to procrastinate, she was a hard worker and I was surprised at the progress we were making. Barely an hour had gone past when we were finished on the ground floor and moving up to the next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough one thing I noticed as that Sharon hadn't put her shoes back on and instead went around completely barefoot. Every time she kneeled down, she seemed to do it in such a way that her long feet were pointed directly at me, her shapely toes wiggling as if teasing me. I sometimes struggled to ignore that and what made it worse was that whenever Sharon reached up to clean something just above her head, I could swear she was making her tank top ride up on purpose so that her well toned belly and navel were exposed. It was large and deep and from experience, I knew it was deathly ticklish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time I turned away after seeing Sharon's feet or belly, I swore I could hear her titter and I knew she was doing it on purpose as some revenge on having turned down her plans for a fun day. I smiled to myself as I walked upstairs, knowing I was going to give it to her good and proper once we were finished. We separated as we got upstairs as I vacuumed the hallway and Sharon cleaned up her parent's bedroom. I finished that job and switched the vacuum off just in time to hear a horrified gasp come from Sharon in her parent's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what had happened, I rushed into the room to find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as I rushed into the room, I was greeted with the comical sight of Sharon perched on the bed, having jumped up there once she had seen the thing that had terrified her so. Following her gaze, I gave a smirk as I saw the remarkably large bee that was hitting itself against the window and trying to get out of the room. Walking over to the window, I got out the feather duster and guided the bee to where the window was opening, the little creature flying away with a merry buzz as it left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon visibly sagged with relief as the bee was sent from the room and she hopped off the bed and gave me a hug fit for a hero. \"Thank you so much!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist, I used one hand to pick Sharon's tank top up, exposing her belly, and with my other I tickled her sides gently using the feather duster, brushing the soft plumes lightly against the soft skin of her midriff. Sharon squeaked and began to giggle in a melodically but didn't give up the hug, instead moving her body back slightly to allow greater access to her belly for the feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResisting the open invitation was incredibly difficult, but I stopped the tickling and Sharon looked at me in a disappointed way, pouting adorably. \"We still have work to do, remember?\" I asked, bopping her on the nose with the duster. \"Don't worry, I'll tickle you when we're finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright,\" Sharon sighed as she picked up the rag and polish she'd been using. \"We really do need to clean up the mess around here after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that you made,\" I responded before putting the feather duster back in my pocket and getting back to work as Sharon stuck her tongue out at me. Thinking about just how I'd get back at her later on, I got to work cleaning the rest of the house as Sharon did her part. Soon, surprisingly, everything was done and in order. I put the vacuum back and sat down in the living room with a sigh of relief. I looked at the clock and was surprised to see that it was only just midday. We must have been working hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts were interrupted by none other than Sharon who came in from the kitchen and handed me a glass of fruit juice and a plate of sandwiches. \"A small reward for your help,\" she explained with a grateful smile. \"I really couldn't have done it this fast without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't have done it at all without me,\" I answered before tucking into the food and drink, enjoying the recharge immensely. I felt the feather duster poke in my pocket and grinned as I finished the food. \"That reminds me,\" I said, \"weren't we going to do something after we finished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon stared at me blankly for a moment before her eyes lit up. \"Of course! We were going for a run! Thanks for reminding me!\" she said before rushing upstairs to get changed into some running clothes. Like I said, a complete ditz at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt the feather duster in my hand and wondered whether to get her the moment she came downstairs or go on the run with her. It was a nice day out after all. Soon, I heard Sharon make her way downstairs and resolved to...</span></div></div>",

When she went to look in the living room, I quickly and quietly moved right behind her to catch her off guard. As soon as she turned around and I saw the startled look on her face, my hands dove toward her ribs and half tickled half pushed her onto the couch. The result being that she was too busy giggling to stop me from climbing on top of her and pinning her down. I gave her a minute to stop laughing and respond to what I just did.<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe...I sup- hehehe..I suppose this means we're not going on a run?\" She said as she grinned up at me.<br>\r\n\"Well I was just thinking about how I helped clean up this humongous mess you made of your house, and all I get was a glass of juice and a few sandwiches? I think I deserve a better reward than that don't you think?\"<br>\r\n\"Ummm, I don't suppose another glass of juice is enough of a reward?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"Well then.

A little exercise was nice and knowing how caught up we could get into the tickling, we'd probably just create yet another mess that needed cleaning up afterwards. I got to my feet as Sharon came down the stairs, dressed in a bright red tank top and black shorts with some running trainers on, ready to go \"Alright, something easy for today. Four mile jog around the town, the usual route. Ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded quietly, knowing that I'd need to save any bit of breath I could for this. I wasn't out of shape or anything but I didn't exactly exercise too so a four mile jog was going to be a bit rough. We stepped out of the house and Sharon led the stretches, her lean body getting my attention as she went one way, then the other as her arms and legs stretched to prevent pulling anything as we ran. When we were done, Sharon turned back to me with a bright smile and nodded \"Well, time to go!\" She said and then started off with a manageable jogging pace, myself quickly following her straight after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later and I was beginning to wish I'd just tickled Sharon from the start. We were roughly two and a half miles into the jog and I had long since run short of breath. I felt sweat across my brow and plastering my shirt to my body as the Sun beat down on us. I had a scowl of concentration locked on my face as I was determined not to stop because if I did, I doubted I could start again. Just ahead of me was Sharon who didn't seem any the worse for wear. In fact, she looked back to me as she jogged and stuck her tongue out \"C'mon you big baby!\" She called out \"It's not that hard! Maybe I should give you some incentive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she lifted up her tank top slightly to expose her midriff and although I couldn't see her belly, I saw Sharon bring a hand down to trace a finger around the edges \"Want to tickle here? You gotta last until the end!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy scowl got even larger at the little tease although it was in good humour. I knew I was going to get her good and proper when all this was done. Sharon was so caught up in encouraging me though that she wasn't looking ahead and so...</span></div></div>",

Because of my breathlessness however, my warning\u00a0failed to reach her ears and I watched as Sharon jogged right into a dark-skinned woman. They collided, both falling to the ground painfully.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman Sharon had inadvertently body slammed looked rather peculiar. Her skin was relatively dark, she had long black hair, worn loose, and plenty of jewelry. I estimated there to be about three dozen different shiny bracelets, rings and necklaces all strewn across her body. Her attire was rather exotic as well, a long skirt with a slit on the side reaching all the way to her hip, a sleeved belly shirt that showed several inches of skin, and no footwear. She was probably some kind of gypsy woman, I reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch...\" Sharon groaned as she rubbed her head. \"Sorry, miss, are you okay?\" she apologized. Not answering, the woman merely clutched at her chest. After a few moments of awkward silence, where I helped Sharon get back to her feet, I noticed the strange woman scream. I looked over at her, concerned that she had been hurt in the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright? Need us to call an ambulance?\" I asked, offering an outstretched hand to help the gypsy woman to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you careless idiots, what have you done?\" the woman shouted, ignoring me as she continued to clutch her chest. I turned to get a better look, wondering if she might be having a heart attack, when I realized she wasn't clutching her chest but rather a silver amulet the size of a tennis ball, which seemed to be... leaking. A strange green and black fluid was trickling from the amulet and dripping through the gypsy woman's fingers, pouring onto the ground. Then, without warning, the strange amulet exploded violently, splattering me and Sharon with the strange substance.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly repulsed, I spat some of the disgusting fluid out of my mouth. I had made the mistake of trying to talk just before the amulet went boom. \"Okay, what the hell?\" I coughed.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what just happened?\" Sharon said, wiping her eyes. As I looked around at the subsequent mess, I noticed that the gypsy woman and her bizarre trinket were nowhere in sight. She must've have been covered in the weird black muck as well, which was proven true when I noticed a set of footprints leading down the road. However, I was in no mood to chase her after all that running. Besides, the gypsy had probably gone to shower and change, an idea I considered very appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your guess is as good as mine. I kinda want to get cleaned up though. Maybe we should finish this run tomorrow,\" I suggested, as I tried to flick some of the grime from my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good idea. Who on Earth was that woman? And what was that weird exploding amulet?\" Sharon asked curiously, as she peered left and right to see where the gypsy woman had gone to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can discuss this on the way back,\" I insisted, steering Sharon in the direction that took us back home. Sharon was always curious, a quality I liked about her, but her priorities were a little out of order. The need to investigate some imaginary mystery should have been trumped by the fact that we were covered in crap.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine. Aren't you the least bit curious though?\" Sharon asked as we began to jog back. Thankfully, Sharon had insisted we bring sweat towels, so we managed to wipe off most of the grease-like fluid to the point that we didn't look like we had just jumped in a barrel of oil.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm more interested in this great stench we've acquired,\" I said pointedly, making Sharon giggle. The weird ink smelled like bizarre mixture of garlic and smoke, afterwards mixing in a bucket of horse droppings for kicks. \"It's weird, but I have a really bad feeling about this,\" I said, jogging alongside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What d'ya mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't the first time something crazy has happened. I'm beginning to think there's something out there, or maybe a group of somethings, who like putting me in these weird situations. I mean, you can attest to a lot of crazy stuff. Stuff like the giant octopus that paid us a visit while we were at the beach, remember that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee, yeah. I liked him, he was rather gentle with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was, wasn't he? Anyway, just saying, strange things happen to me and people around me,\" I shrugged, a gesture that is significantly less effective when jogging next to someone. \"And this whole thing screams 'strange' to me. I'm honestly half-expecting us to have unleashed some kind of slime monster just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, that only happened like once,\" Sharon said dismissively. \"You worry too much. Tell you what, it's getting late, let's just head back and catch some Z's. We'll go running tomorrow morning, okay? We'll be fine, nothing will happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, you're tempting fate. Pushing it is never a good thing. But fine, I'm wiped out from you working me like a slave today anyway,\" I laughed, sticking my tongue out at her as we stopped right outside her house. We agreed to meet here early tomorrow morning, and I trudged back to my place, wondering how I was going to explain why I smelled like a compost heap.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My excuse was pretty lame. I told my parents I'd slipped into a mud patch even though it was pretty obvious that it wasn't mud I was covered in. They didn't press however, so after\u00c2\u00a0showering I made a beeline for my room. Cleaning Sharon's house and the following jog drained my energy, so I simply undressed, slipped on some pajama shorts, and collapsed on my bed. I think I was asleep before my head hit the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the strangest things about sleeping is how you never really know at which point you've drifted off. Even more frustrating is if you actually stop and think about it, the only thing you'll achieve is restlessness and you toss and turn for another hour before you find a comfortable position. Likewise, you never really know when a dream starts. One minute I was curled up in my bed, and the next I was standing in the middle of the road, soaked in black gunk\u00c2\u00a0again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Of all the things that happened that I could've dreamt about, it had to be this?\" I grumbled. Looked around, I realized that this was the same road where Sharon ran into the strange gypsy woman. I scanned the area, and it seemed that none other than Sharon herself was making an appearance in this dream, covered in the same black filth I was.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Sharon. That's weird, girls in my dreams don't usually wear so many clothes,\" I said, saying the first thing that came to my mind. Hey, I was in a dream, not like she was going to judge me for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say, neither do boys in my dreams,\" the dream-Sharon shrugged. \"So, should I be tickling you, or should you be tickling me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that the idea wasn't enticing, but it was still rather sudden and I couldn't help but say reflexively. \"Come again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in these kind of dreams usually it's one or the other, isn't it?\" Dream-Sharon shrugged before pouncing on me. She grabbed and my sides and quickly tickled me to the ground. Just like the real thing, dream-Sharon was stronger than she looked, and annoyingly enough she managed to pin me down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried squirming free, but she just giggled, ignoring my attempts to escape and began spidering her fingers up and down my ribs, drawing fast, frenzied giggles from me. Annoyingly enough, I was also wearing the same thin t-shirt I was from our jog, which provided little protection. Trying to knock her off didn't work either, because even in a dream, I wasn't going to punch a girl... besides, being tickled by an Indian cutie wasn't exactly a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon proceeded to go to town on my ribs and sides, grabbing and poking them aggressively. It was a far more muscle-stimulating tickle that left me breathless with laughter, and with one of my instinctive struggles I accidentally knocked her over onto her back. Seizing the opportunity, I smiled and straddled her mid-section.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it\u2019s my turn!\" I grinned, as I wiggled my fingers and dug into her flat stomach.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeaked with laughter as I made contact and tried squirming away, but no matter where she twisted and turned my fingers were there, waiting to greet her skin. My fingers followed her toned belly with laser-like precision, poking and prodding. After a while, she stopped struggling and just took the tickling. At her surrender, I began blowing a few raspberries, mixed in with a few ticklish licks. After inadvertently licking a bit of black sludge, I went back to more standard tickling, which dream-Sharon enjoyed so much she lifted her arms up to allow me better access to her underarms. I chuckled, stroking my fingers up and down her sides before going up to harass her underarms and trailing back down to her taut belly.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was having so much fun that tormenting my very ticklish friend to hysterics that I was totally surprised when I felt a finger tap on my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I turned, I was met by two policemen who I vaguely recognized as being local, their uniforms bleached of almost all color. This was new.\u00a0I wasn't how I was meant to respond to their sudden appearance. Sure I was tickling the living daylights out of my friend, but that wasn't illegal, was it? As I was wondering how to greet them, I felt a pair of hands grab my wrists and pull them behind my back. I was about to protest when I saw the man's emotionless and unblinking stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, officer, what'd I do wrong?\" I asked. I'd definitely never been arrested in a dream before. Not in real life either actually. And now that the fun part of the dream was over, I was kinda hoping it would end soon. They pushed me into the back of their police cruiser, dream-Sharon right behind me, her hands also cuffed behind her back. The officers still remained silent even as they got in the front and we took off for the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I glanced outside the window, I noticed that the dreamworld seemed different from reality. Everything seemed a lot darker, like there wasn't enough light. When the car drove past the local Kitchy Karnival, I noticed how all the loud colors seemed to have been drained from the decorum. I felt like I was in a black and white movie, or maybe a film noir. While I was imagining how I would look in a fedora, I heard a yelp. I glanced over and saw that dream-Sharon was pinching herself. Taking up the idea, I mimicked her. All I accomplished was a smarting sting on my arm. \"That's really weird... okay, why am I stuck in the shadow realm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shadow realm? Ugh, even in my dreams you're such a geek...\" Dream-Sharon said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gaped at her. Her dream? Before I could say anything however, the car jolted to a stop and the two blank-faced police officers pulled us out. As we were moved along, I took a look at the police station and had a good idea of what they were going to with us once we were inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo celebrate their fiftieth year-anniversary, the officers had recently put in a set of ornamental ceremonial stockades to celebrate their years of service and dedication to punish crime. Of course, I had a sneaking suspicion they were perfectly functional. This suspicion was confirmed as the two cops who had escorted Sharon and me pushed us to the stocks and strapped the two of us in. They uncuffed us just to retie our arms above our heads, leaving our armpits exposed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around at the station. On top of the messed up color scheme and the blank stares everyone was giving us, not a single officer there seemed to be working. Usually people were answering the phone, writing reports, pushing someone into the jail every once in a while, basically doing things that you would expect cops to do. Instead they just slowly gathered around the two of us, watching and waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, boy...\" Sharon gulped as she saw two officers take a seat by her feet, stripping her shoes and socks off, while two more took position at her sides.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again...\" I said as I was quadruple-teamed in a similar fashion four policewomen. They ignored my feet and legs, choosing rather to congregate around my upper-body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, can we talk about this?\" I asked, hoping against hope that these people could be reasoned with. I looked at the curiously blank-faced officers and realized...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no build-up, no teasing, no anticipation. They dove straight in, as if they wanted to hear us both screaming with laughter as soon as possible. And they certainly succeeded.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock was like being by a violent bolt of lightning, or maybe being tackled by a two hundred dude. Suddenly all eight hands pounced at once, this one surprise attack dissolving all my defenses.\u00a0There were two hands constantly rummaging into my underarms, but my mid-section was where the torment was worst at, being tormented by no less than three possessed policewomen.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn each side, one was pinching each of my ribs with one hand and teasing the area in-between them with the other. Combined they kept me constantly bouncing squirming from left-to-right, but it was useless, if I leaned left, I would be leaning further into one set of nails, if I leaned right, the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last policewomen seemed to have claimed my stomach and I soon became painfully aware that she had come prepared. It seemed she had come from the canteen, as she was wielding a pair of plastic forks, like a hungry customer at a restaurant, and using them to great effect. At first she explored my store torso with them, scratching around my sides and lower ribs and hips, then seemed to notice that my belly was particular sensible to this new weapon and began to focus on that area, ignoring my hysterical begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had been tickled before (on a shockingly high number of occasions) but this was probably the first time there was no teasing, no anticipation, no taunting. Just bam, laughter. Though I began to find it hard to think too much when the person at my underarms switched from deep rummaging to gentle scribbling. Even policewomen seemed to have fairly long nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow finding enough concentration to glance to my left, I clearly recognized Sharon's boyish laughter only slightly muffled by my own. Based on her frantic squeals, she was having a rough time too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne officer was squeezing both her thighs at the same time, earning squeaks and squeals for his trouble. She actually started to lean forward in the stocks as she laughed. He mercilessly squeezed the inside of her thighs for several more moments before using both her hand to tickle the back of her kneecaps. I saw her squirm even more when he started to do this, it tickled in a way that made her want to escape rather than laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother caught Sharon's attention again when he began to tickle her ribs at the same time as her armpits, squeezing along the ribcage and earning squeals and gasps from the young girl. He then began to dig his nails into the soft skin and ran them up and down the lower part of her ribs. While he was doing this, he never stopped tickling her armpits. He tickled the center of them even harder, causing her to lean from one side to another in a vain attempt to escape the torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final two officers down by her feet seemed to be desk jockeys, both brandishing ballpoint pens and stroking them up and down Sharon's brown feet, drawing squiggles, shapes, and figure eights. Sharon's feet were flexing and grasping so responsively to the sharp touch that despite the stocks they had to use one hand to keep her feet still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the policewomen tormenting me intensified the tickling, suddenly all four of them digging into my underarms, eight hands, eighty fingers, forty fingers swirling and scatching over each of my ticklish underarms was too much, and I blacked out to the sound of my own laughter...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I looked around and saw that was back in my good old room. I laid back on my bed and stared at the ceiling. It had all been just some weird dream... wait, didn't I have something I was meant to do? I checked my watched, cursed and realized I was late for my scheduled morning jog with Sharon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, I was changed, wearing trainers and at Sharon's doorstep, having wolfed down a quick breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rung the doorbell and a noticed a groggy Sharon answer the door, still in her pajamas. After sneakily glancing at how much skin her thin pajamas exposed, I decided to wait for her to get ready first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we got ready to begin jogging, I casually asked her, not wanting to sound insane. \"So... sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at me with wide eyes. \"You are a weirdness magnet, aren't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that depends if you had a weird dream last night or not,\" I shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I definitely did,\" she said quickly, as she pulled my arm. \"Maybe we can jog later. How about instead we talk about how we've been cursed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat down in front of Sharon's couch discussing plans.To my surprise she seemed utterly convinced about it already, which was rather surprising. usually people in our situations in books and movies were in denial but I guess we were just a bit more savvy than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that was you in my dream last night? Every word was you?\" I said, looking questioningly at her, starting to remember some of the stranger things she had said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon held my stare, flushing slightly. \"Yeah, that was me. And what do you mean your dream? It was, uh, our dream, yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine, fine, but we need a plan,\" I said stroking my chin. \"We should try finding that gypsy again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but where? I mean should we try looking for her here, or in the uh, 'shadow realm' as you called it?\" Sharon grinned teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are never going to let me live that down, are you?\" I laughed, reaching out and poking Sharon in the sides, making her squeak. \"And let's please not call it that. Anything but that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" Sharon giggled. \"So what's the plan going to be?\"</span></div></div>",

Or whoever she was can send us to that place, she might be found there.\" I said thoughtfully \"Well sleep tonight and try to track her down, maybe someone in the realm can point us in her direction or at least help us find a clue as to what that place us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon nodded along with me before sighing \"Another night of being tickled in my dreams.\" She said before giving a smile \"Same as any other night really.\" She chuckled. I smiled back a the joke and we resolved on meeting up in the dreamworld that night to find a solution to the problem. We exercised together for a bit so that sleep would come easier to us that night before I headed home and went to bed early, eager to find a solution to the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time of tossing and turning, I eventually fell to sleep, my dream starting as soon as I drifted off. The first thing I noticed as that the area around me was darker than before. While before the background had appeared to be simply monochrome at times, there was a subtle difference as the darkness was that much starker and the sky above me was hazy, it being impossible to make out whether it was night or day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brought my eyes down to earth and saw that I was in a very different spot from last time and not as well dressed. I was in a pair of grey swimming shorts and in someone's backyard that had a large pool. I wondered briefly the meaning of this when sound finally reached my ears, that of someone screaming with laughter. I twisted around and saw the source, Sharon in a grey bikini having been tied down to a sunbed via her wrists on the rests and ankles to the chair itself. Around her stood three girls, one strawberry blonde, one with black hair and a red head I recognised as being Alicia, Mary and Kimberly respectively, three local rich snobs and bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey too were clad in bikinis although they were all black ones which contrasted with the paleness of their skin. They all stood around Sharon and each had a feather in their hands. The plumes were huge, the size of a forearm and incredibly fluffy looking. They were also the only bit of colour in this place as they were blood red, a stark contrast to the black and grey surroundings. I shivered just from looking at those feathers as silly as it sounds, I got a feeling of real evil come from them as their standing out only added to the weird feel of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat wasn't helping was Sharon who was positively screaming with laughter. I'd gotten her fairly well from when I first met her but I'd never gotten a reaction like that, no matter how much I tickled. Dream-Alicia was swirling her feather around Sharon's bare belly, the toned abs being constantly assaulted as the whole length of the feather went around and around her belly, constantly skimming over Sharon's navel. Dream-Mary used her feather on Sharon's feet, brushing up and down on each sole, not seeming to care that Sharon was curling her toes or trying to cover one foot with the other. But then again, the way in which the feather managed to brush up all of Sharon's foot at once negated these defences anyway. The final feather, wielded by dream-Kimberly, seemed to be the worst of them all. The third scarlet feather was being brushed up and down Sharon's thighs and teased the front of her bikini bottom, the thin material looking as if it offered no protection whatsoever as the plume brushed across and tickled Sharon's most sensitive area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three way assault seemed to be driving Sharon out of her mind as she thrashed her head from side to side as the tickling went on, her face contorted with laughter as she tried to escape from the tickling but to no avail. What we had gone through the previous night had just been a taster, I realised. Now this curse was kicking in fully. I watched as Sharon continued to scream with forced laughter from the feathers, unable to get a word through her shrieks as I remembered our original plan and decided that if these dream-people are distracted by Sharon, I could probably try and find the witch. But it didn't sit well with me just leaving Sharon to be tormented for hours until she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, I decided too...</span></div></div>",

She managed to stop herself just in time though, her foots scraping against the pavement as she stopped short right on the edge of it. The car also screeched to a halt and I let out a large sigh of relief at seeing Sharon unharmed. I quickly rushed over to her, my own exhaustion temporarily forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK?\" I asked, checking for any damage over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No... I'm OK.\" She answered although I could see she was shaking a little. I put an arm around Sharon's shoulders and hugged her tight as a way to comfort her. She let out a little sigh and put her head on my shoulder, eager for the support she was getting. I looked over to the car that had stopped right in front of it and noticed it was a police car. Normally this wouldn't have been a problem but the driver's door opened and out popped Officer Lane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer 'Give me ten bucks and I just might look the other way' Lane, the most notoriously corrupt police officer in town. It was unknown how exactly she kept her job but it was thought she had something on the Mayor. She was a bully who loved to throw her weight and authority around to get herself ahead in money or would take you down to the station if you failed to comply. She was a tall woman of Amazonian proportions, legs and arms with large muscles that showed her work out regime was one of her few virtues. She had deep ebony skin and dark hair that was cut around the bottom of her ears. She had an attractive face but was marred by gleaming eyes that always showed her contempt for others when she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt seeing us, Lane broke out into a smirk \"Well well,\" She said \"Jaywalking and endangering lives, that's two serious counts right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around the street but saw that no one was there to help us go against what Lane was saying. I scowled at her as she smirked at the both of us \"We didn't do anything wrong! It was an accident!\" I protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Verbal assault on an officer of the law, another major charge.\" Lane said, obviously enjoying herself through all this \"Now then, do you have anything to say that might make me decide to overlook your crimes for the time being?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon and me glared at her, we had no money on us and had nothing to offer her whatsoever \"Just leave us alone!\" Sharon shouted \"You know we didn't do anything wrong so stop picking on us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrave words, but not exactly smart ones as Officer Lane simply walked up to us, showing surprising speed for a woman her size as she reached out and grabbed onto each of our arms \"That sounds like resisting arrest to me too.\" She said before pulling out some handcuffs and cuffing Sharon's hands behind her back before doing the same to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were then shoved roughly into the back of the police car before the doors were locked after Lane got in \"Now let's take a ride and I'm sure you two will come to regret your law breaking.\" She leered before starting the car and driving us to...</span></div></div>",

She was all smiles herself as she drove through the streets of town, telling us on how we should learn to mend ways and use this as a reminder that we should always give proper respect to the police from now on. Such hypocrisy made me and Sharon scowl throughout the car ride, wanting more than anything else to find some way to get Lane to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing our less than enthusiastic take on her story, Lane stopped talking and pulled into a spot just outside the police station. We were right beside a large tree and shielded from prying eyes as Lane got out of the car and walked towards the rear, getting in next to Sharon as she shut the door behind her with an almighty slam. Needless to say, it was cramped between the three of us, in no small part due to Sharon squashing herself against me as she tried to escape out of the reach of Officer Lane but having the effect of only pressing me against the opposite door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what's all this sulking about?\" Lane asked with a smarmy grin \"While I know getting caught during your crimes isn't the best of experiences, you two should smile a little! I'm going to show you a better way of living that shows you the advantages of obeying the law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't do anything!\" Sharon shouted out, a little unwisely in my opinion \"And we're not going to smile for you and the way you try to push people around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLane glowered down at Sharon from her position beside us and it hit us just how vulnerable we were with her hulking over us and our hands cuffed behind out backs. Without warning, Lane's hands shot down and grabbed onto Sharon's thighs, pulling the girl up off balance as her head landed in my lap and Lane held her legs up with one arm. With her free hand, she started tickling the backs of Sharon's legs, her long nails scampering over the area where her thighs met her butt and all around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOHOODOHOHONNN'TTAHAAAA!!!\" Sharon cried out in shock as the fingers tickled the sensitive skin, the running shorts offering little, if any, protection whatsoever from the ticklish assault. Sharon's head twisted from side to side while on my legs, her face contorted into one of forced laughter as the fingers did their work. Lane was slow and meticulous in her tickling, her fingers probing first the legs, and then Sharon's butt as she wriggled her nails into the soft skin. Lane showed no mercy at all as she continued to tickle Sharon's body, her fingers wriggling against the sensitive area and had a look of savage enjoyment on her face that it honestly scared me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough having Sharon twist and turn as she laughed from being tickled so close to my groin wasn't exactly a bad feeling, I couldn't let her punishment go on. As Lane made Sharon cry out even more as she delivered a series of ticklish pinches over her buttocks, I cried out \"OK! OK! We'll do whatever you say! We're sorry for breaking the law! Just stop already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Lane stopped the tickling at that and gave a sickly smile \"Good to see you're learning sense.\" She said before opening the door behind her \"But I think a day in the cells would really help set you two straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the car, Lane ordered us to follow her, Sharon having to re-balance herself before she could, looking completely humiliated at her ordeal. She kept quiet this time though, knowing it'd be best for her and we walked in silence as Officer Lane...</span></div></div>",

I looked to Sharon, who still looked humiliated, with strands of black hair sticking to her mocha skin. I wished I could have comforted her, but with my hands cuffed behind my back, there was little I could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, we reached the basement of the station. There were many empty holding cells, but a few had occupants... teenagers like ourselves, looking frightened and exhausted. Perhaps these were other victims of our Amazonian warden? We didn't have the chance to ask, as Sharon and I were roughly pushed into a fresh cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" cooed Officer Lane, hands on hips, smug expression on her face. \"We need to make sure you criminals are clean. We don't want any lice or fleas to contaminate the prison population.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon and I exchanged curious looks. I wasn't sure if it was intended to be an insult or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have bugs on us...\" Sharon muttered with a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Lane took off her police cap and shook her head. She was certainly beautiful... which just emphasized her cruelty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why should I trust a little law-breaker like yourself? Now, get undressed. I need to hose you both down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy blood ran cold at her command. \"Uh, pardon?\" I was so shocked I could barely comprehend the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step forward, and her statue-esque body towered over me. \"I'll ask one more time. Strip down to your underwear and get ready for the hose. If you don't comply, I will perform my duties as an officer and do it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped. Sharon looked just as stunned. While she was a close friend, I didn't particularly like the idea of undressing in front of her... and certainly not in a cold, dingy prison cell gawked at by a cruel captor.

Shoving us back into the cell, she then gestured for us to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I reluctantly unzipped my jeans and kicked off my shoes. I noticed Sharon doing the same, with perhaps a bit more hesitation. All the while Officer Lane hungrily eyed us both. I could almost sense her lips smacking with anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a good little pair of delinquents. If you keep it up, you might even get parole,\" our dark captress laughs. I merely glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing off my shirt quickly like a bandaid, I folded my arms in front of me. I tried to maintain my dignity, but it was difficult with only my boxers on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There,\" grumbled Sharon nearby, tossing her yellow shirt into a heap. \"Happy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stole a glance at my Indian friend, and couldn't help but smile at her body. Dark and elegant, her skin was smooth and flawless... and a nice contrast to her lacy yellow bra and matching panties. She didn't strike me as the type to wear such fancy underwear, but I suppose everyone had their secrets exposed now. I noticed Sharon smirk back at me, and she motioned her head down. I looked down to see I had chosen my bumblebee boxers this morning. Flushing red, I smiled as much as dared... as awkward as the situation was, Sharon certainly knew how to provoke my sense of humor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done,\" laughed Lane, and I suspected her laugh was more sinister than she let on. She reached behind her back and revealed a bottle of liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing it towards me, I caught it with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the delousing solution,\" Lane explained, leering at Sharon and myself. \"I want you both greased up with that stuff before I get the hose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Sharon, and she shrugged. There were worse things than having to rub down a half-naked girl... unfortunately, those things might be just around the corner...</span></div></div>",

I looked over at my scantily clad friend.  Shanon was truly an Indian beauty and I felt a stir of emotions as I saw her rich brown skin.  To say how she looked like you could saw she looked like a sister of Shyria Saran.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Officer.\u201d  I said thinking of a plan.  I walked over to her with the delousing lotion and smiled at Shanon.  \u201cPlay along 'kay.\u201d  I said winking, she smirked and smiled.  With a squirt of the bottle I added a shine to her smooth and soft belly, she flinched as the cold solution impacted her warm skin.  I took my hand and started to spread the lotion around, her belly already felt like very soft silk but the lotion made her toned stomach almost frictionless.  Shanon immediately starting giggling and wrapped her arms around my neck and pressed her chest against my chest to keep her from doubling over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job delinquent.\u201d  Officer Lane said smiling a predatory grin.  Shanon continued to giggle as my finger enjoyed running over her belly and sides.  I wanted to also attack her bellybutton but she was going to need some of her breath for the next part.  I continued for a moment before sadly stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOfficer it would be faster if you sprayed while I rubbed ma'am.\u201d  I said to the Officer respectfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what, I like you delinquent.  Unlike your mocha friend over here you actually have respect.\u201d  She walked over and held out her hand for the delousing lotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet ready.\u201d  I whispered in Shanon's ear, she nodded in reply, her long dark hair covering her shoulders.  I waited for the Amazon to get close before aiming for her eyes; however Shanon took the bottle out of my hand unexpectedly and and squirted the bottle into the officer's eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw!  Damn it!\u201d  Lane yelled falling to her knees and clutching her eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRun!\u201d  I yelled to Shanon, taking her hand and dashing for the steps.  She kept paced and was overtaking me as we reached the top of the steps.  Officer Lane continued her yelling as she followed us up the stairs.  On the upper floor we made a break for the door, Lane was behind us, I didn't see her pull out of taser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShanon screamed in shock and the taser stuck into her side and knocked her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot you slumdog millionaire!\u201d  She said menacingly as she approached.  \u201cYour coming back to my house tonight, you thought what he just did was ticklish, just wait until your tickled from dusk till dawn by me and my sisters!\u201d  I tried to get Shanon up but she was motionless on the ground groaning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is going on here!\u201d  I looked up ans saw Commissioner Jordan come out.  He was a tall and muscular man with a no nonsense attitude.  \u201cLane!  What are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust dealing with a criminal here sir.\u201d  Lane said in a sultry voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMister Rina's daughter, he's out of town for two weeks, why is she here?\u201d  He asked looking at her,  Shanon's hair was plastered on the ground and he slick and smooth belly was rubbed onto the floor, her brown skin was covered in a sheen of cold sweat.  Commissioner Jordan looked from the panting girl on the ground to me.  \u201cAnd him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a couple of criminals I caught.  Though I must say Miss Rina that was awfully stupid assaulting an officer like that.\u201d  Lane said savagely standing over Shanon, I stepped forward to defend her but she shoved me back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know going to court is just going to end up getting you in trouble.\u201d  Jordan said rolling his eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on John.\u201d  She said in a flirtatious voice patting his chest.  \u201cLet me sentence her to a week and a half with me.\u201d  She beamed a smile at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what, let you have what is essentially a tickle slave until her parents are back?\u201d  Jordan said incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll make it up to you.\u201d  She said putting a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd him?\u201d  He asked looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh him- I don't care he can go as long as he stays out of my way.\u201d  I balled my fists in rage that this woman was trying to take away my friend's freedom, make her a slave essentially.  Yet it would be Jordan who deemed her fate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You watch as Lane lays her into the back of her patrol car and gets into the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to enjoy owning you for the next couple of weeks.\"  She muttered smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulls away you pull out your cell phone that you had gotten back and call your friend Bobby.  He was great with electronics and could track the local police.

You nodded as you spotted it.  \"Okay take this and attach it to the side of the house.\"  You look down and see a small device that looked like a usb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will allow us to get into their house, well kind of.\"  He paused.  \"It will allow us to access any camera's inside.\"  You nod as you get out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\"  You reply.  You stealthily sneak up.  Lane's patrol car is there, along with a couple of other cars.

She shivered from the ac as most of her skin was exposed.  Officer Lane had a hand firmly on her back forcing her along the carpet of the cozy looking house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my kingdom, here I rule.\"  Lane said sternly to Sharon.  \"Here you obey.\"  Sharon was obviously scared and she looked down not saying anything.  Lane took her chin and lifted it up.  \"Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon shakily nodded her head.  \"Ye- y- yes.\"  She replied.  Lane smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this.\"  A voice said. Two girls walked into the room smiling.  One looked Chinese while the other looked like a stereotypical blonde.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah sisters let me introduce you to our new- tickle slave, for the next few weeks.\"  She smiled.  \"Tickle slave, say hello to my sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sisters?\"  Sharon muttered confused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're closer to each other than most blood relatives.  When I was young I lost my family, Carol's parents saved me from the streets.\"  She said motioning to the blonde hair girl.  \"They taught me discipline, helped me in school, taught me to succeeded.  They also adopted Samantha.\"  She said pointing to the Chinese girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we stick together.\"  Carol said putting an arm around Sharon and guided her to sit on a couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is a hot one.\"  Samantha said sitting on her other side.  They both had very long and hard nails and started to lightly stroke Sharon's sides, slowly growing faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-no-PLES-hogah-noples-stahhp!!!!\"  She tries to squirm side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we get to tickle her whenever we want?\"  Carol asked as Sharon bucked and squirmed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is at our complete mercy, and we wont show her any.\"  She grinned, grabbing Sharon's shoulder's and pulled her back against the couch, now she couldn't even move side to side as she lost breath and had sweat tickle down her lovely brown skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeee-pleeee-Imsorr-ahhahahaha!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they stopped for a few minuets but Carol kept rubbing Sharon's soft and toned belly and Samantha rubbed her thighs.  Lane came around and stood in front of Sharon.  \"Listen we will refer to you by multiple names.  Slave, ticklee, delinquent, girl, maybe even Sharon or Miss Rina. You will do exactly what we tell you and obey your masters commands.  You will refer to my sisters as Mistress when you talk to them and me as Master.  Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master.\"  Sharon said submissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you get to be called master?\" Carol cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I brought her in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n\"We have to get he out.\"  You say watching the feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\"  Replied Bobby.  \"This is entertaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Sharon.\"  Carol said sweetly.  \"I'm excited to have a tickle slave to tickle whenever I want and she can't resist.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My cousin Leslie was going to be here any minute now. She was 21 and coming back from college at a school a ways north of here, and was going to stay here for a couple weeks before going back to her parents' house. My parents were both off on a vacation themselves, so we'd have the house to just the two of us. They were having a \"second honeymoon\" on a European holiday, and I was happy for them to get out and enjoy themselves. They'd both been working hard lately. And honestly, I was looking forward to getting the house without any parental supervision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think they thought that if Leslie is here with me, I'd get into less trouble. Honestly, if it were anything like old times, she'd only get me in more of it. But she'd cause less trouble goofing off with me than getting into fights with her parents. I think that's why she wanted to stay here for a few weeks before going back home. Leslie was always pretty stubborn, and sometimes when she got mad said some things she didn't mean. I remember back when we were younger, she pulled the \"I'm adopted, you're not my real parents\" card. That embarrassed her later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put on some clothes and came downstairs, made myself some breakfast, started my day. I had just finished my scrambled eggs when I heard an aggressive knocking at the door. Leslie must be here. I opened the door to let her in, getting a look at her for the first time in a few years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, kiddo! Haven't seen you in a while, C'mere!\" Leslie said to me, dropping a big dufflebag on the floor and wrapping me in a bear hug. I was surprised, but it was good to see her again. She was still a head taller than me, I was hoping I would've caught up, but it looks like now it'll never happen. She had dirty blonde hair that was shoulder length, and pale skin, the kind that will tan easily down here in a sunnier place. She was wearing a sleeveless tan colored tank top, and a loose pair of pants with a camo design. As she wrapped her arms around me, I noticed her shirt riding up. It was already showing an inch of her bare waist, but now slid up to show more of her midriff, even showing a hint of her navel. My first thought was a tall girl like her probably has trouble finding shirts that are long enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy second thought was that I should wriggle my hands down her sides and take the opportunity to tickle that bare skin of hers. We used to get into a lot of tickle fights when we were growing up. Maybe that's part of why I love tickling so much. But I remember that I also lost every one of those tickle fights. Even though I lost, I didn't actually mind, and I think Leslie knew it. I might've also had a bit of a crush on her growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with a twinge of regret, I pulled away from the hug. There was plenty of time to try and beat Leslie in a tickle fight later. Or, you know, just lose. That was fun too. \"Oof, it's great to see you too, Leslie. Are you trying to smush me?\" You say to her, grinning at her as you both head into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, only a little.\" She said, plopping herself down on the couch. \"Whew, that was a long trip. But whatever, we've got the place to ourselves! Whatcha wanna do first sport? I'm itching to do something.\" She said, looking up at you. Leslie certainly was still energetic. I'll have to make sure to keep up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're the guest, Leslie. And its just your first day here. So, what do you want to do first?\" You ask her. She sits pensively for a second, before finally saying...</span></div></div>",

Campus is so deep in the city that I don't think I've seen any wildlife in months,\" Leslie said, jumping up off the couch and stretching. Once again this revealed her lower belly and navel, causing my eyes to linger over the taut skin. Leslie's always been athletic, and the view only confirmed she's pretty toned and been taking good care of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie noticed my look and gave me a knowing smile. \"I know what you're thinking, kiddo, and you're welcome to try,\" she told, just as she reached out and gave my ribs a quick squeeze. The sudden attack caught me off guard, and I let out an embarrassing yelp and squirmed out of her grasp. Leslie took on an overly dramatic fighting pose. \"Come at me bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you're still such a ham, Leslie,\" I said, trying to catch up to her quick pace. \"But I'll get you back when you least expect it.\" She smirked at me and wiggled her eyebrows, obviously welcoming the challenge. Hmm, this walk in the woods might be more fun than I initially thought. Of course, I realized I also had to stay on my guard. She could always decide to pounce me for the heck of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got our shoes on and headed out into the woods behind my house. There were a bunch of trails that snaked out into the trees, and to be honest I'd never gone down most of them. Or gone very far at least, since there never seemed like much point. But now with Leslie so determined to do something, I'm sure we'd run into something new. Leslie was leading the way, picking a path seemingly at random. I followed her as we walked single file down the narrow dirt path, letting her take rights and lefts as she saw fit. While I tried to keep a good sense of which forks we took and how to get back, I realized we were quickly getting ourselves lost. Not that it would be too hard to get back even if that happened. I could still figure out which way was back into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of us said much as we hiked down the paths, which were getting increasingly knotted with roots as we ventured deeper into the forest. I could tell Leslie was enjoying the chance to get out into nature, occasionally stopping for a second to look at an interesting tree or flower. It felt nostalgic being with her, and despite the silence, I could tell we both felt comfortable around each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking behind her, I also couldn't help but notice when she pushed a branch out of the way and exposed a bare underarm just in front of me. Stretched out just in front of me like that, so inviting, I couldn't help but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026get whapped with the branch as she let it go, catching me off guard and distracted. I quickly pushed the branch out of the way only to see her laughing at me. \"Hey, eyes up front, tiger. Now where were you looking?\" she asked me, and I could tell the whole thing was a deliberate set up. I couldn't help but chuckle, she totally got me. I'd have to be more careful if I was ever going to get her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur path started inclining a bit, with Leslie pushing ahead and gaining a little distance from me. Unfortunately, she was in a bit better shape, and making her way up the incline easier than me. As I was catching up, I saw her stop at the top of the hill. I could tell something unusual had caught her interest. \"Hey!\" she yelled back at me, not even turning around. \"C'mere and look at this!\" What got her so excited, I wondered?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pushing away my immediate, tickle-obsessed instincts, I decided to see what caught Leslie's attention. I jogged up the path to where she was, getting only a little winded by the time I caught up to her. Gasping slightly, I saw she was pointing out over a field in front of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were standing in front of a field of tallgrass. It looked like it came up a little over knee high in front of us, but further in it looked like the grass rose well past my waist. The field was about the size of a football field, with a bare hill on the other side past the taller part of the grass. The tallgrass was swaying back and forth in the breeze, and was probably putting out a good amount of pollen. Thankfully neither of us had allergies. This species of grass had kind of a purple tinge to it, but was otherwise incredibly normal looking. For the life of me, I couldn't tell what got Leslie excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\u2026 grass?\" I asked her, looked at her with a confused expression. \"I know you've been living the big city life lately, but you've seen tallgrass before, Leslie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dufus. Look!\" Leslie said, pointing again. \"See how the grass is swaying? There's no wind at all! None of the leaves in the trees are moving. The air is perfectly still. So why is the grass moving around like that? It's not even all moving in one direction, it can't be wind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking again, Leslie was right. The nearby trees were completely still. I couldn't feel even a hint of breeze in the air. But that grass kept waving back and forth, almost hypnotically. First one way, then the other, almost like it was searching for something. Super weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! Let's go check it out!\" Leslie called back to me, already heading out into the field. I hurried to catch up to her, as we entered the tallgrass at the same time. I could swear it reacted to us, swaying to and fro a little faster as we started making our way through the field. The stalks brushed against my legs and seemed to wiggle behind my knees. The effect was starting to make me giddy, as I noticed the grass was distinctly tickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-man Leslie, this grass is really hehe, really moving- haha\" I said, surprised at myself for breaking down into laughter from just some grass brushing my legs. Somehow it tickled way more than I expected. Tons of little fronds lightly brushed across my skin, as if they were hunting for a sensitive spot to linger over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! It's crazy. Maybe we'll figure out why if we make it across the field. Man, is the grass getting to you? <i>Little baby too tickwish</i>?\" Leslie teased, making me try and scowl at her. She seemed to be keeping her composure just fine. Although I definitely noticed a grin on her face. And it definitely seemed like a ticklish kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe pressed on across the field, as the grass got taller around us. We came to the portion where the grass grew higher, and it was up past our waists. Thankfully my shorts and shirt were enough protection to keep the grass from really tickling me. But then I noticed Leslie was not so lucky. Her shirt stopped an inch or two short, leaving a band of bare midriff exposed, which the tallgrass seemed somehow eager to sway over, brushing her bare belly, hips, and sides. I noticed her belly starting to shake with pent up laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, s-so who's the <i>'tickwish baby</i>' now? You-hoho look like you're h-having more problems than mehehe!\" I told her, my laughter ruining the taunt a little, but not much. Leslie started to say something, but just then a frond swiped over her hip in <u>just </u>the right way, causing her to yelp and break into a stream of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, sh-shut uhuhup!\" she said, as we descended in more and more ticklish laughter. I also noticed we were walking slower and slower\u2026 We needed to do something, and quick.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As we continue to descend in to more ticklish laughter, from the swaying grass. I had noticed that we were walking slower and slower. The tickling sensations on my knees and Leslie's bare midriff had caused us to stop in the middle of the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I HEHE C-AN'T HEHE MO-VE HEHEHE \" Leslie laughed, as she tried pushing the grass tips from under her tank top. But with every handful of grass she was able to grab, another bunch of fronds would find their way up her top.\" hehe, I know you-hoo wanted to walk thr-ough this field, and hehe now your-or quitting, we hehe need to keep moving\" I managed to say in between laughs, as the grass continued to brush against my knees. The brushing on my knees, made them weak, to the point that I was unable to move. The grass poking the back of my knees had increased to the point that I could no longer stand, causing me to fall backwards into the into the center of the field. \" hehehe, are you okayy hehe\" Leslie managed to say in between laughter. As she saw me fall on my back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" hehe, I'm good hehe\" I laughed. \" Lesliee hehe, I've got a problemm, I can't move, my arms and legs are frozen\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I fell, I landed with my arms just above my head and my legs spread apart slightly. The weird thing about now I landed was that my arms and legs were not struck in any mud or the in the ground. They were just laying on top of the ground with nothing holding them down. Also nothing was broken and I felt find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie was still fighting off the grass that was attacking her bare midriff. The swaying grass became too much for her and she eventually fell backwards landing on her back, the same way I was, a few feet from me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Leslie are you okay\" I screamed over to her. \" hehe yeah hehe\" she replied, still laughing from the earlier brushing grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I can't move\" she said. \" my arms and legs are frozen too\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" wee hehe need hehe to scream-mmm for help\" I said giggling again. I had just found out that small grass on the floor of the field was brushing against my faces and ears, causing me to giggle uncontrollable. I also noticed that the tall grass in the field had grown to about 7 feet tall, making it harder for people passing the field to see us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both screamed and giggled, \" HEHE HELP, HELP, WE'RE IN THIS FIELD, ANYBUDDY\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie started to giggle again, as small grass was starting to brushing against her ears and face too. \" what'ss hehe matterrr Lesliee, tickwish\" I giggled and taunted, trying to shake the grass out of my ears, but this grass was not giving up. \" No, hehe this grass is brushingg my earrrrs\" she giggled. With her unable to scream for help     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI screamed help as loud as I could, \" HELPPPPPP HAHAHAHA\". As I screamed for help, tips of the grass above me started to hang lower and lower, till they were right above my midsection, which was exposed from the way I fell earlier. With the way the grass was swaying the tips were moving like a pendulum above my lower midriff, causing my screams to turn into laughter. With every scream for help a tip would swing making contact with my lower belly just right, causing me to yelp and disrupt my  cries for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hehe what's matter, hehe kiddo, you have a tickwish belly welly\" Leslie taunted in between giggles, as the grass continued to brush her ears. \" NOOOOOO, HAHAHA ' I replied in laughter, as the tips may contact with my exposed belly button, causing me to go into mass giggles and laughter. Because we couldn't move our and arms and legs, we were stuck, and if we tried to scream for help, the grass would brush our exposed skin, distracting us and cracking our voices. We were victims to this grass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when all hope was lost, we heard  foot steps in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS SOMEONE THEREREE HAHAHA HELP US HAHAHA\" I tried to say, as a grass tip swing into my belly button again, causing me to break my concentration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well, well, well, what do we here\" a voice said, coming from behind us. I could not see who was behind us, do to constantly getting grass tips brushing against my midriff. <br>\r\n\" it looks like we have some trespassers in are field\" the voice said, as they came into view and it was.... <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leslie!! Where are you? Hey! Where are yoooooooooooou?!\" That's when I \"found\" the hole. As I fell, I quickly caught up to Leslie, who like me, was screaming her head off. \"Leslie!\"<br>\r\n\"Dude! What is happening?!\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know!! Take my hand!\" Leslie reached over and took my hand, and we clutched at each other's arms to make sure we didn't get separated. We fell for what felt like hour, but was probably only a few minutes. Suddenly a light appeared and as we fell through it, we must have gone about 30 ft in the air. And then gravity kicked in and we fell toward the ground, but for whatever reason, the grass caught us and gently lowered us down. After about a minute of catching our breath, the grass started tickling us.<br>\r\n\"What the hell! Are we back here? Seriously?!\" Leslie yelled.<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get out of this stupid grass!\" We quickly ran out of the grass, and then fell down onto our butts in order to properly catch our breath. After several minutes, we were just sitting there, trying to figure out what happened.<br>\r\n\"I forgot how freaking weird this town can be sometimes. You'd think a giant octopus that held me upside down and tickled my feet would burn that into my memory.\" She muttered.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no kidding. Come on, let's go back.\"<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" But then something just as weird as the grass and the hole happened. The curvy, winding road that was covered in roots that we took to get here was gone. It had been replaced by a straight shot road that was smooth and paved. We exchanged worried, baffled looks, but remained silent as we walked down the road, wondering just where we were. When we looked out, we saw the town just the way we left it. But something felt odd about it. Like it was vastly different somehow. We started walking home. Then I realized what was different. The town looked like it'd be turned into a center of tickling culture. Restaurants and shops had signs that advertised different tickling specials, and some of the places looked like they were devoted to tickling, there were different stocks and bondage tables located around town with people being publicly tickle tortured, and looking at the people, they often wore clothing that exposed vulnerable ticklish spots, they openly tickled friends as greetings and interactions, there were even a few girls and guys dressed up in bathing suits, offering to be pinned and tickled for money. I couldn't decide what was more powerful. My enjoyment of what was around me, or being completely weirded out. Eventually, we made it back home but had to take a double take since it looked to be ten times bigger then we left it. Like it had been different sections added onto it.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is the right place?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n\"Positive...\" I said quietly. \"Watch.\" I walked up to the door and turned the key in the lock and it unlocked easily. We walked through the house, mystified by what had happened. We walked into the kitchen to see...us. It was me and Leslie, and they looked to be making sandwiches. \"Hello?\" They jumped in surprise and when they turned toward us, I saw that they... </span></div></div>",

And the beach here is so great! Let's go!\" Leslie quickly starts rummaging through her bag, presumably looking for a swimsuit. I shook my head, and realized its going to be tough keeping up with her. Leslie gave out an \"Aha!\" and help up the two halves of a dark green bikini. \"Alright, I'm going to go bed changed. Go get your trucks on, what're you waiting for?\" She said, already moving to the bathroom to get changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that there was no stopping her, I went to my room and got out my blue swim trunks and changed into them, also putting on a white t-shirt and a pair of flip flops. Good beach clothing. I started thinking about what else I should bring along, but before I could give it any real thought I heard Leslie yell from downstairs. \"Alright, I'm ready, let's go! Time's a-wasting!\" I hurried downstairs to find Leslie standing in the living room in her bikini. Her tall, statuesque figure looked very, very good in it. She was in great shape, and my eyes were drawn away from her face. Her top hugged her breasts nicely, giving an alluring amount of cleavage. And her toned tummy was fully exposed, and I felt my fingers twitch at the urge to reach out and try to tickle her. That long, shallow depression of her bellybutton, the curves of her hips, the slightest indication of her abs underneath her smooth, pale skin. I bet I could really get her if she wasn't expecting\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Earth to dufus!\" Leslie called out, snapping me out of my reverie. \"My eyes are up here, y'know. I know how awesome I look, but try to keep a handle on those hormones.\" I blushed and looked away as she teased, but she consoled me, \"Hey, it's cool. I know how irresistible I look.\" She winked at me, and I playfully punched her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a dork.\" I told her simply, recovering my wits. \"C'mon, I'll drive us over there.\" The two of us got in the car my parents had left for me. Leslie reclined in the passenger seat and relaxed as I drove us to the beach, taking the easy twists and turns west to towards the ocean. It was a quick drive, and before we knew it we were at the beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, there weren't many people there, despite the warm and sunny day. I could see some girls playing beach volleyball off to the side. It looked to be an intense competition, although I noticed a girl on the sidelines who reached over to tickle one of the players at a critical moment, leading to her missing the ball. Interesting rules. Here and there were people lying on blankets or playing in the shallows, but there was plenty of beach space to go around. I looked up to see the steep stairway that led up the cliff towards the mansions that overlooked the ocean. Man, it'd be cool to be in one of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" I heard Leslie mutter. \"We forgot sun screen. I'm not going to get tan now, I'm just going to turn into a lobster.\" We got out of the car and started heading toward the beach, and I realized that she was right, we had completely forgotten sun screen. Well, maybe if someone hadn't been so eager, I would've thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you get all red, I promise to rub aloe on you.\" I tell her consolingly. Thankfully I don't burn easily, so I wasn't too worried, although I should probably wear sunscreen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I'll bet you'd like that.\" Leslie retorts playfully. \"Wait, wait! Look over there, someone's selling suncreen!\" She looked to be right, at the edge of the sand was a table with a woman standing beside it. Getting closer, it looked like she was handing out free samples of some new brand of sunscreen. I picked up a bottle and examined it. \"Cosqui 75! Protects from the sun! Sensitive skin!\" The bottle said simply. Apparently this stuff was for people with sensitive skin? That didn't really sound like me, but as long as it protected against UV, I supposed it didn't really matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a free sample?\" The woman asked, making me turn my attention to her. She was a shorter girl, about our age. She had jet black hair of chin length in kind of a Cleopatra haircut. She was wearing a golden yellow bikini that showed off her attractive figure. As much as my eyes would be naturally drawn to the curves of her lovely figure, I was struck by her eyes. They were\u2026 yellow, which I didn't think was an eye color. </span></div></div>",

Please lie down now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough I was still somewhat reluctant, I obeyed the woman and lied down on the table. Leslie followed me, and I could tell that she was also wondering what was going on. Once we were on the table, the woman opened one of the bottles of sunscreen. She put some on her hand and started rubbing it vigorously over Leslie\u2019s bare belly. \u201cHEHEHE,\u201d my cousin giggled. \u201cIHIHIT TIHIHICKLEHES!\u201d Undeterred, the woman kept scrubbing the sunscreen on Leslie\u2019s stomach for about a minute before moving on to her neck. Leslie\u2019s giggling died down to just occasional giggles as the sunscreen was applied to her skin. After she got the neck, the woman began rubbing the Cosqui 75 on Leslie\u2019s arms and legs, which did not tickle at all. She then instructed Leslie to turn over as she put the sunscreen on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the woman was finished applying the Cosqui 75 to my cousin, she had used up about a quarter of the bottle. She took the bottle with her and walked over to my side of the table, and then she started to rub it over my midriff. Soon enough, I felt that the way the sunscreen was being applied did tickle quite a bit, and I fell into fits of giggles. \u201cHEHEHE!\u201d I laughed. \u201cNAHAHAT THEHERE!\u201d Just as she had done with Leslie, the woman ignored my complaints and kept going, even getting a little bit of the sunscreen in my bellybutton. She soon finished with my ticklish tummy and moved on to my neck, arms, legs, and back, none of which tickled very much. Once I was covered in Cosqui 75, the woman spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease lie on your backs again,\u201d the strange woman announced. We both got on our backs, and then the woman\u2019s hands shot to our abdomens and began tickling us again. Unprepared for more tickling, we both broke out in laughter for the minute that she wiggled her fingers on our bare bellies. The woman then decided to stop tickling us and handed Leslie the remainder of the sunscreen. \u201cThank you for trying out Cosqui 75. Have a nice day at the beach.\u201d After this, the saleswoman headed back over to her own table, leaving us to ourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at my cousin, we both shrugged our shoulders and got up from the table. \u201cLet\u2019s find a place to sunbathe,\u201d Leslie suggested. I quickly agreed to this, and we headed out onto the beach, finding an isolated area with a good view of the ocean and plenty of sun to go around. Within a few minutes, we had put our towels down and were relaxing as the sun came down on us. Just as I was beginning to fall asleep\u2026</span></div></div>",

Always doing something whether it's going for a jog or playing video games. There's Katelyn. She's the leader of that gang of middle school pranksters I told you about. Although quite a few of them are graduating to freshman year of high school in the fall. Catherine is this tech genius who's always building machines meant for tickling. Rachel is super friendly but to be honest, I'm not sure where she stands on tickling. Rob loves tickling people but he's not ticklish at all. Phoebe is popular but incredibly caring. She's ticklish but I'm not sure if she really gets into or not. Oh. Then there's the trio. Alicia, Mary and Kimberly. They're little daddy's girls who think they're better than everyone else. We're not really friends but they're worth mentioning since I once saw people get so sick of them, that they pinned the three of them to the lockers and tickled them so bad that they cried.

My sister was at a cousin's in Chicago for a week, back for a day, then off to Los Angeles to reconnect with her childhood friend, whom she met when we had lived there, for the rest of the month. For almost the whole month, I had the place all to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, my parents trusted me not to trash the place, and I was both smart and responsible enough to not throw a huge six-day house party. Stepping on my parents' trust wouldn't get me anywhere and besides, huge house parties weren't really my thing. Unless I did something <i>really</i> stupid, which knowing me was unlikely but still quite possible, nothing in the house would break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding out of bed, I stretched and yawned as was customary for waking me up in the morning. I checked the clock on my desk, which read 10:00. A decent sleep-in, but not as late as I've slept some days in previous summers. Normally I'd be getting dressed before bolting downstairs to eat whatever my mother had cooked up for me, but a new sense of confidence (or surge of insanity rather) and the fact that I was alone in the house gave me the courage to go downstairs butt naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly it was not the smartest thing to do, but who would be watching? The shutters were all closed, the doors were all locked, and no one save family and close friends had a spare key. It was as if my family put the house in lockdown every time they left. Sure, nothing as secure as the U.S. Treasury, but there was significantly less cash and worth inside our house. With that out of my mind, I went to make breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacon sizzled in the pan, and the familiar pop of the toaster told me that the little appliance had done its job. A slice of butter from the fridge, an egg in the pan after the bacon was slapped on a plate. Fifteen minutes saw me sitting at the kitchen counter with a delicious breakfast ready to be devoured, and all in my birthday suit. Soon a fork materialized in my hand and was shoveling the food into my mouth. The best food is the food you make yourself. Cereal is good and all that, but honestly if you can make bacon and eggs why wouldn't you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plate and fork found their way to the sink. Dishes, trash, and cleaning were all my chores until the family returned. Since everyone else was out traveling, the only laundry I had to do was my own. Not a bad load, and as long as I was careful I'd have an easy month. Thoughts of how to spend my month alone began crossing my mind. I could invite Jenna over, or go to Katherine's place, or maybe hang out with Sharon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then I heard a noise, and it made me realize that I would not be spending this first day alone entirely as I'd begun to plan it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I felt my cheeks redden at the thought of being caught in such a position without a shred of clothing on me. Although the door was closed and there was no glass to peek through, I felt incredibly self conscious with my position and fought the urge to cover myself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my face got warm at my embarrassment, the bell continued to ring as the person refused to leave and was determined to get some reaction. With a moment's thought, I decided on three options. The door was on a chain and answering it meant that I'd only have to look through a crack so it'd seem I was only going without a shirt as long as my lower body was obscured by the door by leaning to one side. I could rush upstairs to get changed but the person might leave by the time I was finished. Finally, I could shout out to see who it was and hope that they didn't ask too many questions or it wasn't someone I'd have to let in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's pause, I decided too...</span></div></div>",

In front of me stood a girl, about 18 and 5' 2\", in a pink fluffy sweater that cutoff at her midriff, a bedazzled purse, black booty shorts with pink tights and no shoes. She had long blonde hair and a bubbly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello new recruit!\" she beamed unfazed by my nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" I stammered getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the recruitment officer for the company, Tickle Hunters.

She immediately grabbed my wrist and pinned it to the couch with extremely sticky tape and quickly did the same with the other. \"I was hoping you'd ask that,\" she giggled as she clamped a third piece over my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped up, taped my feet to the footstool, and stepped back to admire her handiwork. \"Well, now I'm gonna tickle you,\" her voice suddenly became cold and sinister, \"and when I feel like it, I'll pull the tape off your mouth and you can beg to be one of our 'boys' or ill put the tape back on and tickle you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to stroke her nail down my</span></div></div>",

At the sight of her captives powerless struggling playful sparkle could be seen at green eyes of <br>\r\nmy captor. \"ooowww someone got quite a ticklish belly in here!\"  Another nine devilish nails joined the first one now. I wiggled as hard as you could<br>\r\ntrying to escape the torture. \"Oh and I am Isabelle, Lis for short.\" After those words all of sudden I felt squeezing at the sides. I was going mad from this.<br>\r\n\"Its just a beginning for what is coming, and there is going to be a lot more if you wont agree.\" My \"recruiter\" blew me a kiss with her pink lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know what she wanted from me, I had no possibility of resistance - whenever I tried to throw her off me or struggle she stopped me and started, what seemed<br>\r\nimpossible at this point, tickling me even harder. My eyes were wet from tears and what was even worse I was getting hard down there from such a pretty girl sitting on my naked body and tickling me mercilessly. Lis teared the tape from my mouth. \"What do you say now recruit?\" Spark of rebelliousness gleaned thru me then as I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHASCREEEWHAHAYOU\" She noticed what's going on down there then. Some hope that I am going to be freed gone thru me, as my screaming mouth was still free. However she just placed her right hand nails on the base of my manhood with evil smile.

A female voice answered friendly: \"I have a letter for you!\", a clinging sound from the letter box could be heard, \"my boss told me to ensure somebody is home and it gets read. Please read it soon. See ya!\" A bit irritated I answered \"Bye!\" and heard the clicking sound of her shoes on the street as she left. I felt like I knew her voice, but I couldn't tell who it belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thinking about her voice I realized that the situation was a little strange, usually nobody cares about when letters are read, I opened the door a little and checked that nobody was outside, before I slid through the door crack and opened the letter box, inside was a large brown envelope. Before opening it I put on a pair of blue underpants, a white T-Shirt, shorts and a pair of black socks and made myself comfortable on the couch with the envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of it was a letter from my school, I thought the summer break had started this week and everything was alright, so what could they want from me.<br>\r\nWhile reading it I started to panic the school realized that I had a lot of problems in different subjects, because many teachers stated that I was way to unfocused and missed to many classes, I had to admit I've become a little lazy last year, but my tests where mostly good and missing when there are no tests seems fine for me if I know the topics already well enough. The letter also stated that I still have a chance to pass the year and make up for everything if I do special tests in this one week, I don't have more time, because the teachers will only be in school this week to clean up stuff and do final exams for students willing to better their grades, before being on vacation themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading the letter I tried to see something positive in it which was really hard, but at least my family was on vacation and I have a chance to make up for my laziness. This way they will never know, there are also some teachers I really like and classmates that could be there for improving their grades, so maybe this will be tolerable and after a week I can still enjoy my summer. Thus I decided to eat a bowl of cereal put on a pair of sneakers and go to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I reached the old building with 4 floors I entered and was astonished how empty it felt, on a normal day there are hundreds of children here but now I felt like I was the only one in the building that was of course not true, but it still felt a little depressing.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I decided I should start with a little morning exercise and do something to pass my sports course to fully wake up and finish an hopefully easy one. In my martial arts class I usually just tickled my opponent for a while and hoped they give up or I just lost, my decision for this course war based only on the fact that my indian friend Sharon took it too, so I didn't put in much effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure where my sports teacher Ms. Davis was, but I thought I should start by looking in the gym. This proved to be the right decision, because when I entered she was there removing and cleaning matting from the floor on the other end of the large room. \"Good morning Ms. Davis\" I shouted through the large gym so she could hear me. Looking up she saw me and knew immediately why I was there, so she came over and asked me to change into my martial arts outfit. I went to the changing rooms to do this and when I reentered the gym now in my white martial arts outfit, an orange belt and no shoes, I realized she had changed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 32 year old Ms Davis wore the same things as I did, but had a black belt around her waist. I looked at her from top to bottom, to see her normal blond hair she wore in a pony tail, her nice face, with the very nice smile and her nose that was slightly to large for her face. The rest of her body was pretty athletic, except for her beautiful soft looking feet, with black nail polish matching her belt. I always thought she was pretty and had a little crush on her, because of her friendly way of teaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, again, I want to improve my grade so that I don't fail\", I told her and felt like I was a bit too needy. \"I know, I know\" she answered slightly annoyed confusing me a lot. \"It's the same every year there are students choosing martial arts, because they think they can learn very cool stuff and don't have to do anything for it. The truth is, this course is for you to improve yourself and to learn to fight difficulties in your life, not necessarily with violence, but rather with the strength you gained from this course.\". \"Okay sounds like a really cool idea\", I answered a bit cowed, it was a scolding and I had to take it, to get over with this thing as soon as possible, but it still felt strange coming from Ms Davis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is the task I designed specifically for you: We will have a fight, I will try to keep you in this room and you have to escape, I know you want to see the other teachers to make up for your laziness in there classes too, so the longer you need, the less time you have for them. I am the wall you have to overcome with your strength. We will start in the corner with the largest distance to the exit so you actually have to escape. I am allowed to drag you back, but you are also allowed to push me through the exit with you. There is no time limit for this class and you can stop, if you want to try it later, but then we will go back to the beginning. I will do my best to stop you, but still wish you good look. If you are ready come to the corner so we can start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is my task here I have to flee, but she is sort of right, if I manage to escape her quickly I can continue with my other tasks pretty fast, this whole test feels pretty doable and in the end her usually friendly behavior came through again so she might had to put this course on the letter but will let me easily.<br>\r\nWith this thought I went to the corner faced in the direction of the exit and told her that we can start. \"3....2....1....GO!\" The moment she said go I made a step in the direction of the door where Ms Davis was standing, she immediately grabbed my right arm and throw me to the floor. Landing on my back I closed my eyes a second to refocus. In this moment she threw me through the air once more this time I landed on my stomach, but I was able to land better and tried directly to stay up.<br>\r\nTo stop me from doing so Ms Davis simply sat on my upper legs and pulled my hands out from under me and put me in lock with my hands on my back. I wasn't really able to move anything except for my toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy test was harder than I imagined, after less than a minute I had failed and got beaten, \"See that happens, when you don't improve yourself. You are unable to escape\", she provoked me and it worked I became able to remove my arm from her grip (mostly because she allowed me to) but anyways I fought my way up and was standing again. This time I didn't go to the door directly but rather faked it and when she stepped in the way to stop me I took her left arm with both hands, span around so that my back was facing her and her left arm was above my shoulder and started to pull on it to throw her to the ground. At that moment I felt her right hand squeezing my right side. A small smile appeared on my face, but I tried to ignore it and continue to pull her over my shoulder, but she continued tickling my right side and went up to my ribs. My smile became bigger and I tried to block her right hand with mine, this meant I had less strength to pull on her arm which allowed her to pull it out of my grip and tickle my left side to. I started to giggle and tried to clumsily block her hand without much of an effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moment she started to push me forward I was a giggling mess already so I simply fell to the ground. She sat on the back of my legs and remove my belt which had opened during the fight from before. She stopped tickling me for a moment to remove my jacket so I was only wearing my white martial arts pants and used the belt to tie my hands behind my back. I wanted to resist, but she was to fast and I needed to recover from the tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I was laying there a giggling mess with my arms tied behind my back, with only with a pair of pants on restrained by my pretty and strong martial arts teacher who was still sitting on the back of my legs to decrease my movement options even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't really a bad position for me in fact I liked it sort of, so I could enjoy her tickling or I could try to to pass her test and impress her.</span></div></div>",

I noticed that she didn't have long fingernails, but soft and very strong fingers that tickled like crazy. With my jacket still on it was sort of bearable, but now that she stole this protective layer from me it wasn't, my previous giggling turned into laughter: \"hahahaaah brehehehahak hhahahahahaha pleha hahahahase hahahaha\". \"You want a break, life doesn't give you one either. But seeing how much you struggle you seem to still have some fighting spirit left in you, so I will continue and try even harder to break you\" was her answer to my bidding. Immediately acting according to her thread her fingers became even faster tickling my sides and ribs and going into my armpits from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lost it completely: \"haha HAHAHAHAHAAAHAHAH STOOOHHHOOHOOPP AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\". I couldn't move my arms I couldn't use my legs and I had no strength left in my body, but for some reason I didn't stop struggling even though it didn't feel like it was useful. I enjoyed her tickling, but I didn't want to fail my courses and I also didn't like to look so weak in front of this teacher I had a crush on, so I continued to make escape attempts even if they were completely futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments Ms Davis wanted to spin me around and she did this by simply waiting for another uncoordinated burst from me, stood up a little and then when I got up a little she pressed me back to the ground but this time I was laying on my back or rather on my bound arms. She sat back on my upper legs and put her cool hands softly on my sides: \"You really do have so much energy and strength in you, I'm sure if you put in the effort you could become the amazing person that is highly successful in life I want you to be. But I get the feeling that you are more interested in tickling.\" She gently started tickling my sides while saying this, but just so that I didn't laugh loudly. \"Maybe you just need a different goal than simply passing this course to actually use your power. How about this: I am actually quite ticklish myself, and if you pass this test you can tie me up and tickle me for lets say 2 hours in my underwear, for me this is basically an easy endurance training, what do you think about this idea?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was startled would she go this far to help me become a great person. And if she did why was this test so hard. This could also be just a tease. On the other hand was Ms Davis a person who didn't go back on her word, what had I to lose at this point anyways I could just try to pass again and hope that this additional reward was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this idea in mind I tried to kick her off of my legs with all the strength I had, \"HAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA\" the moment I threw her in the air she began tickling with all she had again and I lost my strength immediately and collapsed back to the ground laughing like crazy \"HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA\". This attempt didn't work, but I need to escape. I want this reward I want it so badly. That and how much it tickled was all I could thing about. \"You are so ticklish I get why you are so fascinated with it\" , Ms Davis told me \"I want to try a new technique on you.\" With that she shifted her body down a little, took a deep breath and blew a 5 seconds long raspberry on the left side of my stomach. \"HOHOHAHAAA AHOHAHAHAHA\" I couldn't stand it. I was completely lost in the world of tickling she had created for me, after a short break she took another deep breath \"NOHAHOHOHOHOH AHAHAH\" was all I could say before she blew another raspberry on my stomach this time first on my right side, than my left and finally again on the right each one felt longer than the previous one and tickled also more. While doing this her fingers never stopped kneading my sides. At this point I was drooling while screaming: \"BLUBLU STOHOHBLUHOPPP IHAHAHAHAHA WAWAWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHANT HAHAHA TOHOHOHA WIHIHNHAHAHA THIHIHIHIHIS AHAHA\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW this is so fun, I might overdo it a little here but, you have enough motivation I must be careful that you don't try a trick on my like before, but well you have no sleeves left, so where should you keep your tricks anyways.\". With that she took another breath and blew a very long, wet raspberry right on my belly button.<br>\r\nThat was it. I peed my pants my bladder couldn't stand any more tickling. I let everything out. My teacher certainly didn't expect this and the combination of her shock and the smell made her stop the tickling and take a step back. I was shocked too but this gave me the energy I needed. I realized that in her surprise she didn't go in the direction of the exit meaning the path to my big price was free, it wasn't a heroic action, but if it worked who cares. And so I got up and made a run for the door. It took Ms Davis a moment to realize that I've gotten up and that I was walking to the exit, but she started following me faster than I hoped, she was also fitter and less tired than me, but I still had a head start and just ran. I stretched my hand out to reach for the door and then I....</span></div></div>",

Ms Davis stood directly behind me and untied my hands. \"Congratulations you escaped, looks like you are a fighter, just as I thought even though you mostly fight with dirty tricks\", she turned me around and gave me a big hug. I could smell her feminine scent while she pressed me into her. \"I think you should change now while I write you a note for the secretary that you did earn enough extra points.\" she stepped back with a smile and went to the storage room where the teachers leave their stuff. I went to the shower and put my t-shirt and shorts back on after cleaning myself, my underwear smelled too bad, so I had to stay the rest of the day without them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Davis was probably still in the storage room, so I entered it and walked between all the sports equipment to my teacher. She was still wearing her martial arts outfit while sitting on a table and writing something. When she heard me she stood up and turned around to face me: \"Looks like you are ready to leave. Here is your paper, I wish you good luck for the other tests.\" Wait that's it? She promised me another reward. I took the paper and stood there for a moment. \"Is there something else?\", she asked after a few seconds. \"Well, thank you for the paper, I appreciate it, but you mentioned another reward for passing this test.\", I answered. \"Wait but that was just to motivate you, I think it is highly inappropriate to let you tickle me.\", \"You did the same to me, besides you were never a person who did go back on her word.\", I answered now with more confidence. She bit her bottom lip a little and looked down, she has never been shy in class, but now she looked like she doesn't want to do this.<br>\r\n\"As far as I know you still need to pass other tests. Shouldn't you start with them.\" she said trying to escape the situation. \"True, but I think I earned it and I wouldn't be able to get you off my mind during the other tests which could greatly decrease my success probability.\" She smiled at my compliment and answered while rolling her eyes: \"Sigh, fine I don't expect anyone for the next two hours so we you can do what you want.\" I was very happy: \"Great! Please come with me, I've already seen a few devices that should help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One moment please you mentioned I have to act on my word, so I need to be in my underwear, right?\" With that she opened her belt and let it fall to the ground, her jacket opened while doing this and revealed a white sports bra with a blue wave pattern she was wearing underneath. I couldn't believe my luck. She had really nice breasts, probably a B-cup and a flat stomach that looked muscular but still soft. She than proceeded by pulling her pants down without bending her knees, she just reached the floor with her hands and threw her pants together with her jacket on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI enjoyed the view and couldn't stop looking at her flawless legs. But after a moment I came back to my senses and thought about tickling this wonderful, beautiful woman, so I took her to the sport devices. \"I think the best way to tickle you is by tying you down otherwise you might be too strong. So please lay down on this bench.\", I told her. She followed my order and lay down face up on the bench in the center of the room. I should have enough space to stretch her out here.<br>\r\nI already knew what I needed next. The school had a machine for rope skipping. It looked like a person with two arms attach to a spinning circle on the \"chest\". I rolled the first figure to Ms Davis head and the second one close to her feet. I activated the break so that they will not roll away and added a few heavy weights to each machine. With those weights attached the machines wouldn't move one bit. To finish my plan I took out a few jump ropes and started with her right foot. I wrapped one rope three times around her right ankle and tied a knot so it wouldn't get loose. I than connected the rope with one arm of the machine and pulled until my teacher was laying on the bench with her bound feet hanging over the edge. I repeated the same procedure with her left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you had this plan for a while now right\", she said a bit surprised while I took her right wrist and pulled it over her head, before binding it with the rope to the machine above her head. \"Well, you already mentioned that my interests are mostly tickling related so I look for ideas wherever I can find them\", I said while also binding her left arm to the machine. After binding her arms and legs I finished my work by wrapping a rope around her knees and one just below her breasts that would keep her on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a step back to admire my work Ms Davis tried to move a little and realized that she was only able to move her head, her fingers and her toes. The rest of her gorgeous body was tied down. \"Oh man this will be tougher than I thought\", she said a little uneasy. What she didn't think of is that I tied her highly immobile, but I could use the rope spinning machine to turn her around if I wanted to tickle her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took the blindfold we had for coordination games out that I had taken with me while bringing the ropes, walked over to her, sat on her legs and put it on her. \"NO, don't do that I want to know what you are doing\". Putting this on her was a great idea because know she wouldn't be able to see my erection pressing against my shorts. \"Don't be afraid, this will be very fun.\" I said while putting my right hand on her left side which made her suck in her tummy a bit and the fingertips of my left hand on her armpit. <br>\r\n\"Where should I start with your soft tummy or you hairless armpits?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'll start with your armpits\", I said while raising my hands. She pulled on the ropes binding her arms to protect her armpits, but the machines I used were to heavy and she couldn't do anything about it. The blindfold I had put on her prevented her from seeing that my hands were in a position to attack her tummy which I started to do. My hands went to her sides and started tickling her soft stomach not too hard to begin with, but she started giggling. \"hahahayouhahalihihittlehahahahadehavihilhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha&amp; #34;. My trick took her by surprise she expected me to tickle her somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer giggles were delightful, especially because I had just started my revenge and was not putting in much effort to create this reaction. With this in mind I started to tickle a bit harder and also went to her lower ribs while still focusing on her sides. \"hahahahHaHaHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\", her giggling turned into laughter as my tickling became more intensive. \"HAHAHASTOHOHOHOPHAHAHA\", \"Well Ms Davis, we still have a lot of time left, I thought this should be an endurance training for you, so it is still not too hard right.\", I said while tickling her sides and ribs. It felt like she tried to escape, but I had done a great job restraining her and so she simply wasn't able to move. She only exhausted herself by trying. Her struggling did however make her skin warmer. Her body had felt amazing already, but the additional warmth I was now feeling was fantastic. My erection pressed painfully against my shorts, I was so glad that she couldn't see it, but I also needed to be careful that I don't press it against her or she might notice and I didn't want this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I gave her a short break to stand up and kneel besides the bench. My hands rested on her belly, but didn't tickle it, I just enjoyed the softness. \"HAhaha ha ha HUH that was I...I. SIGH. You are really good at this, I've always been ticklish, but you got me really good. How much time has passed?\", she said after recovering for a moment. I didn't even bother to look at a clock I was not going to give this opportunity up because of some clock. \"Don't worry about it, I will let you go when the time comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I started to tickle her stomach again. This time even harder than before \"WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAIHITHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\". Her laughter became louder which encouraged me even more to continue my tickling of her sides, tummy and ribs. \"You had this amazing technique you used on my, let me give it a try.\" With that I inhaled and blew a long raspberry right on the center of her tummy. \"AAAHAHAHAHAHAHANOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!!!HAHAHAHAHAHA\" she screamed. Doing this seemed to have broken her a bit more, as she started to shake her head rapidly. I found this reaction to be amazing and blew another raspberry on her stomach. The same reaction followed. \"AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! !!!\". She couldn't stand this technique, what a great information. \"That's right let it all out, laugh. It is so much fun doing this with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued tickling her like this, but after some time her laughter become quieter, even she wasn't able to keep up with this amount of tickling. The raspberries still made her scream with laughter like I had just started and so I simply blew them every few seconds on her to keep her laughter pouring out of her lips: \"AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good taste of her skin and the sweet scent of her body made it really hard for me to finally stop and give her a break, but after a while I did. At this point I had probably tickle her for more than 20 minutes like this. Seeing her I realized that I might overdid it a little. Her face was wet from tears and on the right side of her mouth was a bit saliva leaking out. I gave her the well earned break, but her body didn't seem to realize that the tickling had stopped as her body wouldn't stop shaking and her laughter didn't stop either \"hahahahahahaha\". I went to her head and put a hand on her cheek to calm her. After a moment the laughter stopped and the shaking became less, but didn't stop completely. I used a tissue to clean her face and gave her a moment to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked already broken, but she was always a tough person, so who knows, maybe she still has some willpower left in her. I thought about what to do next, there was so much of her left I could tickle that I couldn't decide. I also thought about the big thing in my pants screaming for attention for quiet some time now that I might care for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI than proceeded by...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still panting Ms Davis began to speak lightly: \"You got me, this is too much, you win. I already let you pass the test. Please don't tickle my tummy any more.\" \"Okay I will not tickle your tummy for a while.\", I generously said. My teacher started smiling and this smile was not caused by tickling, instead it was caused by her brain that didn't work properly because of all this tickling. I mean I couldn't really tickle her belly while tickling the rest of her lovely body. So I walked towards her feet. I let my fingertips glide over her gorgeous legs while going there, making her twitch. \"What are you doing? No. NO! NOHOHAHAHAHAHA\" The moment I had reached her feet I started tickling the soles of her slender feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey really looked like something special. She had creamy feet with rather long toes that looked like she took a lot of care of them. They were soft and had no irregularities. Her toes were decorated with glossy black nail polish. Just gliding my fingertips over her soles already brought her close to the state she was in from the tummy tickling. \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHANOHAHMOHOHOREHAHAHAHAHA\" she screamed. I simply continue to let my finger dance over her soles. I scratched over her heel and tickled under the balls of her feet. All these places worked wonders and Ms Davis continued to plead for me to stop: \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAJUUSTHAHAHAHASTOHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAPPPP!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than stopping I kneeled down in front of her feet and brought my face close to her beautiful soles. Hadn't she been blindfolded she might have doubled her useless escape attempts just to avoid what I had planned for her. I started with the left foot. The first lick I made only covered the center of her sole, it was really nice. Her sole was smooth and also a little warm. The second lick covered more of her sole and even her heel. I realized that it felt this good every place I could reach. My third lick was on her toes they were flawless just like the rest of her feet. \"AAAAAAHHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!HAHAHAHAHA!!!HAHAHAHA!!NAAHAHAHOHOHOHOHAHAHAH AHA\" she used her lungs as much as possible and it felt like she was still not able to express how much it tickled her. Her tears were flowing again, but I didn't care about them. I was too concentrated on the taste of her feet. They were amazing sweet and a little salty, it was just great. The combination of this taste and the softness of her feet made me lick it as much as possible. After maybe 2 minutes I thought, but probably half in hour in reality I let go of her left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really have the best left foot I have ever seen\", I told her but it didn't look like she heard me she was just laughing. It looks like this had completely broken her. She wasn't able to control herself in the slightest as drops of saliva were again flowing out of her open mouth. \"So let's see if you also get the title of the best right foot.\" I told her before greeting her right foot with my tongue. Her reaction was immediate: \"AAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\", I was still amazed at how much she could laugh. I was sure that I would have lost consciousness a long time ago, but her fit body was probably able to resist more and I was happily exploiting this skill of her as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to lick her right foot just like the left one, but this time I used my left hand to tickle her other foot as well. It didn't change anything about her laughter as she was at what I thought to be her limit, but I knew that it added to her sensory overload. At one point I put her big toe in my mouth which allowed me to lick the underside like a lollipop and for me her feet were exactly that. I don't need to finish the semester as long as I can lick her feet it is enough for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen my tongue got a little tired I slowed down the tickling and gave her another pause: \"I have never seen a girl that could take this much tickling.\", I complimented her. She didn't react, she was still a shaking, laughing mess. After cleaning her face again and letting her calm down for quiet some time she was able to speak again:<br>\r\n\"Are we done yet? *Pant* Please I can't take anymore. I do whatever you want, just stop, let me go. I *Pant can't anymore. Please!\". \"How did you like my tickling?\", I asked her. \"It was fantastic, you are a fantastic tickler, but I need a break please.\" She was completely broken the only think her shattered mind could think about was a break and being freed. At this point she would have done anything. \"Well I'm not sure if I really got a big enough reward for beating you in the test.\", I told her. \"You can get whatever you want from. You know that I stick to my word. But please give me a break.\", Ms Davis pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept that. You said I can get whatever I want from you. As long as I give you a break now, but you didn't state for how long, so I'm willing to accept this.\" This means I will...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I felt like Ms Davis had enough for now. She definitely had to recover for some time and she already offered to do whatever I want from her after a break so I could always come back later. \"I will give you your break\", I told her while removing her blindfold. I have never seen her this happy: \"Thank you! Thank you! I need this break.\" she said with a huge smile. I removed the ropes from her body. She got up and sat on the bench for a moment before standing up. \"You really do fight dirty. Using my strengths and fitness against me like that. This is what I said from the start, you can succeed, but it looks like you need very specific goals to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also stood up: \"See you later Ms Davis.\" \"I thought you have other tests to pass.\", she answered a bit confused. \"I will not forget your offer to do whatever I want after your break. You know your word always holds.\" Her smile faded, she hadn't realized what she had said back than, mostly because the tickling made it impossible for her to think. With that knowledge my teacher said: \"Bye.\" and quickly walked away to dress herself. I kept looking at her legs and her butt as she walked away until I couldn't see them anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile leaving the gym I took out her note for the extra points and walked to the first floor where the school secretary Lisa worked. She was a small 24 year old woman with long red hair. She only started to work at her old school a year ago after the previous secretary retired. The fact that she went to the school a few years ago meant we knew each other and because of that I often came to her office just to chat with her for a little. She loved to talk and always had this sympathetic aura around her which made everybody like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally that is. When I entered the office this day she cursed: \"YOU STUPID PIECE OF SHIT! WHY ARE YOU NOT WORKING!\". First I got the impression that she meant me, but than I realized that she didn't even notice me and was just screaming at her computer. She has never been good with technology. \"Hello Lisa!\", I greeted her. \"Hi, sorry I'm a little busy right now, I hope I didn't scare you when I screamed.\", she said still a bit louder than necessary while hitting the monitor. \"I do have something for you\", I gave her the extra point note while telling her that, she didn't look at me, because she had too much to do. After reading it she answered: \"You passed, good for you, looks like the test was pretty hard seeing how long it took you.\" After hearing her normal voice, I realized that she brought me the letter this morning, so I thanked her for doing so to which she replied: \"No problem, it was on my way, besides I knew that if I hadn't brought it to you it would have taken two more days to get to you, so you wouldn't have a chance to pass.\" I was really happy to hear that: \"Well than also thanks for caring for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now took a moment to look at me, so I saw her gorgeous green eyes. With a heartwarming smile she told me: \"I'm always happy to help. But I can't give you the extra points as long as my computer is not working properly. Could you maybe take a look at it sweety?\" \"Fine, I guess I owe you this.\", I answered. She got up from her desk and walked to the side which allowed me to take a better look at the black dress she wore. It was sleeveless, but didn't show much cleavage considering her big breast this made me a bit sad. So I looked further down which showed that the dress was pretty tight it revealed how slim she was and ended shortly above her knees. Looking down her delicate legs led my view to a pair of black heels. They weren't to high, but looked really good on her cute feet. She caught me ogling, but didn't say anything, since she was used to it and I was helping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat in front of her desk and looked at the computer. The screen was black. I pressed a few buttons, but nothing happened. I proceeded by pressing the power button which again had no effect. I checked the cables and saw that the computer wasn't plugged in. Probably a prank, but still she should have been able to figure that out on her own. While I checked the computer Lisa was ordering some paperwork and didn't look at me. After plugging the computer in and starting it, I sneaked up to her and when she raised her arms to put a folder on a shelf I poked her in the sides. She didn't even flinch, turned around and gave me a slightly annoyed look: \"How often will you try this, you know I'm not ticklish.\" I tried lightly tickling her sides a few times before and it never worked. But I was sure that she was lying, because she always insisted that she was not ticklish at all which made me highly suspicious. \"Oh is that so?\", I asked while poking her again. Her face stayed serious: \"Did you fix it?\" \"Well this will make you laugh\", I wanted to continue, but she interrupted me: \"Oh, you can't fix it too, I asked five people before you, I don't understand it, could you please look again, I have to stay until my work for today is done and I just want to go home.\" I wanted to tell her, that I fixed it, but now I might be able to reveal the truth about her ticklishness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I will spend more time to fix your computer, but if I manage to do that, you will allow me to come to your home with you and let me tickle you this evening.\", I told her my plan, it was direct, but the lesson with Ms Davis had taught me that being strong can be helpful in life. \"It sounds like you just want to get your fingers on me. I'm not ticklish so I accept under one condition: if you finally realize that I am not ticklish, you must change it to massaging me, so that I can really relax after this day. Do we have a deal?\". \"Of course we do!\" I told her enthusiastically. I sat done for 2 minutes and acted like I was doing something, before I couldn't wait anymore and told her that the computer was working again. \"Wow, I thought it was too complicated for everybody. Thanks for your help. Let me just finish this quickly in a few minutes I will be done and than you can come with me so I can get my massage.\", she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later we were entering her house. It wasn't that big and I knew it from previous visits. She told me to make myself comfortable. Then we entered her living room. \"So you want to conduct an experiment on my ticklishness. Go on what do you have in mind?\", she asked me. I didn't really thought this through, so I started by saying: \"I want to test all your possible spots to find out which ones work. To do that I need to be able to reach them without difficulties.\" \"Difficulties?\", she asked like she knew what I meant, but was a bit hesitant, \"like my clothes?\", \"And your movement.\", I answered matter of factly. \"Sounds like you just want to tie me up.\", she said annoyed. \"Okay, let's get this over with. My muscles are stiff so your massage would really help.\" So I...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as I was about to reach the door Ms Davis did catch up to me enough to kick against my right leg. I fell face down to the ground. My teacher took my left ankle and dragged me back to the other end of the gym. I wanted to do something and tried moving my bound arms. It worked, the belt must have become loose during my escape attempt. So I reached for the open door and was able to get my fingers on the door frame. I used all my strength against Ms Davis pulling, but I wasn't able to drag myself through the door. I was probably still weakened by all the tickling I received. But my teacher couldn't continue pulling either, because of my resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Let me go. I want this price! I want to tickle you!\" I shouted. Ms Davis told me encouragingly: \"If you really wanted this you should have run faster. But you still have a chance, just pull as if your life depended on it.\" With that I tried it again. I used all my strength and kicked with my legs and started moving forward. It was terribly slow, but the door was coming closer. This was the right motivation I flexed my muscles as much as I could and observed how the door got closer and closer. My head was now in the door.<br>\r\nI was so focused on my goal that I didn't notice anything my teacher was doing and so when I felt her soft left index finger on my left foot it took me completely by surprise. I should have been prepared for it, but I was too concentrated on escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it began \"No! ha don't do ha this haha.\" I could stand this little tickling even on my ticklish feet, but the surprise stopped me from pulling so Ms Davis used her strength to pull me a bit backwards again. I clenched my teeth to resist the tickling sensation on my foot and continued to pull again, but the increased tickling of two fingers my teacher started to use on my left foot sucked so much strength out of me that I was not able to move forward and even with a lot of afford was only capable of staying at my current position. Keeping my muscles flexed was exhausting and the tickling didn't help me either. So when Ms Davis started applying her third finger to my sensitive foot I became even weaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! haha don't  haHa do this HaHaHaHa!\" I was desperate, my price has been so close and now she increased the distance again. My teacher was too concentrated with tickling me to answer. Looking back I saw that she had a great time doing this test with me. My arms were now completely stretched out. I don't know where I got the power allowing me to hold onto the door frame from, but I wanted to win this: \"HaHaHaHaHaHa LetHaHaHaHa mHeHeHeHaHaHa GOHoHoHaHaHa\". She didn't. My laughter only encouraged her and so she started using all five fingers of her left on my foot. She even started to tickle my toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to resist, but I couldn't. I lost my grip on the door frame. Ms Davis didn't stop tickling me, instead she continued and pulled the laughing and kicking ball I was away from the door. When we reached the starting point of the test her tickling slowed down. I was still laying face down on the ground laughing for a bit \"HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA\". Once I had calmed I felt that she was sitting on my butt. She took my right arm and bend it behind my back. She then used my belt again, I didn't know when she took it, to tie my arms behind my back. This time tighter than before. \"I think it will not get loose this time.\", she told me \"Your pants smell, I think you have to wash them.\" With that she got up a little to kneel over me, put her fingers under the rim and pulled them down revealing my blue underpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They suit you well.\", she teased while sitting down on my ankles. My feet were really close together. From my own tickling experience I knew what was coming and that I wouldn't be able to escape. And that was exactly what happened. \"I think I didn't tickle your feet good enough.\" Ms Davis said while starting to use her ten soft fingers to tickle both my feet. \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA\" my feet were less ticklish than my tummy, but it still tickled like crazy. \"This works really good, unlike all your dirty tricks\". She continued to tickle my feet concentrating mostly on the center, because she didn't have much experience and it was having a strong effect on me: \"HAHAHAHAHAHAH NOHOHOHO HAHAHAHAHA\" I didn't stop laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut only tickling the centers got too boring, so my teacher started to resume the tickling of my toes which she had tried while pulling me over. She also began to tickle my heels. She was now tickling everywhere on my feet and it was maddening: \"HAHAHAHA STOHOHAHAHAHOHOHAPP HAHAHAHAHAHA\"<br>\r\nShe didn't, instead she continued her fighters life advice: \"Don't use dirty tricks, use your actual strength, come on passing this test isn't that hard.\" Was she serious I felt like I was dying and couldn't even move my body. Ms Davis noticed that right under my toes were my weak spots and so she concentrated on this part which resulted in the first few tears streaming down my cheeks. \"AAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so fun to tickle him, but I think I got more laughter out of his tummy, or I still have to get to know his feet better.\" Ms Davis thought. \"I will continue with his...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ms Davis stopped tickling my feet. I inhaled deeply to recover, but wasn't given much time as she simply rotated on my legs and slid up to my upper legs. She than poked me in the sides with her index fingers. \"Hey ha stop that.\" It didn't tickle that much, but made me twitch every time. \"Okay, looks like you want it another way.\" With that she began to tickle my sides again. My teacher used both her strong hands to knead my midriff. \"HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA!\" her tickling brought me right back to my previous state. My tummy was more ticklish than the weak points on my feet so this was even worse. Thankfully she was also too focused on tickling me that she didn't think her position through. Sitting on the back of my upper legs meant that I could bent my knees and thus kick her in the back. I didn't do it coordinated, but her tickling made me do it. The kicks were also not really strong, but Ms Davis felt that I was kicking her. \"Oh that's the reaction I expected from a fighter. You can't use your hands, but your legs are still able to attack me. This is really good. You should have done something like this before.\" I could only answer with my continuous: \"HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA HAHA\" as her hands didn't slow down and just kept tickling my sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what you do when I take your ability to move your legs from you as well. Shall we?\" With that she stopped tickling me, turned me on my back and set back down just above my knees. I didn't even understood what happened all I realized was that my face was more comfortable and my legs couldn't kick anymore. Ms Davis than put her soft hands back on me tummy and continued to tickle it. When she started her hands were rather cool, but the squeezing, scratching and kneading had made them warm. Just getting touched by them would have felt fantastic, but the tickling robbed me of the pleasure of this pretty teacher having her hands all over my body. I laughed: \"HAHAHAHAH BREAHAHAHHAHAKHAKK HAHAHAHAHHAHA\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Davis just continued and again added my ribs into her tickling mix. She remembered how well her tickling up and down from my ribs to my sides and back up worked so she resumed with that pattern tickling up and down. I was still laughing like crazy. Tears were streaming down my cheeks, but my struggling became less. Partly because I simply couldn't really move my body. The main reason however was that the teacher had basically tickled every piece of strength and energy out of me at this point. I never was a person with a lot of stamina so I thought it was amazing that I managed to hold out for this long, but my body had become too weak to struggle at this point. I was however still laughing the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teacher noticed that my movements died down: \"What's wrong? You had so much fight in you and now almost nothing of it is left. Maybe I can bring out a little more.\" With that she started blowing raspberries on my belly again. First the left side than the right side. It actually worked a little as I started to shake my head again. I also started to drool again. The new movement died down rather fast and so Ms Davis blew the next set of raspberries on my belly \"AAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH NOHOHO HAHAHAHAHAHAH NO AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" This time I didn't really move again. So my teacher took the next step and blew the next raspberry right in the center of my belly. This made me shake my head again for a few seconds. But when she did it another time I moved even less and the third time I only reacted but a burst of laughter: \"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere I was completely weak and defeated laughing non stop. My lungs hurt. Ms Davis made me activate my last energy reserves just to steal them from me immediately. I could now only laugh while the tears flowed from my eyes. That's when the tickling became less. It didn't stop, how I wished it would have at this point, but the raspberries she was still blowing on my belly stopped and her hands slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really amazed at you. It looks like you have no power left in you, but there is one thing that shows me that you still have some remaining energy left. And you are even provoking me the whole time with it. Maybe this is the best way to help you overcome this challenge.\" I had no idea what she was talking about. My eyes were still closed so I only felt Ms Davis standing up. I didn't even try to move at this point. Maybe I could, but she had tickled all my reserves out of me. I was still curious what she was talking about, but mostly happy for the break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teacher put her hands under the rim of my underpants my last remaining piece of clothing, lifted my butt up a little and pulled them down just like my pants in one swift motion. She threw them on my pants and sat back down on the same position as before. I had slightly recovered at this point. I was still unable to move, but I could open my eyes. Ms Davis had a friendly smile one her face. \"Don't be afraid, I still want to help you. I think you will really profit from this test.\", she told me with a warm smile. I somehow believed her. She had taken me beyond some bounds, but I knew her and exactly this friendly supportive way of her was a big reason why I had a crush on her. I felt her soft, warm hands on my belly again, but now she wasn't tickling she was just caressing it. This did almost not tickle, but felt wonderful. And made my erection grow a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back down on my erect member and whispered to it: \"You are the big energy source. Let's see how I can get his power out of you.\" Her hot breath made it twitch excitedly. \"Just look at you so big and strong. I will definitely get something out of you.\", she continued talking to my member. Ms Davis proceeded by removing her right hand from my tummy. Her left hand still caressed it and sped up a little to compensate for her right hand. She brought her smooth hand close to my penis and started to ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ms Davis started at the bottom of my balls. She let her hand glide slowly over them until reaching my penis. She encircled my penis with each of her delicate fingers once they reached it. She continue this upward motion until all her fingers were on my member and she had reached the top. From there Ms Davis moved her hand down again. She repeated this slow stroking a few times. Each time my erection grew a little until it reached full size and only twitched when she did it. \"Looks like it is now at full size. This means your remaining power is completely in here.\" Her head was so close to it that I could feel her hot breathe on my penis when she spoke. Still unable to move I let out a small moan. Ms Davis continued: \"I want to get it out of there. Let's see how long you can last.\" and began stroking me with her soft, warm hand. I felt like I was already rather close to finishing and each of my teachers slow strokes brought me even closer to an orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so focused on her stroking that I didn't really feel her left hand at this point, but this changed the second she began to knead my left side again lightly. \"haha haha aaah Stop that! hahahaha *moan*\" I was trapped between laughter and pleasure. Her tickling was light so I could focus on what she was doing with my penis, but it still distracted me. Her soft slow strokes didn't stop and I still felt like she was bringing me closer to an orgasm, but the tickling slowed the progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon my teachers right hand sped up a little stroking me faster. \"Yes\", I whispered as the pleasure increased and I became able to ignore more of the tickling. The moment Ms Davis heard me say that she also sped up her left hand tickling my sides harder than before. \"HaHaHaHa *moan* HaHaHaHaHa *moan* HaHaHaHaHaHaHa\" On a normal day the combination of her tickling and her strokes would have been the best feeling I ever had, but since she had already tickled me so much this day, I mainly wanted her to do her magic with my erection. Still the additional tickling meant that I could feel her smooth hand stroking me longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you hear me or are you already in a different world? If you are still here, relax, let yourself fall and enjoy what I'm doing with you.\" my teacher told me encouragingly. She sped up both hands again, pleasuring me a lot, but also tickling me much more. \"HAHAHAHA *Moan* HAHAHAHAHAHAHA *Moan* HAHAHAHAHAHA *Moan* HAHAHAHAHAHA *Moan* HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA *Moan* HAHAHAHAHA\"<br>\r\nI felt how I entered the other world Ms Davis had mentioned. She was so good at this. Her right hand had an excellent rhythm that made this experience just too good. She kept this up for a while. I was falling deeper and deeper into the different world she was creating for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of speeding up her hands again, my teacher actually slowed down her left hand to the light tickles from the beginning. She didn't stop tickling me completely, but her right hand continued the fast rhythmic strokes so I could mostly ignore the tickling. \"haha  *MOAN* hahaha *MOAN* yehes  *MOAN* hahahahaha *MOAN*\" She was now mainly pleasuring me and I felt how fast I got close to an orgasm. I wanted to move my body, but was still not able to do so. Instead I looked at her and saw her supportive look. \"That's right. I want you to finish now. I'm sure it has been long enough. You will now unleash everything you have. You have earned it. So please do it for me.\" My teacher gave me a wink and continued stroking me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Davis saw how my eyes rolled back once I was close. \"YES! Now give me your strength.\", my teacher said enthusiastically. She stopped her tickling completely and only caressed my body again. Her left hand on my tummy and her right hand went down to my balls. Instead of her hand she put her lips on the tip of my penis giving it a kiss. The warmth of her breath combined with the sense of her lips that were even softer than her hands felt wonderful. I moaned loudly. She kissed it a second time. This time she opened her mouth during the kiss and took my erection in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting into position she started to suck on my penis. I could only resist a second before I closed my eyes and had an orgasm. The feeling went through my whole body from my fingertips to my toes. Ms Davis continued to suck even while swallowing from time to time. While she kept sucking this fantastic tingling feeling going through my whole body continued. I was still unable to move, so I simply lay there enjoying what my teacher was doing with my body. She used her left hand to help her right hand massaging my balls never stopping the sucking. It felt like she was massaging my erect penis to widen my vas deferens to make me ejaculate more sperm. The additional stimulation worked. It actually made me shoot out every drop of cum I had inside of me which Ms Davis gladly swallowed. I actually felt how my balls emptied into her mouth until nothing was left. She intensified her massage of my balls and continued the sucking like a vacuum cleaner at this point to make sure that she didn't miss a single drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the best three minutes of my life Ms Davis finally stopped. She removed her lips from my penis and lick one final time over the tip of my penis to get the remaining cum from me. She let her hands rest on my belly leaning a little on me. I wasn't ready to open my eyes. It took me a few minutes to came back to my senses. But in the end I was able to pull myself back to reality. She was right, I had been to another world, metaphorically at least. I opened my eyes. The first thing I saw was Ms Davis pretty face smiling warmly at me as she asked: \"How do you feel?\" I didn't know what to say \"I feel great. This was amazing.\", I finally answered. \"I'm glad to hear that.\", she said and licked her lips to not miss a single drop of my juice before standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My teacher flipped me over and untied my arms. She than lay me back on my back. I had to let her do that without any muscle movement from myself. I still couldn't move and felt like I had no power left. My erection which Ms Davis wanted to use to bring out all my energy got limp with the her last lick. I thought I just needed to recover, but still got a little afraid. My teacher left the gym for a moment in the direction of the storage room where the teachers kept their stuff and had a bathroom. I couldn't see what she was doing since I was only able to move my eyes, but not my head. Laying nude and utterly helpless in the open gym made me really uneasy so I was really happy when I saw Ms Davis face again as she knelt down besides my head and looked down at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI always thought that she had a pretty face, but now it was different. Her nose had always been a bit too big for her face, but I didn't thought this anymore. Her dazzling smile had become even warmer and made my heart skip a beat. As I saw her it looked like there was light coming from her beautiful face. \"Hey sweety, I brought you something.\" With that she put a straw in my mouth and I drank some of the water she brought me. I really needed that. \"I still can't move.\", I told her. \"I know sweety, but at least your eyes and mouth work. That is enough for now.\", she told me emphatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't pass your test and have to continue with the others.\" \"HaHaHa\", she laughed melodically: \"You don't need to worry about those anymore.\" Her left hand caressed my cheek. It felt even softer than before, but I became worried. I was laying there for at least 10 minutes and was still unable to move any part of my body. So I asked her about it: \"Have you ever seen somebody this unable to move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well usually my test candidates move even less. You're the best one I had so far. Nobody else has shot out so much strength and energy. And I was still able to let you have your mouth. The others had problems with, you know, breathing. So you are my biggest success so far.\", she answered proudly. I was confused: \"What do you mean with the other test candidates, what have you done with me?\"<br>\r\n\"I think you already know that. I promised to bring out all the power in you. And I did exactly what I told you. I first tickled your day to day energy out of you. This will come back in a few days, maybe a week, so don't worry you will be able to move again. After getting all of it out of you I sucked your actual life energy out. You really did have a lot of it and it was delicious. Here take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled a mirror out she must have brought with her from the storage room and held it in front of my face. I looked into it. In the mirror was a face I had never seen. The man looked pretty similar to me, but it looked more like my father back when I was a small child. The man in the mirror looked like he was in his thirties. He already had some wrinkles and the first few gray hairs. \"No. That can't be me.\", my voice became silent while saying that. But deep down I knew it was true. Maybe her doing had a negative effect on my brain, but for some reason I was still trusting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Davis put the mirror away and continued: \"Oh it is true. you should now be around 35 I guess. As I said I was able to get a lot of strength out of you.\" My eyes started to tear. \"Don't worry, nobody will see you like this. As I mentioned you are the first man that had enough day to day energy to continue breathing after the procedure. I will keep you and in a week when you got your energy back I will relieve you of your remaining life power. At the age you are currently at you should be able to produce much more sperm. I saw how much you enjoyed my sucking. Just imagine how it will feel when I give you this wonderful feeling for a much, much longer time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, why did you do that.\", I was crying while I asked. \"Just look at me. I feel amazing. I sucked your strength out of you that means I have it now. I do this for quite some time already. It keeps me strong, beautiful and young. It also allows me to charm people around me. I might have to change my residence from time to time so nobody get suspicious at my increasing beauty and the fact that I don't become older, but my strategy of going to schools as a martial arts teacher has worked really well so far. If I had the chance I had taken all of your strength directly, but\", she put my limp penis in her incredibly soft left hand and gave it a stroke that had no effect on it. \"This thing here is useless right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she got up, lifted me over her shoulder and brought me to the storage room. She put me in a dark room on something soft and left. A few minutes later she came back turned on the lights and walked over to me. I now saw that it was the first aid room of the gym and I was laying on a bed. I hated what she did to me, but still seeing Ms Davis and her beauty I was still happy that she came back. She tied me spread eagle to the bed posts. I thought it was unnecessary tight since I was unable to move. \"I don't know exactly when you will get your day to day strength back, but I just want to make sure you can't escape now.\" I had lost all hope at this point. I didn't know what to do and so I just lay there crying and trying to come up with anything I could do which was mostly hoping for a miracle. \"I also brought you these two thinks.\" She said while putting a huge barrel of coke besides me and put a straw for me in my mouth. \"So you will not starve.\", again her warm smile made what she just said easier for me. My teacher than put a catheter in me. \"I experienced that your bladder is not so strong, so this might be useful. haha\", she said laughing at my situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you in a week.\" Ms Davis said while leaving the room and turning the lights out. \"NO! Wait! Please!\", I screamed but she didn't even look back at me. I heard the clicking sound of her key locking the door. That was it I was now trapped in darkness unable to move and some crazy life sucker wanted to rob me of my remaining life energy. All I could do was hope for help. With that thought I fell asleep until ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next days were horrible, I slept from time to time usually after screaming for so long that my throat got sore and I got tired. Nobody came. Ever. The rest of the time I spend hoping for a miracle and drinking the coke. On a normal day I like it, but since it was the only thing I could consume it became too sweat and I just wanted to eat some actual food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had lost all sense of time I slept two or three times I think. But than I noticed how parts of my strength came back. It felt like I spend two days completely unmoving, but after those I reobtained the ability to move my head. This was a big deal for me. I was so happy once I could move around a little again and get more comfortable. The main reason for my enjoyment of this small thing was that it gave me some hope. I knew I was still bound to a bed in an almost empty school waiting for my life sucking teacher who had already taken a lot of my vitality. Not to forget that she wants to take the rest once she comes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew nobody would come, but the new hope made me scream for help until I fell asleep again. The next morning or whatever I could move my body. Not fast and not really good and I still felt weaker than before Ms Davis robbed my energy, but I was able to move slowly. I tried out all my body parts and realized that the parts closest to my tummy and genitals worked best and my fingers were still very hard to move, but I could do something again. \"YEAAHH!\" it was stupid to be happy in this situation, but I was nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still thinking about moving, so I didn't hear the key in the door. Somebody threw it open while shouting: \"Who's there?\". Completely startled by the sudden action I didn't answer directly. Then everything became white, I had to close my eyes and wanted to close my ears as well, because of the loud scream I heard from the woman who entered. She must have turned on the light. After those days in darkness my senses needed to recalibrate to work again properly, but after some time they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes and saw that the woman was standing in the door with her back turned towards me, probably to not look at a nude man. My teacher didn't bother to dress me, just to strip me once she comes back. \"What is happening here, who are you, what is.......\", she rapidly asked me so many questions that I couldn't answer any of them. She seemed very irritated and scared. I felt the same. But I understood that this was my chance, I had to tell her everything, well maybe not too detailed as she might not believe the story, but at least enough to make her help me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please calm down.\" I said in the most friendly tone I could produce in this ironic situation. The woman took a few deep breaths and asked again: \"You are right. So how about you tell me your story.\" \"Could you untie me first?\" I asked in a pleading voice. \"Not until I know what's going on.\" I had no choice, but to obey her. So I started: \"Okay, this might take a moment so please sit down. It's fine.\" She hesitated a moment, but realized in the end that I couldn't do anything in my situation so she could just sit on the chair besides me to listen. When she turned around I finally recognized her. It was Lisa the charming new secretary. I knew her well as she finished school only a few years ago meaning there was a time when we both were students here. I wasn't sure whether she didn't recognize me because of the aging or because she didn't really look at me. It was still a bit strange as she was 24 and thus knew my father a few years ago when he looked really similar to my current state. Lisa was also never shy so she would normally take a look. On the other hand, I didn't recognize her red hair too, so I couldn't judge her, besides this might be better for me and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she sat down I started to explain. I didn't exactly know where to start and what to tell her. Would she believe me the truth or would it be better to just make something up. I had to decide fast so I chose to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I started by telling her who I am. She didn't believe me. \"Haha That is crazy. Have you looked at yourself? You are not somebody who just finished school.\" Of course she didn't believe me. Which sane person would have. But hearing her voice reminded me of something, so I told her: \"You brought me the letter on Monday. I didn't open the door and you said that you had to ensure somebody is home and reads it.\" She looked a bit confused that was recent and so random that nobody else would know. She finally took a closer look at me. After a few seconds she put her hands on her mouth. \"Are you really. It can't be. You are.\", she was a bit overwhelmed by the revelation, but realized it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to tell her the story. How I had taken the test for my martial arts class, how Ms Davis challenged me to a fight where she tickled me to pieces and stole my life energy. I left the part about how my teacher actually accomplished this out. Lisa listened still shocked and started to untie me when I came to the part about how my teacher wanted to come back in a week. \"Thank you so much for freeing me.\" I told her. She gave me a quick hug and told me everything is going to be okay. This was a bit too positive for me, but it still felt nice to share the burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a different problem. Ms Davis had also taken my normal strength. I was able to move my body, but it was all so slow. The beautiful redhead helped me stand up and supported me as we went upstairs where she gave me a few lost clothes I had to wear for a while, since my teacher had taken my clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreshly dressed Lisa took me to her home. \"Here in this house you are safe.\", she told me. It wasn't false, but I didn't want to be safe. I wanted my life back. After telling her my thoughts she told me: \"Sure. I get it. How about this. First we eat something and afterwards we develop a plan to get revenge. But you have to promise me that we won't start implementing this plan until tomorrow. You still move like you are 80. It's way too dangerous.\" Hearing about actual food made me realize how much I craved for something to eat and so I enthusiastically agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating we talked about what to do now. We knew Ms Davis wanted to come back to take my remaining life energy. So she had to enter the first aid room. Lisa came up with a plan to install a trap in the room to capture her. Maybe I could get my power back or at the very least stop her from robbing the lifespans of others.<br>\r\nComing up with a good trap was pretty hard. Ms Davis had a lot of strength gathered from all her victims. She was also a martial arts teacher meaning even two people would probably not have a good chance to win in a direct fight. We thought about it for a while and came to the conclusion that we had to restrain her a lot. It might also be a good idea to not set up a direct physical trap and after thinking about different solution we finally had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we had a solution Lisa prepared a guest bed for me and started to push me in it. \"You need to recover. So you will go to sleep now.\" Usually she was less strict, but she was right after all. She tucked me in like I was a child, but it worked as I fell asleep immediately. Waking up the next day I felt much stronger again. I wasn't sure whether I was at full strength again, but I could move normally except for my toes and strangely the fingertips of my left hand. My right hand worked just fine. I didn't tell Lisa about these parts and after eating breakfast we started with our plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe bought a bunch ropes, a doll and other tools for our plan and drove to my school. As a secretary Lisa had a key and could enter without any problems even on a Saturday. With our prepared gadgets we entered the first aid room where I had been capture for four days. It looked just like yesterday which meant that Ms Davis probably didn't knew that I had escaped. Our first step was to put the doll on the bed so that the teacher won't see the empty bed before entering. The next thing I did was binding a small cannon we bought to the leg of the bed. It pointed upwards and was basically in the middle of the small room. The cannon was made for shooting a net we bought. At the same time Lisa was screwing a hook in the ceiling: \"I thought man are so good at this stuff.\" I liked that she lightened the situation with her humor. \"Well man are only better at nailing.\", I replied. She giggled a bit while pulling a long rope over the hook and connecting it to a roll up machine I had tied to another leg of the bed. Finally we installed the motion detector next to the door pointing to a loop in the rope connected to the hook in the ceiling that was laying on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur trap was finished. The idea was probably more complicated than necessary, but we wanted to be completely sure. Ms Davis was supposed to open the room and make a step into it. When she did she had to put a foot into the loop activating the motion detector and thus the roll up machine. This would pull her feet first to the ceiling. Obviously she could be able to escape from there with her strength so we added the net. A second after the roll up machine finished the cannon will shoot the net to the ceiling. The net itself also has hooks to drill into the wall and stay there. Since the net is more flexible the teacher should be stuck to the ceiling in the net. We would than let the net down and restrain her a lot before removing the net. The plan was good and the components weren't cheap, so I was pretty optimistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter installing everything and locking the door again we wanted to leave. \"Wait. We can't leave the building.\", I told Lisa. \"Why not?\", she asked. I explained that Ms Davis could see me on the streets, we were really lucky last time, but now it would be better to stay. She will probably come tomorrow anyways and it is already afternoon, so we could just as good stay in her office. Lisa understood my fear and so she agreed. We went upstairs to her office and tried to sleep on her sofas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile trying to fall asleep Lisa told me: \"This can be over tomorrow. How do you feel now.\" I felt much better since she entered the room that was used to imprison me and freed me. \"It's fine, I hope that we are successful, but I think we will.\" Lisa smiled as she heard my positive attitude: \"Okay, than let's do this... tomorrow. Good night.\" \"Good night. And thank you!\" With that we fell asleep. The next day we woke up in the morning and chatted as quiet as possible, but we both mostly focused on the trap and whether Ms Davis will come or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the late afternoon the school door finally opened and we heard a pair of high heels clicking on the floor as someone walked down to the gym. I looked at Lisa, she looked back at me, we both knew who it was. We stood up from her comfortable sofas and sneaked down towards the gym. As we got close we heard some noises. First a \"WAAAAAAH!\" than a BANG and finally someone screaming curses. We got her. I was relieved, but still we had to get my life back from her so we went to the first aid room and there we found that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I entered the room and turned the lights on. \"AARGH!\" Ms Davis was above me. She was entangled in the net hanging from the ceiling. Her slender arms were caught in two separate meshes so she tried to use her legs to push herself down. She didn't succeed as the net was too large and flexible for her to do so. \"We got her.\", I said to Lisa who brought the ladder inside. I went up to her to handcuff her so we could let her down. Once I reached her I slowed down. There was a charming fragrance caressing my nostrils. My teacher had told me that she gained the ability to charm people by stealing life energy, but this was really powerful. I began to look at her more intensely. Ms Davis looked just as good as last time. Her face was still perfect and her hair shone golden. She wore a white blouse that hugged her body and a tight black skirt that accentuate her butt. It also revealed a lot of her flawless legs. My eyes wandered down her bare legs until they reached the black pair of high heels she wore. I felt like I was looking at an angel again and was caught in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! What are you waiting for.\" Lisas voice made me wake up again. I shook my head to come back to my senses. I reached for my teachers right wrist and put two pairs of handcuffs we had bought on it. This was slightly difficult since my left hand didn't work that good, but in the end I succeeded and proceeded by connecting them to her left wrist to restrain her. I hoped it was good enough. I was unable to do something about her legs since she still tried to push herself down, but with her wrists tied we were able to let her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped down the ladder before we slowly let the net down. Once Ms Davis was on the level of my eyes she tried to charm me again. She used the brightest smile she could produce and looked at me: \"Hey sweety!\", I tried to not look at her, but her voice made me do it anyways. \"Looks like you got me. I can give you a great reward for it.\" She gave me a suggestive wink. Lisa stepped in by saying: \"Okay, as a reward we want to know how to turn him back.\" Ms Davis answered: \"That's easy, just let me go, sweety. I will give it back to you.\" My brain was not working properly I noticed this, but still wanted to accept her conditions. Luckily I had Lisa who told the teacher that we are not that stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also managed to escape her charm again as I looked away from her face and breathed only throw my mouth to not smell her seducing scent. We took her still in the net to the bed and tied her ankles with the same ropes she had used on me. While doing this she kicked my right hand.\"AAAH\" It felt like she had almost broken it. This was a warning for us. We used another pair of handcuffs on each of her ankles to bind her even more to the bedposts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow came the difficult part. We had to bring her arms above her head. Thankfully we already had some handcuffs on her wrists, but her hands were infront of her. She was not able to break them and so we pulled on them and tried to wrestle her arms up. She screamed at us and used her strength to resist us, so it didn't work. Lisa had an idea I wouldn't have supported, but she hit her in the stomach to interrupt the teachers resistance. She didn't expect that and let her muscles loose for a moment. This was enough for us, as we didn't stop pulling. Her arms came above her head and we again used her rope to tie her wrists to the bed. The two pairs of handcuffs we already had on her stayed, but we added a third pair to tie her arms above her head even tighter. She was now tied in an upside down Y shape and we cut the net away as it was now only in our way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this! Let me go. This is useless anyways. But it is also annoying, so how about this: Lisa I will teach you. You can be young forever. And for you sweety, just remember how wonderful Monday was. You looked so happy when I touched you.\" she tried her charming again, but it had no effect on Lisa and I learned that I had to ensure to not smell her fragrance during this part. So I replied: \"You taught us enough. See, we figured that the first thing you did was tickling the day to day energy out of me. You are so strong that it might be best for us to do the same with you. Maybe you will be more willing to give me my life energy back afterwards.\"<br>\r\n\"That's right you taught us how mighty tickling can be.\" Lisa continued my thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe decided where to start. Lisa went down and sat on Ms Davis left ankle. She removed her left high heel and threw it to the ground. \"What a lovely color!\", she commented her glistening black nail polish. I sat down on her upper legs, rubbed my hands and brought them down to her armpits. \"I think it's time to see what we can extract from you.\" Ms Davis looked pretty emotionless, almost like she didn't care. I was pretty sure that she was not scared, but hoped that she was just good at hiding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I began at her upper arms. I let my fingertips glide slowly over her strong muscles. God her skin felt soft. I began to move my fingertips a little while drawing my fingers closer to her armpits. They were covered by her thin blouse. I tried to push her short sleeves away, but it didn't work, so I just continued. This way I could later increase the intensity of my tickling. Ms Davis looked neutral. I didn't seem like it worked, but I still liked tickling her. Besides she promised me that I could tickle her when I managed to get to the exit of the gym which I definitely did, so I had earned this. With that thought in mind I continued to spider tickle my teachers armpits. I also realized that she hadn't spoken in a while so maybe she has focus to not give in to our tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over my shoulder I saw what the secretary was doing. She didn't start slowly like I did she went straight to town and started to tickle the center of Ms Davis left foot with her long fingernails. She had her left thumb on the teachers big toe pulling it back so that her right hand could tickle the stretched out sole. Ms Davis foot <br>\r\nlooked so delicious that I became a little jealous about Lisas job. She let her fingers climb a little higher and was now tickling just below the balls of her delicate foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back at Ms Davis and saw that she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I looked at Ms Davis I saw a tiny reaction from her. I was still tickling her armpits and saw how she flexed her left biceps a little and pulled at her restraints there. It was not much, but it was something. At that moment I heard Lisa say: \"I think it is working. She started to press against my thumb.\" I replied: \"Yeah I saw it too.\" looking back at Ms Davis I continued \"We have so much time, just open up already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teacher began to talk again: \"This is not *short break* working. You will never succeed.\" \"Is that so? Then you won't mind if I try this to convince you.\" With that threat I pulled out a knife. Ms Davis face slipped from her control. She looked scared for less than a second, she probably thought that I would hurt her. I hated what she did to me, but I would never attack another human being, I ensured her as I put the knife in her left sleeve and cut it open revealing her smooth armpit. I repeated this process on her other sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be much better\", I said to her as I started spider tickling her now bare armpits. Her smooth hollows felt warm. I continued mostly in the center of them, but the position she was in with her arms stretched out above her allowed me to also tickle the outer rim of her armpits. As I picked up the tickling again Ms Davis movement resumed. I saw that she tried to pull her hands down to protect her sensitive skin. But she failed. Interestingly I found that she pulled stronger with her left arm, probably because my left hand was not at full strength and so I tickled her right side more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little movement made me feel really powerful and I continued tickling her as I looked back again to see what my friend was doing. She was no longer holding my teachers toe back and instead just used both her hands on her foot. Her left hand tickled the ball of her foot and went up to her toes from time to time while her other hand scratched mostly over the center of her delicious foot. It looked like the energy thief tried to keep her foot still to not show the effect the tickling had on her, but was failing miserably. Her feet jerked around quite a lot. When she kicked Lisas hands away, she stopped the tickling for a moment as Ms Davis brought her foot back to the starting position like nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this happened a few times the secretary used a new technique and only used her left hand for the ball and the toes, while her right hand went down to the soft heel of the gorgeous foot and started to scratch there. Because of the way she was tied Ms Davis was no longer able to kick this hand away and so my friend could continuously tickle her foot and only increase this basic sensation whenever her left hand managed to glide over the rest of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back at my teacher and saw that her expression had changed. She no longer looked like she didn't care what we were doing. Instead she pressed her teeth together to resist the tickling. My hands continued to tickle her and I saw that she still tried to bend away from my right hand. I had a big grin on my face: \"Oh looks like you are more ticklish than you thought.\" \"No ... this will notht ... work!\" she replied angrily, but I could clearly see how much she had to focus to not start giggling while saying that. I answered by taking out the knife again and started to cut from her sleeve down the sides of her blouse until I reached her white bra. Doing this on both sides revealed more of her skin and allowed me to access her entire armpits even the part next to her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I was about resume my tickling I felt how Lisa started to move. I turned around and saw how she stood up a little and sat down on Ms Davis right ankle. My teacher used the break to start another action: \"Come on sweety. It's not working and I can feel the effect I'm having on you.\" I didn't know what she was talking about until she started to move her pelvis. I had been so absorbed in tickling her that I didn't notice that my penis was half erected. She must have felt it as I was sitting on her and basically pressing it into her. \"Feels good, right? Just let me take care of it. I will do my best to make this an experience you will never forget.\" That sounded like a good deal, but Lisa stepped in again. While I looked at my teacher she had removed her right high heel. The right foot looked just as perfect as the left one. The secretary now started to apply her fingers on the other sole. Her right hand tickled the teachers heel non-stop again, but this time Lisa used her left hand to encircle Ms Davis big toe with her thumb and index finger and tickled the upper part of her foot and the sweet spots below her toes with her remaining fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! Don't get caught by her. I will do my best, but you have to help me extract the secret about how to get your life back from her.\" Lisa told me. I got a little annoyed at her interruption, but my teachers seductive movements stopped when Lisa started her new tickling method. Shaking my head again I came back to my senses again and also resumed the tickling of Ms Davis. With the last part of her armpits exposed I wanted to implemented a new pattern. My idea was to start at the center of her armpits and spider tickling my way in growing circles to the rim of this beauties smooth pits. I interrogated her again as I began: \"Tell me! I need to get my life back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Davis struggling had intensified since we had started with the new areas. Her right foot thrashed around as she was unable to get Lisas slender fingers or rather her tickling fingernails away from her foot. Her upperbody also tried to get away from my right hand even more while I intensified her tickling. Additionally I noticed that she jerked her head every once in a while. I was still on my first circle and had just finished tickling the spot between her armpits and her upper arms when I asked her about my power. I continued by finally going to the newly exposed area just besides her breasts when Ms Davis did answer me: \"Yoouuu *break* will not breahahak me!\" I started to give the new spot a good, thorough tickling just as she said that which had finally opened her. She was not screaming in laughter like I wanted. Yet. But the first giggle meant she was ticklish and that she was unable to fully control it. So we just had to continue. \"I think this works just as we expected.\" I told Lisa. \"Yeah, it might take some more time, but we will win eventually.\", she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teacher closed her eyes. It looked like she concentrated to keep the laughter inside of her. But the struggling showed that it effected her and since I found that the outer part of her armpits next to her breasts did work so well I stayed there and intensified my attack on this spot. \"ha\" Ms Davis couldn't hold it all in anymore. It worked good enough to get her to giggle from time to time. \"ha\" I wasn't sure what to do next. I could go on with her armpits as they worked good enough to put the first crack in her walls, but I could also start with her tummy, maybe this will her open her up even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back at Lisa who still tickled her foot and saw that my teacher also flexed the muscles in her right leg. The secretary had found her place so I decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We still didn't know what to do to get my life energy back from her. All I knew was what my teacher had done with me, so maybe tickling her until she laughs is sufficient to make her spit out her strength. \"haha\" It had an effect on her, but this wasn't enough. I was still tickling the exposed part of her armpits next to Ms Davis breasts. To continue I let my fingers wander down. My fingertips glided over her bra until reaching the dressed part of her amazing body. I was now at her ribs and started to squeeze them. \"hahahaha\" The moment I did my teacher let out the loudest giggle since we started tickling her. \"I got her!\", Lisa told me pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my head and saw that my friend had changed her tickling again. She held her left hand in the same position as before: encircling the teachers big toe and using three fingers to tickle under her toes. But her right hand had changed its position. It was no longer scratching over her heel, instead she had it behind her back on my teachers right knee. Lisa put all her fingers together on Ms Davis kneecap and started to slowly spread them apart. Her fingertips went all over her bare knee tickling the energy thief a lot. This always made her giggle \"hahahaha\". After spreading her fingers fully the secretary moved her fingers a little to tickle the side of the knee and rotated her hand a bit. After that the fingers started their journey to the top of the beauties ticklish knee again. They started from five different spots and glided back up until meeting at the kneecap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect this was having on my teacher was undeniable. I saw how her leg jerked each time Lisa spread her fingers. Not to mention the giggle attacks. While I looked back my own fingers never stopped kneading Ms Davis ribs, through her blouse. Or so I thought. My hands had actually wandered further down and already massaged her strong tummy. I realized that my teachers giggles were not caused by me, but instead by my friend. Clearly I had to increase my attack and so I took out the knife again. The blouse had five buttons, but Ms Davis hadn't closed the top button to show some cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started at the other end and cut off the button at the bottom. Doing so allowed me to see the upper part of her black skirt. When I put the knife under the second button Ms Davis spoke softly: \"No hahaha No ha pleahase don't.\" She sounded uneasy as her voice was corrupted by the manipulation of her body. I loved the fact that she began to sound like I did almost a week ago. I couldn't see it, but I was sure my friend was smiling as well. Lisa showed her happiness by gliding her fingers three times very fast over my teachers knee. This made her kick extra strong. Lisa was lifted up a little, but managed to fall back on the same position, while my teacher shook her head from side to side for a moment while she pressed her lips together to stop her laughter from pouring out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan the second button flew away as I cut it off. I could now see her flat tummy. It looked so soft that I wanted to touch and tickle it immediately. Ms Davis belly button was pretty deep and looked just perfect. Without wasting more time I put the knife under the third button and cut this one away like the other two. Now I could see her soft ribs, but my eyes went straight to the underside of her white lace bra I had uncovered. There was some pattern on it I couldn't quite see. I moved my head closer to my teachers breasts to get a better look. That's when I felt someone hitting my head. It was Lisa: \"Be cautious. You know what she can do to your mind. Don't cut the rest open for now.\"  Everything she said was right, but come on I just wanted to feel those perfect breasts. \"Thanks Lisa you are my life saver.\" I told her failing to not show how much her action had annoyed me. \"Always happy to keep you away from hot women.\", she answered cocky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put the knife back in my pocket and placed my hands on my teachers stomach. First I caressed it a little. Heavens did it feel it smooth. I had trouble even comprehending how good touching her skin felt. My hands were at the center of her tummy when I started to tickle her. Squeezing this part of her body made Ms Davis struggle stronger than before. Her head shook from side to side and her biceps flexed strongly. She obviously wanted to protected herself, but couldn't. \"hahahahahaha\" The intensity of her laughter had increased again. My fingers wandered from the top of her tummy to her sides. They were now at the top of her hips. Tickling there made my teacher move her pelvis strongly. This time she massaged my penis unwillingly. It was less effective than before, but I still bit my bottom lip. I could really see how much she wanted to get away from my fingertips. Her midsection was bend to the right to get away from my right hand. It was still stronger than the left one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! hahaha pleahahahase argh haha mercyhaha hahahaha\" my strong martial arts teacher had started to beg me. Only a little, but I still felt victorious already. She was not even able to keep her giggles in while pleading for mercy. This was so great, we were probably close to breaking her open. I tickled up the side of her body kneading the soft flesh. Once my fingers reached the center of her sides I decided to really dig in. Maybe this would cause the reaction I wanted to see. I pressed my fingers strongly into her flesh. \"NOHAHAHAHA HaHaHaHa HaHaHaHa\" I stopped again. Just when I pushed my fingertips into her smooth tummy and Ms Davis started to laugh I felt an electric tingling in my fingertips. \"Nice one!\" the secretary complimented me. I had the biggest smile of the day on my face and squeezed again. \"AHAHAHAHA HAHAHA STOHAHAHAPP\" Ms Davis lifted her upper body from the bed as much as the strong bonds allowed. It wasn't much, but it was a fun, for me at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to tickle her sides, but not as strong anymore. My teacher was now flexing the muscles in her tummy denying me access to this sweet spot. So I kneaded her midriff as much as I still could. My fingertips moved in a random pattern squeezing and needing. I tried to move each finger individually to make my pattern impossible to predict for Ms Davis. She had started to suppress her laughter again, but getting her this good for once had changed her. \"HaHaHaHa HaHaHaHa\" she was no longer merely giggling. As much as she tried to stop it, again and again she opened her mouth and let out a loud laugh. We were getting her there it was not an easy task, but breaking her was definitely reachable. I than...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting on Ms Davis became more and more like riding a bull. Her struggling intensified each minute we spend tickling her all over her gorgeous body. I was currently kneading her tummy and her ribs, while Lisa held her right foot in a grip tickling it continuously with her left hand. Additionally she used her right hand on my teachers knee. I was fascinated with her struggling because I wanted her to lose this ability and make her experience what she had done to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I was so focused on her movement I realized that Ms Davis was no longer retracting from my right hand. She started to move her belly more upwards to avoid both of my hands. Tickling her had absorbed my concentration so much that I hadn't even noticed my success. My left hand had regained its strength. It must have happened when I tickled the depth of her sides. This had made her laugh loud and I had this tingling in my fingertips. It must have been a tiny fraction of her day to day energy. So we were right all along. The only magic we had to use was tickling. If this is really true, and I was sure it was, I could steal all of her day to day energy. The life energy was a different topic, but I had to start somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friend moved again. She stopped her tickling and removed her hand from Ms Davis foot. Her laughter stopped even though I was still tickling her tummy and sides and going up to her smooth armpits sometimes. I was prepared for another charming attack from my teacher, but there was nothing. She was probably using all her mental strength to keep from laughing fully and was maybe also trying to not let her strength or rather my strength slip out. Lisa turned around and placed herself between Ms Davis legs. Her right one was still shaking from the treatment it had gotten from the secretary or more accurate the fingernails of her right hand. Lisa put each of her hands on one of the teachers ankles and moved them up her flawless legs. I couldn't stop staring at the situation. Seeing my beautiful friend caressing my gorgeous teachers body was highly erotic. Lisa fingertips went up Ms Davis legs until they reached her skirt. The secretary didn't stop there and let her fingers wander further up until they were under the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was tickling my teachers hip with my left hand and her ribs with my right hand when Lisa began to tickle the insides of both of Ms Davis thighs. The secretary couldn't move her hands very well, because my teachers skirt was really tight, but the result of our tickling was strong nonetheless. \"HaHaHa NO I wohan't HaHaHa give ihihinn hahahah.\" Lisa responded: \"Trust me we will break you. Nobody steals from my friends especially not their life.\", she sounded really competitive and a little sadistic while saying this. I was looking back at my teachers face and enjoyed the view while we both continued to tickle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughter worked always the same way: Time and time again my teacher opened her mouth to let her musical laughter out \"HaHaHaHa HaHaHaHa HaHaHaHa\" I enjoyed the view of her full lips quivering slightly before it happened as she tried to keep her mouth closed. She failed each time, her lips parted and I could see her white teeth. At this point I reflexively intensified her tickling a little which made Ms Davis laugh \"HaHaHaHaHa HaHaHaHa\". She was still resisting and closed her mouth as soon as she could. But I noticed that we had opened her. The deep belly tickling had created a small opening and now with each laugh I robbed some of her strength. Each period of quivering, opening of her mouth and melodic laughter made me more powerful. I also realized that she lost her ability to resist the tickling as the time my teacher laughed increased and the times when she could hold it in shortened. \"HaHaHaHaHaHaHa HaHaHaHaHaHaHa\". We were tickling her strength and with it her resistance right out of her. I was really happy about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need more space.\" Lisa complained stopping my train of thought. She meant that Ms Davis skirt really was too tight and only in the way anyways. \"Please make yourself comfortable.\" I told her grinning from ear to ear. I lifted my butt up to grant my friend access to the zipper of Ms Davis skirt. I looked down as my friend took the zipper and opened it slowly with two fingers. I found it very hot to see the schools secretary strip this gorgeous teacher. Lisa pulled the skirt down her legs as far as Ms Davis spread legs allowed. My eyes wandered to my teachers white lace panties that matched her bra. They didn't cover a lot and so I saw her hips and her muscular and well formed upper thighs. Ms Davis sportive lifestyle gave her curves that were an absolute eye candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill ogling at the exposed flesh I felt Lisa's soft hand in my right pocket. I jerked to the left away from her hand even though I didn't mind her hand. \"Keep calm. I think you should never stop having a little fun in your life.\" She told me with a smile and stroked my erection through my pants. I closed my eyes, because it reminded me of Monday. It was nothing like Ms Davis magic a week ago, but when my teacher did it, it was skin against skin and she had better access to everything. But it felt nice nonetheless. \"This feels so long and hard, must be your knife, right?\" she told me with a wink as she stopped her stroking and pulled my knife out. She quickly cut the black skirt to shreds and threw its remains on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis allowed the secretary to dug in harder and tickle more. I was currently tickling my teachers sides again. Her muscles had gotten a little weaker or I had gotten stronger, but I managed to tickle her more too. My teachers laughter came out again and she was now almost incapable of closing her mouth. I was sure the energy came out of her and her resistance collapsed slowly maybe there is something we could do to speed this process up. I was really horny at this point and touching and tickling such a perfect body had given me a rock hard erection. I had the feeling that Lisa was interested in me, so maybe she would do something about it, before we get my life energy back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I had a new idea and slipped my left index finger in my teachers bellybutton. This did wonders. She made one big jerk with her upper body. *cling* Her body had moved up with so much force that she had blasted the remaining button of off her blouse.\"BWAHAHAHA HAHAHA AHAHAHAHAHAHAH.\" It was shot against the ceiling and gave another *cling* when it fell to the floor. I felt a strong electric tingling going from my fingertips through my whole body again. This was a big part of her strength. \"AHAHAHAHAHAHA\" We had her. I had started the real extraction process to get her strength. My teacher couldn't stop her laughter, but I slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new view on Ms Davis breasts was too much for me. They were flawless. Round and firm, but at the same time they looked marshmallow soft. Her bra looked like a C-cup. I was pretty sure they had grown since last Monday. Her lace bra revealed a lot of them. Before I could think about what I was doing my head had started to move. First my nose dug in between them, but it was followed by as much of my face as I could press in. The softness was better than any imaginable pillow. I was surrounded by her warm and soft breasts. I was in heaven and began to move my head around. Being this close to my teacher also meant that I was in a cloud of her odor. It was such a seductive fragrance. I could smell her, it was like fruits, the sea and chocolate all combined in a wonderful strong combination that made me light-headed. I just wanted to stay in this happy place and breath Ms Davis aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa didn't. I felt a hand roughly grabbing the hair on the back of my head and pulling me away from heaven. I resisted a little, but the scent had turned my brain off and so I was too uncoordinated and thus pulled away. The secretary smacked me in the face to wake me up. \"I told you to be cautious.\" She smacked me again. I began to leave the state I had entered. Lisa was holding her hand over my nose to help me resist the powers of my teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friend had stopped me again. I wasn't completely back to my senses when I told her: ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was now sitting between my teachers spread legs still shaking my head to free myself from her influence after I thanked Lisa. My friend caught my face with her hands and captured my eyes with hers. \"I think that I have an idea how we can avoid her charming fragrance.\", Lisa told me, \"But I'm not sure if it will work.\" I was still looking into her eyes when I asked: \"What is it? We should try it, I was so close to giving in, this can't go on like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes wandered down my body while her head turned redder until Lisa was looking right at my crotch. \"You know if I do something with you\", she was still looking down and her head was almost as red as her hair \"then maybe it will be less urgent for you.\" I was pretty sure what she meant, but her being my friend I wanted to be absolutely sure: \"Do you mean what I think?\" \"Well, Ms Davis odor is also having an effect on me. I was able to resist it better until now, but seeing you like this I... I felt it and it ... Let's just say my brain might be a little foggy too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Davis had heard the last sentence and knew what it was about. So she said quickly: \"Come on, you know how good my technique is and her skin can't even compare to mine. I will do it for you in a way that your brain won't even be able to comprehend.\" I wanted to look at the source of this sweet voice, but Lisa was still holding my head and stopped me. \"Get it out.\", she whispered now less shy. Lisa was never a person to run from a challenge and my teacher had just said that she was better than Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just opened the button and zipper of my trousers when Lisa stopped me: \"Just lay back and relax. I will do the rest.\" With that she gently pushed me back and pulled my trousers down a little. My head fell right between Ms Davis wonderful breasts. My teachers seductive fragrance filled my nostrils again. Lisa pulled my underpants down they didn't fit me anyways and looked at my erect penis. \"Oh this is even bigger than it felt like.\" She looked very pleased while saying that. With that compliment she put her right hand on my erection. She gently encircled the base with her fingers. Ms Davis was right, her hands were not as soft as my teachers, but they still felt amazing. \"This is... don't do this on my body!\", my teacher yelled at us. Lisa ignored her and began to move her hand upwards. I didn't care either, even Ms Davis's yelling sounded good. Once Lisa had reached the top she moved her hand back down to the base finishing her first stroke. Ms Davis opened her mouth to interrupt us again, but Lisa was having none of it. She put her free left hand on my teachers right knee and started to tickle it again, just like she had while sitting on her leg. My teacher closed her mouth immediately to stop her laughter from pouring out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind had started to fade since Lisa began to stroke me. Her hand was still very slow moving up and once reaching the tip down again. I enjoyed this a lot and the soft breasts I was laying on were a nice addition. The secretary had difficulties stroking me and tickling my teacher at the same time, but managed to use her hands independently. Until she wanted to speed up the stroking a little. When she did it she unconsciously sped up her left hand too tickling Ms Davis more. I was still laying on her delicate breasts when she started to struggle a bit. It was not uncomfortable. I had already started to move around cuddling with my teacher. Her struggling only meant that she was doing the same. \"ahh mhhm *moan*\" I was having a great time at the hands of my friend and on the gorgeous body of Ms Davis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sped her hands up again. I knew that I could not hold out for long, but tried to make the feeling last as long as I could. The additional speed also meant that my teachers knee was tickled even more. \"HAHA HAHA\" some laughter escaped her mouth. Hearing this melodic laughter was like music to me. I was now rubbing a lot against my teachers flesh and the tickling made her rub back which was like pouring gas into my burning arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lay there with a huge smile on my face. The combination of my teachers seducing odor and my friends skills had turned my mind off. All I knew was that this was the best experience of my life. It felt so cozy that I never wanted to leave. But I also sensed how the needs of my body that were ignored for a full week were finally satisfied as I approached my first orgasm since Ms Davis had sucked me dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while my friend put a hand under my head and pulled me up. At this point I was willing to let her do whatever she wanted with me. Lisa was on her knees, but she wasn't sitting on them. This made her taller and so she pushed my head right between her breasts. She had opened her blouse and was not wearing a bra. This meant that she pressed my face right into her chest. I was still drunk on my teachers fragrance and not really able to understand the situation. It felt like I was still in heaven and now only on a different cloud. The secretary pushed me between her breasts as I moved my head around to snuggle with the soft surroundings of my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter bringing me into position Lisa continued to stroke me. Her soft hand was now moving rather fast up and down my erection. My moans were swallowed by the marshmallow pillows my face was buried in. My brain was flooded by the pleasure I was experiencing. This was better than heaven. With that thought in mind and a warm softness around my face I came. Waves of pleasure ran through my whole body and I started to shake slightly. My cum flew threw the air, most of it landed on the bed and a little on my teachers smooth leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary continued to stroke me, pumping more and more of my juice out of me. I was still in the orgasmic state and felt some tingling in my body. I had opened my mouth shortly after I came and I wasn't able to close it. Lisa's hand was too good and so my tongue came out. My saliva started to flow as well and so I was slobbering all over my friends wonderful breasts. She didn't seem to mind as she was still pumping some cum out of me. I still moved my head around licking all over her breasts, but my stream of cum slowed down. So did the secretaries hand. She didn't stop, but each stroke got slower and softer, she applied less pressure until her hand came to a hold. She was still holding my slightly erect penis gently, supporting its weight with her hand, but no longer stroking it. \"Good boy. This was really necessary right?\" She whispered in my ear as my penis got limp again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. My orgasm had ended and I breathed deeply. I was still snuggling with my friends warm, but now slightly wet breasts. She hugged me or rather pressed my body even more into hers and kissed me on the head. We sat there for a while. This was exactly what I needed. All the pain and fear I had felt when Ms Davis had stolen my life energy was gone. I was no longer afraid that we might fail. Cuddling with Lisa made me feel safe again. The whole action had also boosted my confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lisa finally released me I had teary eyes and ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa had a terrified expression on her face caused by my shouting. I felt a strong anger towards her. She had stopped me again and again. Why did she do that. My teacher who I had a crush on and trusted wanted to make me experience a really good time, but Lisa was standing in the way. \"Leave. Go away!\" I told her angrily. \"This is not you. Get back to your senses!\" Lisa screamed at me. Ms Davis who had recovered slightly during the break continued with her seductive voice: \"No help me, sweety. This will be best for everyone especially for you.\" I was looking back into my teachers eyes. She had completely captured me with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friend tried to cover my nose with her hand again, but I took her arm. Holding it in place with my left hand allowed me to pull the knife out of my right pocket. Lisa knew what I had in mind and tried again to stop me: \"NO! This is her power, don't set her free.\" Ignoring her warning, I cut my teachers arms loose. She didn't have all of her extreme strength anymore, but she still knew martial arts and now it was two against one. Ms Davis didn't waste time. She sat up and placed her handcuffed hands on my friends shoulder that was still held in place by me. The secretary tried to fight back by hitting Ms Davis. \"AAHHH\", Lisa screamed. I didn't see what happened, but my teacher had definitely stopped Lisa, because she collapsed in the middle of the punch and fell on me. I thought she had probably lost consciousness, because her body didn't move. Lisa was only sitting, because my body supported all of her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teacher looked me in the eyes again. Her face was very close to mine as she softly spoke: \"Come sweety, remove the handcuffs.\" I was completely charmed by her and so I took the key out of my pocket. I had a few problems with opening the handcuffs, because I wasn't able to break the eye contact, but I soon succeeded. Once both pairs were removed my teacher was free again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her soft hands gently on my cheeks and held my face. \"Stopping Lisa was the right decision sweety. Here is your reward.\", Ms Davis brought her face slowly closer to mine while she said this. I closed my eyes when I felt her hot breath on my mouth. She placed her smooth lips on mine, connecting us in a kiss. My teacher pulled her lips away, turned her head to the right and gave me another sweet kiss. Her lips made me feel a wonderful prickling sensation on my lips. She again broke the kiss to turn her head. During her tender kisses she caressed my cheeks. I moaned softly when she broke the kiss again, I had already fallen for her, but she continued the soft kisses each time strengthening her control over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while she stopped kissing me. \"That was great. I hoped you liked it as much as I did.\" Ms Davis said. I nodded enthusiastically. She continued happy about my answer: \"HiHi We can continue this or make it even better, but first you have to untie my legs and then we have to find a solution for the secretary.\" I jumped up which made Lisa fall on the bed and walked to my teachers bound feet. Standing next to the bed, I licked my lips when I saw how beautiful her feet were and touched them a lot while cutting the rope away and opening the handcuffs we had used to tie Ms Davis to the bed. My teacher continued while I freed her: \"Sweety, your friend here is pretty and she looks like she has a lot of strength.\", she sounded like she tried to come up with a plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back at her when I had untied her legs and saw that she had thrown away the remains of her blouse which meant that my teacher was only wearing her white lace bra and panties. She pulled her legs up to her and stretched a little giving me a small show of her gorgeous body. After finishing it she crept slowly and seductively over to me. Once Ms Davis reached me she got up, pulled on my shirt so that I put my knees back on the bed. From there she moved her face close to mine again and kissed me. Her hands wandered down my chest until they reached the end of it. From there my teacher put her hands under my shirt and touched my bare skin gently. I put my hands on her hips. Starting there I brushed her smooth sides and touched her firm butt. Her sweet kisses continued while we touched our bodies. Her hands were caressing my lower belly and started their journey upwards over my chest raising my shirt in the process. Her hands glided over my shoulders and from there over each of my biceps. She stopped kissing me while her hands wandered up my raised arms stripping me fondly off my shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI enjoyed every second of our time and put my hands back on Ms Davis butt and thighs. My teacher had checked how Lisa was doing and realized that she was moving a bit. She told me: \"Let's tie her down otherwise she could disturb us again.\" I wanted to continue with her, but she was right and I couldn't resist her anyways, so I said: \"Yeah, that's probably better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe each took one of Lisa's arms, pulled them over her head and handcuffed her arms to the bed. After securing her arms we also tied her legs to the lower part of the bed again with a pair of handcuffs for each leg. Now Lisa was tied to the bed. I found it quite funny that I had been tied here by my teacher and was freed by Lisa and now I had just tied down my friend with my teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Davis approached me again, we were sitting between the secretaries legs, she placed her hands on my biceps and told me: \"I already told you that your friend has a lot of strength.\", she kissed me. \"But I can't get it from her.\" *kiss* \"I need your help to extract it from her.\" She looked down on my penis that was hard like an iron bar. \"It's your decision.\" *kiss* \"You can help me with her and get a fantastic reward\" *kiss* \"or I can take you right now.\" Her hand brushed over my pants right were my urgent erection was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know what to do, but thinking was in my aroused state not an option, so I answered: ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I had no sense of time in the dark room. Screaming for help proved futile. The school was probably almost empty, so nobody heard me. I drank a lot since this was the only thing I could do besides hoping for a miracle. I also slept quite a lot since my body had to recover the energy Ms Davis had taken from me. The bed was comfortable, but I still wanted to get the ability to move back. But I wasn't able for the first four or five times I slept. I had no idea how much time passed, but when I awoke from a deep sleep I moved my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was coming back. I was very happy to move a part of my body again. \"YEAH!\" I shouted. I tried moving other parts and found that the rest was still pretty much unmoving. At least my teacher didn't lie about me getting my abilities back after some time. I drank a lot and tried to sleep again so that I could move again soon. The next time I woke up I could move my shoulders and my arms again. I could also struggle weakly with my legs. I was still not completely recovered, but the hope came back to me. I started screaming for help again. Something I hadn't done in a while because it had never worked. And still nobody came, but I didn't give up, I could almost move again. And with that I went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another long night or day I still didn't know the time. I woke up again. I felt really strong. My power had returned. I pulled on the ropes Ms Davis had tied me with. They felt very tight at first, but now that I could struggle again I realized that she actually gave me a little room. Probably to allow me to find out whether I can move again or not. I struggled a bit, but realized that she had tied them too good and I wouldn't be able free myself. So even with my strength back there was no escape for me and I could only struggle. I fell back asleep again as my energy had gotten back, but I was still in this room and unable to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed. The next interesting thing that happened was when Ms Davis came back. She opened the door and turned on the light while locking the room from the inside. I woke up and realized that the week was over. Lifting my face up I looked at her and saw again how beautiful she was. She wore a white blouse accentuating her figure, a tight black skirt and matching high heels. I felt really betrayed by her, but was still unable to get over the the crush I still had on her. \"Good morning sweety!\", she greeted me with her usual warm smile. She stood next to me, removed the catheter and petted my balls. \"Wow! It's huge. Looks like this thing is ready to be milked again.\" She said happily. I felt lucky that she would compliment me like that, but I still didn't want this. \"Please let me go.\" I pleaded. \"I don't think so, this will be so wonderful for both of us. I can't let you miss the feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to struggle, because I always had hope that she might have mercy in the end, but she didn't and this truth had now finally gotten through to me. \"Ah! You can move again. That means your day to day energy is back as well. Honestly, I don't have to take this from you before I suck the life energy out of you. It is not much energy after all, especially compared to the life energy I will get from this thing here,\" she said while still caressing my balls \"but the last time has been so much fun, that I will do it another time with you.\" I felt weak already. I was in a spread eagle position. My arms above my head, and my feet separated. I wouldn't be able to resist her tickling, especially when it started to rob me of my strength again. \"NO! Please don't do this.\" I tried one last time, but it was pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teacher took the straw out of my mouth, leaned over me and put the soft fingertips of her left hand on my right arm. She slowly spider tickled her way down my arm and into my armpit mirroring the motion with her right hand on my left side. I clenched my teeth and fists together to resist the tickling. Ms Davis stayed in my armpit with her fingers as they got faster. \"Oh looks like you are also ticklish here. Why do you try to hold it in?\", she teased me. I definitely made strange faces, but I was able to protect myself from the tickling. At least until my teacher sped her fingers up again and pressed them deeper into my armpits. \"ha.....no!.....ha.....ha\" I started with the smallest of giggles. \"That's right sweety. Open the gates for me, let it out, laugh.\" Her scratching at my pits continued as my resistance crumbled. \"ha...ha...Hahaha\" I started to giggle more heavy, but wasn't really laughing. My armpits were never really ticklish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy bad luck was that Ms Davis noticed this and stopped her tickling. \"This is not working as good as I remember.\", she said while walking towards the end of the bed. She let her fingers glide over my body until she reached my feet and knelt down in front of them. I tried to get my feet away from her, but the way I was tied didn't gave me enough room to do so. My teacher reached for my right foot and began to tickle it. From her last session she already knew my weak spots, but she still started at the heel. \"hahahahaha NOhahaha!\" her tickling was highly effective as her soft fingers made me laugh for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Davis continued by scratching with her hand at the center of my foot. \"I don't want the other one to feel rejected\", she said and reached with her left hand for my right foot. She tickled both of them at the same time concentrating on the balls of my feet. \"HAHAHaHaHaHaHaHa STOP HaHaHaHaHaHa\" I didn't want to laugh, but her fingers didn't give me a chance. \"That's good. Let it out. You know laughter is healthy for you.\", my teacher responded. I already felt how I was losing strength mostly in my toes, but moving them became more difficult and slower. Ms Davis didn't notice this and just continued to tickle my strength out of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember some spots that worked really good last time. Shall we test them again sweety?\", with that her fingers slid further up until reaching my toes. Her fingers began tickling under my motionless toes. \"Looks like you are losing your energy much faster this time. That's an interesting finding. I have never done this twice to somebody before, so let's see how fast it can go.\" Since I had already lost the ability to move my toes her fingers could access my weak spots easily. \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA NOHOHO HAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA STOHOHOHAHAHAHAHAPPPP AHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" I couldn't stand it. The energy that had taken me almost a week to build up again was stolen from me in a few minutes. \"HAHAHA NOHOHAHAHAHAHAHA\" I could not longer move my feet and my legs became weaker as well. My head and my arms on the other end of my body struggled and twitched the whole time. My teacher simply continued to tickle under my toes. Why did I have a weak spot there. After a few more seconds I could no longer move my lower body. She had robbed all the energy from them. She continued to tickle my toes for a moment before stating: \"Looks like your legs have become useless again. That was really much faster than last time. How about you give me the rest too.\", Ms Davis said while stopping the tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid out of her heels to get more comfortable as she climbed on the bed. Her eyes told me what she was going to do next. \"NO! Don't come closer! STAY AWAY FROM MY BELLY!\" I shouted. She didn't follow my order. Instead she went further up until she knelt between my legs. My penis was a little erected already. She caressed it again: \"This thing here says it wants me to continue, so I will.\" She moved her warm soft hands over my upper legs and hips until she reached my tummy again. Without wasting time she implemented her favorite technique again. She squeezed my sides with her hands. \"HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" It worked so well. All resistance I might had was overcome by this simple action in an instant. She proceeded by kneading my sides up to my ribs and down again. Never changing this general pattern and tickling all the time. Her hands had become even softer than last time, but tickled just as much. It worked almost too good, as I felt the control over my fingertips fading. She had taken this energy in a matter of seconds. My arms followed soon as she used the best technique to tickle my body non stop. My eyes started to tear again. \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH MEHEHEHAHAHARCY HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAH\"  \"YES! That's the reaction I wanted to see from you.\" I laughed like crazy as the shaking of my head slowed and came to a hold. I was now reduced to a motionless piece of flesh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I got most of it out already. The second application works definitely much faster, this is great knowledge.\", she said with a smile. \"But you had a few reserves last time that I also want from you.\" She robbed this last drop of my day to day energy by inhaling deeply and blowing a long, wet raspberry right in the center of my stomach. \"AAAAHHH!!! HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! HAHAHAAHAHAHAH!!!! HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!\" This activated my reserves. My whole body struggled and shook again. \"There it is, now give it to me.\", she said took another deep breath and blew the next raspberry on the center of my belly. I moved until it finally stopped after like 10 seconds. Her raspberry continued a few more seconds before she removed her lips from my belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next step was to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That should be all you have.\" Ms Davis said while stopping her tickling of my belly. I took deep breaths to recover a little. \"Now for the main part.\" She pulled me down as much as the bounds on my arms allowed. Unable to move a muscle I didn't resist her. With my arms stretched out fully my legs had more space which my teacher used to spread them as much as the bounds allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will love this.\", she ensured me with a smile. My penis had grown during the aging caused by the first time she took my life energy from me. Her tickling was stimulating for me, but I didn't have a full erection yet. Whispering to my genitals she said: \"You don't have to wait anymore. I will only play with you from now on.\" Ms Davis started just like last time. She placed her left hand on my stomach caressing it gently. Her right hand started at the bottom of my balls. Stealing my power had made her fingers even softer than before, it felt like they were not from this world. She began to move her warm right hand upwards stroking my penis the first time. She than slid her hand back down again. My penis seemed to really like her attention as it jumped and grew a little. \"Stop this!\" I told her. \"I don't listen to you. I only care on what this wonderful source of energy between your legs has to tell me.\", she responded in a friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she continued stroking me. Each pump of her hand made it grow a little. I would have loved this if I hadn't known what I might lose. But I was too weak I couldn't move and I could also not resist her pleasuring touch. After a few more strokes I had a full erection. Ms Davis continued her slow gentle strokes, but it only made my penis jump and twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is so excited.\", she said amused. \"Come my friend let's have some fun.\" I tried to oppose her: \"No! Get your hands of...\" My teacher interrupted me by tickling my tummy with her left hand. \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA NOHOHAHAHATTTT HAHAHAHAHAHAHA AGAHAHIHIHINNNN\" The tickling stopped my protest. \"Now we can play in peace.\" she whispered and sped up her right hand. The tickling overwhelmed me. I was no longer able to protest. It also took my attention away from her right hand. What she did with my erection felt really good, but the tickling overshadowed it. Ms Davis continued to increase the speed of her right hand until I moaned in between my laughter. At this rate she was bringing me very slowly, but without resistance closer to an orgasm. My teacher kept this up for a while, but she also wanted my life energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowed down her left hand again to speed up the process. I was still laughing, but it became bearable and I was now mostly moaning. This also meant my protest resumed: \"hahaha Please *moan* STOP!! hahahahaha\" \"Sweety we already talked about it. This is the best for you, just relax and enjoy what I'm doing to your body. It will feel incredible if you just accept it.\", she responded with that as she put her left hand on my erection and started stroking me with both her hands. \"See! I'm doing all I can for your pleasure, so please, just let it happen.\" The feeling of both her hands was fantastic. I moaned loudly when she started it. My body was beaten. Without any physical strength, it was fully controlled by my teacher and she guided it directly to an orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I mustn't!\" feeling my life being at stake here I tried to not give in to her stroking. Ms Davis simply continued to use her unbelievably soft hands to pleasure me. \"Alright you decided to continue fighting. Good for you.\", she complimented. Why was she so supportive I asked myself. \"I like a little challenge.\", she continued. \"We'll see if you can resist this.\" My teacher adjusted her position. She pulled her legs out from under her and sat on her butt between my legs. Her feet were now in front of her. She extended her legs and brought them over my face never stopping her fast stroking with her hands. They looked amazing, smooth and creamy. Her toes were long and slender. I saw that she was still wearing the black nail polish when she wiggled her toes. Enjoying the view weakened my resistance to her which brought me much closer to finishing. I didn't want this, but her feet looked too delicious to not look at them. \"Please, try them.\", Ms Davis said while touching my lips with her toes. When I didn't open my eyes a quick poke in my tummy from her left hand allowed her to put her right big toe in my mouth. I had never tasted something as delicious as her toe before. It was sweet and a little salty, but also incredibly soft. My penis twitched strongly. My teacher took her right big toe out of my mouth and offered me her left one. I started licking it immediately. \"Looks like that was it with your resistance.\" she commented my reaction. The toe tasted just as good as the other one she had given me. I no longer opposed her actions. Her feet had convinced me. I just wanted to give in to this world of please she was creating for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Davis knew my body from last time so when she saw my eyes rolling back she knew I was very close. she quickly pulled her feet out of my mouth and lay down between my legs leaning on her elbows. She softly put her hands on my balls and gave my penis a kiss. From there she opened her mouth, guided my penis into her mouth and began her glorious sucking. At this point I didn't want to resist as her warm, soft hands started to massage my balls again it simply felt too good.<br>\r\nWith this my last wall finally collapsed and I opened up to her. My cum began shooting out of me as I had an orgasm. Starting from my penis an amazing tingling started to spread through my whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy cum flew directly into Ms Davis mouth who started to greedily swallow it. \"AAAHHH!\" I screamed in ecstasy as I came. My teacher had a little trouble swallowing everything I was erupting, but she was very pleased with it. After a whole minute my first burst slowed down. That's when Ms Davis actually started her magic. She clearly wanted all my life energy, so she used her tongue to gently lick the underside of my erection. This opened me up again a little which allowed her to suck more of my juices out of me. The wonderful feeling in my body continued. The tingling was in my fingertips and in my toes. I thought they twitched a little even though I couldn't move at all, but it didn't bother me anymore. I simply enjoyed my teachers skills as she robbed me of my energy. \"AAAAHHHH!!\" I screamed in pleasure again when she intensified the massage of my balls. She was right after all. Experiencing this was well worth everything it might cost me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Davis sucked and sucked, my juices kept flowing out of me which meant I could stay in this state of ecstasy. The reason for this was her massage of my balls which opened and widened the channels in my body. This allowed her to suck every single drop of cum out of me, swallowing it loudly. Sucking the life out of me would have been a painful process, but her soothing mouth compensated for that. While she sucked the life energy out of my erection the electric feeling continued streaming through me. Even after taking so much from me already it didn't got less wonderful. If anything it became better. From time to time a strong wave of tingling went through my body intensifying the pleasure during this burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did go on for a bit longer. Ms Davis sucking skills were simply amazing. She probably was only able to keep the pressure going because of the strength she had taken from other people. After some time the tingling started to fade. I was not able to comprehend anything that happened at this point and it still felt good, it was just less. Instead I felt warmth in my stomach. This felt nice, but was nothing compared to the previous sensation. My balls were now less than half as big as they were when she started. My teacher had gotten most of the life energy out of me at this point and started sucking stronger to also get the remaining bit. The tingling got weaker and the warmth in my stomach became less as my body handed it over. The juice my teacher lusted after was hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy balls were completely dry. I was empty at this point. She removed her lips from my penis and licked the tip of my penis just like last time, to get even the last drop from me. Ms Davis had taken everything I had from me. She knelt down between my legs, licked her lips and smiled down at me again. I looked at her and couldn't believe my eyes. She was so gorgeous. Everything about her face was perfect. And not only that, her golden hair shone brightly making her face look like a painting of an angel with a golden frame. \"You clearly were the best I ever had.\" She told me. Even her voice had improved even further. Luckily for me she continued with her warm, soothing voice: \"I told you that you would benefit from this test.\", Her voice was as calming as it was charming. \"You still had 70 delicious years in you. I'd thank you for them, but it think you can count the sensation I gave you as a thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept looking with her warm smile that looked more friendly than ever at me and I starred back at this beauty until I started to age again. My hair became gray and fell out. My body got wrinkles and shrunk. I was still smiling from the fantastic feeling of her procedure as my skin got gray and my body turned to ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Davis stood up, put her shoes back on and said to herself: \"He really was the best man I ever encountered. I finally managed to perfect the procedure thanks to him. I can't wait for the next fighter willing to do the extra points test.\" With that she left the room. She met the janitor on her way out who saw the dirt on the bed, but she simply walked up to him, put a hand on his biceps and said sweetly: \"A strong man like you can handle this right.\" The man, completely charmed by her beauty, just smiled and told her that he will simply through it in the garbage. \"Thank you\", she answered, gave him a wink and left the school.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I should think about my past mistakes. Is there a better way to do this than doing history I thought to myself and went up to the third floor where the history room was. I pressed the door handle down and wanted to open the door. It didn't work good the door wasn't locked it rather felt like the old door was stuck, so I pushed stronger. \"AAH!\", I heard somebody inside the room scream, before a loud BANG sound echoed through the floor. Not that anybody beside me was there who could hear that. I thought that something had happened and ran to the second door of the room while hearing the sound of falling books in the room. This door wasn't stuck, so I entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe right side of the room was strange there was only a path to the mostly empty left part, otherwise there was a large black tarpaulin covering a huge pile of stuff, I followed the path to the left side.<br>\r\nThere it became obvious to me what had happened. Ms Green my history teacher was buried under a bookshelf. She must have moved it a little, just enough that it was in front of the door and I knocked it over with the door. The books were all over the room and my teacher was covered by them. I walked over and saw her feet sticking out at one side. The bottom of the shelf was trapping her ankles. She was wearing black flat shoes with a cute ribbon that showed the tops of her petite, white feet. I liked that she wore these shoes so often, because they were slightly too big for her feet, so sometimes during class she dangled them a bit which was always a great show for me and made me curious if she happened to be ticklish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now wasn't the time to admire her feet I had to help her. Once I reached the other side of the book pile, I started to remove the books to uncover her face. There were so many and they were so big and heavy that I couldn't move many at the same time, but after two minutes I had found a strand of her hazel brown hair. I followed its path and reached a slightly moving part of the pile which I was finally able to free her face. The 28 year old woman looked as good as ever. Being buried under books didn't harm her as it seemed. Her smooth white skin didn't have any scratches or marks, her lips seemed a bit more full and red then normal, but that was probably just my imagination. My eyes wandered over her upside down face, as I was standing over her until meeting her eyes. I looked into her big green eyes with the gorgeous long lashes. After a few seconds I said \"Hi, Ms Green, I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?\" \"Good morning mister. No, I think I'm fine. Looks like you got me into a pretty bad situation. I can't really move.\" she answered. Relieved that she was okay I answered \"I will free you from your captivity, just like the knights in medieval times.\" She giggled at my joke and answered: \"That's nice of you, could you start with my midriff, There is a book there pressing into my stomach that is very unpleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Ms Green.\" I said while starting to remove the books at her midriff. After I had taken a few of them away, she told me: \"Oh that was it, thanks that was a little painful, now it is much better, almost comfortable. Oh by the way, I forgot to ask, why are you here?\" \"I need to take the extra point test to pass your course.\" I answered. \"Wait, you were a little distracted in my courses, but you did fine in general that doesn't make sense, I wouldn't have let you fail.\" A smile appeared on my face, that means one test is already done. My teacher continued: \"On the other hand am I only in this situation, because you didn't took any care when opening the door, and part of my job is to teach my students manners, so I will only let you pass if you help me with a little research I wanted to do. After you have freed me obviously.\" An evil grin was on her face. I was still removing the books and thought about my answer. Blackmailing me in her helpless state was probably not a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Green was still buried under the bookshelf, but I had exposed most of her body by now. She was wearing a light blue T-shirt and a long darker blue skirt. This looked really good on her especially since I knew that she always wore little pearl earrings matching this outfit perfectly. The shelf was smaller than she was and trapped her just the right way. The top of the shelf was laying just below her collarbone, the bottom was trapping her ankles and the sides rested on her underarms keeping them in place. There were still a few books on her arms decreasing her movement options even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally had a good answer and so I told her in the meanest tone I could muster: \"Are you sure you won't right me a pass-letter?\" \"Don't worry, it's a really fun task, I'm sure you will enjoy it. And don't forget you are my knight, you can't leave the princess in captivity.\" I looked at her face and saw her giving me a wink. Now I was sure she was alright, because she was always fun-loving and had made numerous jokes in class. \"Well my princess, you are right I have to do something about your situation, but the tradition is that I get a reward for helping you and it seems like you only want to give me an additional task, so why should I help you?\" My teacher giggled when I called her princes and proceeded: \"It's not really a task it's just something I always wanted to do with somebody, it's more an experiment, but I don't like to use this word in the context of history, because it always sounds so dangerous, so let's call it research. Don't worry it will quickly be done once you freed me and then you will have passed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about it. I could do what she wants and I feel a bit obliged to do so as I put her in this situation on the other hand I always wondered whether she was ticklish and now was the best opportunity I will ever get to find it out. While taking a short break from removing the books, I thought about it and decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I removed the last books and lifted the bookshelf a little to allow Ms Green to pull herself out of her captivity. \"Thank you so much my knight.\" she said while making an elegant curtsy. She sat down on a chair, sorted her hair and rubbed her wrists. I asked her: \"I have freed you now, you don't need me for anything else, so can you give me the pass-letter?\" \"Not so fast. As I said I want to do a little research with you. The thing is I want to improve my teaching for the next year and in order to do so I bought some new books and material. It got delivered that's the reason for all this stuff over there\", she pointed at the tarpaulin \"in order to make space for it I wanted to get the shelf out of the way and you know the rest of the story.\" Ms Green sighed. \"Sorry I need to recover a little, could you disassemble the bookshelf so we can bring it to the janitor, I want to look through the stuff. If you do this for me I will write you the letter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer task was doable, I agreed and went to the shelf. It was an easy system that didn't even require tools. While I was taking it apart, Ms Green had taken a large black book out and read concentrated. She sat with her legs crossed over each other. I saw that her shoes were dangling from her feet again and she switched her feet every now and then. I had disassembled half of the shelf, while glancing at my teacher over and over. She had a knowing smile on her face. I was working really slow, but I couldn't help but look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was finally done needing three times as long as necessary, I walked over to my teacher. She was still reading in the large old-looking book. When she placed it on the table I took a look and saw that it didn't contain signs of a language I knew. It was probably some ancient stuff I couldn't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done if you give me the letter, then I will bring the shelf to the janitor so it's out of the way.\" \"Thank you, I have the letter here, but before I hand it over to you, I will ask you one last time: Are you sure you don't want to participate in the research. It is really interesting, I have this book here, I know it looks like gibberish, but I can read it and it's medieval ritual for entertainment and relaxation. I want to try it out and I'm sure it will be fun, just think about it most people back then had shitty lives so they needed big entertainment to compensate for the hard times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still sure that I wanted to go, but hearing a few more words is probably interesting. So I listened to her explanation. \"There are numerous techniques. You don't have to do much I will do all the work and spoil you.\" This actually sounded quite nice, but I had other tests. Ms Green realized that I was at least slightly interested, so she continued: \"It's just a relaxation technique. Also there are even a few involving tickling.\" She poked me in the side when she said that. I jumped away from her fingers and answered: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"</span></div></div>",

She looked happily at me: \"Thanks I will make it as good as I can.\" My teacher pulled on the black material revealing many books and a chair I knew from the internet. It was a bondage chair often used for tickling people. It has two long planks for the arms and two for the legs which allow the victim to be tied and tickled everywhere. This one however had no ropes are anything to tie people with. The rest of the material was mostly books and a few unopened boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was looking through the stuff Ms Green had gotten a small vessel and a fine brush that was used for drawing small things. \"Is this for tickling?\", I asked her getting slightly excited. \"You will see, no spoilers from me. Please give me your wrists.\" I did as I was told. My teacher painted a symbol that looked like two chained thin rings on my left wrist. It tickled slightly, but not enough that I would react to it. The vessel contained a green paint that was exactly the same color as the teacher's eyes. She drew the same sign on my right wrist and took a step back: \"This is the beginning of the ritual. Tali!\" I didn't understand the word, but the second the word had left her lips I felt a force pulling my wrists towards the chair. The green color glew a bit as I moved backwards until my wrists were stretched on the planks for the arms. I tried to move away, but I was unable to pull my wrists away from the device. The rest of my body was free, but I was still bound to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Green walked to the door, painted something on it and whispered something. \"Hey, what are you doing? What is this.\" \"Don't worry, I just make sure nobody interrupts this, the ritual won't work otherwise. You don't have to be afraid, you were just so hesitant that I don't want you to change your mind.\" She repeated what she had done with the first door with the other one and the window, always painting a symbol and then whispering something. I found it strange that the paint disappeared shortly after being applied. My wrists didn't show anything anymore either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teacher walked over to me. I was a bit afraid, because I didn't understand what happened. I was sure that I didn't want her to draw more signs on my body, so I kicked in her direction. \"Oh, have you forgotten that you are the knight. You are not supposed to hurt the princess.\" I was not willing to trust her for now, so she walked past me. The device didn't allow me to see what she was doing and with my wrists bound my movement option were very limited. So I couldn't put up a fight when Ms Green took my right leg and drew the rings on the back of it. \"Tali\" she whispered again. My leg flew upwards and placed itself on the chair. I was so concentrated on it that I did not think about Ms Green, so when I heard another \"Tali\" I was surprised when my left leg placed itself on the plank holding me in place. I was now bound to the chair and couldn't escape. The little movements I could make were mostly meaningless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to know what was going on, but my teacher hadn't given me any useful information so far, asking her felt useless to me. She walked back in my view and looked friendly at me. \"We have already learned a lot. This magic paint actually works. And you are nice enough to the ritual with me, so we will see how more of the magic works. Isn't history fascinating.\" She sounded excited and nothing else, but I still wanted to go: \"Please let me go, you have seen that it works, can't you let me go now?\" She laughed at my question: \"hahaha Letting you go? Now? No I won't do that I have to finish the ritual with you, but don't worry it will be interesting for both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Green was standing between my legs and drew a different sign on my T-shirt it was a lign that used less and less paint. \"Ilang\" after she said this word my shirt became wet, no it wasn't wet it became transparent and disappeared. I was no longer wearing a shirt. \"Uh you have the body of a strong knight I like that.\", my teacher complimented me. I felt my left biceps being pulled against the plank more than before. There were still the last remains of the vanishing green shine on them. My teacher had used her bounding spell on my biceps too. The same happened on my right arm. I was so helpless now. My arms were completely immobile and my legs were almost as useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a good starting point, let's see what else this brush can do. She dunked the brush in the vessel again and brought the brush to my right armpit. I couldn't move my arm, so this part of my body was helpless. She drew something inside of it. Covering almost the whole area. \"ha ha ha\" The brush tickled me while she painted. I couldn't make out what she was painting, but it was more complex than the other symbols. Once she was done she brought her lips too my right ear and whispered \"Gatelen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw a green shine in my armpit, before a strong tickling sensation exploded in my armpit. \"HaHaHaHaHaHaHa What! How? HaHaHa NO! HaHaHaHaH\" It tickled a lot and my armpits weren't even that ticklish and it was just one of them. \"It works. It really works. I wasn't sure, but this magic works exactly as described.\" my teacher happily said. I looked at her and she was dipping the brush into the vessel again already. \"NO! HaHaHaHa STOP!\" I tried to stop her, but she was already painting something in my left armpit. It was a different symbol I thought, but the tickling decreased my ability to make that out, I just wanted her to take the brush away. She soon did so and came close to my left ear. I was shaking my head, because I couldn't bring out the word \"no\" again, but she ignored that and whispered again: \"Gatelen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tickling sensation started in my left armpit just as in my right one. I had closed my eyes, so I didn't see the green light this time, but I was sure the same thing had happened. My laughter increased as both my armpits were ruthlessly tickled by the spell. \"HAHaHAHaHAHaHAHaHAHa\" It was a lot of tickling I didn't even know why Ms Green was doing this to me, but it tickled and tickled. Ms Green was looking in her book again before saying to herself: \"They are correct this is a difference. And that is true as well. The ritual needs more preparation.\" She walked back over to me, put a hand on my cheek to hold my face still and kissed me on the forehead, before painting something on it. Then she said: \"Bebener\" I was still laughing, when she asked: \"Which part of your body is more ticklish your upper body or your feet?\" My laughter stopped the second she asked this question. But I still felt the tickling in my armpits. I breathed through my nose, but my mouth opened. I tried to stop myself from answering, but was forced to respond truthfully. So I said: \"...\"</span></div></div>",

My laughter continued after I had given her the answer: \"HAHaHAHaHAHa\" She moved around me and the tickling stopped. Relieved my body collapsed. I let my head hang down and would have fallen to the ground if my arms weren't attached to the chair. I closed my eyes to shut out everything for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teacher stood between my legs again and spoke: \"Isn't this wonderful. I told you it is very entertaining.\" I liked being tickled, but this was too much. \"Please. I can't take it.\" I was almost whispering. \"Oh, you are a knight, I'm sure you are strong otherwise I wouldn't do this with you.\" She dunked her brush in the vessel again and started to paint on my exposed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brush started just below my left armpit. She let it glide over my ribs on this side drawing some sign on me. I struggled a bit, but I could almost not move and she was good enough at painting that she could compensate for my movements. After my left ribs were covered with symbols, Ms Green traced my left side. The brush tickled much more there, so she put a hand on my stomach pressing me against the chair to hold me still. The brush went up and down, left and right on my left side until everything besides some free space around my belly button was covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shivered when she dunked her brush again. \"Now to the other side, shall we?\" I lifted my head to look at her face. She flashed me an encouraging smile and started to apply the paint on my right side. The brush followed the shape of my ribs when she painted all over them. After drawing her symbols on them, she continued on my side and created the marks on my stomach. I watched the symbols and thought that it looked good even though I knew this will be terrible for me. My teacher stood in front of me and looked like she was going to say the word again, but I looked up and interrupted her: \"Don't do this.\" I had become a bit louder again. My body had slightly recovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right, I should check the book again, this is more complex so we want it to work, right?\" I tried to hide my fear, but probably failed. Ms Green went to the table and read something. After a moment her eyes lit up and she came back. \"You were right I can already use the next sign if you can already speak again, so I will do this.\" She immediately dunked her brush and painted over the empty area on my belly. Her brush even went into my belly button. I wanted to speak, but this part of my body was so ticklish that I had to focus on not laughing. After drawing symbols on my belly, she finished painting my body by circling my nipples with the brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Green placed her left hand under my chin, lifted my head up and looked me in the eyes before speaking: \"I always liked you. Your admiration for me always gave me a warm feeling and I sense that you are strong.\", she drew something on my lips while speaking \"This will be hard for you, so let me give you a good-luck kiss. Tutuk.\" The symbol on my lips glew and I offered her my lips which my teacher used to kiss me passionately. The kiss felt wonderful. I forgot the fear and the tickling for a moment when she pushed her tongue in my mouth to play inside of me. Ms Green slowly moved her head away and ended the kiss. As soon as her lips had left mine she whispered in my face: \"Gatelen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy whole upper body glew before it felt like it was on fire. There was a tickling sensation on my ribs and belly. The tickling in my armpits had resumed as well. My sides tickled and the nerves in my belly button did too. Every nerve ending in my upper body was sending the same message: \"You are getting tickled. A lot!\"<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" I laughed long and hard, this was too much. My body produced many beads of sweat  which rolled down my body. I was sure I would lose my mind when this goes on. My eyes started to tear. This was just unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething soft stroked my cheek. Ms Green used a towel to brush away the sweat on my face. She gently dusted the tears from my eyes as she said: \"Laugh for me my knight.\" Before she painted a sign on my forehead again. \"I need more information from you to find out how strong my spells are. This will allow me to optimize the ritual for the two of us. Bebener.\" I remembered this word and didn't want to tell her another of my secrets. My teacher continued: \"This time, I'm not gonna extract one of your secrets out of you, I will do so later again. For now I want to know: How does it feel? Describe the sensations you are experiencing.\" I stopped laughing which was a very much needed break for my diaphragm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my tongue loosening and gave her an honest answer: \"It feels like numerous tickle stimulation happening to me simultaneously: My sides and ribs are kneaded strongly, brushed gently and everything in between.\" Ms Green brushed the towel over my upper body as I spoke to wipe my sweat aways. \"In my armpits I have the same feeling. There is a flurry of fingers tickling every piece of them some with long fingernails and some with soft fingertips, while brushes trace all over them.\" The towel wandered over my belly and into my armpits as I continued: \"At the same time it feels like tongues licking all over my body, exploring every piece of me. My belly is horrible, there are lips blowing raspberries on me continuously without a break. I feel like I'm about to die. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" Once I had finished my answer the laughter resumed to pour out of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, this is what I was hoping for. My spells work really good, but according to my book there is still room for improvement.\" Ms Green had finished collecting the sweat from me and walk back over to her book to check how she should continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe assured herself that she had to ...</span></div></div>",

Please give me a break.\" I spoke as fast as I could even before starting to get air back in my lungs, because I feared that Ms Green might continue my torture too soon again. After saying this my body collapsed. My head hung down and I bent forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teacher took her place in front of me and stroked my face with the towel again. She brushed the tears, sweat and the two drops of slobber I wasn't able too hold inside my mouth of me. The towel wandered down my neck and over my upper body again, before she placed it on my right thigh. \"This is the best entertainment I ever had. I'm pampering you good, don't I?\" I didn't want to answer her question, every answer I could give her would result in her tickling me more. And no answer probably had the same effect, so I focused on recovering my tired body. \"Here drink this. Don't worry it's just water. I don't want a dehydrated knight.\" I drank some of the water she was giving me, in fact I gulped down everything in the glass, because I needed this so much. \"Good boy\", she praised me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Green turned around and shifted her attention on my feet. She grabbed the right one and pulled on the laces to open my sneaker. I jerked my foot a little, but she easily stripped them of me revealing my black sock. My foot felt cold, because I had sweated so much. She was already opening the laces on my left shoe and pulled it of to uncover my other sock. \"They look a little wet, I know what I will do to free you from this unnecessary protection.\", she said while grabbing brush and vessel. She pulled a thin line on my each of my socks and smiled at me when she said: \"Ilang\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy socks started to vanish and disappeared giving her access to my unprotected feet. \"I know that they are less ticklish than your upper body, you told me yourself, remember. But this additional stimulation will help us with the ritual anyways, so this is good for us.\" I jerked my feet, when she dunked the brush in the vessel. She brought the brush close to my left foot and stopped: \"Oh, I almost forgot, I need to collect something before I continue to spoil you.\" Ms Green took the towel, knelt down and thoroughly dusted the sweat of my feet. She even went in between my toes which tickled a little, but compared to what I had experienced it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to move my left foot away, but I couldn't escape the cool paint. My teacher smeared a large amount on it and painted many symbols. The brush tickled quite a lot on my sole, not so much on the tops of my foot and I started to giggle. This was the tickling I enjoyed, not the demonic, destroying sort, but rather a gentle, soft tickling. \"Do you like this?\" she asked me. I nodded hesitantly. \"I knew that you are really ticklish, I saw you begging one of your female friends when she tickled you once. That's why I wanted you for this research.\" She had finished painting my foot except for the toes. Ms Green drew a symbol on each of my toes which were more sensitive, so I giggled harder \"hahahaha\", while she continued: \"You know this little tickling is not enough. I'm collecting your sweat, because I need to tickle a lot of it out of you for the ritual.\" My left foot was now fully covered with the signs and so my teacher grabbed my right foot. I shivered again when she soaked the brush with the green paint again. This time she started on my toes mirroring the symbols on my other foot. \"Tears and saliva that get tickled out of a person work even better, but you don't produce enough of them, yet. That's why I have to add your feet. You just need to be tickled even more.\" The top of my right foot was covered as was the center. Ms Green finished painting me by drawing the last symbols on my heel which made me giggle a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up again and positioned herself close to me before patting my head. I didn't want to be treated like a small kid, but I was not in control. \"My knight, are you ready for your next... let's call it session?\", she asked with a smile. Still exhausted I answered: \"No, I'm not, please let me rest at least a bit longer.\"<br>\r\nMy teacher raised the brush menacingly and drew a sign on my forehead. \"You shouldn't lie to me. Bebener. Are you ready to be tickled again?\" I tried to oppose it by shutting my lips and shaking my head, but my body was not fully controlled by me and so I slowly opened my mouth again and said: \"I'm ready, we can start again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful, according to the records this means you are a really powerful person. I did expect no less from my knight.\", praised Ms Green me. I started to panic: \"NO! Not like this. It's too much. Please don't!\" Tears appeared in the corners of my eyes. She put her equipment aside and placed a hand on the back of my head. My teacher moved closer to me and pressed my face into her T-shirt covered chest. \"Calm down.\" Her other hand stroked my back. This was a very soothing position for me. \"I don't want to see a tear in your eyes.\", she tenderly kissed the top of my head and whispered almost silently \"Gabenter. Unless you are tickled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't process the last sentence she had said. The tickling was now all over my body. The tickling of my upper body was just as bad as before, but now the nerves in my feet were sending the same signals the rest of my nerves were already emitting. I tore my head high as I screamed: \"AAAHHH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HIHIHI NO! HOHOHOHO HAHAHAHAH\" Ms Green took a step back when I started to shake my head violently. My hands closed to fists and opened back again. I was wiggling my feet and toes as much as I could. I had done so already, but now that were on display and tickled I moved them a lot. It was futile. I tried to push my toes down or pull them up. No angle helped even one bit. The tickling curse was burned into my very body. I couldn't escape it and so I continued to laugh out hard: \"HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA HIHIHIHIHI HAHAHAHA\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery now and then I could open my eyes a little and saw Ms Green's brown hair or her blue clothes the corners of my eyes. I think she was mainly standing behind the chair I was bound to. She was proficiently brushing the towel over my face to clean my eyes from the tears I couldn't hold back in the slightest and catching the saliva I was drooling. The signal queue of my brain was overflowing with tickling sensations \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\", but every now and then I felt a quick wipe over my belly, a soft rub in my armpit or very rarely a gentle caress over my feet and in between my toes. My teacher was collecting the fluids she needed for the ritual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't decide whether that was good or bad for me, but my brain wasn't working anyways I could only feel the tickling and shake my whole body in reflexive fleeing attempts. Not knowing how much time had passed I became aware of the fact that her spell did not just tickle, it also stopped my body from getting desensitized, otherwise my reaction would have decreased by now, but it was still tickling like crazy just as in the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head was pulled against the chair. Ms Green had the towel over my forehead when the tickling stopped. My body was still shivering, but I couldn't let my head fall again. I panted heavily and couldn't say a word, it had been just too much. The teacher spoke up: \"Let me check if it is enough.\" She went to her book and scrolled through it. I could finally let my head fall. I was more exhausted than ever before in my life. I had many tickle session, but none came close to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard the voice of my teacher when she said: \"...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What? No.\", my voice was little more than a whisper. My eyes were closed. I was so exhausted and felt my mind going blank. Unconsciousness was catching me in a sweet embrace. I felt the black void surround me and my muscles going limp. \"Sesuk.\" Ms Green whispered in my ear and my eyes shot open again. I quickly closed them again, but I was already ripped away from the relaxing atmosphere. \"Are you serious, this is the most fun I ever had with a student and you want to fall asleep, don't worry I can't cure your tiredness, but I can help you to not lose your senses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe painted on my forehead. \"No. I'm telling. What do you want to know. I will tell you everything, if you just stop.\", I begged her. My teacher answered softly: \"I know that you want to, but in your current state you will tell me whatever you think I want to hear and I don't want this. You have to understand I need the truth, the real truth from you. I also promised you to make you tell me your secrets later and the time has come.\" \"No, please don't.\", I protested, I wasn't sure what she would ask me, but I also didn't want to find out. \"Without this the ritual will fail, so It's necessary for both of us. Besides there must be something you are hiding and the curiosity is getting the better of me. Bebener. It's time, tell me everything you don't want me to know. What are your secrets you are hiding from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a scary question. There were enough things I didn't want to share with her, but I knew how powerful the spell was and was going to disclose all of these information. I was shaking my head a little, but I soon started to give her the answers: \"I have a crush on you. I always did. You are so gorgeous. Your eyes are big and green that's why I was often chatting with you after class, just to get lost in them.\" \"Oh, that's so sweet.\", she commented while I continued: \"There are also your feet. They are flawless I have always wondered if they happen to be ticklish. I can tell you if our roles were reversed I wouldn't give you a break, I would keep you producing your beautiful laughter without end, assuming you are ticklish.\" I shut my mouth after that statement, why wasn't I able to hold that back that would have been much better for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy history teacher answered: \"Well let me fulfill this one wish for you. I am really ticklish. When I was young I got tickled to pieces regularly. That's why I started to study history and learn about magic, just to protect myself.\" I was feeling that I was about to tell her something else and tried to resist the spell as she continued: Well I expanded my skills by now and experiment more as you experienced, but why are you looking so strained?\" My mouth opened and I said: \"I have another sensitive, ticklish spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Greens eyes lit up when I confessed this. \"Where should that be, I thought I had covered all the spots on a human body, I don't know where else people could be ticklish.\" She held my chin and drew the symbol on my forehead again. I screamed  in fear: \"NO! Don't make me tell you. I can't take it!\" She ignored my begging and proceeded with her wizardry: \"Bebener. What are all the ticklish spots on your body that I haven't tickled so far?\" I rapidly shook my head and tried to stop myself, but the answer was forced out of my lips: \"There is small area in my left armpit that is not covered and I'm ticklish between my legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, people are ticklish there. I never knew. That's fascinating. Let me first correct my mistake.\" She looked in my left armpit while I protested. I didn't know how she did it, but she found the area I had told her about and applied the paint there. \"This will benefit our cause. And now to your other secret area.\" My teacher pulled my shorts up a little, drew the chained rings on my upper legs and said: \"Tali. Now is will be much easier.\" I felt my upper legs being pushed against the chair. She drew a line on my shorts and pulled my blue underpants up to also paint the line on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your blue underpants are cute, they match my outfit, but I think you don't need them for now. Ilang.\" I knew my last piece of clothing would disappear leaving me nude and utterly helpless. I didn't want to look down and she wasn't making me. Instead she gave me two additional glasses of water that I greedily drank, I had lost a lot of liquid. When my penis was revealed she inspected it and stated: \"You were right, this is a spot.\" She took the towel and wipe over the slightly sweaty, sensitive area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Green dunked the brush into the vessel while telling me: \"I'm gone prepare the rest of your body. At the university they told us that we shouldn't pamper the students too much, but I can't help myself when I have such a big man in front of me.\" She gave me a wink, stooped down over my crotch and started to paint above my penis. It was limp, so she could easily access the area under my belly leading to my shaft. I bargained again: \"You don't have to do this. I'm gone do whatever you want. You can check this statement, It's the truth.\" \"I know that it is, but I don't want you to do anything besides sitting here and letting me be good to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brush was gliding over the upper side of my penis covering it with symbols while she spoke. She took the tip of my genitals and raised them to access the underside. My whole body shivered when she touched me with her soft fingers which made her smile happily. \"The testicles too?\", she asked once the underside was filled with her drawings. I didn't answer her, but she just continued, making me jump when the cool paint hit my balls. My teacher painted each of them separately. I had given up a bit and wanted to look away, but I was also too curious and it felt good, so I observed her when she applied the paint around my penis.  She made sure to cover enough space around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straightened her back once she was done and gave me a cheerful smile. \"You are well prepared, the next session can start. Do you have anything else to say.\" I didn't, so I shook my head. \"Alright, then let's not waste more time. Gatelen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body started to glow and my tickle torture resumed. The intensity had increased with the new spot she had added. I threw my head back and tried to let out enough laughter to express how much it tickled: \"HAHAHAHAHAHA HIHIHIHIHI HAHAHAHA HOHO HAHAHAHAHA AAHAHHHAHAHAHAHA\" It wasn't sufficient to show how much it actually tickled. I just couldn't laugh hard enough. Now that my upper legs were bound as well I shook my hip to try to escape, not that I knew I was doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you are actually ticklish there. Who would have thought, but great to know.\" The new spot was not the worst one on my body, but the sensory overload I had already felt was now even stronger. I was completely lost in a world were everything tickled. There was no other sensation. Tears flowed from my eyes again and I would drool all over the place if not for Ms Green who again used a towel, the second one already, to effectively wipe it away and take the fluids from my body. I couldn't think about it, but my teacher was going all over my body with her towel, she even stroked my penis occasionally with it, to make sure she didn't miss anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickling above my penis  and on my belly was adding to my laughter: \"HAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA\", but it also started to produce a different effect. I felt that the water I drank wanted to leave my body and my bladder couldn't hold it anymore. I clenched my teeth when I felt that I wouldn't be able to hold it, not that I was in a position where I could do anything about, but the tickling sensation decreased a little or rather I had a different feeling overshadowing it a little when I felt that I couldn't hold it any longer. I threw my head back and started to pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything left my body, I shot it out. It was liberating that it reduced the laughter a little, but soon every drop had left my body and the laughter resumed. The tickling soon stopped however and I just felt Ms Green cleaning my face and body of the sweat again, before tenderly wiping the last drops from my penis. I felt drained. She softly spoke to me: \"Well done my knight. I didn't think I could make you do that, but this is perfect.\" I opened my eyes asking myself what was perfect about that and saw my teacher with a gleeful smile and bottle full of my urine in her hands. \"You know tears and saliva are strong, but nothing is more potent than this here for the ritual. This alone is more than enough, so we can finally start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know what? You gave me enough to do this ritual twice, so I will give you a choice. I can let you go, but then two of your friends will suffer twice as much or I can continue with you. I'm asking you to prove yourself: Are you a real knight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't think long and answered: \"...\"</span></div></div>",

She nodded: \"I knew you are that kind of person, you want to help others. I experienced this myself and I think that this is fantastic. In fact you offered to help me just now again, because I don't have to capture somebody else. That is much easier. You are really sweet.\" I disagreed: \"That's not how I... NO! Don't touch me!\" Ms Green had taken the brush and held my chin with her left hand to draw on my forehead. I had already told her everything what more did she want to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tali.\", she breathed in my face. My head got pressed backwards I couldn't move it anymore. This was the main part of my body that I could still move, now I could only struggle a little with my upper body and my fingers and toes. \"Why are you doing this? I can't escape\" I asked, but didn't get an answer. My teacher was engaged in her painting. I felt cool signs on my chest and stomach, unfortunately I was no longer able to look at what she was doing, because Ms Green had taken the ability to move my head from me. It felt like the binding rings again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy assumption was proven right, when I heard her say \"Tali.\" again. My body was forced against the chair. I could only move my toes and fingers. My teacher finally answered my question: \"That's better I don't want you to struggle in the slightest from now on. If I make mistakes with the symbols it won't happen what I want. You might be turned into a pigeon or an orchid if I make a mistake. I don't know which, the texts are old, you know.\" I tried to stop this again: \"Maybe you shouldn't do it then. I agreed that I would participate, but I didn't know that I might be turned into a plant.\" She responded quickly: \"You accepted without knowing terms and conditions, I have to teach you that this is wrong.\" I was sure she was grinning while saying this, but I couldn't see her face as it was buried in a book again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that I couldn't do anything and still felt tired from her previous actions, so I tried to recover a bit. I closed my eyes and felt my body relaxing, I must have been really tired, because I managed to fall asleep. She must have undone her spell that was stopping me before and I rested for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't for long. I felt something cool in my belly button and opened my eyes immediately. \"Oh, you are awake again. You shouldn't fall asleep while I'm pampering you, I know that it must feel cozy, but this is an experiment, you have to give me feedback in the end.\" I didn't respond, so my teacher shrugged her shoulders and continued: \"I used the ingredients you provided to create this special paint, don't worry I'm not gonna cover you in your own urine\", she reacted before I even thought about it \"And now I'm gonna apply it on your body to start with the ritual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brush was still in my navel. From there Ms Green drew lines over my belly going up my torso and down to my legs. An especially thick line was drawn from my navel up to my sternum. Starting from the thick lines she drew thinner lines covering different parts of my body. Some went to my arms, over my biceps until reaching my forearm and stopping at my bound wrists. Another pair of lines went over my legs also all the way down to my ankles, she actually drew three of these lines on each of my legs. Another full circle was drawn around my throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this drawing tickled, but I couldn't move and it was not so much, but giggles kept flowing out of me and I sort of enjoyed what was happening. Ms Green seemed to realize this and was also smiling cheerfully. Maybe she didn't want to harm me after all, I actually didn't think that she would do that, but she didn't stop and tickled me beyond any reasonable limit, so she cared less about my well-being than I hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teacher soaked the brush with fresh paint and continued: \"Now for the hardest part. Hold still or you will become a cockroach or so.\" I couldn't move so this was really meaningless. Ms Green began to draw even thinner lines beginning from the thicker ones going into all parts of my body. These new lines were round kept spreading smaller and thinner line that never touched. After a while she had covered both my legs with these lines and continued on my arms. I could now see much better what she had painted and it looked like a network of roots from a tree or veins that are able to reach everything and go to one large connections that leads to my belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was sure a similar network was created on my arms and tried to concentrate when my teacher applied the paint on my stomach and chest to be sure it was there look similar there as well. The brush entered my armpits where it had all started, but the symbols were really different this time. The lines were now reaching everywhere on my naked body, well except for my penis and the area from my belly to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Green looked me in the eyes: \"You are doing a great job. Let me give you a small reward.\" she drew on my lips while speaking \"Tutuk\" I felt how I offered her my lips, but it was different from before. The last time I was able to resist, at least a little and it was unsuccessful, but now this new paint was so much stronger. I couldn't avoid in the slightest. My history teacher kissed me on my lips. This time I pushed my tongue into her, before she could. This is how powerful the new paint was. She moved her head around a little to cover my whole mouth. Her soft lips felt fantastic, I found myself enjoying the kiss even though I was forced into it. Ms Green broke the kiss after a moment. \"My knight, that was what I needed. Let me continue now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe painted the next lines starting from the ring around my throat going to my head and on my face. The brush went over my chin and cheeks, my ears and nose. I knew that I had to close my eyes and she painted on my eyelids too. Then it went up to my forehead and temples. She also drew up to my ears covering them with more lines. Once my face was covered she took a step back to inspect her work. My whole body was covered by a complex network of lines. It must have looked like a roadmap where everything was leading to my navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great. There is just one area left and I then we can finally start the spell.\" Ms Green approached me again while saying this. She knelt down in front of me meaning she was on eye-level with my genitals. The freshly paint-soaked brush in her right hand she started to draw another symbol beginning in my belly button. My teacher covered my lower tummy with the network lines and then drew a line on right side of my testicles and mirrored this on the other side. From the bottom of my nuts she painted up drawing what felt like a spiral on each of my testicles, before going up the underside of my shaft. The last line wasn't straight that one was an arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teacher gave me a bright smile, petted my head tenderly and said: \"This is it. The preparations are done. I will now test the first spell.\" Her soft hand caressed over my cheek before she walked back to her working desk with the book and the other utensils. Ms Green raised her voice: \"Jiwa korban, jotosan rant\u00e9 lan metu.\" I felt a strange tingling all over my body. \"Dheweke wis dilaporake, saiki kudu bayar.\" The paint began to glow. The bright green was a bit dazzling. \"Mulane aku narik kowe.\" The color of the paint changed. It began to look red at the endpoints of the thin lines. \"We ngambung, aku duwe wong ing pancing.\" The red color was spreading towards the thicker lines. The parts that were already red turned black once the red had left the area. My fingertips felt a little cold as did my feet. \"Aku duwe kringet. Aku duwe urin. Nyerah kanggo kula.\" The speed with which the red expanded leaving the black behind increased. My paint on my belly was now a deep purpur, because everything let to this part. \"Nyawa Metu.\" The red paint on my belly began to shift downwards. \"Nyawa Metu.\" The spirals on my testicles glew red and it spread into my shaft. \"Kirim lan dadi abdi. Nyawa Metu.\" There was a white smoke on the tip of my penis. \"Nyawa Metu! Nyawa Metu!\" My teacher kept shouting this louder and louder and I looked down and saw the white smoke that was clearly coming out of my penis while the red color on my body continued to wander down to my shaft. \"Nyawa Metu! Nyawa Metu!\" The white smoke had fallen to the ground, but now I saw that it was developing some shapes. It looked like a ball with a some rectangles underneath. The smoke kept flowing out of me. \"NYAWA METU!\" With the last scream the smoke thing finally materialized. There was a thin smoke line going from it to my penis, but I focused on something different. The thing, it looked like me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Green position herself in front of it and spoke unable to hide her excitement: \"It worked! I was able to extract your soul out of your body. Don't be afraid it is still connected to you, you won't die, but I wouldn't have thought that this was possible.\" What did she just say. This is my soul. My teacher took out her brush and approached my soul with it. I wanted to speak up, but I felt incredibly weak. I hadn't realized this before, but I couldn't move my fingertips and felt a little cold. \"Don't let her paint on you\", I breathed. My soul was already moving back towards me, but Ms Green managed to draw a few lines on the arms, legs had and stomach of my soul and whispered: \"Tali.\" My soul continued to float back towards me. My teacher repeated louder \"TALI!\" and ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I observed how my body stopped moving a second time. The smoke-creature that was apparently my soul was now just floating in mid air approximately one meter away from me. \"NO!\" I had become a little louder again when I saw my teacher taking my soul's left wrist and dragging it away from me. After there were three long meters between me and my soul, she stopped. The spell worked somehow different on my soul, because it seemed like it was just frozen in place and not pushed against a special chair like I was. My teacher walked over to her utensils while my soul stayed at it's position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI used the time to take a closer look at the creature and could see that it clearly had my body and face and it wasn't dressed, just like me. I could also see that the thing had no hands, its arms stopped after the elbows and chunk of the shoulders was not there as well. \"Come back to me.\", I tried to get its attention, but nothing happened. I got however Ms Green's attention. She looked over to me and said: \"It didn't work as good as I had hoped. Most of it got out of you, but some parts are still in your body. It was also close to slipping back into you, but I was quick enough to keep this from happening. I'm sure you will love what will happen next. Remember these things here\", she gestured towards the bottle and the towels \"I will now finally use the magic powers of them. I have already prepared it, so enjoy the show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew a circle with some symbols inside of it on the ground and stepped in the middle of it. \"Salinan\", she said and waited a second before stepping out of the circle to look at my hands and shoulders. She went to my left hand and touched it. Her soft, warm fingers felt really good on my cold skin. I was still not able to move my head, so I had to look at the circle and saw a second Ms. Green stepping out of it and walking over to my right side where she touched my shoulder with her hands. The one on the left said: \"You moved your hands too much that stopped your soul from flowing out of here.\" My teacher on the right side answered: \"The same is true for the shoulders. We need to fix this.\" A third Ms Green walked out of the circle and over to my soul and checked it for more missing parts. She had finished her work when the fourth Ms Green stepped out of the circle: \"The rest looks good, we don't need to repeat it, this can be corrected more easily.\" The fourth version of my teacher stood by the book and was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was finally able to speak when the fifth Ms Green stepped out of the circle: \"What is happening here? What is this?\" All of them ignored me. The first two walked over to the one by the books and I could see there were a sixth and seventh one coming out of the circle before the two came back to me, or I thought it were the same, they all looked absolutely equal. The two teachers put their hands on one of my shoulders each supporting themself a little with me, they brought their lips close to my ears and the right one began to whisper in my ear: \"This a very mighty spell, it creates copies of a person.\" The left one continued: \"Don't worry you won't be able to find a difference between us.\" The other one whispered again: \"We made a small mistake and now we have to correct it.\", she began to kiss and lick my earlobe while the right one proceeded: \"We know that you are a helpful knight. And it will be wonderful for you.\" The left one started to kiss my cheek and the right one spoke softly again: \"I hope you haven't forgotten that this is all to pamper you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBound like I was there wasn't really anything I could do for or deny them and the two Ms Greens standing close to me began to caress my upper body with their soft hands. I closed my eyes for a second, because it felt really good, so I could no longer keep track of the number of copies she had created. There were many at least six, probably seven of them standing around the manifestation of my soul. The teacher on my right put her hands on my cheeks and kissed me shortly. I wanted to shake my head, but couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view in front of me was crazy. There were numerous copies of a person standing around a smoke-creature. Two of these Ms Greens took an arm of my soul each and they pulled them up, while two pulled the legs of the thing up. I could hear a quick sentence from them: \"Yes, we can already start.\" The teachers next to me where blocking my view time and time again to give me a peck, but I didn't react to what they were doing I was too focused on the scene in front of me. The group of teachers were moving my soul around until it was floating in the air with its back facing the ground. My soul's arms where spread over its head and the feet separated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see one of them with a wicked smile on her lips. But wasn't sure as my view got obstructed again and again. I wasn't sure what the two Ms Greens that were caressing my body wanted to do. It felt good, but my concentration was just elsewhere. Then the group of history teachers started to tickle my soul. Not a lot, just two of them were using their fingers to tickle both feet, but I knew I was ticklish there and my souls was shifting its face around. I didn't feel anything and my soul was not capable of speaking, so it didn't laugh, but I was sure it would have done so, if it had the ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen ...</span></div></div>",

That's how you get the attention of such a man.\" She smiled brightly and pulled her shirt over her head to reveal a black bra, smooth armpits and a flat, soft looking tummy. Was I that stupid? They wanted to arouse me, I hadn't realized this, but now it was clear to me and it was working my history teacher's tummy looked incredible. The deep navel and the soft ribs made me want to tickle her so badly. The two Ms Greens at my sides gave each other a knowing smile and stripped their shirts off as well. I couldn't look at them as good, but there were now three copies of the same beautiful body in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Ms Greens at my side were caressing my thigh with one hand each, while still working my upper body and kissing my face. The third one turned around. I could now see her gorgeous back. She bent forward which allowed me to look over her and see my soul again. There were now more teachers tickling it. One for each foot and one for each armpit were tickling hard and my soul shook its head and struggled as a result. The Ms Green in front of me opened the zipper on her skirt, before pulling it down very slowly which shifted my attention back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first I could see were her black panties matching her bra, she bent more forward revealing her round, firm butt. My eyes were glued to her body. The blue fabric of her skirt went down her smooth legs. I looked at the back of her thigh and followed the curves of her knees to her calves. The skirt ended its journey as a blue pile around her ankles. I felt how my penis began to stiffen because of this view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two Ms Greens were still caressing my thighs and upper body while kissing me occasionally when I felt a third pair of my teacher's gentle hands on my sides. She stood behind me and began to tickle me lightly. I still couldn't move and it was a very pleasant tickling. The two Ms Greens caressing my body also started to tickle my armpits every now and then when they felt like it while the one behind me kneaded my sides a little or counted my ribs. This was enjoyable and kept me on the ropes, but my main focus was on the version in front of me.  She stepped out of her skirt stripping off her black shoes while doing this. I saw the smooth, creamy soles of her small feet when she stepped away from me. The teacher turned around and now I saw her cute toes with the red painted toe nails. God, her feet looked amazing. I just wanted to touch and tickle them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down in front of me which gave me a moment to look at my soul again. The teacher-group was now even more active. The were still four copies tickling my soul's armpits and feet, but there was now also one Ms Green on each side of my soul tickling its tummy and sides. My soul looked like it was completely hysterical. It shook with as much force as it could which wasn't much. I wasn't sure about this, because the two Ms Greens at my side were giving me sweet kisses me again to block my view, but it looked like my soul was crying. I also thought there was a small puddle of tears under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could observe this further my attention was caught by the teacher in front of me who had raised her legs and was giving me a show of her amazing feet. She showed me the sole, spread her toes and flexed her ankle. I could see them from all angles. Her legs looked really good as well. My penis was rising and pointing towards the ceiling. The white smoke-connection I still had with my soul wasn't influenced by this. The one in front of me commented: \"Heavens, knighty, am I making this grow? You are a big man aren't you. I take this as a compliment, my pampering must be great for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up again, raised her arms and put her hands behind her head to pose for me and show of her armpits. She then pulled on her bra: \"This is in the way, right knighty?\" and stripped it off, she must have opened it when I wasn't looking. Who cares? I was starring at her breasts. They were probably a C-cup. Her breasts looked round and firm, just like her butt. Her nipples were a light pink that matched her lips. Ms Green crossed her arms and pushed them up a little. I shivered a little because of the pleasurable touch and fantastic view, while whispering \"wow\". All the copies had a big smile on their faces and my penis grew even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what happened this morning? You rescued me from the books and made a joke about princess and knight. I think now is the time the knight gets the reward from the princess. And you have such a large sword that I just have to play with it.\" She came closer to me and turned around. Her back was now facing me as she walked backwards. Her naked back touched my body. It was flesh against flesh. Her soft back was pressing into me. My head was on her shoulder and my penis was pressed into her cuddly butt. She rubbed her body against mine. I moaned softly. The Ms Green turned around and kissed me, before kneeling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was loosing myself in the gentle tickles and the visual stimulation, but I was still able to take a quick glance over to my soul. While I was in pleasure, my soul was the an utter mess. There were now seven copies of my history teacher tickling its armpits, feet, tummy and genitals. My soul was totally helpless and tried to laugh, but it wasn't able to produce sounds. There were tears dropping to the floor into a big puddle under it. My soul looked not like before though. Some parts seemed to be missing. I knew that my hands and shoulders weren't pulled out of my, but a part of my butt seemed to be missing as well and the underside of my leg wasn't there either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher in front of me had taken my erection in her gentle hands and gave it a soft kiss on the tip with her soft lips. I closed my eyes because this felt so amazing. I quickly opened them again just in time to see a big part of the thigh of my soul falling to the ground. It looked like a heap of jello that was emitting smoke. One Ms Green walked over to it quickly and put it into a vessel. My view got blocked again and I heard the bare-chested Ms Green telling me: \"Nyawa Metu. Enjoy your reward. I certainly will.\" Before sliding her lips and mouth over my erection. I moaned again. It felt really good. Her mouth was warm and wet. She began to move her head giving me a blowjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three other copies were still tickling me lightly. The one behind me had also started to go into my armpits more often while the others had started to tickle my belly keeping me just on the edge of laughing. This was a great feeling. Their gentle hands also rubbed my body all over. All of them also participated in caressing my face mainly my chin and cheeks. My body was still cold so their warmth was an enjoyable feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt the suction on my penis increasing so I looked down at the one in front of me. I took another look at her breasts, but was a bit irritated, because there was smoke coming out of her nostrils. It was the smoke that was connecting me to my soul. It appeared thicker, but this could be my imagination. I looked up again to check my soul for a moment again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked frightening. Many parts of my souls were no longer there. The smoke-creature had no arms any more. The legs and feet were missing as well. I saw that the teacher group was mainly tickling the tummy and genitals now, one was blowing raspberries on my belly, but two were tickling my soul's neck and ears. The back was dripping and I saw some sort of jello falling to the ground. One of the Ms Greens collected all of these jello parts in a vessel. The face of my soul was still screaming for help I was sure of this, but I couldn't do anything. I probably should have worried more, but the pleasure I experienced overshadowed everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ms Greens were caressing my body and the one between my legs was giving me a blowjob. She didn't use her tongue. She was doing all of this with her full lips. Her hands were supporting my erection and tenderly playing with my testicles. I moaned into the mouth of a copy of my teacher that was kissing me passionately. The suction on my penis kept increasing. This was such an amazing feeling and I couldn't resist it. I loudly moaned into the tender lips that were kissing me and had an orgasm. At least I thought so. I was feeling the usual tingling and pleasure of an orgasm, but I wasn't coming. The almost nude teacher was still sucking me. I was now kissed almost continuously which increased the pleasure. The tickling had stopped instead my shoulders were massaged and two pairs of soft hands played with and caressed my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a short break in the kisses and I could open my eyes despite the pleasure the Ms Greens provided me, so I looked over to my soul and saw that one hand of my soul had appeared. But it didn't stay for long. The five copies were still tickling my soul's tummy with all they had making my hand fall to the ground as a jello puddle very quickly. I thought the connection between me and my soul was thicker than before, but my vision was blurry, so who could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed my eyes again and got lost in the pleasure the Ms Greens were providing me. I couldn't resist anyways and I didn't try anymore. The blowjob was still getting heavier despite me thinking I was already in an orgasmic state. I had lost my sense of time and reality. I heard a whisper: \"This is the relaxation technique I promised you. I told you I would try my best. I will try to make it last a little longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was moaning into soft lips while being sucked out. It really took a little longer, but I finally came for real. My seed shot out of me and into the warm mouth still surrounding my penis. The lips were licking my penis clean, before the Ms Green stood up and swallowed loudly: \"Mmmh. Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped to the side and I look at the remaining parts of my soul that ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In front of me was nothing. The smoke-creature had disappeared. I looked down as much as I could in my bound state and saw no smoke line. My body felt cold and I was afraid. Ms Green spoke again: \"I haven't destroyed your soul. It's in here\", she held a rather small black vessel in front of my face \"it's not much space, but enough ... for you.\" \"I don't understand.\", I said. \"Well it's a long story, but let me explain it a bit. This will help you understand what's going to happen next. You agreed to do the ritual. As I explained it's based on medieval wizardry. The goal of the ritual is, like always, to gain power. In this case in the form of mindless, obedient slaves. In order to do that you need to make them submit in every possible way. I made you do that step by step. Now I have everything I need to turn you into a handsome assistant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Green took out the paintbrush and her paint-vessel again while I told her about my disagreement: \"Submitting? I don't want to do that. I still have willpower and can resist you.\" My still almost nude teacher put her arms behind her head which made me gulp before she said: \"You don't, but I want to continue my explanation.\", she lowered her arms again and I saw the paintbrush: \"NOOO! NO NO NO STOP IT! Don't come anywhere close to me with that.\" I wanted to flee so badly, but I couldn't, her bondage spell was still working. \"The first thing I made you do was to make you willingly participate in the ritual.\", she painted on my mouth while saying this \"After that I made you submit your strength to me by weakening you until you lost all control and peed yourself.\" \"I..I didn't want to! You gave me no chance.\", I tried to defend myself. My teacher drew symbols on my belly while continuing her explanation: \"That's the point sweety. I made you submit your strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paintbrush was in my navel and tickled, so I laughed lightly: \"hahaha take it hahaha away\" \"It's just too much fun to tickle you, but let me elaborate. After you had submitted your strength to me I had to take two more things away from you. So I used a very difficult spell to separate your soul from your weakened body. You know that part. You were disobedient and it didn't fully work at first. That's why I used a bit of your energy to summon the clones. They are slaves, but as you can see they have already disappeared. These demons are not from this world so being here is hard and exhausting for them. You will be much more helpful.\" She flashed me a gleeful smile when she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not from THIS world?\", I asked. \"Yes, it's fascinating I know, there are more dimensions and worlds than we know, but we can't reach many of them or perhaps we could, I just don't know how, maybe one of these books contains such information. But were was I? Oh yeah, after I had pulled the soul out of your body I tried to enslave it immediately, but as you said you are not that weak. That's good. Strong slaves are obviously better. But it meant that I had to do more. I needed to weaken your soul and extract the rest. That's when I found the perfect solution. I tickled your soul. That was so funny. You didn't see it or you didn't understand it. Doesn't really matter. Your soul just collapsed the second I tickled it and turned into a pile of weak jello just like you. HaHa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was terrified, she was evil that much was obvious to me by now, but I was still not able to process that information. My teacher continued: \"In case you were wondering it was truly me who gave you the blowjob. I saw how much you enjoyed my lips. I take this as a compliment. But I didn't have a choice. The demons would have sucked you completely out to feed on you which would have destroyed my plan. There are however two more reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was interesting, she had been so good at this I still hadn't fully comprehended what had happened to me in the last five hours, I realized that I had no sense of time when I thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teacher stopped speaking for a moment. I wanted to know the rest, so I asked her: \"What do you mean? And what is your plan, why are you doing all of this to me?\" \"I don't want to hurt your ego too much so I will tell you the truth, I like you, I always did and when I had the opportunity to enjoy your big penis I had to take it. The other reason is\", Ms Green painted on my testicles and shaft \"I need your seed to keep you as my slave. As long as you entrust me with it I control you. The moment I digest it fully you will be free from the spell, so I will ensure that your balls are always dry\", she winked at me when she said that. I gulped that sounded wonderful and my teacher observed my reaction \"see knighty, I told you it's pampering for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finished her drawing and placed her soft, warm hand on my chest, slightly left of the middle. She gently caressed the area while telling me the rest. \"At the same time I captured your soul. I have to control it to make this magic work. Your soul will get slowly consumed by the magic, but you should have 10 to 15 years and after that I'd like a new, younger slave anyways, but we will create an army, so you won't be lonely.\" Her hand continued to wander over my chest as if she was searching for something. \"Why do you want an army of slaves that sounds like a terrible plan.\", I still tried to stop her, logic could work I thought, but she ignored me. \"There it is\", Ms Green said and painted on the area where her hand had been. I felt that it was exactly above the middle of my heart which scared me a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy teacher had finished the symbols on my mouth, belly, genitals and heart when she took a step back and started: \"Let's start. Wong Lanang.\" A red light coming from my teacher's tender hand and going to my mouth appeared. It felt like someone was pushing a gag in my mouth. I tried to speak and realized that I couldn't.<br>\r\n\"Wong Lanang.\" another red light appeared this time, it went to my belly. When it touched me I felt how all of my power left me. I had been weak, but this was more I was just a strengthless bag of meat. I couldn't collapse, but my jaw opened, because I had no power left to keep it closed.<br>\r\n\"Wong Lanang.\" the third red light appeared and went straight to my penis. I got an erection pointing at her the second it hit me. My teacher giggled: \"This is useless. I already had the power to make you do this whenever I want. hihi\"<br>\r\n\"Wong Lanang.\" The final red light appeared and connected my heart to her hands. I didn't physically react to this, my mind just felt strange. There was something happening with my consciousness, did she succ... My eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome my slave.\" I heard a whisper in my ear and opened my eyes. Close to my face was the most gorgeous face I had ever seen. It was Ms Green she was smiling at me, but I was lost in her big green eyes. \"I want to know did it work? Who am I to you?\" I answered happily that she would speak to me: \"Yes, it worked, we succeeded. I am your obedient slave, princess.\" Her smile became even brighter when she heard that. \"That's wonderful and we want to keep it that way. You know what that means, it's milking time.\" My teacher put her right hand on my chest and I felt how all power left my body again. I was still bound with my wrists and ankles, but I wouldn't have moved anyways without her command. The loss of strength made my head hang down and my jaw opened. I saw that I was sporting a massive erection. She enclosed my testicles with her left hand tenderly and began to massage them while Ms Green's right hand took my shaft and began to give me a heavy handjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind was massively clouded, but I realized how good her soft hand felt and I wanted and had to serve her. The tender hand caressed up and down. I must give her what she wants, I thought. She softly spoke: \"Please knighty, give it to me, I want this from you. So hand it over, let me take it from you.\" I wanted to obey her and climax. Her heavenly stroking and the tender testicle massage were quickly bringing me there \"Do it. For me.\" When she said \"for me\" the saliva started to flow out of my mouth and I orgasmed. My teacher captured my seed in a measuring cup. \"This is for later, I always need some of it at hand, otherwise you might escape me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't think at all. Without a command I was rather useless and more like a doll than a human. My mind only reacted to her commands, but Ms Green soon spoke again: \"Great, now that I have you we can start the plan. The first step is to...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Come on now, knights don't need such a long break\", Ms Green told me and struggled as much as she could which was almost nothing to show me that I had to free her. Without saying a word I walked past her towards her trapped feet. I knelt down in front of them and put each of my hands on one of her ankles and caressed them a little. My teacher started to wiggle her feet which made her shoes flap off and back on because her toes were still holding onto her shoes. \"What are you doing, please set me free\", she sounded a little desperate as if she knew there was something coming she couldn't stand. I on the other hand was already pretty sure that I got my answer. Ms Green was ticklish and I planned to find out just how much. I began to speak again: \"I have a different idea about how to make you give me my letter.\" \"No, this is not acceptable, you have to make up for throwing the shelf on me, not exploit this even more\" she argued. In response I let my hands slide over her ankles, put a finger under her heels and stripped her shoes off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had never seen her feet like this before. Sure she was often dangling her shoes so I had a good idea how her soles looked like and the tops of her feet were almost always revealed, but before today I didn't know about her toes. They were so cute. Rather small just like her feet and round. It looked like my teacher had regular pedicures as her feet looked really soft and flawless. Her neatly trimmed, red painted toenails fit her much more then I would have imagined. I was so eager to see her feet that I had pulled her shoes of with enough force to throw them against the wall behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Green looked a bit afraid, she knew what I would do, but she had already found out that there was no escape for her. I began by putting one index finger in the center each of her feet and scratching her with them. My teacher tried to resist the tickling and it worked so far. Her feet wiggled around and she tried to escape the sensation, but I could simply follow her movement never stopping to tickle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of tickling her like this, I wanted more and so I directly started to use four fingers of both hands on her feet. This cracked her immediately: \"HaHaHaHaHaHaHa\". She started to laugh, it sounded loud feminine and a bit delighted. I couldn't see her face, but I could imagine how she had to open her jaw and show her teeth, because I forced the laughter out of her. I decided to tease her a little more: \"See, this happens when a princess becomes to greedy and doesn't reward the knight.\" \"I.. I HiHi understand HaHaHaHaHaHa it.\" My fingers wandered up and down her soft soles, while she spoke. I ensured that one hand was on her heel, while the other tickled her pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Green's toes were wiggling since I started and increased their speed now that I applied the new pattern. \"Seems like your toes want my attention, don't worry I will take care of them.\" After saying that, I crossed my arms, grabbed her feet to hold them still and started to tickle her big toes with my thumbs. Her reaction was immediate: \"HAHAHAHA NO! NOHOHOHO HAHAHAHA\" My teacher's laughter became louder than before. Her toes were simply more ticklish than her soles. Her laughter pured out of her. She started to cough during the laughter so I stopped to give her a break. I walked over to look her in the eyes while talking to her. She still had a huge smile plastered across her face. Ms Green inhaled deeply to recover before she spoke: \"You must be a dark knight, that was so mean.\" She wasn't angry which was good for me. \"I'm just punishing you for being greedy, besides your toes are really ticklish\", I commented. \"Yes they have always been that way that's why I never expose them. They are just too sensitive. I can't even walk over grass without shoes.\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was curious if she had changed her mind, so I asked her about the test. \"You still have to help me with the research. I know you were always looking at my feet, so doing this to me must have been something you really wanted to do for a long time, so it's only fair that you help me now.\" She hadn't changed her mind, so I went back to her feet while saying: \"I'm sure I can convince you.\" My teacher realized her mistake and tried to stop me: \"Wait NO! I was joking NO HOHO HAHAHAHAHA\" As soon as I had reached her feet, I began to tickle under her toes of both her soft feet with all I could. She had told me that she was really ticklish there so I wanted to exploit this as much as possible. \"HAHAHAHAHA STOP! HAHAHAHA\" she couldn't take it. I was an experienced tickler and knew how to get her good and I used what I could to tickle her feet. Staying systematic and always having at least one finger gliding over her feet ensured that she was tickled continuously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout stopping her torture, I asked her again, this time louder to drown over her laughter: \"Have you changed your mind, princess?\" Ms Green continued to laugh and tried to speak: \"HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought that I had broken her at least a little and so I started to demand things from her: \"</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re going to be a really fun visitor.\u201d I follow Amber into the next room, where I see a few holes in the wall. \u201cSo, here\u2019s the first stop of the tour. These are called wall stocks. As you can imagine, they are very useful for tickling people\u2019s feet, but they can also work well for tickling tummies. Would you care to see a demonstration?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I confirm, and then two feet poke through the bottom holes, a stomach pokes through the large middle hole, and two hands come through the top holes. Suddenly, the top and bottom holes get smaller, trapping the hands and feet of the person on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead and tickle it,\u201d Amber encourages, and I walk over with a devious smile. I hear laughter right as my fingers touch the bare belly, and I lightly tickle it for a minute. However, after a minute, I decide to raspberry the midriff, and then my tickling becomes much more intense, tormenting the person on the other side. Five minutes pass, and then I stop abruptly when Amber\u2019s fingers run under my shirt again across my own ticklish tummy. \u201cThe best part about this is that after you tickle the person, they get to tickle you back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I knew what was happening, Amber had placed my hands and feet in the wall stocks, and my midsection pushed through the middle hole. \u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d I laugh as I am suddenly the ticklee. What felt like twenty fingers were running over my bare belly, and as much as I tried to squirm, I do not get very far. \u201cTHAHAT REHEHELY TIHIHIHICKLEHEHES!\u201d After a couple minutes, I get my own share of raspberries, with one side of my midsection getting raspberried as the fingers continue to torment the other side. Amber allows me to get tickled for eight minutes before she finally lets me out of the stock holes, giving me a minute to catch my breath again. \u201cThat tickled so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good; it\u2019s the aim of the attraction,\u201d Amber comments. \u201cAnyways, you\u2019ll meet her later; she might even let you have some more tickling fun then.

Once I am fully bound, she tells me, \u201cSee you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks away, and I strain my body, trying to see if anyone else is around and can let me out. \u201cHello!\u201d I call out. \u201cIs anyone else here?\u201d No one answers, so I call out to the girl who brought me here, afraid. \u201cAmber? This isn\u2019t funny!\u201d I hear nothing else, and despite being slightly afraid, I eventually settle down, resigned to my fate of being tied up until someone manages to find me. Suddenly, I feel fingers dance on my bare sides, and I yelp in surprise. \u201cAHAHAHA!\u201d The tickling stops just as quickly as it started, and when I look down to find the source, I see nothing. \u201cWho did that? Is that you, Amber? Is someone else here?\u201d My series of questions go unanswered, which I did not expect, and I start to get worried again. Just as I\u2019m about to call out again, fingers come and start tickling my armpits. \u201cAHAHAHAHA! STAHAHAHAHAP!\u201d While the first tickling just lasted a few seconds, this one keeps up, with the tickler deviously moving their nails in my armpits for less than a minute before going back down to my ticklish tummy. \u201cNOHOHOHOHO!\u201d I call out, trying to get them to stop. \u201cAHAHAHAHA PLEHEHEHEHESE!\u201d Despite my pleas, the tickling does not stop, and soon enough, it gets worse. Another set of ten fingernails come up and start tickling my midriff, causing my laughter to double. \u201cNAHAHAHAHAHAT THEHEHEHERE! PLEHEHEHEHEHESE!\u201d The four-handed tickling continues for at least ten minutes, and by the end, I\u2019m laughing myself crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the tickling intensity calms down before it eventually stops. \u201cSo, what do you think of the surprise tickle table?\u201d Amber inquires as she appears in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that you?\u201d I ask as I catch my breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet,\u201d she confirms. \u201cWhat\u2019d you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it was definitely a surprise,\u201d I acknowledge. \u201cYou\u2019re a really good tickler, but I know you weren\u2019t alone.

One of the richer girls who attended my school, Kimberly was part of a trio who always found a reason to demean their classmates. \u2018And now she knows exactly how ticklish I am,\u2019 I thought to myself. \u2018Look at my luck.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Kimberly,\u201d I announced after recognizing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi,\u201d she responded with a smile. \u201cSo, you seem pretty ticklish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d you half-heartedly answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t try and fool me,\u201d she teased, wagging a finger. \u201cI know you like tickling and being tickled.

Of course, my parents helped fund this place, so it won\u2019t be a normal job, but it should be fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, that sounds nice,\u201d you begin to grasp what is going on. \u201cKimberly, I can\u2019t help but notice that you\u2019re acting a bit different. Like\u2026 well, you\u2019re a lot more fun like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean not like when I\u2019m around Mary and Alicia?\u201d she questioned, referring to the other two in her trio, and I nodded in affirmation. \u201cYeah, my parents make me be around them because they are all friends, but I\u2019d rather just hang out with people like you. I know I can be a jerk when I\u2019m with them, and I want to change that, so I\u2019m hoping this job will move me in that direction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s very thoughtful of you, and I think it\u2019s already paying off some,\u201d I noted. \u201cIn any case, you are very talented at tickling. I have a feeling our guests will have lots of laughs here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I guess there\u2019s just one question now,\u201d Kimberly stated, an evil glint in her eye. \u201cDo you want to be tickled again, or do you want me to let you out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought for just a second before answering,</span></div></div>",

Finally, she gave up on trying to get me to answer. \u201cOh, fine, I guess you really don\u2019t want to answer, so I\u2019ll just have to experiment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA poke to my navel was all it took to get me laughing hysterically, just as Kimberly had predicted, \u201cNONONONONONO!

I darted over to the living room, grabbed the blanket off the couch and covered myself up with it. When I went back into the kitchen, I saw the \"intruder\". It was Kimberly Lockwood. She was part of a trio of stuck up, rich girls at school who thought they were better than everyone else. However, they were all incredibly hot. She had ginger hair that she had tied up in a ponytail, bright green eyes, and a ton freckles all over her face. She was dressed in a bright blue tank top and dark purple sweatpants. Looking down at her bare feet, she had painted her toenails a neon green. She was actually the nicest of the trio and many people thought that if Alicia hadn't somehow gotten her to cling to them, she'd be a very nice girl. Now that I saw who was in my house, time for the big question.<br>\r\n\"Why are you in my house?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...umm...this is a bit of a long story.\"<br>\r\n\"I have time.\"<br>\r\n\"Well okay...my parents went to Hawaii for the summer for their second honeymoon and so they wanted me to stay with someone. I overheard you telling your friend Phoebe that your parents were going to be out of town for the summer as well, so I suggested you and they asked your parents if they were okay with it and everybody thought it was a good idea so here I am. And since you're probably wondering why I didn't go with Mary or Alicia, to be honest I kind of want to find friends who aren't so mean to everybody. So I guess I'm also here to make up for the fact that I've kind of been a bitch to you and your friends...Umm...Are you naked under there?\"<br>\r\n\"Umm...yeah.\" We both blushed hard at that. I also took a moment to process the information. \"Okay, so how do you plan on making it up to me?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...I figured you'd have some ideas...umm...your interest in tickling is no secret and I'm...PLENTY ticklish...if that helps at all.\"<br>\r\nI was astounded. Here was this amazingly hot, super ticklish girl who just basically said that I could tickle her as much as I want. But what if she was lying and planned on ambushing me with Alicia and Mary? That didn't seem likely though. She really was a nice girl. And she could always prove herself by helping me tickle prank Alicia and Mary. I thought about it for a moment and I decided.

The girl had been violently thrashing about on the couch from the skillful way I moved my fingertips over her belly and laughing like a hyena when I finally stopped tickling her. Much to my amusement, I found that Kimberly continued laughing hysterically up to a full minute after I had stopped tickling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a while to regain her composure as her laughter finally died down into absolutely adorable sounding subdued girlish giggles and then ceased. Afterwards, she was panting and gasping for breath, the tickling having took a pretty huge toll on her. When she had finally calmed down completely from her tickle torture, I reached down and untied her bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... my god,\" She said, gasping between words as she still fully hadn't caught her breath. \"That was... absolute torture\" Despite saying that, Kimberly didn't seem too upset or mad over what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" I apologized. \"I couldn't help myself and got a little carried away\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, you're fine\" Kimberly insisted, smiling and admitting. \"It was actually kind of... fun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" I asked in surprise, not quite able to believe me ears. She had actually enjoyed being tickled like that? Given how berzerk she was going while I was tickling her, I thought she would've hated it. \"You actually liked it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" She said, her smile changing into a smirk that was more mischievous. I had practically no time to react when she suddenly pounced on me. \"In fact, I liked it so much that I think I wanna share it with you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, wha- AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" I start to ask, caught off guard by Kimberly before bursting into laughter when she reached her hand underneath my shirt and started tickling <i>my</i> belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, looks like you're a bit ticklish yourself\" She said, digging her fingers into my stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHA H-HEY W-WAIHIHIT HAHAHAHAHAHA\" I said, laughing as I fall back onto the couch. Just like Kimberly, my tummy was my most ticklish spot, meaning I went nuts from her sudden tickle attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, quit trying to fight it, you're going to love it\" Kimberly said before she asked \"So, is your tummy your most ticklish spot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA YEHEHEHES! HAHAHAHAHAHA\" I could only answer truthfully as I wriggled about, finding that Kimberly was right and I was starting to enjoy being tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting\" Kimberly said, a slightly seductive tone in her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

She then takes the rope and ties my ankles down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey!\" I protest, putting up a light struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the tables have been turned and you're now <i>my</i> tickle slave\" Kimberly said, a playful &amp; teasing tone to her voice as she pushed my shirt up to expose my belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, at least for now\" I retorted with a cheeky grin, playfully threatening. \"When I get out of this, I'm going to tickle the crap out of that tummy of yours'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you will\" Kimberly replied before grabbing two of the feathers I had used on her and lightly trailing them over my belly. \"But for right now, it's time for a little payback.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehehehehehehehe h-hey heheheheh c-cuhuhut ihihit out hahahahahaha\" I said, breaking down into giggles almost immediately as Kimberly slowly ran those feathers along every square inch of my stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you said your tummy is your most ticklish spot\" Kimberly said, still keeping a teasing pace. \"But I wonder just <i>how</i> ticklish it is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youhuhu'll have tohoho find out hahahahahahahah youhuhurself hahahaha because I'm not tehehelling youhuhu\" I told her, failing to keep my composure as those devilish feathers tickled like crazy.

Kimberly was more than determined to fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I don't know, I don't think you're laughing loud enough\" Kimberly said, tracing that feather around faster &amp; faster, getting closer &amp; closer to sticking it inside my innie belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehehehehehehehehehehehee st-stahahahap it hehehehehehe c-c'mohohon huhuhuhuh\" I pleaded with her, losing control more &amp; more by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop trying to cover it up\" Kimberly told me. \"Let me hear that beautiful laughter of yours.\" With that, Kimberly dipped that feather into my navel and began swirling it around.

A minute later, I came back with two glasses of water. \u201cI guess you did them right; I couldn\u2019t get out to get back at your belly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, do you promise to be good if I untie your wrists from the edge of the couch to let you drink this on your own, or will I have to do everything around here?\u201d I playfully questioned her about drinking the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Kimberly responded\u2026</span></div></div>",

While I had been fooled by such thoughts before, being alone as I was meant that I had to step up my responsibilities... even if those responsibilities were as mundane as answering the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to the kitchen phone, quickly checking the caller's ID. But rather than saying unknown, it said 'jammed'. Huh? I had never seen an error message like that before. My interest piqued, I picked up the receiver and gave a tentative, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reply was a garbled chuckle. \"Well, well. The man of the house is finally up. Enjoying your vacation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was strangely distorted... deep and static-like, but unlike any normal person's voice would sound. In fact, I couldn't even tell if the speaker was male or female! It was as if the voice was being run through a filter of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I guess so...\" I replied, becoming more disturbed by the minute. \"Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice chuckled again, much more ominously than before. \"Irrelevant.

In fact, one of them wants to speak to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe static-like effect disappeared, and I heard a familiar voice on the other line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro! It's a trap! Don't do anything they-\" It abruptly ended with a muffled sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no mistaking it... it was my sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done to her, you son of a bitch?!\" I shouted, half-enraged and half-frightened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk,\" muttered the voice, still distorted. \"Why, it turns out this game needs multiple players. You're the star attraction, of course, but think of her as a prize. If you do as we say, then you will see her soon enough. However, if you break the rules, then she has to pay the price. And don't worry, we'll keep you well informed of the situation, at every step. In fact, have a look at your cell phone now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar buzz of my smartphone alerted me to its presence on the kitchen counter. I lowered the kitchen phone's receiver, and carefully approached my cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to the sinister voice's word, there was a picture. It was grainy and poorly lit, but it was obvious of who it was... my sister! It was her face, blindfolded, with her mouth bulging with some sort of packing. Clear plastic tape was wrapped around her mouth, sealing the gag tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, running back to the kitchen phone and shouting, \"Don't lay a finger on her, you bastard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, the voice tsk-tsked me. \"Perhaps not a finger. But maybe a feather?\" I blanched at the thought. My sister was as ticklish as I was, and judging from the situation, it may be akin to torture for her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that was just a teaser, young man. For you see, there are two other players: your mother, and your cousin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy cellphone buzzed again, and I knew that pictures of my relatives were being sent... almost certainly bound and gagged like my sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't even have a chance to speak before the voice answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so, now the game begins.

My mother and cousin were tougher, and I knew they could hold out longer. At least, that was my hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" laughed the sinister voice on the phone. \"I must admit, she's been an excellent player in the game so far. It'll be a shame to lose her, but fair is fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was growing weary of this speaker's nonchalance. \"Just tell me what I need to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah straight to the point. You were well chosen,\" said the voice, obviously relishing this sick little game. \"The rules are as follows: you will given a single clue as to your dear sister's whereabouts. If you can decipher the answer, then you will be a step closer to freeing her. However, if you do not have an answer in one hour, then a severe... penalty... must be paid. For all the players.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple clue to solve. Seemed easy enough, even if it was only a step closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And of course, you must not speak of the game to anyone. Particularly the authorities. The game will end immediately, and you will never see any of the players again. We guarantee this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knot formed in my stomach.

But what had a 'skin' for a floor? Grabbing the first t-shirt I could find, I quickly looked at the time. 55 minutes left before the penalty would be paid.

My sister had warned me that it was a trap, but that was a risk I was willing to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I sprinted to the garage and my bike. Looking at my wrist watch, I realized that I still had a good 50 minutes to get to the school gym.

In any case, I didn't have time to think of the alternatives... the clock was ticking, and my family was in danger! Dashing down to the kitchen, I grabbed my cellphone and bolted to the garage. I untangled my bike from some clutter and peddled like a madman down our the street. Unfortunately, the rink was on the other side of town, and even going as fast as I could would be cutting it close. I could only pray that my answer was correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an exhausting ride, even fueled by my desperate adrenaline, but eventually I made it. The rink was nestled in a rundown corner of an industrial park. The building had been closed for some time, and was probably on its last legs. An ideal spot for a kidnapper, I supposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy tires squealed as I pulled on my hand-brakes, decelerating from my frantic ride. Not missing a beat, I leapt from my bike and dashed up to the front entrance of the rink. I took a quick moment to look at my watch, panting hoarsely. 5 minutes to go. It was going to be close!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the rusted doors were unlocked, and they creaked and groaned as I forced them open. Inside was the thick smell of musty sports equipment. Nearly gagging, I ventured into the darkened structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis?!\" I shouted through the ancient stink. \"Are you here?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly silence greeted me. I walked deeper into the ruined rink, careful to dodge any fallen debris. The skating area was covered a thin layer of grim, and a collapsed beam had fallen into the middle of it. Smashed concession stands and broken booths lined both sides of the building, but there was no sign of life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrible feeling began to swell in my gut. Was it possible I was wrong? Did the riddle mean another location? The dull realization that I had been so stupid was blunted by the horror that I had failed my sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if confirming my worst fears, my cellphone began to vibrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI answered it, fearing what would be said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where oh where did you go, my little man?\" laughed the sinister voice, still distorted by the static. \"Judging from my GPS tracker, you're on the far side of the town. Are you trying to run? Or did you fail the challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I lost,\" I said sadly, shaking my head. \"But please, don't hurt my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice seemed oddly supportive. \"That is very noble of you. But unfortunately, rules are rules. And now, the penalty must be paid by your family. However, the game is not over. When the time comes, a new riddle will be given and you will have a second chance. Pray that you do better next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the phone clicked dead. My guilt was excruciating, but I understood that I needed to let it go. Wallowing in pity would only make me lose sight of the true goal: rescuing my family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, my phone began to buzz again... </span></div></div>",

It's so fun to break those who would stand against me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nervous chill went through my spine as I heard those words. There was something so... Eerie about them.

At your expense of course.\" The voice replied \"But since you were so rude to me earlier, I think I'll share the fun with others. Your friends shall soon learn that you should have treated me with more respect. A red plume shall show you and them to be more polite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person then hung up from their line and I was left wondering as to what they meant by that.

Houses had been broken into while their owners had been inside of them and they were always discovered naked and tied up. Something had happened although the police had managed to keep the details under wraps regarding the events but in each time, a red feather had been left stuck to the front door of each victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realised that the person on the other end (Providing it wasn't a prank), was the one behind the break ins and I knew I had to act quickly.

More investigative than scared or embarassed, I asked \"Who's there?\" to see if I'd get a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA head peaked up from behind the sofa. It was an early high school girl, about fifteen or sixteen by the looks of it, with long brown hair and a couple of mischievous blue eyes. She looked familiar, but her name escaped me. Then my cheeks started to go red as I remembered I was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who are you?\" I asked. \"How did you get in here? Why did you come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl giggled again, emerging from her hiding spot around the furniture. A blue tank top hugged her skinny body, which was nearly as tall as I was, and her hair fell all the way to her shorts, which cut off mid thigh. A grin spread across her face as she approached me. \"My name's Katelyn,\" she told me. \"Your mother let me in before she left, and I'm here because I'm supervising you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an underclassman, she was very precocious. She found my nudity amusing, but she wasn't ridiculing and taunting me like most freshies or even sophs would have. Then I recognized her - she was the de facto leader of a small prank-loving girl gang. Their pranks were all harmless though, and their leader, Katelyn, had a reputation for being surprisingly mature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would my mother let you in?\" I asked, now curious as to this girl's motives. She smiled as she kept slowly approaching me, while I was backing away a little bit slower, more playful than serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I overheard your parents talking to a neighbor.\" she explained. \"Your mom mentioned that you were going to be by yourself for most of the month, and she was worried about you being irresponsible. So I offered to help out since my parents are gone most of the month too. She said yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going somewhere, she'd been planning this. \"Help out how?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I'm going to supervise you. Make sure you don't do anything crazy while your parents are out. I'm all unpacked in the guest room, and I'm ready to spend the month.\" She was spending the entire month here with me, and all arranged without my knowledge. I guess I was no longer alone all month, but it could've been worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the meantime,\" Katelyn continued, \"I'd like to play a game with you.\" Like a stalking feline, she slowly stepped towards me, pushing me gently against the wall when we'd run out of space, her hands resting on my belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued, I asked \"What kind of game did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a little chasing and hiding, cat and mouse, cop and robber, with a little twist.\" She leaned in close, her voice dropping to a whisper. \"I hope you're ticklish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her fingers started wiggling into my belly and sides, causing me to break out in loud laughter. I would've dropped to the ground had Katelyn's hands not been supporting me. However, that meant I leaned right into her fingers, which magnified the sensations and causing me to laugh even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter maybe a minute she stopped, letting me rest for a minute. \"Good,\" she smirked. \"In fact, better. You're much more ticklish than I had hoped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile recovering, I let the information sink in. This girl had planned on us being alone so she could tickle me? This month was looking better and better. And maybe if I was good and she was okay with it, I might return the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't put any clothes on,\" she ordered. \"Much more sensitive this way. Well, better start running you bad, bad robber, 'cause the cop will be here soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backed off and sat on the same sofa she hid behind. Waiting a moment to consider my options, I came up with three spots. I could hide in the attic, stretching out beneath the clutter to block Katelyn's view. The garage was also an option, since she probably wouldn't look in the <i>car</i>. Or I could go for the fallback: my closet. It was so obvious she might not look there.</span></div></div>",

Years of clutter were all stuffed in the small space, which would make it easier to hide. Of course part of me really didn't want to hide, to let her find me, but I would play the game if it made her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the cramped loft space, I took in the familiar sight. Stacks of boxes and shelves were all over the place, with tons of stuff just loose on the floor. Anything from deflated footballs to misfitting clothes to ancient art projects. There was a tray of crafts, with the googly eyes and feathers and q-tips, there was a curtain, there was a half-used roll of duct tape, there were sheets draped from the rafters a foot above my head. There was even a stool to the side of the room. And the list went on of all the stuff that was crammed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI searched for a decent hiding spot, scanning the room for something that would conceal me in a subtle way. In the end I decided that the best way to hide would be to get as low to the ground as possible, so I crawled under one of the collapsed curtains, squeezing between a pile of boxes and a shelf, my front resting on the wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling down to wait for Katelyn, I immediately thought of how childish this was. We were pretty much playing hide and seek, something I hadn't done in years. All too quickly I remembered that during those games I sucked at hiding because I couldn't take the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes listening to my heartbeat I heard footsteps ascending the stairs. When Katelyn stepped into the attic my breath caught in my throat, an old habit that never really worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you turn yourself in now,\" she said in a cheesy voice, \"I'll make sure that your sentence is softened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy view was blocked by the curtain draped over me, so all I had to go on was her breathing and the light padding of her footsteps. I heard them come right behind me, then stop as if she knew I was there...</span></div></div>",

Though she had just said she knew where to find me, her bared little feet were making off to the side of and behind me, out of my field of vision... Suddenly, I felt something wrapping around my shins. To my horror I realized that even though my body was well hidden, wrapped in the old curtain, my feet were likely still sticking out beyond my sanctuary. Another image flashed through my mind; the roll of duct tape I had seen earlier, lying innocently on a disused table.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I quickly tried to retract my legs as more layers of the sticky material were wrapped tightly around it, forcing them togethor. She apparently noticed, and I felt her hand seize my bare, exposed feet, forcing them back under her arm. \"Not so fast, Robber! We need to get some information out'a you first!\" More tape went around, and then several strips she stuck to my toes, stretching them out along the length of my foot, pulling the sensetive digits inexorably back. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I tried to back out of the curtain despite myself, but the same headlock on my ankles kept me form going backward as well as forward.\"Okay, Robber, got you! -Now tell me; where are all your friends hiding?\" She skittered her nails lightly on the taunt arch of one foot, and I burst into giggling. \"W-what? Hahahaha! Ack! Not the tohohoes!\" I heard her giggling in delight herself at my reaction as she ran her sharp little nails all over my feet, seemingly at random. She teased the skin at the tops of my toes for a few moments while I shook and wriggled in my cloth cocoon, struggling in the horribly confined space for some purchase I could use to manuever myself a bit with, straining against the duct-tape to close my toes from the tingling torture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hahaha! What are you talking about? Whahahaht friends?! Hahahah!\" I laughed as her nails poked and pinched lightly away at my toes, playing along. After lingering there for a while she drifted slowly back down my arch, scratching away instead now instead of simply poking and kneading. \"Ahahahhaha! Let me up! Oh kay- you've caught me! Hahaha!\" I yelled, feeling that little spot at the base of my arch, right where it met the heel, being deviously exploited by a group of concentrated, probing fingers. <br>\r\n'What do you mean, 'what friends'? I mean all those other ticklish criminals you run around with.\" Declared Katelyn, as I kept on shaking and laughing, rubbing against the floor and looking like I was trying to do the worm at some points when her fingers teased one of my many, many sweet spots. Even through the emotion-dominated, ticklish haze I was in, I wondered if she might have been serious about wanting to know about my friends. Come to think about it, I knew alot of ticklish people, some who might be happy to play a few games like this with us later...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was so distracted, exploring the possibilities, that it wa several seconds before I noticed the tickling had stopped. I craned my head over my shoulde, using the repreive to try and unwind the curtain from around me. It was embarassingly easy when I wasn't jerking around with those devilish little tickles coursing through me. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"C'mon out now, you bad, bad robber. We'll need to take you down to the station for proper questioning. And possibly sentencing.\" Katelyn called. I slid out, interupted briefly when she teased my legs and then my belly while my arms were still trapped. <br>\r\n\"Up you, come, robber. March!\" Still carrying the duct tape, she pushed me along in front of her as I shuffled, helping me down the stairs, and then to the area she had designated the 'station'.          <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I played along with her game, actually looking forward to what awaited me, as she handcuffed my hands to the headboard and my feet to the foot of the bed. There I was, stretched taught and naked at her mercy. \"Now, I'm going to ask you one more time, Where are your friends?\" She glared at me with a devious smile. \"What friends?\" Her grin nearly wrapped around her head as she said the name that put terror into my heart. \"Alicia, I think she would be a good interrogator while I'm at lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" there was no way you were letting that spoiled brat and her friends get their hands on you in a situation like this. Although you knew her number there was no way you were going to give it up. Katelyn straddled me and stroked my sides, eliciting a stream of soft giggles from me. \"I had a feeling you would be that way,\" she said, leaning over me. So sensitive was my skin I was already giggling as her long hair brushed my belly when she massaged it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nails skittered across my belly sending me into peals of frantic laughter. It tickled like nothing else I had ever felt before. My belly was already sensitive and this vile just made it too much.  My cute torturer was enjoying this way too much. Se was laughing nearly as much as me, she was so pleased with the result, all the while cooing, \"Tickle tickle tickle!\" Only making it worse. I was laughing way to hard to give any response at all or even form a complete thought. I looked into her eyes and knew that there was no stopping her. I tried as hard as I could to buck the younger girl off but her knees just clamped on and she seemed to enjoy the ride and strangely enough I think I was too. As torturous as it was, It was still extremely pleasurable and giving me a painful hard on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was left of my conscious thought scattered when she blew a raspberry on my tummy wiggling her slick tongue in my navel. I let out a high, less than manly scream. She stopped tickling, but it took me a few minutes to stop laughing. \"The number?\"</span></div></div>",

We reached the landing on the main floor of the house, and she started prodding me in the sides, directing me over to the living room. \"Okay, Robber, here we are at the station!\" She declared, still keeping with the pretenses of the game. \"Sit down on that chair and stretch yourself out, big-boy.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I dutifully sat down and raised my arms over my head, and she wasted no time in wrapping them in duct-tape, going over and around the tall head rest, tightly adhering my arms to it. She taped busily away at my shins, and then pulled the lever on the sides of the recliner, raising the foot rest, lowering the back rest, and pulling me out still further. \"There! Now, to start questioning you properly...\" I shifted in nervous anticipation as she lightly rested her painted fingernails on my belly, and then started lightly, slooowly dragging them down my sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I burst into giggles. My stomach had always been a particularlily sensitive spot, and I couldn't stop the continuous river of light laughter as her fingers gently danced around my abdomen, tracing shapes, elleptic circles and spirals, and slowly building momentum all the while. My laughing likewise picked up speed as her nails dug in deeper, swiftly poking my sides in succession. She joined all the fingers on her right hand togethor, forming a 'c' shape, and started rapidly digging them and her thumb into my sides. I verily exploded  with laughter, twisting sideways and reflexively yanking on my sticky restraints to escape. \"Awwww. Does the bad, bad wittle rober have a tickwish tummy?\" She taunted playfully, never remotely slowing as her other fingers skittered all over my other side, before heading up to knead my ribs. I was too busy laughing to respond, shaking and trembling as my nerves were driven crazy by her probing, flashing fingers. I squeezed my eyes shut under the onslaught, but opened them again abruptly as I felt the overwhelming tingling surge outwardsf rom a new point on my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The little sadist was twirling her fingers around in my navel! I sucked in my stomach, desperately trying to abort the tickling, but she was persistant. I clenched my teeth, determined to not give her the satisfaction of seeing me go crazy with laughter. Noticing my reddening expression, she brought in her other hand, putting the fingers to either side of my belly button and then pulling them apart, stretching my navel into an oval shape. And at least doubling its sensetivity.\"Oh, c'mon, robber. I can see it, give me a nice laugh now. You knooow you want too...\" She wormed her fingers around to accentuate her words, and I couldn't hold it in anymore. I shook with laughter, thrusting my body out, and then reversing and sucking my stomach in, struggling to throw her off. Despite my frantic writhing a, some part of me was obviously loving it, and I was faintly glad she was focusing all her attention above my waist. I shook, bounced, and virtually screamed with laughter at her techniques; scratching away at my underarms, kneading my ribs, digging into my belly, and probing my navel, endlessly, it seemed. It went on and on, and I was breaking a sweat just from exerting myself in my futile escape attempts, whens she finally, suddenly stopped, grinning like a maniac. \"Heheh. Now <i>that</i> was fun.

Then I invite them over and we both tickle you until you cough up a third number, and that person comes over until you cough up a fourth, etcetera etcetera.

Truth is, there were quite a few people who would like some\u00c2\u00a0vengeance on me for a few, uh, light tickles that may have occurred in the distant past. Still, I was too surprised to question it when she stopped. \"I'm starting to think I simply don't have enough arms to tickle you with. Fortunately, I came prepared.\" She turned and jogged out of the room, and once she was gone I struggled at the duct tape still holding me firmly against the chair. Hearing those words had given me an idea as to what she was going for - I had probably said something quite similiar myself in the past - and knew just how long I could typically last against that particular little implement...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My struggles came to naught, save reminding me why I rarely used duct-tape as a restraint (it was quite uncomfortable to reflexively pull away from) as Katelyn dashed back into the room and knealt at my feet. She was holding something I couldn't make out, and strapping it to my foot with duct-tape. I chortled at the slight feeling of bristles worming into the skin beween my toes, and hoped she wasn't using a toothebrush. Those devious little things tickled like mad in the right hands! She was onto the other foot by now, and I squirmed my toes to confound her efforts as best I could, and to avoid the little tickles that accompanied her work. Grinning evilly, she stepped back and looked over her handiwork. \"Well, big-boy, this ought to be fun! Ah, sometimes I feel so evil I could just torture myself!\" With that announcement, she leaned forward and touched something on my feet.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tickles exploded upwards through my body without warning. I burst into renewed laughter as my nerves lit up, all yelling out the primal message 'Make it stop!'. My body struggled to fulfill that command, and I bucked and writhed desperately but futiley. I could feel dozens of tiny, stiff little bristles working away furiously in the space between my biggest and second toes on my right foot, and the base of the arch on my left foot. \"Ahahahahaha! You little monster! Ahahahah! I'll get you for thihihis!\" Katelyn wasn't even looking at my face though, simply examining my twitching feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know, I can't help but feel like I'm forgetting something to go with this...Oh! That's right!\" She pulled out a few more pieces of tape, pressing the instruments of tickle - which I was now fairly certain were electric toothbrushes - harder into my sensetized flesh. \"And, while I'm at it, remeber you can always stop this by giving me a number. Though I can't promise I won't use this technique when your friend gets here!\"\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ahahahah! Turn them off! Turn them offhoffhoff!!! Ahahahah!\" As determined as I was to not give her the satisfaction of surrendering, and fairly used to tickling, I still hadn't been tickled like this in a long, long time. And as I felt myself tearing up, the idea finally came to be in the back of my mind that if I gave her a number, perhaps whoever she wound up calling might decide to get their revenge later and actually spring me now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that in mind, I quickly gasped out a number when Katelyn held up a third brush and started lowering it towards my navel. \"That's it?

She was a technical genius, and could whip up an array of interesting, unique tools in a shockingly short time. While she had been able to breach the 'Can-Not-Tickle-Self' barrier with her machines, she had felt that the testing would be much more efficient if she had had another subject to work on.<br>\r\n          <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And that was where I came in. I had provided the nerve ending and vocal cords for all kinds of bizarre devices and techniques. She usually respected limits, but I also knew first-hand how merciless she could be on a body when it's strapped to a rack right in front of her. And then there was that one time when I had come over and, noticing how she had just finished some new kind of tickle-table before dozing off, decided to help her experiment along by gently proceeding to- Well, it's in the past now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There was nothing to do but wait, it seemed, and Katelyn was nice enough to get both of us a drink of water. She then removed my leg restraints, piece by piece, before yanking my legs individually  farther out to the sides and re-taping them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"It wouldn't be good manners to wait until you're girlfriend showed up before we do this, would it?

Since when did anyone like you know that phrase?\" I asked her, trying to re-direct the conversation. Katelyn giggled to herself and said, \"Only the best movie of our time, FRED.\" I didn't know how respond to that and I heard Cat's door as well as my door open.

It should be under my matress, it has the final parts of my machine in it.

I rubbed my wrists and said, \"Couldn't you two have been a little more careful about that?\" To which she replied with a, \"Come on\" as she guided me towards their stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Read the other Cat chapters for a better idea of the room.) Cat's basement looked mostly as it had the last time I had come over. Machines, Chair machines, Portable machines, Bits and Bobs, as well as some fetishy gear hidden away. But the main diffrence was the large examination table at the far side of the room. The table had various arms mounted to its sides, next to it was a server rack on wheels, and nearby was a desk with a computer on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be thankful, you're the first subject that will ever have their brain monitored while this tecnique is performed.\" Cat said as she moved some things around in the cluttered room. \"Anyways, just lay down on the table, i'll do the rest.\" She said nochalantly as she booted up the computer.\"</span></div></div>",

I allowed myself a few breaths before settling down and staying quiet, eager for this game to end one way or the other. Minutes passed into hours, and after a few of those hours (during one of which she returned to the attic and almost found me again) Katelyn, both annoyed and frustrated, called out to me.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY!

Although she seemed a little disappointed that she had lost the game and wouldn't get to tickle me, to my surprise she seemed to get much more cheery and peppy about her upcoming ordeal as soon as she walked into my room and plopped onto my bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, this is comfy...\" she said, feigning a yawn as she collapsed on the bed, the springs creaking slightly. While I walked to my closet to throw on some clothes, she opened an eyelid and spied a box next to my bed. She reached down open up and burst into giggles, \"Wow, you came prepared, big boy!\" she laughed as she emptied the box of feathers, rope, brushes and an assortment of other tickle tools. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding into a pair of shorts, I flushed darkly. I wanted Katelyn to be laughing, and I admitted she had kind of a cute laugh of the soft melodic giggly variety, but her making fun of me was rather not how I wanted it to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dug into the box and considered showing her the ropes, but ultimately decided on the scarves instead. In my experience scarves chaffed far less and were better for light and teasing tickling and the way I figured it, since she had been teasing me so much, it was my turn to get a bit of teasing in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be so cocky if I were you...\" I said, as I reached over and tied her wrists to the bed posts. I leaned down and whispered in her ear, \"Get ready to start squealing.\" I said it in what I thought was quite a menacing tone, but she responded this to blowing a loud raspberry in my face. I guess in hindsight, trying to spook a master of pranks was not a very good idea, who knows how many boys and girls Katelyn and her gang of tickle-happy comrades had tormented over the years?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling under my breath, I finished tying down her ankles and stepped back to admire my handiwork. I had left her with a little bit of slack so she could squirm and wiggle a bit, but she wasn't really going anyway unless I had grossly underestimated how strong she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while Katelyn might have not been my first choice of tickle-prey, she was still a very good catch and especially so if we were about to spend a month together in the same house. She was definitely cute, with her long hair and bright blue eyes she was already smiling and wiggling her socked feet in anticipation. Her blue tank top exposed her underarms nicely, and her shorts exposed much of her long legs (I also found it rather somewhat demoralizing that this middle-school girl was nearly as tall as I was, what were they feeding these kids these days?).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Bring it on, big boy. Do your worst. Just don't forget, I'll be sure to get you back,\" she said with a wide smile, completely unafraid and, dare I say it, excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just have to make sure to get you extra good then,\" I grinned back, \"but let's make this a little more interesting,\" I said as I slipped a blindfold over her head. In my extensive experience that always brought about more... entertaining results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... where should I start?\" I said speaking aloud as I looked up and down her ticklish and exposed body. She still had a defiant mischievous smirk on her face, and I looked to remove that ASAP.</span></div></div>",

I had tied them together at the ankles for easier access. I was truly surprised by what Katelyn said next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, my feet aren't as ticklish as my tummy anyway,\" Katelyn shrugged nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped the movement of my trailing fingers for a moment just to digest what she just said. \"Wait, did you just give away your most ticklish spot? You're new at this, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, maybe I did, or maybe it's a terrific bluff. Or maybe it's a terrific double-bluff, who knows?\" she laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, she wasn't supposed to be the one playing the mind games, I was! That's not how these usually go, but as I sat there pondering I realized I had fallen into her trap and was wasting valuable tickle time. The penalty for losing the game of Cops and Robbers was one hour of tickling, and I had already wasted ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, I'm not falling for that one,\" I said as I sat down at the foot of the bed and yanked her socks off, revealing her bare feet. They were cute, long and slender and her short, neatly trimmed toenails were painted with a glossy dark blue polish that matched her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, since you're such a fan of games, how about we play one here? It's called 'Don't laugh',\" I explained as using just one fingernail I lightly traced down the arch of her left foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just use two fingers, but if you laugh, I get to use all ten,\" I declared as I immediately began grazing her across her feet with just my two index fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how do I win?\" Katelyn began to ask, but she had to gasp and bite her lower lip to start herself from giggling as I had just snuck a finger in-between her big toe and second toe and was slowly teasing the soft flesh in between that wasn't used to being touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you last five minutes I'll let you go,\" I said with a big grin in my voice, feeling fairly convinced she wouldn't possibly last that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up and I saw her competitive streak in full effect as she bit her lip and seemed determine to not lose. It was rather adorable really as she curled her pretty toes up and tried to withstand the two tormenting fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracing my two fingers over both soles, I made circles, letters, numbers and sometimes just random squiggles, my fingertips and nails lightly scratching, slowly massaging. Every now and then she would shiver and let out an almost inaudible squeak which I felt would be cruel to disqualify her on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes I would focus my slow tinkling tickles on one foot and her poor little feet would flap and wiggle, one crossing over the other in a vain attempt to protect it. This only had the highly amusing effect of leaving the protector vulnerable, as I would simply then tickle the other foot, forcing the roles to reverse in desperation, repeating an endless cycle of ticklish agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, that's so cuuuute,\" I teased her, as she did the foot protecting thing again. I had been teasing her feet slowly, but now she was getting dangerously close to victory so I let her fingers go wild tickling her long arches rapidly all over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatelyn jolted as she felt this powerful high-octane attack and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looks like now I get to use both hands, and all ten fingers,\" I announced, chuckling. Now my fingers were working fast, over both feet. I went for the kill, as I immediately dragged my nails up and down Katelyn's soft soles, not stopping till I heard her burst into hysterical uncontrollable laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, for the first few strokes she managed to endure my attack, merely flinching and gasping as I dragged my fingernails up her arches. I started off going from her heels to along the ball of the foot and back again, but once I added her blue-painted toes to the mix the flood gates opened as she burst into schoolgirl giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that it was a soft spot for her, I then switched to targeting each of Katelyn's toes, pinching them, wiggling them, and scraping along the top of them. To my delight, Katelyn yelped with each pinch, giggled from each wiggle and bounced on the bed from each scrape as she tried to escape the tickling. I was starting to really have fun as I began to flick my fingernails across Katelyn's toes, easily tickling each one with a casual flick of a fingernail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you I would have you laughing before long,\" I smirked as I continued to play with her long toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much fun as it was, permanently traumatizing middle-school students was something I generally tried to avoid, so it seemed prudent to give her a little break. Of course every now and then I casually stroked her foot to \"keep her on her toes\" in both a figurative and literal sense as she panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was totally unfair,\" Katelyn pouted after she caught her breath. \"You totally used more than two fingers at the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what you're talking about,\" I said, whistling. \"But tell you what. I'm not totally without mercy, so I'll give you another chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Katelyn grit her teeth and clench her toes determinedly, I shook my head, laughed and spoke again, \"Nah, playing the same game in a row would be far too boring.

Being blindfolded, she didn't see it coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh. It's not exactly a complicated game, I thought you big boys were meant to be smart?\" Katelyn replied cheekily. It seemed her mischievousness had not been tickled out of her quite yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, for this game, we'll be playing it with a little twist,\u201d I grinned. \u201cKeep your foot still. Let's make sure it\u2019ll write.\u201d Just as Katelyn began asking what on Earth I was talking about I tapped the tip to Katelyn\u2019s left heel and began scribbling right to left very swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response was instantaneous, and carried a much more frantic sound than I had anticipated. Immediately, Katelyn responded with \u201cOhohohoho\u201d followed by wave after wave of hysterical giggles. Luckily (for me, not her), ink did not immediately flow forth from the pen, which meant I had to dutifully continue the tickling,. I chuckled, I wasn't really in a hurry in sparing the ticklish girl from such apparently tremendous sensations. Her reactions were so entertaining that I half-considered getting a camera and recording this to show some friends. Tragically, I only had about twenty minutes of the hour left, and I didn't really want to take advantage of the girl TOO much, now did I? And if I did, who knew what she'd do in retaliation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop fidgeting,\" I said sternly as Katelyn's foot wiggled and squirmed. \"If you mess it up, I'll have to wash it off and start again,\" I said, though truthfully I don't think I would've really minded writing on Katelyn's feet all day long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatelyn let out a whimper that sounded remarkably like a puppy before grumbling and bracing herself as the pen began stroking her left heel again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the ink had run forth, blackening her light colored sole ever so slightly; I continued the motions for several seconds more, though, watching Katelyn squirm was adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I gotta draw the rest of the board, don't move\u201d I said as my hand moved to the toes of Katelyn\u2019s left foot, pushing them back so the sole was pulled taut. Despite anticipating the strokes of the pen, Katelyn's foot still jolted as tip of the pen struck the ball of her foot, nearly ruining my line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, I quickly zipped lines up her arches and just under the ball of the foot. Then I repeated the same action on the other foot so we had two playing boards. They weren't quite perfect due to Katelyn's ticklishness, but they were legibl and hey, no need to be picky. I wasn't exactly designing rockets here. They'd do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, the board's finally done. Basically, it\u2019s Tic-Tac-Toe, pardon the pun. As I'm sure you've worked out, the board will be your feet,\u201d I said, smiling as I admired my penmanship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d Katelyn said, still panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to try explaining the rest of the rules, but Katelyn complained loudly: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow am I supposed to play if I can\u2019t seehehehehehe!\u201d Annoyed that I was interrupted, I began to quickly scratch at Katelyn\u2019s big toe on her right foot with my free hand, watching the toe flex and twitch violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I please continue?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Yehehes!\u201d she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. I won\u2019t stop then,\u201d I sniggered, continuing to tickle the toe for several seconds, \u201cAnyway as I was saying, I'll play fair. Hell, I'll even give you an advantage. We'll play two games, leftie and rightie,\" I said, poking each foot with the pen for emphasis. \"If I get three in a row, I win. If I don't, you win. If you win one and I win one, we go to sudden death. I think I'm being pretty reasonable here,\" I said with a smirk. Perhaps calling this game \u201cfair\u201d was a bit of a stretch. Katelyn was at a bit of a ticklish disadvantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I win?\" Katelyn said, sounding very confident in her abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 if you win, I\u2019ll let you tickle me,\u201d I shrugged. To be honest I wouldn't mind losing that much either. It was a perfect win-win situation. \u201cIf you lose, you tell my parents that I've been as radiant as sunshine this month. Sound good?\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a very curious smile on her face as she accepted the conditions. \"I'm so gonna whoop you, big boy. I'm the Tic-Tac-Toe queen in my math class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered for a second what kind of math class she was in if they spent all their time playing Tic-Tac-Toe before replying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's play.\"</span></div></div>",

Just sthahahap it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said feigning confusion, \"What am I doing?\" This was too fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just gohohohoho alreheheheady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYehehehes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have an advantage then, you know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust gohohoho big bohohoy! I dohohohont care hahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, oh fine, if you insist, I always was a sucker for cute girls,\u201d I said with a sinister smile adorning my face. I studied the hand-drawn board intently and began thinking outloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 do I want to go here\u2026\u201d I mused as scratched at the top left corner of the box of Katelyn\u2019s left foot, causing her to giggle again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr\u2026 maybe I should go here\u2026\u201d I spoke again, this time picking the far right, middle box, which fell upon the spot just under the ball of Katelyn\u2019s ticklish foot, where I began to scratch that sensitive and difficult to protect piece of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatelyn laughed harder, sporadically wiggling her toes to wrinkle her skin in an attempt to protect it. \u201cArgh, darn it, I just can\u2019t decide\u2026\u201d I said drawing it out, continuing to scratch at random boxes while Katelyn was bouncing wildly on my bed, buckling from the tickling..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJustehehehe just goho!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFiiiine.\u201d Choosing the central box, I slowly and carefully drew the circle, marking that part of Katelyn\u2019s sole her own, in addition to blackening it with that silky ink which glistened so nicely upon her bare foot. Doing this elicited such lovely sounds of laughter that I didn\u2019t want to stop, so I traced her circle several times, almost making the board a complete mess due to Katelyn\u2019s fidgeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou young people these days... Always fidgeting and squirming. You almost messed up the board, and then we\u2019d need to start over\u2026\u201d I said mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig boy, I swear I am going to get you back for this. Where did you move?\u201d She asked, grumbling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI went right here, in the center\u2026\u201d Again, unable to resist, I began to lightly scratch at Katelyn\u2019s foot, this time denoting where I went; in the center of the board, which was also the center of the arch of Katelyn\u2019s foot. \u201cNow, if you want, you can go here\u2026\u201d I said, tracing my finger from the space she had tortured to the one directly to its right, scratching at it. \u201cOr you could go here\u2026\u201d I said giggling as I teased her some more, now lightly tickling the flesh denoted by the top right corner again, as Katelyn continued to giggle in a pool of laughter on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere?\u201d I asked playfully, scratching at the spot Katelyn had indicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Yehehes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you absolutely sure?\u201d I asked again, continuing to play with her sensitive soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYehehehes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, ok! Jeez, there's no need to yell. You act like someone is tickling you, or something,\u201d I said with a broad grin on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was too cute. I wonder if we could play this every day till my parents came back. Picking up the pen, I slowly, deliberately,filled the blank space with one slash, making sure to trace it repeatedly to get the most laughter out of Katelyn, finally moving on to the next slash after several torturous strokes of the pen. With the X complete, I chose my next location, the top left spot, filling it in with a ticklish circle as Katelyn laughed lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I went\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. I knohahahahahahah!\u201d Despite her pleads of insisting she knew where I had just gone, I still scratched at the spot, causing poor Katelyn to wiggle helplessly on the bed. \u201cThe bottom left hahaha! To blohahahack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another sinister smile, I stopped torturing Katelyn, simply saying ok. A crafty idea had just crept into my head, and I chose to follow it up. With the pen, I began to blacken the bottom left space with Katelyn\u2019s X, knowing full well that she had meant for the other corner, but she had literally said left. As her senior, who would teach her the importance of being specific if not me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhahahahat! Not there! Not thereheheher! The other sihihihide!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh. You meant YOUR left! Oh well.\u201d Slowly, I moved from the far left box to the far right, letting the tip of the pen lightly caress the ball of Katelyn's foot to allow Katelyn to revel in her own ticklishness for just a little longer. When the pen gently touched the far right box, I slowly filled it with my circle, and then drew a long thorough deliberate line connecting the three circles, before drawing the pen back up it, forcing Katelyn to laugh as the line was repeatedly drawn. Finally I decided to give Katelyn a break. \u201cI win.\u201d I proclaimed proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cheated! You totally cheated, big boy,\u201d Katelyn said back between pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said left,\u201d I said innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI meant the other left!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo bad. Onto game two. Y'know, I almost hope you win this one, because then we'll play sudden death...\" I said with a evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sudden death?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I think we should try playing a deciding game of Tic-Tac-Toe on your tummy, don't you? I think that'd be the most appropriate way to end this,\" I pondered, an evil idea forming in my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was trying to win this round, I was just going to have fun with the most ticklish spots on her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few giggles later, it was Katelyn's turn and she answered quickly, clearly not going to fall for the same tickling tricks again. \"The one, right below your one,\" she said calmly. You had to be impressed with her, still as confident as ever.That was okay with me though, as I scrawled her circle below my X and filed it in, making sure I completely filled the circle with ink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was enough to get her squeaking with laughter again as used the pen to stroke an X above the ball of her foot, another good spot to torment. The cycle repeated, with her trying to win, and me trying to just tease her ticklish soles as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like you aren't that bad after all,\" I said, smiling as we had filled every square on the board without anyone winning. Katelyn was still breathless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a tie. Time for sudden death, overtime,\" I said as I stood up from my comfy spot at her feet. I took a fleeting glance at her pretty feet with their blue toenail polish before figuring this wouldn't be the last time this month that I would get this opportunity. Hell, I might even have to help her scrub of all that ink later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her squirming and her laughter it seemed she had dislodged the blindfold as she stared straight into my eyes, her blue eyes sparkling playfully. \"Well? Bring it on, big boy.\" she smiled, looking a little winded, but still every bit as confident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea,\" I said as I rolled up her blue tank top to expose her stomach. \"Looks ticklish,\" I teased, poking her belly, \"I wonder just how ticklish the button is,\" I said as I began to trace a circle with my index finger around her bellybutton, slowly gradually getting closer and closer to the bellybutton. I looked up as she bit her lit cutely and tried to keep her giggles in, her eyes keep darting to my hand and then to me. She seems to be anticipating my attacks and almost... looking forward to them? I noticed that even though I had given her plenty of slack, she wasn't squirming to get her stomach away from the tickling. She just laid there, taking the tickling and laughing mirthfully. I wondered, was she starting to enjoy this as much as I was? Had she always enjoyed it? She was the first who had made the first tickle move, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last minute, right before my finger was about to delve into her belly, I pulled my hand away. Katelyn had tensed up, and she suddenly deflated and flopped on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you stop?\" she asked, sounding disappointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like me tickling you?\" I said, amazed at this turn of events. If it turned out that way, maybe there'd be even more opportunities and chances, and maybe fewer one hour restrictions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... actually...\" she said, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I leaned in close to hear her, and that's when it hit me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I mean literally hit me. Apparently sometime during her struggling the scarves came loose, and she managed to stay still enough when I was tickling her tummy that I didn't notice that she was no longer restrained. Catching me completely off-guard, she sprung explosively from the bed and leapt on me, straddling my hips as she began burrowing her fingers into my sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'd rather tickle you. That was a lot of fun, much more than I thought it'd be, but now I think it's my turn,\" she said, over the sound of my laughter. While I was tickling her, I had had the sense to put some shorts and a t-shirt on, but they didn't do much to deter her tickling efforts, especially when she slipped her fingers under my shirt and gave my ribs a good kneading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate to escape, I tried to stand up or crawl out, but she grappled me, all the while still wiggling a devious finger in my bellybutton. Bursting with laughter but unable to squirm free I stood up, took a few shaky steps and promptly collapsed back onto the bed. Unfortunately for me, a revitalized Katelyn landed on top, maintaining her advantage. Using her knees to hold my arms down, she began to glide and wiggle her long fingernails across my exposed tummy, paying particular attention to the area around the bellybutton. My arms were still free but due to the awkward way I had landed and my growing hysterics I barely had the strength to lift them as I bucked and squirmed under Katelyn's nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few frantic moments I resigned to the laughter. This was just as fun, and after all I'd put her through she deserved some form of reward. After a while, she gave me a brief respite, laughing triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, big boy, where should I go next? I'm thinking...\"</span></div></div>",

I mean you had so much fun tickling my feet, didn't you?\" she said, after she was certain she had tickled the resistance out of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that I had completely exhausted myself with laughter, Katelyn climbed off me and made her way over to the side of the bed where my feet were resting off of. She sat down on my ankles so my feet were trapped between her legs. I knew I could sit up and her flanks would be totally exposed, but I was too tired to fight back from the brutal tickling that my tummy and sides I had already received. Besides, I was a little bit curious to see how she would approah this. Seeing how Katelyn acted as a victim, I was interested to see what she was like as the torturer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, you have pretty feet for a guy, and they seem pretty ticklish too,\" she purred as she clawed her nails up and down my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeahahahah,\" I replied, twisting as I felt her nails being dragged more enthusiastically over my bare arches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, I bet your feet are totally more ticklish than mine,\" she said with a playful grin as she sifted her fingers through my toes and began tormenting the flesh in-between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI caught what she was getting at as she looked back whilst still tickling me. \"Wahahahanna bet?\" I said, still chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she was sitting was so that although my legs now supported her entire weight, which restricting any movement, her bare feet were easily within arm's reach, and they were in no position to move without freeing my legs. I think she new this and planned it beforehand, but I didn't care as I reached down and started tracing the tic-tac-toe boards still drawn on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lehehets go, bihihig boy,\" she challenged, giggling as she felt my fingers began to trace familiar patterns on her soft inky white soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I had already extensively tickled her feet before, I had both an advantage and disadvantage. My experience meant that I knew plenty of hotspots that I knew would drive Katelyn dizzy with laughter. Of course, the disadvantage was that the extensive tickling of her feet meant I had probably numbed a few of her spots with the incessant and persistent teasing. Contrary to popular belief, tickling the same spot over and over again didn't actually work that well. Oh, and there was the chance that my feet could actually be more ticklish than Katelyn's, a possibility I was becoming mirthfully aware of as she began tickling the tops of my wriggling bare feet making me burst into boyish giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my focus onto her bare feet as they scrunched up protectively, not wanting me to attack the very vulnerable spots under and in-between her toes, but thankfully I knew a cure for that. I patiently stroked her long arches till her toes flexed and opened before slipping my fingers in and giving her digits a good tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing fairly convinced this would have been enough to defeat her, I was surprised when Katelyn merely giggled with laughter before applying the same ticklish attack to me. Tickling my toes till they curled up, then stroking my arches till my toes opened and diving in again. Even more annoying was how effective it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, judging from Katelyn's legs twitched and flinched as I continued teasing her pretty feet, I knew she couldn't take much more, but even so, I was still again completely caught by surprise when she suddenly dove backwards and began to squeeze my sides in a final attempt to regain the upper hand. Screaming with laughter, my only answer was to grab her newly exposed sides to attempt to counterattack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nohohoh more!\", I said completely worn out by the tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehenough!\", she cried, flopping on the bed alongside me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were both pretty tired and still gasping and letting out the occasional giggle. We both looked at each and smiled warmly at each other, taking a well-deserved and well-earned break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually broke the silence, \"You definitely gave up before me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You totally did. I won that round,\" she insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was absolutely a tie,\" I vehemently denied, raising my hands threateningly to poke her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh, fine,\" she conceded, \"a tie.\" She giggled as we both stared at each other. \"That was fun though, wasn't it, big boy?\" she said, sounding as mischievous as ever.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We''ll play another game after lunch, okay? It's too early for this kind of thing,\" I replied with a big yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. I'll make lunch, mkay? See you downstairs,\" she said, sitting up and walking out. I noticed she had ignored her socks and just veered straight for the exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess she figures she won't need them later,\" I thought happily. \"Looks like I have a very fun month ahead of me...\" </span></div></div>",

My closet would be a good enough hiding spot, and, if neccessary, ambush point. I was trying to recall the rules to 'Cops 'n Robbers', but hadn't actually played the game in years. Something about the 'robbers' only being able to hide from the 'cops'?Some revenge would be nice though, and I would like to see just how ticklish Katelyn was....<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once in my room, I put on some underwear on a wim, still not comfortable being totally nude around a complete stranger. I pulled open my closet, and grabbed a few implements I found handy to have around - feathers and such - before stepping in and crawling to the back. Either she could tickle me with these when she found me, or they would come in handy should plan B be considered. Burying myself under a pile of clothes, I tried to get comfortable and listened. I could hear her drawing closer already, doors opening and closing as she searched and cleared rooms nearby. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, I heard the one to my own bedroom open. \"Hmm, that rotten robber's probably hiding out in here. Now where could he be...?\" I heard some faint noises coming from beyond my hideaway - perhaps she was checking under my bed or something- then, I could just make out a widening ray of light as my closet door was inched open. \"What? I could have sworn I heard him in here somewhere...\" She took a step forward and began prodding at the piles of junk and clothes. Her probing fingers reached my own sanctuary, and passed through the outer layer of garments to make contact with my side. I strained, but couldn't avoid a light chuckle at that.  \"I think I got him nooow,\" she purred, poking more vigourously, and bringing her second hand in. I started laughing a bit harder as both sets of fingers teased me, and curled up into a tighter ball to protect my belly.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few more moments of being tickled like this, I stood up. \"Okay, cop. You caught me.\" She looks me over and then frowned.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hay! I told you not to put on any clothes!\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh dear. Should I be punished for that?\" I replied jokingly. Katelyn just grinned and reached into a bag at her feet, pulling out several short lengths of rope.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, you bad, bad robber. Come over here and lie down.\" She motioned to my bed. As I complied, she pulled some more items out of the bag, but I couldn't quite make out what they were. \"Now, stretch yourself out, and close your eyes.\" I finally got a good look at the rope - it made two loops, one at either end, cleverly knotted back to the main segment. It looked oddly like a pair of handcuffs...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I realized this as she slipped one of my wrists through one of the loops, and the other loop went around one of the bed-posts. She noticed me watching her busily restraining me and said \"I'm sorry robber, but I told you no peeking!\" She pulled something - some length of fabric over my head, blocking my vision - and I felt more rope handcuffs going over my other arm and over my ankles. I twisted slightly in my restraints, testing the bonds. Not too tight, maybe she wanted me to have a little wriggle room. That belief was swiftly dispelled when I began to feel the ropes tightening, stretching me out spread-eagled on my bed, hardly able to twitch. My helplessness was brought home when she idly swirled a finger on my abs, making me chuckle and strain, but all I could dowais lay there prone as she asked \"So, you naughty robber, where should we start punishing you?\"          </span></div></div>",

She may have been a stranger, but she was a cute one and already showed interest in my ticklishness. Why would I turn down an opportunity like this? Besides, some revenge scenarios were running through my mind, and I liked the look of them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly there was a flurry of motion in my left underarm, and I screeched rather girlishly before breaking down into laughter. My immediate instinct was to jolt to my right, but restrained so thoroughly I didn't even scooch a centimeter. Unable to escape, my armpit was nice and still for Katelyn's dancing fingers. They were only the gentlest and lightest touches with the tips of her nails, but that made it all the worse.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0More nails fluttered across my belly, and my laughter increased in volume. Touches flew across my abs, my sides, and even going to the waistband of my boxers and scratching the skin between my stomach and hips. A couple of fingers dove into my navel and explored it, bringing forth gales of laughter.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aww, is the bad, bad robber just a little bit ticklish?\" I heard Katelyn say, her voice by my ear. \"Should've listened to me big boy.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The combination of her tickling and her intimacy brought forth my usual reaction, and before long there was a nice tent pitched between my legs.

Blood rushed to my cheeks.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And who's your friend here?\" Katelyn asked in a whisper, her mouth almost in my ear, her breath caressing my neck.

I wonder why you tried to hide him...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her hand was pulling my underwear, about to expose my excitement to the world...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And both her hands stopped.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But that can wait,\" she whispered to me, her voice hushed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bed gave way as she put one knee on the edge, then both. Scooting over to my tied body, she brought one leg over and straddled me stomach, her hand resting on either side of my head. Katelyn leaned in right next to me, so close that her cheek brushed mine, red as a tomato.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...laugh for me big boy.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Instantly her hands darted to my hollows, scribbling all over, pushing me into hysteria completely. My laughter rocketed up in pitch, as did my instinctive efforts to escape. The latter failed horribly, and my immobile pits made perfect targets for Katelyn.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She didn't spend very long there, traveling down to my ribs, focusing on delicately tracing each and every crevice she could find. My hips tried to buck, but in my weakened and hysterical state I couldn't shake her. She wasn't even fazed as she went about her tickling with a passionate lust I'd rarely seen before. Her energetic scribbling was interrupted occasionally by lazy dragging and pokes, all keeping me in a perpetual mania.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You like this, don't you big boy?\" she asked, continuing to torment my ribs. \"Now, should I go meet your little friend, or find something else to make this more fun?\"</span></div></div>",

The bizarre sensation of the tickling pulsing through me instead of moving in the uneven 'static' that hands were likely to produce or the constant blaze of an electric toothbrush did nothig to lower it's effectiveness, and I was once again uselessly shaking in an attempt to nock her hands away. \"Hahahaahah!

It almost sounded like the padlock to the front door was being manipulated somehow. Was it possible that my parents had returned from their vacation already? Or could it have been my sister, home early from our cousin's house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile being discovered by my family in my birthday suit would be embarrassing for all involved, there was another, far more insidious possibility... someone was trying to break into our house! Afterall, there HAD been that recent prison break-out on the news, and there were rumors of an artifact missing from the local museum. But I dismissed the idea as too outlandish. While we were relatively well-off, there was no way someone would target our mediocre-looking house. So, I decided to head upstairs and put on some casualwear. \"Must be the wind,\" I muttered to myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the clanking got louder. I froze, and despite my best efforts to rationalize it, it was clear someone was fiddling with the door's lock. Feeling especially vulnerable while naked, I decided to grab whatever clothing I could and confront whoever was at the door. Unfortunately, all I could find was a comical chef's apron with the words \"Kiss the Cook\" plastered on its front. But it was better than nothing, and I quickly put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had barely cinched the draw-strings when I heard an ominous THUNK from the front foray. The lock was released! Panicking, I grabbed the nearest 'weapon' I could find... a spatula. Wielding it as a miniature battle-axe, I raced to the front door, hoping against hope that it was merely my parents returning early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked open, and a figure stood in the threshold.

I was part-shocked, part-scared, but mostly confused... for it was a rather stunning red-headed woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in a full-body leather catsuit, her cinnamon locks practically glowed in the early morning light. Her body was that of an athlete; slim but muscular, with curves in all the right places. The zipper to her body-hugging suit was pulled down to her chest, revealing ivory-white cleavage with just a smattering of freckles along the top. Her face was angular yet feminine, and her lips were a ruby-red that matched her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was too stunned to even dive for cover, and the intruder instantly spotted me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell,\" she murmured in a rich, cultured British accent. \"This house was supposed to be empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her words, I didn't sense much hostility... mostly annoyance. As if to emphasize the point, she sighed deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a change in plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step towards me, and finally my muscles sprung into action... and I collapsed onto my rear end, stuttering like an imbecile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are y-you?\" I squeaked out, with about as much manliness as a kitten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman tilted her head, and a small smile appeared on her thick full lips. \"I am Saeva Dupont, world-reknown art thief,\" she stated, as if it were common knowledge. She glanced at my apron, and smiled a little more. \"And you appear to be a chef who cooks in the nude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking my head dumbly, I muttered, \"Uh...no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaeva  sighed, clearly more amused with the situation than anything. \"Well, then perhaps you can help me out, my nude little man. You see, my scouting reported that this home of yours would be empty for the next several months. I had intended to use it as my safehouse during my next heist, but now there appears to be a wrinkle in my plans...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at the woman before me, trying to think of something witty to say. Unfortunately, all I did was nod ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how about this,\" Saeva said with her aluring accent, \"I use your house, and you don't interfere with my preparations.

The sexy thief listened calmly to my response before eventually asking \"Are you sure this is your answer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certain,\" I replied, folding my arms and smirking at her, as if she'd walk out just because a half naked guy ordered her to. Instead, she reached over and slammed the door shut, prompting me to suddenly realise I was alone, half naked with a wanted criminal. My mouth gaped open as I realised just how much trouble I was in when Saeva pulled something out a thin tube from a pocket on her outfit. It was as long as her hand and made of black plastic. I stared at it in confusion before Saeva pressed a button on the side, shooting out a group of thin wires that wrapped around my torso, trapping my arms against my body completely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Wh-What's this?!\" I demanded, my bravado having left me entirely as the thin wires left me unable to pull my arms away from my body in the slightest. I was so stunned, her next shot caught me completely by surprise, this time the wires wrapping around my shins. I stumbled in place and only just about managed to keep my balance, that is until Saeva reached over and gently poked me in the shoulder, sending me tumbling backwards onto the carpet below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding on my rear with a thump, I grimaced and wriggled desperately, trying to pull my hands and legs free but without any luck whatsoever. Saeva blew the end of the device like a cowboy with his gun before giving me a wide grin. \"A neat little toy of mine, very handy in a whole host of circumstances I think you'd agree.\" She sat down beside my feet, looking as if she was enjoying every moment of this, which wouldn't have surprised me \"Now, time to renegotiate our deal,\" she announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous about what she'd do, I was open to whatever suggestion she had. \"What did you have in mind?\" I asked, just about stopping myself from shrieking in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You allow me to use your home as a safehouse over the next few weeks and tell me where all the goods in the neighborhood are,\" she said before reaching down and flicking her nails over my bare feet. \"Or I give you the Kootchie Koo treatment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden tickling took me completely by surprise and I let out a less than manly shriek of laughter from the teasing on my soles. Instantly, Saeva's eyes lit up and her fingers continued the ticklish assault, lazily dragging over my soles as they teased and stroked my feet at a snail's pace. But even that was enough to make me howl with laughter, my highly ticklish soles feeling every electric shock go through them as she lightly teased and tickled me from heel to the base of my soles, my bonds not allowing me to do more than yank and twitch from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was worse was the fact that the tickling was having its usual arousing effect on me and I could feel a swiftly growing erection press against the apron. Saeva hadn't noticed it yet, but she would in time. She had a look of pure glee on her face as her nails tickled my feet, causing me to laugh hard as I felt the heat grow in my cheeks from laughing so much as well as the heat in my loins grow from the tickling itself. \"Well then,\" she said after some time. \"Do we have a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even having to think, I screamed out...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I took care to make sure that the minimum amount of my head was exposed as I watched the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the person entered the house and, I have to admit, gave me something of a pleasant surprise. Rather than a huge, intimidating figure, there was instead a rather attractive looking Goth girl. From the looks of it, I put her down as about eighteen years old and she was quite tall. She had long black hair tied into pigtails on either side of her head, bright green eyes and a rather attractive face. She wore slip on shoes and long striped stockings that went up to her knees along with a small black skirt that showed off quite a bit of her thighs.

Actually, I think I would like to take the law into my own hands, and I was betting this goth girl was plenty ticklish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart throbbed as she glanced inside the kitchen, worried she might be about to draw a knife or something, but she only glanced in for a second before coming back out and walking towards the sitting room.

It was for the first day of summer vacation: their parents were driving deep downtown to spend the day with some old friends, and they didn't want their daughters feeling neglected or running around the friends' apartment (the latter of which I thought was more likely).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shot up and threw off the covers, checking the clock as I did. Upon reading the digits, I immediately vented a huge sigh of relief. The clock read 9:45. I didn't have to be at the house until 10:15. It was half an hour away, but the house was literally right down the street. Still, it couldn't hurt to be ready.

To be honest, I was surprised that I got the offer to babysit. One of the girls was thirteen, surely old enough to look after her sister and herself. It's not like the parents were staying out overnight or anything. And why had they left a note on our mailbox instead of just coming and talking to us?

She was of average height with her bright blonde hair tied into a ponytail behind her and fell to between her shoulders. She had a bright smile and brown eyes that lit up in an excited fashion. Her figure was curved and with rather large breasts that were emphasised by a t-shirt that seemed to be a size too small for her. I noticed she went about barefoot as well and wore loose camo shorts, certainly good summer outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Yes?\" I said, a bit taken back by this stranger and the fact she had come from nowhere, Walking past me, she sat on the nearby couch with a satisfied sigh before going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm their aunt Sophie. I was asked before to babysit for them before but I had an appointment with a friend. Well, they got called into work and I decided to come here. I decided to send them to the movies, gave them something to do on a nice day and let me relax after a hectic work shift yesterday. They'll be gone for a few hours so I was hoping to get out back and work on my tan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie paused to look at you and an expression of sympathy crossed her face \"Seems I kinda screwed you out of a day's pay though, sorry about that. Tell you what, to make it up to you, why don't you go enjoy the pool out back? I'll bring out some sandwiches and we can chat if you like. I was told the neighbours were friendly around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bright smile came from Sophie and I had to admit, it sounded nice. Was hot out and a dip in a pool never hurt anyone. Still, this was a stranger and I didn't know all that much about her, wasn't even her house so to speak. Maybe just staying inside to talk first was better?

After a bit of swimming around I could hear Sophie call my name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your having fun, aren't ya?\"  She teased. turning to her direction I noticed she was already down to just a bikini, pure white in color. With out the t-shirt I saw her form was very curvy, her large breasts leading to a rather toned and tan belly. Her hips were nice and shapely, giving her a very matronly look to her as well. Ogling her stunning body my eyes caught her feet as well. Plump rosy feet with freshly painted black nail polish. And at that moment I realized I had my first summer crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! Are you okay?\" She asked puzzled at my expression, I had been staring for a few seconds too long at this point, but I quickly snapped out of my trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh what?\" I sputtered back, blushing a bit.

I can't help but look at her butt when she reaches over to grab the lotion and hand it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you get all of my back, I burn easily!\" She smirks as you take the lotion. Pouring a bit in my hands I start to rub it onto her back, just below her bikini strap. She let out a small shiver as the cool lotion hit her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Ha ha ha that's cold!\" She squeals, her laughter is immaculate. So shrill and cute sounding.

Clearly you've never met a good tickler before.\" I teased back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy fingers crawled up her sides to her ribs and she pulled her arms in,  unable to talk through her hysterical giggling. She tried swatting my hands away, squirming and writhing about until she was on her back. Now that I could see her face I noticed she was enjoying every second of it, and I seized the oppurtunity. My fingers trudged down her belly and stopped just at her waistline, my fingers wiggling and crawling over her bare skin. She grabbed at my wrists, laughing and smiling at me while she just kept her hands there, not trying to move them away. At first I was puzzled and eventually my mind came to the conclusion I should have come to just moments ago. She was enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed and grabbed her hands, holding them up above her head while her laughter died down. Once she caught her breath I quickly began asking questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are you enjoying this!?\" I said, blushing and slightly embarrassed.

Eventually I pried my hands out and began wiggling my fingers around her belly and sides, causing her to laugh loudly as well as squeak a few times. When she tried to grab my hands, I took both of her hands and held them down over her head and used my other hand to keep tickling. Eventually, I stopped to give her a break. When her laughter died down quite a bit, I told her to turn back onto her belly and she quickly complied. And then screamed in mock terror as I held her ankles in a headlock. The shriek she let out when I scraped my nails down her feet was definitely worth the lost pay check.

After looking around for a few minutes, Sophie finds six coils of rope, each about five feet long. She grabbed four and let me get the others, and then the two of us went back inside. I followed Sophie upstairs to the master bedroom. When I looked inside, I saw a huge bed, and small bedposts stuck up from each of the corners. \u201cPut your coils of rope and your shirt down on the chair, and then lie down on the bed.\u201d I set the rope and my shirt down, and I lied on the bed, knowing that the majority of my body was exposed for tickling. Sophie tied one end of each of her four coils of rope to the bedposts, and the other end was attached to my ankles and wrists. Once she finished, I was tied spread eagle to the bed, and there was no slack to allow me to move. \u201cWell, now that I have you tied to the bed, I guess it\u2019s time for me to tickle you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie got up onto the bed up near my upper body, and she reached down. The first place where her fingers hit were my armpits, and I immediately cracked up in laughter. \u201cHAHATHAHAT TIHICKLES!\u201d you yelled. Aware that I could not move, Sophie wiggled her fingers in my hollows, and she smiled as she realized how much it tickled. She tickled my bare armpits for one minute before she decided to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf your armpits were that ticklish, I bet it just gets better as we go lower,\u201d the babysitter conjectured as she lowered her hands to my ribcage. The fingers wiggled against my ribs at a very fast speed, and I laughed with as much intensity as the armpits. Once she saw that I was just about as ticklish on the ribs as the armpits, Sophie decided to tickle there for another minute and then move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, since your ribs weren\u2019t more ticklish than your armpits, your stomach has to be super sensitive,\u201d Sophie announced as she continued down my body. All of a sudden, Sophie\u2019s fingers wiggled against the front of my bare belly, which made my laughter jump up a bit. Seeing that I was more ticklish here, she changed her tickling method to poking, making me break into random bursts of laughter. She poked all around my tummy, trying to find particularly sensitive spots there. After a couple of minutes, Sophie returned to wiggling her fingers, finding that it was a little more effective than poking me. She tickled my sides and bellybutton relentlessly, observing that they were more ticklish than the front of my belly. Finally, following five minutes of tummy tickling, Sophie decided to slow down the tickling, and she asked me, \u201cDid I already find your most ticklish spot?\u201d</span></div></div>",

She always keeps some tickle tools around, and she told me where they were. They are always really effective on me, so I can just imagine what they will do to you.\u201d Sophie placed the feather duster and the electric toothbrush on the side of the bed, leaving her with only two feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the feathers made contact with my bare sides and started waving back and forth. \u201cHAHAHAHA!\u201d I laughed at the tickling as I began to squirm. The babysitter kept the tickling at my sides for a minute, and then she decided to move it in. Soon the feathers tickled all over the front of my midriff, and I kept hysterically laughing. After a few minutes, Sophie began to move the feathers in smaller and smaller circles around my bellybutton, and then without warning, one of the feathers crept into my bellybutton, and I screamed in laughter. \u201cNOHOHOHO!\u201d Sophie took advantage of my sensitivity and quickly added the other feather in, making my laughter jump an octave. For ten minutes, the feathers danced around and in my navel, and then the babysitter stopped temporarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose feathers worked really well, but I have something that will really make you smile,\u201d Sophie declared. She set the feathers down and picked up the feather duster, displaying it before she plunged it into my right side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I felt the feathers hit my side, I began laughing again, \u201cHAHAHAHA! NAHAHAT AHAHAGAIN!\u201d My squirming also picked up as I tried to avoid all the feathers hitting the side of my bare belly. However, the ropes binding me limited my movement, and Sophie took full advantage of this, swiping the duster around my side for five minutes. The babysitter then moved the duster to the front of my tummy, knowing that although I was less ticklish here, the amount of feathers would make up for it. \u201cHAHAHAHA! IHIHIT TIHIHICKLEHEHES!\u201d For five minutes, the feather duster teased the front of my midriff, and then the torture came. Feathers suddenly began to enter my navel, and I responded by squirming violently, which only helped the duster tickle more. \u201cSTAHAHAHAP!\u201d Ignoring my pleas, my tickler continued to tickle torture me for another ten minutes, and then she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have one more tool to test on you,\u201d Sophie proclaimed. \u201cThis time, I think we will skip the routine and just get you where you will laugh the most.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that this meant my navel, I struggled against the ropes and protested, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t need to use- HAHAHA!\u201d The tickler ignored my pleas and stuck the electric toothbrush in the hole on my stomach, and when she turned it on, I broke out in laughter. \u201cHAHAHA PLEHESE! NOHOHO STAHAHAP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo stop?\u201d Sophie twisted my words. \u201cWell, I was about to stop, but I guess you like it. I\u2019ll keep going, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe babysitter rotated and moved the toothbrush around in my bellybutton, and I squirmed around in random directions to try and get it out. \u201cHAHAHA! NOHOHO! PLEHEHEHESE STAHAHAP!\u201d I hysterically laughed. As I attempted to escape, I confirmed an earlier suspicion: Sophie was tickle torturing me, and she enjoyed it very much. The electric toothbrush tickle tortured my bare bellybutton for a full half hour, and then my tickler ceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I tried to catch my breath, the babysitter broadcasted, \u201cI thought I should give you a break before I used another method on you. For the break, I\u2019m going to put the tools back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy captor left the room for a couple of minutes, but this time I did not try to escape, curious of this other method she had in store for me. Once Sophie returned, she straddled me and then blew a raspberry on my bare belly. \u201cAHAHAHA!\u201d I burst out in response to the five-second raspberry. When my tickler lifted her head up, I received a ten-second break, and then she leaned down and blew a zerbert on the other side of my ticklish tummy. This fifteen-second cycle continued for five minutes and then the belly blows ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this\u2026</span></div></div>",

One thing that also works well wherever you put it is baby oil. You probably know this already, but it makes the skin more sensitive.

I continued this method of tickling for about half an hour, at which point I decided to switch tactics. Dropping the dusters, I dug all ten of my fingers into Sophie\u2019s exposed flesh, forcing her to burst into even harder laughter as she felt the new tickling style. \u201cNAHAHAHAT THAHAHAT!

Following twenty minutes of this, I returned to the lighter tickling, waving the dusters back over her sides. The babysitter\u2019s laughter stayed constant through this change, although her pleas for mercy never ceased. Finally, after ten more minutes with the feathers, I took the feather dusters off my exhausted ticklee and gave her a break. I let her rest for five minutes, and then I\u2026</span></div></div>",

I think you\u2019d be the perfect ticklee. You\u2019ve got a really ticklish stomach, and even though I never tickled them, I\u2019m guessing that your feet are pretty ticklish, too. Also, you volunteered to let me tickle you, so I can infer that you like being tickled.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat exactly does volunteering to be tickled now entail?\u201d I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you would have to take your shirt back off, and then I would tie you to the bed again,\u201d Sophie notified me. \u201cI would go down and tell the girls that I have someone for them to tickle in their parents\u2019 room. They would probably rush up and find you, and then they would start tickling you. I will come up after they do and supervise them, and I might give them tips like your most ticklish spot. Also, I will get some tools from the closet to let them use on you. I\u2019ll make sure that they give you a five-minute break at least every thirty minutes, and you\u2019ll be tickled until their parents come home. In compensation, I\u2019ll give you what you would have made if you had babysat them, and I will pay for it myself.

After spidering the tops of your feet, she gives your toes a test. After letting out a surprisingly feminine squeal, Claudia grinned, confident your toes were a sweet spot, as she alternated between tickling the spaces between your toes, and nibbling on your toes, which was driving you crazy with laughter. <br>\r\nWhile Claudia tormented your feet, Clarissa was going crazy on your stomach. She sat on top of you, scribbling and dragging all 10 nails all over your stomach with no discernible pattern. As different as it was from Claudia\u2019s thoughtful tickling, this was just as effective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the combination of the two was unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHASTAHHAP!!

I was more ticklish here, so I laughed harder, and Clarissa quickly sat on my legs to prevent herself from being kicked. \u201cAHAHAHA!\u201d My tickler seemed to be enjoying my laughter as she skittered her nails from my soles to my toes and back, finding that my toes were slightly more ticklish. Eventually, Clarissa got bored of this and unexpectedly began tickling my tummy. Feeling the tickling on my most ticklish spot, I broke out in crazy ticklish laughter and brought my hands down. \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

She soon returned with the girls, who were carrying rope, handcuffs, feathers, toothbrushes, etc. Clearly they had done this before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow us to the tickle room\u201d Aunt Sophie said leading the way. You walked into the room that the girls shared and then you went through the closet door, only to find a room the size of a master bedroom with a table on one side and a king sized bed on the other. You were certain that the table was meant for tickling since it had stocks, a tightening mechanism to stretch the victims arms above his/her head, and a two cut outs in the table. One to access the butt/private region. And one to access the area from the belly button to the boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were all four in the room, Clarissa informed you that you had two options to begin with, but unfortunately for you they both required you to be entirely naked for better access you all your tickle spots. You suspected that Aunt Sophie had planted this idea in their heads.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one was that you would be hogtied on the bed and tickled by Clarissa and Claudia with tools, while Aunt Sophie instructed them on how to tickle better, which spots to tickle next, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option was that you would be tied facedown on the table and tickled by all three females, but they would use only their nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you wanted to be free of Aunt Sophie tickling you the idea of tools being used scared you, making you unsure if you could handle all the tools. Even though the idea of being hogtied slightly turned you on, you were unsure if this was the option you wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, being locked onto the tables, with your penis sticking through the cutout and the girls having access to all sides of your body essentially was very frightening. But the feeling on manicured nails on your body did a number on you that turned you on as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what\u2019s the final decision?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI think I\u2019ll take my chances with the table\u201d you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty then!\u201d Clarissa exclaimed. \u201cGo ahead and lie on the table and we\u2019ll lock you in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you laid on the table, aligning your penis and testicles with the smaller cutout and your belly over the larger cut out. You then felt Claudia placing your ankles into the stocks and closing the top down on them. Meanwhile, Clarissa was securing your wrists in the cuffs and tightening the cable they were attached to so that your arms were stretched far above your head, leaving your torso taut, killing all your wiggle room. All the while, Aunt Sophie just watched. She was clearly enjoying seeing you tied at her and her nieces mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! I think we\u2019re ready\u201d Clarissa announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust remember girls,\u201d Aunt Sophie interrupted, \u201cHave fun, tickle hard, and we\u2019ll break in 30 minutes or so!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly deduced that\u2019s Claudia was the sister who preferred methodical tickling and her favorite location was the feet since she was at your feet since you got on the table. She began by test each part of your foot. She slowly dragged a couple fingers up and down each arch, before wiggling a few fingers on your heels and then jumps up to the ball of your foot. After spidering the tops of your feet she gives your toes a test. After letting out a surprisingly feminine squeal, Claudia grinned, confident your toes were a sweet spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Claudia tested your feet, Clarissa was going crazy on your stomach. She sat underneath the table and scribbled all 10 nails all over your stomach with no discernible pattern. As different as it was from Claudia\u2019s thoughtful tickling, this was just as effective. And the combination of the two was unbearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you factored in Aunt Sophie sitting on your butt facing your feet and grazing her black manicured nails, which matched her toes, along the upper backs of your legs, you were reduced to a bucking, screaming, ticklish mess. You didn\u2019t know if you could last 30 minutes without passing out, much less an entire day of this. After a few minutes of being absorbed by Claudia holding your big toes and scratching wildly along your arches, occasionally hitting underneath your toes, you felt Aunt Sophie dismount your butt and switch spots with Clarissa. Evidently, Clarissa wanted a chance to tickle your back and sides, so Aunt Sophie gladly switched her spots. Clarissa quickly resumed her madman attacks, squeezing your sides violently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Sophie, though, decided to lie beneath your cock instead of taking Clarissa\u2019s place at your stomach. But you didn\u2019t know this until you felt a single nail touch your balls. You were already partially erect due to the tickling, but you quickly hardened out completely after feeling Aunt Sophie\u2019s touch. She then spidered all 5 fingers of one hand around your hanging testicles. This drive you absolutely bonkers. Clarissa\u2019s assault on your butt cheeks was bad enough by itself. Throw in Claudia\u2019s ever thoughtful tickling of the between of your toes and Aunt Sophie\u2019s tickling of your manhood with the occasional lone finger running the length of your cock, from base to tip, you were going insane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Aunt Sophie decided it had been around 30 minutes and she made the girls let you out of your bondage and go get you a glass of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the girls had left and it was just you and Aunt Sophie in the room she began talking to you. \u201cWell, how was it?\u201d She inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerrible! Absolutely awful! There was so tickling and then you\u2019re teasing of my balls didn\u2019t help anything at all!\u201d You said half furious, half exhausted, and part secretly thrilled with your current situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, this is just the beginning. But just wait, once the girls are gone, I\u2019ll let you have a chance at revenge.\u201d She said seductively with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the girls walked in with glasses of water for all. While you were drinking in silence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The phone rang in the living room. After Clarissa answered it, she said that she and Claudia were going over to a friends for the night if that was okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Aunt Sophie announced that it was time for the second take of your tickling and that the girls should decide on a new position or twist to keep the tickling interesting. </span></div></div>",

She continued wiggling her fingers around in my underarms, and I soon pulled my arms down to try and make her stop. However, before I could get my arms down, the babysitter moved her fingers down to my terribly ticklish tummy. \u201cNOHOHOHO! DOHOHOHONT TIHIHICKLEHEHE THEHEHEHERE!\u201d I yelled. Instead of acknowledging my request, Sophie quickly ran her fingers all over my bare belly, finding a particularly ticklish spot at my bellybutton. \u201cNOHOHOHOHOHO! HAHAHAHAHAHA! STAHAHAHAHAP!\u201d She continued to tickle torment me for five more minutes, always keeping a finger in my navel. After this, she stopped tickling, leaving me laughing on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I quit giggling from the residual tickling, Sophie proclaimed, \u201cWow. You\u2019re really ticklish, especially that stomach of yours. Sorry if I went a little bit overboard. I just remembered something. There\u2019s some rope in the garage, and the bed in my sister\u2019s bedroom is pretty big. If you want, you can tie me up and tickle me in there.

I\u2019ll take you up on that offer. Do you have anything in mind for the results?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say that the loser getting tied up and tickled for at least ten minutes would be sufficient punishment,\u201d I responded, and Sophie nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, come with me,\u201d she said, and I grabbed my shirt, following her to the garage to retrieve some rope. \u201cThis is for when you lose.\u201d she teased. \u201cI\u2019m going to get that tummy so good that you\u2019ll be begging me to tie you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be so sure,\u201d I teased back, goosing her still bare side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHAHA!\u201d she squealed in laughter, but a smile remained on her face. \u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of yourself. Wait until the tickle fight starts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got up to the bedroom, I was already imagining having Sophie under my fingers for a full ten minutes. I was also somewhat imagining what it would be like to be under her fingers for that ten minutes, smiling at the thought of both. \u201cAlright, rules for the tickle fight,\u201d Sophie addressed me when we set my shirt and the ropes down. \u201cOnly tickling can be used to get the other to submit. The person who says uncle first loses. Any spot that\u2019s bare is open to tickling. Did I forget anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I allowed. \u201cAre you ready to laugh like you\u2019ve never laughed before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBold words for someone who\u2019s about to be under my fingernails,\u201d Sophie taunted, wiggling her fingers at me. \u201cStart now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little caught off guard since Sophie initiated the tickle fight, I was the first victim when she got my belly. \u201cAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d I began laughing. However, this was certainly not my first tickle fight, so I reached up and tickled Sophie\u2019s armpits, causing her to squeal and pull her arms back. \u201cThat was tricky, starting so suddenly. You won\u2019t get away with that again.\u201d This time, I attacked Sophie\u2019s sides, and she immediately doubled over in laughter. Despite being stronger than me and clearly more experienced in giving out tickles, Sophie had obviously not been a great participant in tickle fights, as she crumbled. Eventually, though, she recovered just enough to begin tickling my belly and bellybutton again. Both of us were hysterically laughing and trying to get an advantage over the other at this point, and eventually\u2026.</span></div></div>",

Sorry that your friends got sick.\"<br>\r\n\"You're sweet. Thank you. Please have a nice day!\"<br>\r\n\"You too!\" I then went outside and started walking back to my house, wondering what to do now. She had given me quite a bit of money. I could go to the nearby pool. The lifeguard there, Liz, was rumored to be super ticklish and often let people tickle her since she seemed to like it. There was also a boys vs girls paintball arena in the nearby woods. Apparently it was a tradition there for every member of the winning team to pick someone from the losing team and they'd have to do what the winner says for 24 hours. Finally, if I wandered around the town a bit, I was sure to run into one of my friends at some point and I could treat them to dinner or buy a new video game for them to play or something.

In addition, apparently Mom and Dad think that we need a babysitter, but I disagree. A ticklish babysitter will make the convincing quite a little bit easier. Once we\u2019re done with you, you will want to tell our parents that we can take care of ourselves without a babysitter.\u201d She reached down and started skittering her fingers over my shirt-covered tummy again, causing me to restart my laughing as I tried to escape the torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold up, Claudia,\u201d Clarissa instructed after a few more minutes of tickling, and Claudia reluctantly stopped. \u201cWe have to tie him up first so that we can both tickle him. We\u2019re can go to the bedroom to do it.\u201d The two girls quickly helped me up, making sure that they held my hands behind my back. While Claudia went to her garage to fetch some rope, Clarissa led me upstairs, sneaking in several side tickles on the way. We ended up in Clarissa\u2019s bedroom, and Claudia showed up right after us with several feet of rope. \u201cI\u2019m going to let your hands go so you can take your shirt, shoes, and socks off. Once they are off, lay down on the bed with your hands above your head. Do as we say or this will get a lot worse for you.\u201d She released my hands, and I reluctantly removed my shirt, shoes, and socks, baring the majority of my body for tickling. However, while I removed these clothes, I made sure to do it slowly in order to prolong the time before I was tied up and tickled. After this, I continued to comply with Clarissa\u2019s demands, laying on the bed and stretching up my hands. Claudia tied my wrists to the top bedposts, and Claudia did the same to my ankles, attaching them to the bottom bedposts. Once I was all tied up, the girls decided exactly where each of them was going to tickle me.</span></div></div>",

Looking up quickly, I saw that my wrists were tied securely to the corners of my bed frame, keeping my arms high above my head. A quick check confirms that my legs are also tied down in a similar fashion that left me nearly completely immobile. First confusion, then annoyance swept through me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the- who would do this?\" I asked my bedroom, but again it refused to answer me. Wriggling and pulling on the restraints, I tried to get even a little slack. My efforts were wasted as I realize I can't even stretch the rope and the cuffs are in no danger of unbuckling. Tied spread-eagle on my bed, I felt my senses tingle a bit as a gentle breeze wafted in from the slightly open window, caressing me softly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" I exclaimed loudly. The breeze helped me finally notice that I was stark naked in my bed. Whoever had done this to me had thrown my covers to the ground and stripped me entirely nude before tying me up. And they were pretty good at restraints too, as even with my newfound conviction to cover myself I was completely unable to find if the slightest freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy attempts at escape just tired me out, and eventually I simply decided to give up. Lightly breathing because of my straining, I began to think about the situation. There'd be no reason to strip and tie me up just to leave me like that, so whoever my captor was would probably return to tease me.

The door swung open and in squeezed a large metal cart as wide as the doorway, filled to the brim with devices and machines that were practically spilling onto the floor. A small bump was heard as the cart collided with my workbench, and from behind the metal clutter my friend Katherine poked her head around and smiled brightly. Her long brown hair was tied back into a single ponytail that fell to the waistband of her jeans, and her tank top was both flattering and practical - she hates sleeves when she's working with machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her chirpy voice she called to me \"Good morning sleepyhead! Sorry for forcing myself on you like this, but I just couldn't <i>wait</i> to try these out on you.\" She began maneuvering her cart around the workbench, continuing to talk as she wheeled it closer to my bed. \"Your entire family is out for the day and you were fast asleep - and I mean <i>fast</i> asleep - so I couldn't resist tying you up like this and getting my things. I took the liberty of stripping youth save time.\" Reaching the foot of the bed, she left her cart there and walked up to the mattress before sitting by my naked torso. Being nude didn't bother me at all - besides, she'd seen me naked several times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine was a rare genius when it comes to machinery. Both of her parents are robotics engineers, and their talents have clearly rubbed off on their daughter. Already she could turn a pile of circuitry and spare parts into something neat and useful; a while ago she essentially built a small wheeled robot from the ground up, which now helps her carry loads around her 'lab'. Actually, she spends a lot of her talent on her tickling passion - which is rival to my own - creating clever contraptions and machines that tickle me out of my mind. However, when she first started she had no one to test her inventions on - and she wanted to fine-tune devices to specific subjects, so she couldn't use them on herself - so when she heard of my love for tickling she asked if I was okay with being her guinea pig. I answered as soon as she asked. Pretty soon I was spending every other weekend in her basement - her 'lab' she called it - strapped to an examination bed while Katherine invented and tried out new ways to tickle torture me to my limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the brunette sat beside me, I chuckled softly. \"I should've guessed it was you,\" I said. \"I might've protested to you stripping me naked, but you've seen everything I could hide with clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right I have,\" she stated assertively before quickly scrabbling her nails on my bare belly, sending me into a sudden fit of laughter. She may like inventing machines to do the tickling, but she still likes tickling me herself. \"As ticklish as ever I see,\" she observed. After a few more seconds she let me catch my breath and continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I am all prepared for your experiments - and I'm in no position to decline - I'm ready to be tested on. What did you bring with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin grew as she heard my response - she always liked it when I was a willing subject. Walking back to her cart, Katherine surveyed the devices and machines she brought over from her place. \"I've brought a lot, and I've got three ideas to start with,\" she said after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought over something new today. I've got fourteen little machines, each with a suction cup that will stick tightly to your body once activated. On the inside are lots of tiny feathers that can move at various speeds, tickling the skin that the gadget is attached to. They are controlled by a remote that I will be using to adjust the speed of each one as well as which ones are on or off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My second suggestion is something a bit bigger. I've got three 'feather discs' as I like to call them. They have a strong arm that attaches to the bedframe and supports the disc, allowing it to spin unhindered across whatever part of the body I position it over. They too are controlled by a remote that sets the speed of the discs. The long plumes are very soft and light, but at high speeds they can be just as torturous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, my greatest prototype yet. This little beauty was the hardest to put together, but will be by far the most advanced tool I've ever used on you. A pod twice as big as your head will be suspended above your body by four supporters that I will attach to your bed posts. From this pod will emerge a few small robotic arms, equipped with various tickle tools, that I will direct to tickle the sweet spots on your body - which I know very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, which one do you want to start with?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's try those thingies that you mentioned first,\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning broudly, Katherine picked up a tray from her cart and brought it over to the bed. Two rows of the little gadgets were lined up neatly, ready to be used. Picking one up, she brought it closer to me so I could see what exactly she was putting on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, it was a grey box almost an inch big with a black suction cup. The box had a button on the opposite side, currently dim but would probably light up once she activated it. Beside it was the number one, probably to let her know which devices she was controlling. Flipping it over, she showed me the tiny white feathers lining the center of the suction cup, contrasting with the black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually quite proud of these,\" Kat said, setting the tray down and placing the cup in the center of my armpit. Once she was happy with where it was, she pressed the button and the device attached itself tightly to my skin, the button shining green as it did. \"Such small devices are very finnicky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to attach the machines to my body, targeting the spots she knew would drive me wild. Both of my armpits, ribs, and flanks got its own gadget. Each of my thighs got one, and two were placed right on the arches of my feet. Kat took special care when attaching one over my navel, making sure the feathers would dip right in. Finally, she attached a pair to where my thighs reached my pelvis, a particularly sensitive spot for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's one more,\" I pointed out jokingly. Smirking, Kat just set the tray back on her cart. She picked up a remote with the numbers one to fourteen arranged in two columns. Next to each number was a dial and a little light that shone green. Only number fourteen was dark, since it wasn't activated yet. All the dials were off right now, but I suspected that would change very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down in the chair to my right, Katherine made herself comfortable. \"You ready?\"  she asked. My heart beating too fast for me to speak, I could only nod. \"I'll start out lightly,\" she continued, \"just so I can probe your reactions. Don't worry, I'll be sure to tickle the shit out of you before we move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she slightly twisted dials one and two, causing the machine in my armpits to activate, slowly shifting the feathers across my skin. I only just noticed how soft they were, and looked forward to when Kat decided to speed them up. Then the ones on my ribs and feet turned on too, and soon the room was filled with my constant giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to enjoy this,\" observed Kat. \"Though I can tell this is still too light for you.\" Turning the dials on her remote, she switched on the other devices and sped them up slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I was laughing, though it was still nowhere remotely near my limits. Feathers swirled on my thighs, and bristles dove in and out of my navel, brushing the sides and hitting the knot at the bottom, which alone even on such a slow setting was very ticklish. Reflexively I struggled to get away, get free, but since the machines were stuck to me they never ceased their endless movement. And Kat's knot-tying was too good to allow me to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she started probing, increasing the speed of one machine for a while, gauging my reaction, before turning it down again and continuing with another one. She didn't need to take notes, as her near-photographic memory kept track of my response to the tickling. Occasionally she prentended to forget, using it as an excuse to bring back an old machine we haven't tried in ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Kat announced \"Alright, I've got all the results I need. Now we can step this up.\"</span></div></div>",

Each of them was followed by another two. Soon ten girls all between ages eleven and fourteen surrounded me, giggling at my predicament. My blushing only increased the giggles. \"Hello big boy,\" said a girl on my right. I recognized her - in fact I recognized all of them. This little gang of girls were infamous for pulling pranks in and out of school. I knew right then that I wasn't going to have an easy time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thought it'd be fun to prank a boy like this,\" said a blond to my left. \"And it is. Your parents and sister went to the new mall and you were still asleep. It was a good opportunity! We just don't know what to do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could make him listen to really annoying sounds,\" suggested one girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could cover his face in smelly laundry,\" suggested another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes turned to a brunette a my right, who was the one who called me big boy. \"I have an idea.\" Without warning, she reached out and poked my side, a small action but it made me giggle and try to squirm away, only to find I couldn't. All the girls shared devious looks, then swarmed around me until six were on my torso and four were on my legs. Despite the imminent embarrassment, I couldn't help but get a little turned on at the thought of being tickled mercilessly by all these girls at once. Luckily they were too focused on tickling to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" shouted blondie, and my entire body was assaulted. Fingers poked and prodded my belly and ribs, nails dragged across the soles and arches of my feet, digits wiggled around inside my armpits, across my thighs, into my hips, even in my belly button. And of course, being the deathly ticklish person that I am, I began laughing loudly and thrashing in every which way. They didn't let up for minutes, which doesn't sound like much but when you're being tickled out of your mind each minute is an eon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" a girl at my feet exclaimed amidst my cackling. \"He's very ticklish! This is <i>so</i> much fun.\" Eventually they did relent, but only long enough for me to catch my breath and for them to decide how to proceed.</span></div></div>",

As I sat there panting, I hoped that they'd find the clutter in my closet and notice the stuff on my workbench. It may have been incredibly embarrassing, but I was enjoying it far too much to let embarrassment get in the way. Although I wouldn't tell them about the stuff until I thought for sure they wouldn't find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls,\" their leader announced, \"search!\" They fanned out and looked around the entirety of my room, the closet being one of the first places they looked. Disregarding the pencils on my desk, a couple of girls made their way to my workbench. Two were digging in my closet, looking for anything that might have some effect on me. The rest took off into the rest of the house, widening their search to expand their arsenal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took them close to fifteen minutes, during which time some tickled me gently and briefly to take their mind of their search, and one even asked me if there was anything tickle around here. I didn't give a direct answer, but I hinted that deep in my closet 'there might be something'. Once everyone had returned they took a look at what they had: feathers - both quills and plumes - q-tips, electric toothbrushes, paint brushes, and even a feather duster that they pulled from somewhere. They also picked up one of my modified tools: a drill with the drill head replaced with a bunch of feathers. Altogether, a deadly collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job,\" the brunette congratulated. \"We're going to make this big boy laugh like a baby for us!\" Evil grins spread across every little girl's face just then, each one grabbing a tool and heading for a part of my body. A paintbrushes were poised over my armpits and ribs, my belly got the duster, a toothbrush ready to enter my belly button, feathers for my sides and thighs and feet. It was truly a sight to behold, a gang of girls ready to tickle the living daylights out of me - and me eagerly awaiting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, as if they'd planned it ahead of time, they started. Like before, there was no build up, just a full attack everywhere they could reach. The soft paintbrush bristles were maddening on my ribs and in the hollows of my armpits, where they swam around and tickled me insane. The duster breezed across my exposed belly and the toothbrush in my navel whirred ticklishly. Soft feathers teased my thighs, and hard quills gently scratched the bottoms of my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lasted for quite a while. I cannot remember how long they kept that up, but eventually they got bored of it. They gave me another break as they decided what to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still heaving for breath, I barely noticed that they'd untied me. It wasn't until that they started prodding me that I realized through my giggling that I could move. Looking around, I saw six of the ten girls standing around me, looking at me with wolfish grins on their faces and tickling tools in their hands. \"We're going to move you,\" said their leader. \"Stand up and follow me. Don't try to run or we'll tickle you down. Disobey and Cindy's going to have fun with that feather drill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my left, the blond from before pointed the drill at me and grinned evilly before giving it a menacing whirr, the feathers moving rapidly. They knew I could overpower any of them easily, but not if these girls tickled the strength out of me again. Besides, I didn't plan on running - I was too excited and curious to run away. Although I did plan on stopping a few times, just to give Cindy an excuse to use that drill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up,\" the brunette ordered, and up I got. Following her to the hall, I stopped in the doorway as if reluctant to leave my room. A whirring noise came from behind me, and the feather drill made contact with my butt, forcing a gale of laughter from my lungs and prompting me forward. All the girls giggled at the reaction, and soon the feathers were dancing across my rear again. Apparently they liked how I responded to the prodding, as it happened several times while they led me through the house whether I was slowing down or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we reached our destination, I found myself in our garage beside our house. At first it looked incredibly empty because of the missing car, but then I saw a ladder in the middle of the space with one of the little girls sitting on the top of it. The other three girls were standing around waiting for us, and they immediately perked up when the brunette brought me into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy poked me with the feather drill again, and I giggled myself into the center of the garage next to the ladder. \"Raise your arms,\" the brunette ordered, and I obeyed immediately. The girl on the ladder quickly tied one end of rope around my right wrist before looping it over one of the crossbeams of the garage and securing the other end to my left wrist. She did a very good job as even on my tiptoes I had little slack. Once she finished, the girl climbed down the ladder and ran inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open your legs,\" commanded their leader, and I complied. \"More.\" I split my legs as far as I could, hanging from the rope as I did. Four girls brought over two one hundred pound weights that my dad put in the corner years ago and placed them by either of my feet. Two more girls came over with small lengths of rope and secured my ankles to the heavy metal masses. Now I was stretched to my limit, hanging from a crossbeam with my legs pulled apart by a couple of weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the girl who left returned with a tripod and camera. My stomach dropped - if they posted this or showed it to anyone, it would go viral and I'd be mocked for eternity. But before I could open my mouth to plead, the brunette (whose name still eluded me) hushed me and put a feather to my lips. \"Don't worry big boy, this is just for us,\" she reassured me. \"We promise we won't share this with anyone - we're not <i>that</i> cruel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge sigh of relief escaped my lungs. If that video had gotten out into town, I'd be the laughingstock of the entire high school forever. As it was, my heart still skipped nervously as they set the camera up in front of me. I heard a beep as it began recording, and all the girls rushed over to me. \"Ready everybody?\" the brunette asked. She was answered with a chorus of nods and evil chuckles. \"Ticklish big boy, take one!\" she announced to the camera, and they commenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whirr of the drill emanated from behind me as Cindy pushed the feather tips into my left cheek, causing me to jolt as far forward as able. That wasn't very far, and soon I found just how truly restrained I was. Though I was able to move my hips forward and back, that was all the freedom I had and I could only shift minute amounts of a millimeter. It was a vulnerability that everybody was more than happy to take advantage of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeathers twirled around in my armpit, someone dusted my flank, one girl dug her fingers into my ribs, some others ran paintbrushes up and down my thighs, a little devil stuck an electric toothbrush in my navel and turned it on. They weren't much for finesse, but the incessant all-out tickling was more than sufficient. All of the sensations were turning me on, and before long I had a rock-hard erection right in the middle of the garage. This time however, in this more exposed position, it didn't go unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cindy,\" the brunette called out, \"could you pass me that drill?\" Before long the tool had switched hands and was aimed at my genitals. As the soft bristles spun across my cock and balls, I lost all the fight left in me and just hung there limply, accepting that this was what these girls wanted to do and I could do nothing to stop them. I became aware that the feather duster had traveled from my side to my behind, earning a few hip bucks in a pointless escape attempt and another few dozen laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long they kept me in that perpetual state of tickling I don't know. All that I do know is that I managed to stay conscious and enjoy every second. One by one the girls let up though, until the feather drill finally pulled away from me and let me rest.</span></div></div>",

Whilst I was recovering, the girls put everything back and slipped the memory card out of the camera. When I was able to look up, I saw the brunette standing there with a glass of ice water in her hands. \"How're you doing big boy?\" she asked, handing me the glass. Too quickly I took it and drained nearly all of the refreshing liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, err...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katelyn,\" she said. \"Listen, ah, sorry for going so far. We just wanted to prank you because your family was out, we didn't mean to push you so hard like that.\" I looked at her and she seemed genuinely apologetic, something I was a little surprised to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Katelyn,\" I told her. \"I don't mind at all, although you all looked very evil when you were standing over me soon after I woke up. If there's anything you should apologize for, its for being too scary before you started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twelve year old giggled a little shyly, and again I was surprised. These girls may have been pranksters, but they were nowhere near as cold-hearted as some of the people I've come across in high school. It led me to wonder when kids lose their innocence. \"You certainly looked like you were enjoying yourself,\" she teased, gesturing to my diminishing but still-present boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both chuckled at that. The other girls had finished putting away by then, and together Katelyn and the others agreed to meet up at her house to watch the video. One by one they left, teasing me on their way out. Cindy even spent a minute goosing my sides as she passed, amused at my ballistic reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way out, Katelyn turned towards me and grinned.  \"I'll be back to give you more,\" she promised. \"Expect plenty of pranks in the near future, big boy.\" With that, she ran and caught up with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for me, I sat there for another few minutes, thinking about the morning that had just happened. I could scarcely believe it, but it had happened. I was still holding the glass of water to prove it. A gang of girls really had tied me up and tickled me half to death. It was like something out of a dream. Eventually I got to my feet, deciding that it would be best to get dressed before anyone showed up - naked was no way to answer a door.</span></div></div>",

And it made me slightly indignant; a group of people, who I only just barely knew of before this morning, had broke into my house, stripped me nude, and then proceeded to forcibly restrain and tickle me for nearly two hours - just for their own amusment!

Rachel, one of my more recent friends, was trying out Robb's new Kinnect.

She swiftly completed a section of the game and moved on to the next, sticking both arms out and up, using the sensors on the small machine mounted on Robb's family's TV to try and fly a digital plane. Her dark blue sleeveless t-shirt rose up a bit with her limbs, and impishly I leaned forward and lightly poked her exposed belly.She giggled cutely.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, stop that, I need to concentrate!\" I traded knowing smiles with Robb, who shared some similar interests with me, and prodded her again, slightly harder. \"C'mon, stop poking me-it tickles!\" She giggled some more, failing to maintain a straight face, and turned a bit to look over her shoulder at me. Seeing her partially disracted and her back towards him, Robb darted forward and squeezed her other side. She brought her arms down to protect her vulnerable belly, too ticklish to care if she lost the game at this point.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hahaha-Stop poking me guys! Or...\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Curious, I prompted: \"Or you'll...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She suddenly leapt forward at me.  \"-Or I'll have to tickle you!\" She landed almost on top of me, both hands going for my sides. I burst out laughing beneathe her probing, penetrating fingers - at least as sensetive there as she was. Still, I was a veteran of more than a few tickle fights, so I had the strength of will needed to thrust my right hand into her bared underarm and swiftly wiggle my fingers, despite instinctively wanting to protect my belly. She squeaked in surprise and fell backwards - directly onto Robb, who snatched at her wrists as they flew above her head to steady her, and pulled them back above her head. She squirmed, realizing how vulnerable a lying down position left her in if I retaliated further, but I had straddled and pinned her bucking body before she could work her arms free.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rachel! You never told me you were ticklish - and liked to dish it out too! Makes me wonder... Out of curiosity... Just where are you the most ticklish?\" Her eyes widened and her continued attempts to buck us off increased in tempo. I took her lack of a response as a good sign - I hadn't known her long enough to tickle her very much, and hoped that she wouldn't mind it too much. If she hated it, she probably would have demanded that we let her up, or started getting a bit upset. Likely she still hadn't made up her mind on the subject, but still thought she was supposed to hate it or something. \"How about your sides - just how ticklish are you there?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Making sure I was well centered on the couch, I reached down and braced my thumb agianst her right side with my other fingers, before using it to press in rapidly with the thick digit. I knew from experience that there was a large nerve cluster there just above the hips, and when she burst out laughing and struggled, I knew her belly was no exception! I removed my hand after a few more minutes of listening to her lovely laughter, and brought both of them together at the bottom of her shirt. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She giggled nervously, but still didn't say anything as I slowly drew the blue garment up, revealing her tanned stomach. \"So,\" I enquired. \"How about your belly? Is that one a very ticklish area?\" She just smiled, squirming a little in a vain effort to get her shirt to fall back down and cover her midriff.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Like I'm gonna tell <i>you</i> where I'm ticklish! You'll just have to find out...\" She closed her eyes tightly, but couldn't resist peeking - and giggling - as I slowly lowered a finger to her belly and started to gently drag the tip across. She instinctively sucked in her abdomen as I continued testing her sensitivity, and, to correct this, I reached over behind me, grabbing a large cushion.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're good  at PE, right? Give me a bridge, push that belly up!\" Her only response was to try and pull her legs out from under me, so I snuck my hand down under her and started rapidly scrabbling the fingers on her lower back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hahahahahahey! Stop that! It tihickles!\" she tittered, surprised. She thrust her belly upward to ecaspe my merciless fingers, and I shoved the thick pillow under her back, holding it up in the air. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Observing her exposed navel, stretched out and helpless, I winked at her as she watched, wide-eyed, as I slowly leaned forward. Her previously minor struggling and laughing reached a sudden pitch as I blew a long and drawn out raspberry, and the forcfully elevated position of her poor belly only heightened its already great sensitivity. I grinned to myself as she laughed hysterically, came up for air, and then repeated the process again and again. I grew bored of this tactic after a few more tries, though, and went back to tickling her belly and sides, this time in earnest rather than merely doing it lightly to test her. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A chuckling Robby went hard at her deep, smooth underarms whith one hand and went about kneading her ribs with the other. She bucked and squirmed, pulled and pushed, trying everything to get us off her or impede our torturous tickling. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unbeknowest to her, if she <i>really</i> wanted to stop, all she would have had to do was yell, as I wasn't about to tickle-torture someone who really wasn't comfortable with it, to some extent. While she would still throw in the odd plea, I knew she must have liked it; I had been in her position several times before in much more merciless conditions, and begging was merely a reflex - only rarely activated for me in those cases. She could have pleaded a lot more than she was. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, I could see we were tiring her out, so I blew on her navel one more time and slid off her legs, Robb likewise liberating her arms. She sat up, looking tired and flushed, but still grinning. \"Whew! That was tiring. But... It was a bit fun. Still, you'd beter watch out. I'll be sure to get you like that sometime!\" She declared, poking me in the side. Robb really had barely tickled her, and even let one of her arms up breifly to tickle me a bit, and from her perspective he had obviously been far from the instigator. I just grinned and poked back, which started a half-hearted tickle fight that lasted for the rest of my stay. Even when we put on a movie, the soundtrack was often interrupted by a giggle from either me or Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I had no doubt she would make good on her threat, and looked forward to when she planned to extract her well-deserved vengeance.           <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the credits began to roll, Rachel stood up and stretched, waking up some of her muscles. Seizing the opportunity, I poked my fingers into her exposed ribs, eliciting a few giggles. Her arms flew back to her sides, but I had already withdrawn, evading the swipe that would have trapped my fingers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robb sighed, leaning on the arm of the sofa, hair falling into his eyes, which he rolled quite dramatically. \"You two have been at that since this afternoon. It's fine that you're giggling at each other, just next time you're both over here try to restrain yourselves during parts of the movie: it's hard to enjoy a serious moment while someone's giggling in the background.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh?\" Rachel asked, raising an eyebrow and smirking. \"I think Robby here's feeling a little left out.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Realizing where she was going with this, I began to shake my head, a sad smile on my lips. \"Don't bother Rach,\" I said. \"Robb's not ticklish in the slightest. Believe me, people have tried, hard. The things I've seen people do to make him laugh...\" I shook my head again. \"I'd die from laughter long before they got around to trying half the things they tried on him.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really, not ticklish at all?\" she asked curiously. Hopping over to the edge of the couch, she worked her fingers into Robb's stomach, using everything she knew to get a reaction. He didn't even crack a smile until he reached out with one had and lightly started kneading Rachel's side, and even then it was more of a smug grin. Surprised, Rachel flew backwards onto the couch, her head falling onto my shoulder.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nope, not in the slightest. That was a good attempt though,\" Robb said, as if he were awarding her a consolation prize. His grin grew as his fingers wiggled menacingly towards Rachel's almost prone body. \"But next time you try and expose yourself like that, it'll turn out much worse for you...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shrieking in mock terror, the redhead braced her legs on the couch and pushed into me as if to escape from Robb, hugging my arm tightly. \"Oh no!\" she gasped playfully. \"Help, I think Robb's coming to get me, oh help!\" Her performance was surprisingly good, though she kind of spoiled it when she broke out into a huge smile that touched every corner of her face, just before burying it into my shoulder. I was happy to let the moment last a little longer (though Robb felt a little awkward) but a glance over at the clock told me I should be leaving.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I should get going soon,\" I informed my friends sadly. My family would probably be back soon, and I should be there when they returned. It was already seven, and I doubted anybody would be spending dinner out of the house. Reluctantly, Rachel eased off my arm and took a look at the clock.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yikes,\" she exclaimed. \"I gotta go. Didn't realize how long we'd spent here.\" Hugging me, she then scooted over to Robb, giving him a quick hug too. \"Thanks for inviting me over Robby,\" she said softly. Robb returned the hug, and Rachel got up off the couch. As she passed me on her way out, she leaned in close to my ear.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can bet I'll be seeing you soon,\" she whispered. \"I still owe you some tickles, and I'll be sure to get my full vengeance.\" And with that threat hanging, she was out the door.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now I had two girls who were out to tickle me - one with a personal vendetta, and another with a whole gang.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stretching my own sleepy muscles, I stood up from my comfortable spot on Robb's couch. \"I better leave too, my family will be home soon if they're not already. God knows mom's gonna throw a fit if I'm not back before dinner. Hey, thanks for having me over man.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anytime,\" was Robb's casual response. \"Gimme a call, we should hang out again like this. Maybe I'll invite more of the gals too.\" When that thought crossed his mind, a smile spread across his face and he chuckled. \"Actually, that sounds good. Remind me to throw a party sometime, the gang should hang out when we're not being swamped with homework.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Smiling, a shook my head in jest, a theatrical sigh coming from my lungs. \"Really? You're calling us a gang now? Yeah, I'll remind ya. At least, when someone reminds me. Don't worry, we'll get around to it eventually.\" I walked to the door. \"Still, a gang?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I need to call it something, and for some odd reason I don't think of us as a crew. Too cheesy.\" We both shook our heads in agreement. \"Anyway, I'm sure I'll be seeing you around dude.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I replied, \"Count on it.\" Leaving his place, I got on bike and began the quick ride back to mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When I pulled into the garage, the car was there already. Easing my old ride onto the wall of the garage, I quickly went inside, eager to eat after the long day. I wasn't surprised to see my dad working on his laptop at the dining table. I wasn't surprised to see my mother in the kitchen, cooking some delectable looking food. Although I was surprised that my sister wasn't helping her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey ma,\" I said, walking into the kitchen and breathing in the exquisite aromas. \"Looks delicious. By the way, how was the new mall? It opened today right, just an hour out of town?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My mother smiled in that way that makes someone feel right at home. She answered, \"Oh it was great. I swear, they have <i>every</i> major chain from clothes to shoes to jewelry. Where were you?\" Before I could answer, an eyebrow on her forehead raised. \"And how did you know we were at the mall?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, let's just say I heard it from a new friend I made today.\" While almost everyone knew about my interest in tickling, there <i>were</i> some things I didn't tell them. Katelyn was one of many things I kept (relatively) secret. \"I was over at Robb's house, trying out his new Kinnect thingy.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sounds like fun,\" my mother replied, multitasking our conversation with the stove and microwave. \"Lauren's out eating dinner with a bunch of her friends, so it'll just be you, me, and your father tonight. They'll be coming over afterwards - Lauren's hosting a sleep-over. That okay with you hun?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sounds fine ma.\" A bunch of girls sleeping over? It's actually a lot less fun than it sounds. They stay up talking late into the night and even the morning, long after I'd like to fall asleep. Sure they were pretty and fun to be with - and Lauren's friends always happened to be very ticklish - but they could be little devils too. More than once they teamed up and gang tickled me for hours. Sure, I don't complain, but it's scary being at the mercy of an army of girls.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dinner was rather uneventful when compared to what I'd gone through earlier that day. Once he finished his project, my dad told us he'd be leaving on a business trip sometime that week for a few days at least. Mom told me about the mall, how immense it was and the beautiful architecture, not to mention the sheer number of stores there. After about an hour, we had finished eating and I cleared the dishes while dad went right back to working and mom sat back on our couch to watch some of her favorite shows.</span></div></div>",

And without the burden of homework, there was no reason for me to stay up late into the night. I also decided that I didn't have enough stamina remaining to deal with Lauren and her friends when they came back. They could be ruthless, and while it may have been fun I simply wasn't feeling up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing the stairs in our house, I retired to my bedroom. It looked more or less like it had when I woke up, the bedsheets and blankets strewn on the floor from that morning. The girls had left the tickle tools and rope on my worktable for me - even the feather duster. Their use and punishing use of tickling gave me several ideas, but I didn't have the energy nor materials to do so that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging around inside my closet, I emerged with my old laptop. The thing had been around with me longer than my back, and the trusty old thing allowed me to do many firsts. Setting it down on the desk, I spent the next hour surfing the net, watching some of my favorite YouTube vids and visiting Writing.Com (excellent site by the way). It was entertaining, but as I grew less interested I decided it was time for me to conk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI threw my sheets back onto my mattress and slid into bed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night was a cloudy one, and the shining stars were hidden from view. Even the bright moon, which normally glowed so fiercely white at this time of the month, was partially hidden by the clouds, casting fluffy shadows on the ground below. It was late at night, long past the time I had nodded off, and most of the town had fallen asleep. Most of those who hadn't weren't looking out their windows at a starless sky, and those who were didn't see the enormous flying vessel. The darkness provided natural cover for the town-sized ship, and it could float above the small town without worry of detection. Scanning the remote collection of buildings, the crew found their target: a house on the outskirts of the town, more acurately a male specimen inside that house, namely me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise of machinery emanated from the opening bay door, though by the time the sound reached the surface it was nothing more than a groan in the wind. Out of the now open bay door came a smaller ship, one meant to ferry passengers between the ground and the vessel, no bigger than a bus, and it flew down into the town to retrieve its target. The shuttle lowered itself until it was about level with my window, hovering as the hatch opened to reveal a person covered entirely in a jumpsuit and machinery. Silently sliding my window open, the stealthy intruder snuck up to my bare body and slipped a few drops of solution onto my lips. Had I been awake, the solution would've knocked me out faster than a sledgehammer to the head (and feel much like one) but asleep as I was it sent me into an even deeper slumber, without a chance of me stirring for the next several hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout having to worry about me waking, the intruder then hoisted me over his (or her) shoulder and returned to the shuttle, sliding me to another person within the small ship through the window. Once I was secured, they closed the window behind us, closed the hatch to the shuttle, and returned to the huge dark ship floating miles above the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know how long I spent in a semi-conscious state, just waking up from my deeper than expected rest. Feelings of mild happiness filled me, like the light pleasure of lying in your bed in the morning even though you are awake, and this perpetual state of satisfaction was all I knew for the longest time. As I slowly returned to my senses however, I realized that I was actually not in my bed and I could not tell whether it was morning or not. The first thing that greeted my open eyes were silver metallic walls, covered in panels and hatches and bolts, giving the room a futuristic look. Apart from a single closed portway on one side of the room, there were no obvious openings that could lead anywhere. The door itself was made of a darker metal than the silvery color of the walls, but it was still seemless with the rest of the room. Beside it were two lights, a green one that remained dark and a red one that grew dimmer and brighter. Above me was a single source of light, somehow shone equally throughout the entire room, eliminating any shadowy corners. How that could have been possible I have no idea, but it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only furnishing in the entire space was a metal table on which I now sat up on. Restraints at the head and foot of the table laid open like crab claws, cuffs ready to snap shut at a moment's notice. They were the same color as the walls, creating an overall uninteresting atmosphere. After my observation of this alien place settled in my mind, curiosity soon followed, laced with a hint of panic. What was I doing here? Why was I here? Where was here? Who did this?</span></div></div>",

Somehow I had a feeling this wasn't an elaborate prank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" I asked shakily, standing up as I looked around for the intercom. Were there cameras in here too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I am Professor Solaris M. Vordin! Perhaps you've heard of me? I'm told I am very famous in this sector of the galaxy,\" the voice said proudly. I wasn't sure how to respond, only that in general it's a bad idea to annoy jittery megalomaniacs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no actually,\" I said truthfully. \"What do you want with me?\" I asked, but it seemed the professor had already tuned me out and was talking to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Primitive Earthlings, no idea when they are in the presence of a genius. Perhaps I could use their limited cognitive abilities to test the intelligence adapter strain research that Group C is working on...\" Vordin mused, talking to himself. He continued this for a few moments more, rambling on about research that some group or other is working on, before realizing I was still on hold until a few repeated coughs and ahems got his attention.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, Earthman, forgot you were there.

The professor spoke in such a quick and frantic pace I hadn't picked it up. The fact his voice was so high was making my head hurt too. I don't know what kind of drugs they had injected into me, but I felt like I had a been hit by a sledgehammer in the face. I didn't get a reply as the intercom beeped and there was silence. I sat back down on the table<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly afterwards, there was a rap on the door of the room and I met Kelliah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We of the OmniProd Corp have a contract for you to sign,\" she said emotionlessly, as if just going through a routine. She handed me the clipboard and a long metal rod which turned out to be an elaborate pen and not some kind of devious probe. \"At the dotted line,\" she pointed, ignoring my baffled expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, there's so much I don't understand I don't know where to start,\" I said, looking at the clipboard. \"First of all, where the hell am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see how that is in any way relevant.

The scary serpent-lady who had snakes for hair and eyes that could turn people into stone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped and stared at the two burly guards, also purple-skinned, that followed her and seemed to be glaring at me. The strange rifles they had in their hands did not made me feel any more assured. I considered just signing the document and saying \"screw this, I had a nice life, tickled a lot of girls,\" but this couldn't be how it ended. No way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put down the clipboard and the long pen on the metal table, the noise quiet but distinct in the otherwise silent room. \"Tell me what's going on first,\" I said, looking intently at the Kelliah woman straight in the eyes. She glared back, and I noticed her eyes were purple too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I hate having to deal with such troublesome test subjects,\" she grumbled as she reached into the pocket of her jacket, which was made of shiny material (it seemed rules of fashion were universal), and pulled out a stack of flashcards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OmniProd Corp is the corporation that strives to achieve excellence in every area, oh blah blah blah, just read it yourself,\" she said, bored already as she tossed me the stack of flashcards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, actually, I can't read this at all,\" I said apologetically. The language reminded me of puddles and blobs, I didn't have a clue what any of it meant, and the documents she had handed me earlier were in the same script. Utterly unintelligible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they not teach you how to read in Earth schools?\" Kelliah grumbled before picking up the clipboard with the document attached to it. \"This is a legal binding contract that says you are willing to let us test our new products on you for a few days. In doing so you get paid 200,000 universal currency, credits, dollars, whatever you want. Now please sign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, tell me what kind of products you're gonna be testing on me first. What's going to happen to me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no chance of lethality. You are merely going to be put in a controlled environment to test our products,\" Kelliah said, trying to push the clipboard and pen into my hand again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, just what does your OminProd Corp sell? Tell me!\" <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

And another thing, how come you aliens can speak English?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Universal translator,\" Kelliah replied like she heard the question a thousand times before, and considering she seemed to be in charge of contract negotiations, it wouldn't be surprising if she in fact had this conversation a thousand times before.  \"The translator does not work on text however, and it would be a far too inefficient waste of our human expert's time to have her translate for you hairless apes,\" she said dismissively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why tickling weapons though? Why it is always tickling?\" I asked, not ungrateful for this fact, but no closer to understanding any of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no more time for your questions. You have already taken up more than my alloted time. Sign the document now or you will see why tickling is the favored method of interrogation in the galaxy,\" she said, glaring and wiggling her fingers threateningly.

It's yours!\" I yelled as the two muscular purple-skinned guards grabbed my arms and frogmarched me to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stroked her chin as she pondered my offer.

Oh, and let him taste the double chargers,\" I braced myself as the guards fiddle with a dial on their weapons, then fired their weapons at me. There was a pair of flashes, and I blinked and looked at myself. It didn't seem to have any effect, but my attention was drawn back to Kelliah who was wiggling her fingers threateningly. I was suddenly painfully aware just how exposed I was, stretched with my ankles and one end and my wrists at the other, with only my thin pajamas (a t-shirt and boxers) for protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and human, after I break you, not only will you sign the document, but you're also going to give me half of that 200,000 for having me work overtime,\" Kelliah sneered, the rigid formal woman had disappeared and been replaced by this eagerly sadistic one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelliah hooked her thumb under my shirt and pulled it up until it covered my face, preventing me from seeing anything clearly. Of course, there was nothing preventing me from feeling anything. \"I don't need to see your smiles, human, I just want to hear you scream with laughter,\" she said venomously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden poke above my navel caused me to squeal and jerk to the direction of the prod, but my bonds prevented me from turning much in either direction. I was starting to realize what those guns had done to me. Every nerve seemed to behyper-sensitized, and it didn't help that I was natrually deathly ticklish either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, the last human I tickled broke in less than five minutes Do you think you can last that long?\u201d she mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I opened my mouth to respond, I jolted as if being zapped by lighting when ten fingers burrowed into the sides of my stomach and wiggled in deeply. I exploded with laughter, thrashing on the table. I tried to break the bonds around my wrists and ankles, but it was pointless try to break out of the thick metal clamps. These people knew hot to make good bondage equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to suck in my stomach, but her fingers followed along effortlessly like a bloodhound following prey. No matter which way it twisted or turned, the her fingers were constantly wiggling into my stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of this she lightened up a little bit, but it didn't really help that much. Her nails lightly skittered circles around my navel, stroking gently. I was still reduced to a giggling fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you wish you had signed that document now, don't you? Well too bad... I'm having too much fun to stop now,\" she whispered in my ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly her nails began to spiral closer to my bellybutton each time she completed a circle around my stomach. My giggling grew more intense once I realized where she was heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhohohoho comehehehon plehehease sthap!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 You'll sign now, right?\u201d She said, I heard the fluttering of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so amazed that she had stopped that I slumped down on the table, relieved. I panted, drawing in deep gasps of air. I guess Kelliah was a business woman at heart, personal enjoyment came second to business. My t-shirt was beginning to stick to the sweat on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...changed my mind. Actually, I want to hear laugh a bit more first,\u201d She said as a lone finger suddenly slipping into my navel before wiggling about and my world exploded. I shouted with laughter and bucked energetically against the table, but each erratic movement only seems to drive her finger in deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, tell you what, if you can stay still for ten seconds, I'll stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could picture the evil grin on her face as she said that, but even if I wanted to hold still I just couldn't. My body was going crazy from the waves of ticklish sensations bombarding me. All I could do was scream and howl as that one finger in my bellybutton turned me into a quivering hysterical mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute, smiling evilly, Kelliah finally decided to...</span></div></div>",

I liked being tickled a lot, but this was a whole other level of intensity. Kelliah gestured to the guards to open the clamps. There was a brief moment after my limbs were freed I spent shaking my wrists, and when I got to my feet I deeply considered punching Kelliah in the face and giving her a dose of her own medicine. One quick glance at the guards and I changed my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was imagining this delightful yet impossible thought, Kelliah thrust the pen and clipboard into my hands. \"At the dotted line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it really take that long to just explain to me the story behind this? I mean, is this how your corporation works? When someone disagrees, you just tickle them they change their minds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelliah sighed. \"It's just business, It's how we do it, it's how everyone does it. Spare me the lecture and sign!\" she said threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she said this and I once again considered beating her over the head with the clipboard, I pulled out my last resort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please?\" I said, giving her my best pleading puppy-dog eyes look. I didn't know if Kelliah even knew what puppies were, but in my experience it was a trick that usually worked on girls, and alien girls seemed be no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were a lot of fun to tickle, number five,\" she said, biting her index finger, it seemed my puppy-dog face was working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, I'll let you meet with our human expert later. I'm sure she can answer your questions. She's been asking for an interviewee for a while now anyway,\" she conceded, shrugging. \"But in return I don't want any more trouble from you, for some reason I'm sensing you could be the quite the nuisance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise,\" I said, signing her document as a sign of good faith and handing it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, don't break my trust in you number five. Though I must say, you are quite the specimen. I can see why Professor Adearon is so fascinated by humans,\" she said accepting the documents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adearon is your human expert, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelliah nodded as she tucked the clipboard under her arm. She gestured to the guards and they opened the door for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and if you misbehave, bear in mind that I shall be sure to be the one to personally discipline you, number five,\" Kelliah threatened as the door slammed shut. I heard a click afterwards. It seemed that despite all the high-tech furnishings, they still used keys for the doors, probably due to budget restraints or something. How delightfully low-tech, I thought, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at the ceiling for sign of any cameras, after finding nothing suspicious, I pulled out the metal pen I had sneakily stashed with a nice sleight of hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began fiddling with the door, seeing if I could somehow use my extensive lock-picking experiences (don't ask) to get the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Kelliah, but I'd rather be the one disciplining you, thank you very much...\" I murmured as I fiddled with the door, wondering if alien locks were similar enough to human locks for this to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of this...</span></div></div>",

I didn't think the OmniProd Corp would react kindly if they found out I had been trying to break out within minutes of signing their contract. I stepped back and sat down on the metal bench, trying to look casual (at least, as casual as I could be in a completely empty room). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn burst a harried looking purple-skinned woman in some clothes that I assumed were far more casual than Kelliah's shiny jacket. She also seemed more casual as well, whereas Kelliah marched in all business-lie this woman was panting with exertion. She gave me a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be subject five, it's so nice to meet you,\" she gushed, and awkwardly stuck a hand out. It seemed OmniProd Corp's resident human expert hadn't quite mastered the art of handshaking as she had her hand palm up as if asking for a low-five, but I awkwardly took her hand and shook it anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, my name's not subject five, it's-\" I began, as she stopp shaking my hand and let go, but she was already muttering to herself, and tapping buttons on a little handheld computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so that's how you commence a traditional human handshake... How interesting, oh, an interview with a human, oh this is so exciting...\" For some reason I was reminded of the first alien professor, who I had briefly chatted with on the intercom who was also like this, babbling quickly and constantly. I wondered if it was a trait of their species, having high-pitched voices definitely seemed to be a trait, though personally I felt that this Professor Adearon's voice was far less grating than Kelliah's or the annoying Professor Vordin's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, human, tell me about your planet! What kind of wildlife is there, how developed are the human nations, what toxicity is the air, is it true humans procreate by sharing saliva?\" she asked enthusiastically, with her electronic device at the ready to record my answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, slow down, slow down...\" I said gesturing with my hands as she bombarded me with questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, sorry, sorry, I do apologize, where are my manners?\" she smiled apologetically, scratching her head, blushing and looking embarrassed. I have to admit,  I found her actions to be kind of cute in a way. It was exactly the kind of thing an awkward teenage girl would do on her first date. \"I'm Professor Adeara Adearon, an exotic species researcher for OmniProducts Corporation,\" she said proudly. \"As you might have guessed, my particular field is the strange yet fascinating species that live on the planet you call Earth. Unfortunately, not much research has been done on them previously, so we no almost nothing about you humans, which is why this interview is so important to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's nice to meet you, Professor Adearon, you see, I also have a few questions for you. Maybe we could do a trade?\" I offered. \"You answer one, I answer one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know what the table you're leaning against, is for, correct?\" She asked, raising her an eyebrow. Well, something like that. She didn't have eyebrows, but her face definitely got the meaning across. I nodded, remembering Kelliah's not-so-compromising approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll go a lot faster if we cooperate. And maybe this way you'll have more time to ask me questions,\" I said, trying to persuade her, \"Think how much more you could about humans this way... a human interacting with you in a natural way, treating you like an equal... a friend...\" I smiled, trying to charm her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is how humans negotiate! I must say, you humans are vastly better at cognitive reasoning than the preliminary data suggested!\" She said excitedly, pressing some more buttons, typing something on her handheld device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll choose to take that as a compliment,\" I said smiling at her. She looked up at me, blushed and then smiled back. She seemed vastly friendlier than that suit, Kelliah. I knew a lot of people like that, and a lot of the time it was the shy, nerdy types who were the nicest, kindest people. Thinking that reminded me of friends I had on Earth, people like Catherine, Maddie, so many of my other friends. I had to get back there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have a deal, Professor Adearon?\" I asked, to clarify. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do, human. And... call me Adeara,\" she said, her cheeks burning. Of course, it was difficult to tell when the her skin was purple to begin with, but she definitely seemed to have flushed to a darker shade. \"I remember reading somewhere that a sign of friendliness and intimacy among humans is offering a friendly nickname or one's first names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, how do you know so much about humans anyway?\" I asked, genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Several university papers have been published about your species, though many details are inconsistent. Is it true that some humans enjoying howling at terrestrial satellites? And that these humans also possess the power to spontaneously turn into canines?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's definitely not true,\" I laughed. I saw Adeara put a clear cross on her digital clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next question, is it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, it's my turn to ask you one first,\" I said, silencing her. \"Why is OmniProd Corp trying to develop tickling weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because... they want to sell them? There's a large market for them?\" Adeara answered, looking somewhat confused by my question. \"Why do humans have such a strange skin color?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We like it that way,\" I said, making up an answer as fast as I could. \"Why is there a such a big market for tickling weapons?\" I pressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndeara slowed down a bit, casting her gaze to the floor. \"Well... have you ever heard of the Great War?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard of one, but the one I'm thinking of is probably different from the on you're referring to. Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ten standard years ago, there was a huge intergalactic war that basically hit every major planet and species in the local clusters. It started with a disagreement over clothing of all things. After the war ended there were estimates that it killed over 90% of every participating nation. My... my home planet was hit pretty bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said automatically, as I realized that this poor girl must have seen so many of her friends and family die.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said in almost a whisper, then coughed and cleared her throat. \"So in the aftermath of the war, the The Universal Pacification Law was passed. The law seeks to avoid death at all costs, warranting very heavy fines on the planets who's citizens offend. The new law also believes in deadly retribution: if you kill someone, then your whole family is executed. In the first year of the law's introduction, many, many died, but after that, the world changed, and planets looked for non-lethal ways to defend itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I can't believe that there would ever be a war like that. Banning death, that's amazing,\" I said, shaking my head in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think so human?\" she asked, looking me in the eye. \"The law will only remain until the clusters rebuild and repopulate themselves to 95% of its original population. And then the wars and death will start again,\" she sighed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans have tried to accomplish world peace for years, but we've never been able to do it,\" I replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we will continue at another time, you have already given me some very interesting answers. I thank you, human,\" she said, rubbing her eyes as she stood up and headed for the exit. She seemed deflated and unhappy, a stark contrast to how she had been when she had first walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Adeara! On Earth with have a saying, 'The worst memories stick with us, while the nice ones always seem to slip through our fingers.' So don't let it keep you down, okay?\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back and gave me a big smile, \"I take it that it is human custom to cheer up a depressed friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is,\" I nodded, \"And I felt bad. Visit me again sometime, okay?\" She smiled very widely at that, and even waved at me happily as she left, a bounce in her step again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a training session with the new tickling weapons in two standard hours! Get some rest... human friend,\" she called out as the door shut behind her and the lock clicked back into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, the weapons. In my hypeand curiosity I had forgotten to ask about those. Another time then, I shrugged, as I plopped back on the metal bench, sighing. I still felt a bit like a jerk for asking her about it, and stirring up all these uncomfortable memories, but hey, I wasn't here to look for an alien girlfriend! I tried to tell myself. I needed to get out of here, and something told me what I had learned was important. They say knowledge was power, and knowing the existence of such a law definitely was some powerful knowledge indeed. So these aliens, couldn't kill us, eh? I thought as I stared at the pen I had stashed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should teach Adeara the most important thing about human beings... we're very hypocritical and we don't like being anyone's guinea pigs,\" I muttered under my breath as I pulled the metal pen out again and began to twirl it around my fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down on the metal bench, I waited to meet my fellow human subjects. If my plan of escape were ever to come to fruition, I'm sure I would need their help.  </span></div></div>",

The weapon training session is due to begin in ten standard minutes. Prepare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a clicking at my door and two armed guards arrived to frogmarch me out. For the first time, I saw a part of the spaceship (or whatever we were on) aside from my room. The hall way was lined with cells, mostly empty, but that did little to reassure me. Eventually, the narrow passage opened up into what looked like a tiny train station with a small platform flanked by two sts of rails. Everything was made of the same silvery metal, glinting in the multiple lights that shone from the ceiling. A line of four other humans was made in the center of the platform, watched by a set of guards. The guy at the end of the line turned back nervously, and I was certainly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robb!\" I said, immediately recognizing his auburn hair and dorky button-up black pajamas adorned with stars and moons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! Bro, I can't believe you're here too! Rach, look who it is!\" Robb said, his expression brightening as he waved to me. I glanced at the girl next to him in the vest and the pink pajama bottoms and it was in fact, Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely didn't think I'd see you here,\" the tanned girl said with a grateful smile and she pulled me into a tight hug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she pulled away, I turned and gave Robb a friendly slap on the shoulders. This was feeling almost like a happy school reunion until a shout from a grim-faced guard shook us from our stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I need to talk to you guys,\" I whispered as I walked into position next to Robb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it. There's some serious shizz going on here, man\", Robb whispered back. \"I thought aliens only abducted cows, man! What\u2019s going on? I sure hope they don\u2019t probe us\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not gonna probe us,\" I said automatically. I don't know why, they might well do, but it just seemed like such a ridiculous comment and Robb had whispered quite loudly. It attracted the attention of the other human captives, both of whim looked at me. One was none other than the middle-schooler who had pranked me earlier today, Katelyn. She waved cheerily at me, a bright smile on her face as she winked slyly. She was way too happy considering what was happening. Did she not know what was about to happen? More disturbingly, did she know, and was she looking forward to it? Next to her was a dark-haired girl who I think I shared a class with last year. What was her name? Janet? Jane? Jessie? For the life of me I couldn't remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still trying to recall her name when I noticed a sixth captive joining our ranks, escorted by the guards like I was. It was a blonde woman whom I recognized as one of the lifeguards at our local pool where I went swimming occasionally, sometimes fantasizing of having her tasty feet all to myself. As she stumbled into our makeshift line, I found myself staring at her feet, tanned from her many hours at the pool and with rose-red nail polish on her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA booming voice shook me from my thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, my eager little test subjects!\" shouted a dramatic voice, which I recognized belonged to the demented Professor Vordin. \"You lucky six have been chosen to help us in our experiments!\" Vordin said, sounding absolutely thrilled. \"And you six have the unique and rare honor of testing our most recent batch of experimental weapons for us in a simulated environment. If nothing goes wrong and none of you get fatally injured or damaged, we promise that there will be Earth cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not very reassuring, is he?\" Robb whispered. I smirked as I realized that the reward of cake was almost certainly Adeara's recommendation. The cake probably wasn't even a lie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whichever group has the longest survivor wins! Oh, and to give you all a little incentive to perform well, the losing group will volunteer themselves to test Research Group D's creative interrogation methods and tools!\" Vordin declared joyfully. \"So do fight hard, my lovely subjects! And may the best specimen win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, two pods rolled next to the platform on the rails, one red and blue. Their shape reminded me of those angular bullet trains you'd find in Japan, except with most of the train part cut off. A hatch opened on each, leading to a surprisingly comfy-looking room with seats on the side and a series of metal boxes at the front of the car. One of the guards announced the groups. \"Numbers 1, 2 and 3, in the red pod, Numbers 4, 5 and 6, in blue!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around as the remaining guards divided us up into our teams and began directing us to our respective pods. Pushed by my own pair of guards towards the blue pod, I saw that Robb and Rachel were...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Robb, Rachel!\" I yelled as I saw them and Katelyn get shepherded into the red pod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I heard a reply, the doors to each pod slammed shut and I felt the ground shake as the pods began moving along the rails again. I gritted my teeth in frustration before looking at my blue team members. For some reason, maybe because of the fact I was a guy or that I seemed to be the most confident, they seemed to be waiting for me to take charge. The dark-haired girl whose name I didn't remember just stared at the ground, an ambiguous expression on her face like she was just waiting for her stop on a hight-tech cable car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde lifeguard looked scared and spoke in a light Australian accent. I think this was the first time I actually heard her speak. \"What are they gonna do to us?\" she asked, fear creeping into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make us tickle each other, probably. With their weird weapons they've been developing,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief silence while both of them looked at me incredulously. \"Wait? TICKLING?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys know they want us to test non-lethal weapons, right?\" I looked at two blank faces. \"You\u2019re kidding me, neither of you bothered to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was scared,\" the Australian admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's the punishment if we lose? They're going to tickle us, aren't they? Ugh, I hate being tickled...\" The other girl whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost wanted to laugh out loud, but it really didn't seem appropriate. \"All things considered, it could be worse. We could have been abducted by the type of aliens who want to shove unmentionably large objects up our butts.\" That earned a nervous laugh from the lifeguard and a half-smile from my dark-haired former classmate. \"I know this probably is kind of an awkward place for us all to meet, but we're all in this together, okay?\" I said putting my hand forward. My basketball coach had always made us do this before and after games and I had never understood why, but now I did. It was to keep us all together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" said the life-guard, smiling as she reached forward and placed her hand on top of mine. \"And my name's Liz by the way. wish we could've met under... less strange circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jen,\" the dark-haired girl said, putting her hand in as well. Then, with a determined voice, she added, \"Let's not lose, I'd rather avoid creative interrogation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The weapons are probably in these,\" I said, inspecting the metal boxes at the front of the car. There were three, each one about the size of a shipping crate, and I motioned for Jen and Liz to take the other two while I approached the middle one. We opened them up and found an assortment of very strange looking weapons. In my box I found what appeared to be a futuristic musket with a glove attached to the end of the barrel. Curious, I pointed it at the floor and pulled the trigger, and to my surprise a ghostly blue hand flew out in an arc and bounced off the floor till it hit a target, a target that happened to be Jen's pale bare foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe, oh gehehehit it off!\" she said giggling helplessly as she kicked her foot and tried swatting the blue hand with her hands to no avail. I searched for an off dial or switch on the rifle, but to be honest, I was in no real hurry. Hearing Jen's laughter reminded me about her. I remembered sitting behind her in science class, where she would always don a pair of nice sandals that showed off her pale feet with black painted toenails quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Jen snatched the gun from my hand, annoyed that I was taking so long and turned it off herself. \"This... one's mine,\" she said still panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" I laughed. \"Jeez, you can aim the next one on me, if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if you say so,\" Liz said mischievously, pulling the weapon out of her box and aiming it right at me. The thing looked like a bowcaster from Star Wars, those weapons that the furry wookies used. It looked like a crossbow and a laser gun hybrid, the barrel sticking out from the crossbow. Liz pulled the trigger and a shimmering net flew out, reflecting the light as it flew at me. Like those gladiator nets, it somehow expanded to wrap around me, covering everything from my shoulders to my ankles in wiry mesh. I flopped about on the floor, but I couldn't get free.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen?\" Liz said, looking at the dark-haired girl. The lifeguard and my former classmate echanged glances, and when they turned to face me there was a devilish grin on both their faces as they sat down by my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now ladies...\" I began, but I was silenced when I felt Liz's warm hands pull my toes back. To make matters worse, Jen then began to scrape her fingertips around my sensitive, stretched soles. I immediately began laughing, scrunching my feet in an effort to minimize the effectiveness of her technique. It didn't help much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I take that back, tickling's alright,\" Jen chuckled as she scribbled and walked her nails up my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, let me have a go too,\" Liz said as she released my toes and scooted over. Now Jen had my left foot and Liz had my right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guhuhuys C'mon! We gohohohota focus!\" I said, already wiggling around in the mesh, giggling incessantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is practice,\" Liz giggled, now dragging a lone finger up my arch, making me bounce and squirm. \"Well, not very good practice, since I doubt that anybody else here is nearly as ticklish as you,\" Liz giggled as she started spidering the tops of my feet, leading me to burst into uncontrollable laughter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, he has such soft feet for a guy,\" Jen commented as if observing the weather, all the while her fingers never stopped tormenting my foot. \"And so ticklish too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EHEHEHENOUGH!\" I bellowed as loudly and forcefully as I could. After a lot of thrashing, I managed to tear the net enough for me to free myself, still giggling as I pulled myself away from my two tormentors. Breathless, I knew somewhere a scientist on Vordin's team was being ridiculed for making such weak nets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, boss,\" Liz said mischievously as she gestured to the last box. \"Hehe, I feel a little bad that I had so much fun there, so fair's fair, you can use the last one on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, fair's fair,\" I said with a big grin on my face as I stood up and walked over to the final box, looking in at the last contraption. It looked like some kind of silver gun that reminded me of one of those speedometer guns traffic police used. Picking it up, I aimed the thing at her tummy. She was dressed in pajamas like the rest of us, and hers were a pair of baggy shorts and a crop top that exposed plenty of her ticklish belly, inviting me to wonder just how ticklish she was there. To my disappointment however, after I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. I pulled it again, but still nothing. A third time yielded no results either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sorry mate, I gave you a chance,\" Liz shrugged, smiling that she had lucked out and avoided a well-deserved tickling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" I stewed, searching for something else on the gun that might be required to activate it. When I saw a little switch on the side of the gun, I mentally kicked myself. I flipped it and was about to fire at Liz when the door to the pod opened, revealing our battleground for the experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're here,\" I said, looking out onto the simulation grounds. The place was obviously a practice arena, with platforms and random blocks and steps and grates and a bunch of random stuff so coincidentally place to make perfect cover or an ideal base. There was no way things were just this perfect on a real battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's do this,\" I said determinedly, looking at my teammates. Both had eager looks on their faces, a stark contrast with their previously worried expressions. I guess tickling me gave them a morale boost. \"Oh, and Liz? I'm taking the...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'll take the weird gun. See if I can figure out how it work it,\" I said. I tucked the gun into the waistband of my boxer shorts and handed Liz the crossbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't really like the idea of wading in with an untested weapon, but I figured I had a bigger chance of surviving with this wild card than the skinny blonde. Then a cheeky smile spread across my face as I realized I was basically venturing into a war game where the crossfire was tickling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is like the Hunger games, but, uh, weirder,\" Liz said, as she stepped out of the pod with her weapon raised, looking around for our opponents in case they had arrived before us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the Tickle Games,\" I said, unable to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like the red pod was dropped over there,\" Jen said, drawing our attention back to the battlefield. \"If the three of us surround them,\" she gestured to two chest-high walls and a large metal crate, \"we can catch them in a crossfire, they'll be easy pickings,\" she said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know this?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Dad takes me hunting. Says we should all know how to protect ourselves,\" she said proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I really didn't have you pegged as that kind of person, Jen,\" I said, shaking my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"You were in my science class last year, weren't you? I still don't understand why you never said hi to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mumbled some excuse as I looked away a bit embarrassed. I probably should've at some point, but I was one of the guys who often preferred to admire a lovely lady from afar, though I sure as hell wasn't gonna tell her that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway!\" she said, going back to the topic of battle tactics. \"If I get on top of that crate we'll have a great vantage spot. I should be able to snipe them pretty easily,\" she said motioning with the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness we have you.\" Both Jen and Liz looked at me, and I nodded. \"Let's do it,\" I said as we charged for our designated positions. It sure was awkward running without shoes, but the cold metal ground seemed strangely free of debris such as glass or stones to cut my feet on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crouched and ducked my head under the wall that served as a barrier and occasionally snuck glances at the red pod. I felt reassured that I had Liz alongside me, because at least we knew for a fact that her weapon actually worked. I pulled my gun out and fiddled with the dials and buttons a bit more, but when I aimed at a platform above me and pulled the trigger nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that gun still being uncooperative?\" Liz asked me, huddling alongside me as she looked at the strange silver contraption. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it, I guess I'll have to count on you girls winning the day for me,\" I said, smiling at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully we won't let you down,\" she smiled back. It was amazing, even in a bizarre alien environment and situations as strange as this, the smile of a pretty girl still managed to make my heart thump hard in my chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Jen firing her rifle shook me from my trance. I looked up and saw the gun's floating hands fly through the air and hit their targets. Soon laughter was filling the air. I slowly raised my head to see what happened, then ducked it quickly as a bright green blob flew past. Adrenaline pumped, I noticed Liz had taken the initiative and was standing up and firing nets at the red base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, I thought, realizing my teammates were actually pretty good at this. Jen really knew her stuff and this tactic had worked wonders. I saw a girl over to the side try to creep up on on the box, Katelyn I recognized, with some kind of melee tool in hand which looked suspiciously like a taser. She tried to scramble up to the shooter's nest but I yelled a warning to Jen. As professional as ever, instead of looking at me Jen looked for Katelyn, found her, and aimed her weapon at the foe. The gun launched out a series hands that hit Katelyn's knees, feet and a headshot resulted in a hand hitting her neck. It was actually quite strange to witness, I saw Jen fire shot after shot, but instead of Katelyn being blown backwards like you'd expect the glowing hands just stopped as soon as they made contact, and hovered there, tickling the spots where they landed. After sustaining so many, Katelyn, was squealing with laughter when she finally made it to the top of the crate. The hands on the legs and knees were making her footsteps shaky (especially the ones on her feet, I remember a rumor that her feet was the most ticklish pair in the entire middle school). Despite this, Katelyn got within range and swung her weapon, which I suspected would tickle quite powerfully if it connected. Before the blow landed however, Jen just hopped off the crate, firing the gun one more time with one hand in a move that reminded me a lot of a scene from an action-movie. By the time Katelyn jumped back down again to follow her foe, she was easily brought down by a well aimed attack from Liz's bowgun. As Katelyn landed at my feet, wrapped in the mesh and giggling as the hands still continued to tickle away, I was sorely tempted to confirm the rumor and give her feet a good tickling. She definitely had it coming. And after all, my teammates weren't just good. They were awesome. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This is gonna be too easy, we're so gonna kick your butts,\" I said, not realizing I was tempting fate as I bent down and picked up Katelyn's weapon, \"Now I wonder what this does,\" I murmured, teasing the girl who had gang-tickled me senseless just the previous morning. I tapped it against Katelyn's pale bare feet, and she screamed with laughter as the device jolted ticklish nerve endings in her foot. I hummed inquisitively and kept it pressed against her flopping foot. \"So that's what it does.\" There was some more frantic giggling and kicking and  laughing before suddenly it all stopped as I realized she had fainted. I noticed the ghostly hands from Jen's gun had disappeared too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, check this out,\" I said turning to my team, taser still in hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Give us a hand, you lazy bugger!\" I heard Liz shout, I stood up to see what she was yelling about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen was on her side and I saw that some kind of strange green blob had splattered over her arms and across her gun. The Aussie lifeguard was trying to remove the shiny goo or tear it apart or something, but her hands would just reach through the goo every time she tried to dislodge her Jen's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty cool toy, huh?\" I heard a confident voice boast proudly. I turned and saw Robb smiling confidently, a weapon that resembled a shotgun with a barrel the size of a CD in his hands, just before he began laughing as he casually fired a few more shots in our direction, forcing us to scatter. A shot caught Jen on her ankles, trapping them, forcing her to tumble to the ground. \"And check this out!\" He called to me and Liz as we scrambled behind another wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Jen burst into laughter and couldn't resist sneaking a glance over. Robb had launched more shots at her so her entire body, excluding her head, was encased in the green muck. But for some reason, despite the fact that the goo seemed as firm as concrete when keeping Jen's body trapped in place, Robb's hands could flow straight through the goo, allowing him to tickle his prisoner at his leisure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's some crazy suspended animation shizz going on right here. Dude, these toys are insane!\" he cackled with the same excited fervor when he told me the Kinect was going to \"totally going to revolutionize gaming forever, bro\". For some reason, I imagined he would get on splendidly with the other mad scientists working here. Maybe I should see if we could get him introduced to Professor Vordin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, we got to help her!\" Liz said determinedly, her Australian accent growing thicker as she got more stressed out by the loss of her teammate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got a gun!\" I said, trying to pull her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do we!\" she snapped, brandishing her crossbow as she prepared to fire. \"C'mon, you're meant to be pro at this! Gimme a hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I am?\" I asked, wondering exactly what I was supposed to be so good at. Shaking strange ideas from my head, I lunged after her, trying to grab her and pull her back under the cover. I missed by a hair. I leapt out of cover just in time to see Liz with her crossbow aimed at Robb's back. I was actually amazed at our good fortune, I couldn't believe that Robb had actually lost us and turned his head. He had always claimed that gaming gave him cat-like reflexes and incredible awareness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz pulled the trigger and the net flew out and nailed Robb good and done, ensnaring his limbs as he flew to the ground like a tall tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooot!\" the Australian girl cheered as she sauntered over to where his squirming body lay. \"I told you we'd get him,\" she said triumphantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, Liz! Hold up!\" I said, trying to hop over the wall, tripping over it in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got you tough guy, now let's hear you laugh,\" I heard Liz say, followed by Robb's laughter echoing across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething didn't add up. Why would Robb expose himself so fully? Then something clicked in my head, something that I should've long before... Robb wasn't ticklish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh heh, it's a trap!\" Robb laughed, and I was pretty sure it wasn't because of the tickling. He sounded absolutely delighted, as if it was a phrase he had wanted to say for ages but never had opportunity to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up just in time to see Liz get tickle-ambushed from behind as Rachel flew into the picture, slipping her fingers under Liz's thin shirt and stroking the Australian girl's sides. A few frankly adorable squeaks later, Liz managed to pry her opponent off, retaliating by tickling the exposed tanned skin along Rach's midriff in retaliation. Rachel squealed loudly as she was tickled back. Fortunately for her, she had some backup. During the struggle, the girls had inadvertently stepped on, kicked, and landed on Robb a few times. Although he looked mighty uncomfortable, all the commotion tore through the weak mesh. He quikly rejoined the fray by reaching out tickling Liz's belly. Liz turned, jolted, and tried to spin away from him instinctively, but Rachel was right there with her long fingernails waiting. A few squeals later, and the two had quickly tickled her to the ground. Rachel straddled Liz's waist and continued poking and scratching at the trapped Aussie's sensitive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz tried to curl up in a ball, thrashing her blonde hair from side-to-side, but Rachel was ruthless, sticking her tongue out as she drove the blonde girl mad with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're next. We got a score to settle,\" she called, grinning at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jolted upright, realizing I had been enjoying the show a little too much and hadn't actually snapped into action until they had a two-on-one advantage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's time to use my secret weapon,\" I declared loudly as I whipped out the gun from the waistband of my boxer shorts. It still didn't do a damn thing, but they didn't know that. And what they didn't know... could hurt them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Go on then? We got one of those too,\" Rachel dared, smiling evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And ours is bigger,\" Robb added helpfully, pointing his shotgun in my direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but my gun does something better than shooting goo though,\" I said, slowly walking forwards, still aiming my gun at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes an excellent... diversion!\" I yelled tossing the gun at them. I knew Vordin and Adeara would probably kill me for this, but hey, desperate times call for desperate measures. I had noticed Liz stirring earlier and I knew this would be the best, if not my only, opportunity for a counterattack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GG, man!\" Robb smirked, ducking as the gun sailed right over his head. He began to raise his own weapon only to realize he couldn't as a meddlesome Aussie had just latched onto the barrel and pushed it down so it was now aimed against his legs. A brief struggle later and the goo gun launched a great big splotch at a surprised Robb's feet, ending up with him on the floor and the shotgun in Liz's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never underestimate an Aussie,\" she smiled cockily as she pulled the trigger till he was enveloped in the mucky slime. He looked none too happy about it either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, Australia's overrated,\" Rachel said, lunging at Liz's ribs from behind. Having already taken a lot of tickling, Liz fell quickly, trying to curl up in the fetal position as Rachel grabbed at her foe's sides, rummaged fingers over her ribcage, and snuck fingers under her armpits, depending on which was most easily accessible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom so close up, I only just noticed that Rachel had a peculiar set of brown gloves on. They seemed simultaneously bristly and feathery at the same time, with long points that reminded me of guitar picks, slightly hooked to form some claw-like nails. The gloves made my skin crawl just looking at them, and I wondered just how much they would tickle. Part of me wanted to find out, since Rachel had certainly rather easily tickling Liz into submission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, looks like it's just me and you now,\" she smiled, flexed her fingers menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't have it any other way, Rach,\" I smiled back. It was amazing how you could have a sense of competition in such things. I mean, motivating people by threatening the losers with tickling was one thing, but I could tell that Robb, Rachel, Liz, Jen and I, well, we'd had a lot fun doing this. There was a certain normality to it, like we had organizing some kind of paintball match except instead of paintball guns, we were given these and we just ran with it. It was almost like there were no aliens monitoring us, and we weren't on some giant spaceship God knows where. As far as Rachel and I were concerned, it was just the two of us, having another one of our tickle fights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in those tickle fights, I did usually win... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can beat me, Rach? Even with those gloves, your belly is way too ticklish,\" I teased, beginning to trash talk already, swinging my baton eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself, big boy, Katelyn has some suggestions on how to deal with you...\" she replied, wiggling her fingers menacingly, and the mad scramble began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, looks like it's just me and you now.\"</span></div></div>",

Are you scared of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not scared of you,\u201d Rachel announced, although her body betrayed her, still moving cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure look terrified,\u201d I proclaimed, trying to incite her to come at me. \u201cIf you\u2019re not scared, why don\u2019t you come on and try to get me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel paused at this, giving me enough time to come in and strike with the tickle taser. I sprinted up and jabbed it into her belly, causing Rachel to squeal and back away. \u201cAHAHA!\u201d she laughed as she tried to escape, with me chasing her. Suddenly, she swiftly turned, fast enough so that I could not also make the turn, and ended up behind me. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get it now.\u201d Right then, I felt fingers under my arms, starting to tickle my armpits. My own arms shot down, trying to protect myself, but this only increased the tickling sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHAHAHAHA!\u201d I was now the one laughing. \u201cTHAHAHAT TIHIHIHICKLEHES!\u201d As I felt the different tickle tools, including feathers, brushes, and fingers, tormenting my armpits and soon my sides, I began to squirm around, trying to shake Rachel loose. Thirty seconds later, I did so, running backwards with the tickle taser guarding my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you think of that?\u201d Rachel asked deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt tickled quite a bit,\u201d I responded, having finally caught my breath. \u201cNow you\u2019re going to get it again, and this time, it will stay with you.\u201d I backed away slowly, with Rachel following me the entire time. Eventually, I got back to where the others had been trapped, and I easily found the goo gun, picking it up. \u201cHey, Rach, remember this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel\u2019s face quickly turned to one of fear as she began to run away, but she didn\u2019t get far before I took a shot at her, trapping her legs. She turned around, prepared to fight me, but I simply shot another one at her arms, trapping them with her middle, leaving her midriff exposed. Once I finished covering everything but her head in the goo, I leaned down to begin the tickling. I brought the taser out and held it against her ticklish tummy, leading to screams of laughter, \u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHA! NOHOHOHOHOT THEHEHEHEHERE!\u201d My ticklish opponent squirmed as much as the goo allowed, but I kept the taser on her stomach, giving her no mercy. Before five minutes had passed, Rachel had given up all hope, begging me for mercy. \u201cPLEHEHEHEHESE! IHIHIHI SUHUHUHUREHEHENDEHEHER!\u201d Confident of my victory, I showed some mercy and took off the tickle taser, giving her a short break. This was not to last very long, though, as I removed her gloves and put them on myself. Just as quickly as I had stopped with the taser, my fingers dug into Rachel\u2019s middle, armed with the tickly gloves. \u201cAHAHAHAHAHA STAHAHAHAHAHAP! DOHOHOHONT UHUHUHSE THEHEHE GLOHOHOHOVES!\u201d My friend had fallen into silent laughter in two more minutes, so I thought about giving her belly a break.</span></div></div>",

Soon, several aliens and guards came onto the field, and they took Rachel, Robb, and Katelyn away. Adeara walked up with a few guards and addressed me, \u201cCongratulations, subject five, on winning the simulation! We have Earth cake for you if you will follow us.\u201d Jen, Liz, and I, although exhausted from the tickle fight, followed the scientist and guards through a few rooms until we came to one with food on a table. \u201cHere is your reward, humans! According to our sources, this is chocolate Earth cake!\u201d We sat down at the table, and the cake was served to us. When we started eating, we found that the cake was indeed chocolate, and it had vanilla frosting on it, making the food exponentially tastier. We finished the cake in about ten minutes, and then Adeara approached us again. \u201cWould you like to see the other team\u2019s punishments?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d I responded, and Adeara motioned for us to follow her. After walking through several rooms with Adeara and a couple guards, we heard frantic laugher and headed into a room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight we came in on was quite an enjoyable one, as Katelyn was on the ground laughing hysterically. She was being tickled by Kelliah on her feet, restrained in a hogtie position by some mechanical trap. Meanwhile, some tendrils had sprouted out from the trap and were teasing her tummy and the rest of her upper body, leaving the girl helpless on the ground. This continued from the time that we walked in until about five minutes later, when the tendrils retreated. \u201cYou may stop now, Kelliah,\u201d the loud voice of Vordin projected. \u201cWhat did you think of the machine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Kelliah lifted her fingers away from Katelyn\u2019s bare soles. \u201cWhat did you think, test subject one?\u201d she questioned Katelyn. \u201cHow did the interrogation device compare to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were both hehe very good hehe,\u201d Katelyn continued to giggle a little while she answered. \u201cYou were hehe more effective hehe, but it was hehe close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think that if the machine can get close to my skills, it is deserving of more funding,\u201d Kelliah gave her approval to Vordin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d Vordin proclaimed, shaking another alien\u2019s hand. \u201cWe will discuss terms for funding your continued research. Who is our next excited test subject?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As we stood opposite each other, waiting for the other to make a move, I was reminded of the shootouts in those wild west films.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, in those movies, typically the one who went first lost so... I flexed my right hand and beckoned to Rachel, giving her the universal 'bring-it-on' gesture. With surprising speed, she lunged forward with her gloves. In raising my hand to taunt her, I had foolishly left my underarm exposed and vulnerably, a fact she quickly took advantage of as she snuck a hand under my arm, tickling me ferociously. The furry glove combined some of the best of several tools: the softness of a feather, the pointiness of a bristle, and the firmness of a brush. It tickled quite powerfully, overwhelming my hollow with a variety of ticklish sensations. Rachel, grinning from ear to ear, decided to press her advantage, stepping around me to tickle me from behind and soon her fingers were tickling both underarms at once. I tried clamping my arms down, but all that achieved was a ticklish assault of a different kind as she tried to pry her fingers out. It also meant that, once her hands were free, she could move to another spot, and soon she was giving my ribs and sides a good teasing. Shaking and twisting left and right, I tried to spin loose, but she clung on to me like a cat, never letting go with her claws as she worked me over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate for respite, I jabbed blindly with the baton I had taken from Katelyn and was rewarded with a squeal as Rachel backed away, rubbing her tanned tummy with her forearm to get rid of the lingering sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katelyn tried that thing on me earlier, it's quite effective,\" Rachel giggled, still massaging her tummy. \"How do you like my gloves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're very... potent,\" I replied in what was probably the understatement of the year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I wonder if they'll let me keep a pair afterwards,\" Rachel smiled as attacked again, reaching for my sides. \"They'd come in handy during our tickle fights...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy baton gave me the extra reach that Rachel lacked, and I tried to use that to my advantage, circling away from Rachel as she advanced, placing the baton between me and her in case she tried to charge again. I could tell she was getting frustrated, and sensing an opportunity I lunged forward... and got the baton wacked away from me as Rachel elegently sidestepped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha,\" she giggled, wiggling her fingers. \"Now laugh for me!\" Rachel smirked as she rushed at me, swiping with her dangerous-looking gloves... but at the last second, I managed to duck and weaved to the side, managing to trip her in the process!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel tumbled to the floor, landing on her chest, temporarily stunned as the air got knocked out of her. Wasting no time, I dropped to the ground and hooked one arm around Rachel's ankles while flexing my other hand. Recovering, Rachel looked up and her eyes widened as she realized what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rach, how ticklish are your feet again?\" I asked rhetorically as my fingers wormed into the soft sole of her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling too frenetically to reply, Rachel squirmed under me and tried to get away, but because my entire body weight pressed against her tanned legs she couldn't quite slip free. I began focusing on tickling her cute wiggling toes, pinching them and scratching the fleshy pad of her big toe as I tried to tickle the resistance out of her. But it seemed that she was too seasoned a tickle fight veteran to be taken out so easily, as she reached forward and started tickling my own feet with those menacing claws, putting eveything she had into her last-ditch attempt at winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling giggles catch in the back of my throat, I tried to endure, to block it out, and focused all my attention back on Rachel's tanned soles. However, as a few seconds passed,  I realized I wasn't gonna be able to win this one, caught in the hands, or wiggling fingers rather, of Rachel's semi-revival. I scrunched my toes, trying to protect them as much as possible from the tickles, but it seemed Rachel knew exactly how to counter that, using one hand to hold back my toes back and the other to probe her furry-gloved fingers all over the undersides of my ticklish toes, slipping between them and running the fibers on the sides of the little digits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the tickling grew too much and I no longer had the energy to fight back. Reflexively I pulled my foot away, jumping up and releasing my grasp on Rachel's bare foot. Skuttling away, I began rubbing my still tingling foot and tried to catch my breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel didn't give me a millisecond to recover, jumping on me and straddling my torso. Feeling her warm body press against mine, I rather hoped she didn't notice the peak in my boxers (or did I? Rachel certainly seemed to be having a lot of fun as well, maybe she liked this as much as I did). All those concerns disappeared from my mind as Rachel's bristly gloves began making contact with my belly. I attempted a few defensive tickles, reaching up to try to tickle Rachel's tan skin, but whenever I did, her hands darted to my underarms and forced me to cover them the only way I could. When I was protecting them, Rachel was having a heyday on my ribs and belly, dashing her fingers across my skin in a haphazard manner, never letting me regain my balance to counterattack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahah, Rahahahachehel! Stahahahap!\" I squeaked, breathless with laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance, big boy, way too much fun,\" she giggled, exploring my ticklish body with her gloves while I writhed with laughter beneath her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud noise that sounded like a horn-buzzer hybrid grated against my ears, a brief ring that I supposed signaled the end of the match. Rachel didn't take the queue however, flipping over and grabbing my feet. \"Hear that, big boy?\" she asked with an evil smile on her face. \"We win this time. And I think a little victory reward is called for.\" With that she ran her fingers up and down my soles, the feather-bristle-claws tickling like mad. I can't say it was entirely unenjoyable, but it smited of injustice that she had already won and was now flaunting her advantage. Of course, when she began fiddling with my toes I was laughing too hard to care. The little fibers got between and underneath my digits, teasing tender skin that rarely felt anything. I completely lost it at that point, flailing my arms and bending my body, her weight on my shins keeping me from esaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the ring from the klaxon was a bit longer and more insistent. Sighing, Rachel got off me, looking a little disappointed. I accepted her hand as she pulled me up. \"Congrats, Rach, you earned it,\" I said with a smile that wasn't entirely due to all the tickling I'd just received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you'll have better luck next time,\" Rachel grinned at me, laying her hand on my chest (I managed to supress a giggle into a snicker). I leaned in, looking deep into her pretty eyes when the loud klaxon blared out a third annoying buzz.  A group of purple-skinned alien scientists were making their way towards us (I don't know how they got here)with guards in tow. One of the scientists separated us and pulled us to treat the minor scrapes and bruises we had had gotten from our tussling. As I grumbled under my breath at their lousy timing, I was greeted cheerily by the bubbly Professor Adeara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number five!\" she called happily. \"You did brilliantly! Here, this should rehydrate you,\" she said, offering a small silver flask. I took a swig, emptying the little canister in one go, and instantly I felt loads better, as if I'd just got out of bed and felt as fresh a the day. I handed the flask back to Adeara, who leaned forward and whispered in my ear. \"Oh, and I should warn you that Professor Vordin isn't happy you used his expensive prototype as a projectile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he going to do to me? Tickle me some more?\" I said loudly, catching Rachel's eye and I saw her giggle at my remark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a human joke? Human humor, oh, I must remember that one...\" Adeara said excitedly as she jotted it down on her handheld monitor. \"Nonetheless, I'm afraid you and your team must come with me, Professor Vordin was rather insistent we test some of the more, uh, intense devices on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not much I can do about it, unless you break me out of here,\" I joked, watching her carefully to gauge her reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now why would I do that!\" she laughed. \"You are by far our most responsive specimen, and not to mention the most fascinating...\" she dwindled off, sounding almost flustered at the end of the sentence. Adeara then brightened up. \"Ahh, now I understand! That was another case of human humor! I really must jot this down... Excuse me!\" she said, calling over a couple of guards. \"Number five is ready to be taken exam room one! Please escort him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards came over all business-like and stood in front of me. One gestured to follow him, and as he turned I did so, the other guard tailing us. \"See you soon, number five,\" Adeara said with a large and obvious wink as the guards walked me off. I couldn't help but chuckle at the cheesy action. I bet Adeara had come across that in one of her papers and had been just aching to try it for ages. I was marched off to one side of the battlegound where one of my guards swiped a keycard and opened a pair of metal doors. We continued down the hallway past a number of large laboratories. I peered in through the glass on either side of me at the teams of purple-skinned aliens of all physiques and both genders working on a variety of mechanical apparatus, maintaining constant focus on their tasks. They all had one these tight-fitting white clothes, which I assumed was their equivalent of lab coats. Once in a while I saw someone wearing one of those shiny silver jackets like Kelliah had, looking curiously at what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few turns we arrived at what I assumed was exam room one. It looked similar to my room, only it was far larger and with a series of the metal clamp beds on one side. A group of scientists and guards were there already, three white-garbed men and six guards lined up behind them. The two escorting me joined them, assuming the same position like a rank of eery robots. My teammates, the blonde Australian lifeguard Liz and dark-haired Jen, were there as well, looking a bit nervously at the scientists and guards. I walked over, joining them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, sorry I couldn't win,\" I apologized, more out of manners more than anything else. To be honest, I wasn't really that bothered by this latest development. I was used to constantly being in these kinds of, well, 'ticklish' situations. I just hoped my teammates would be alright. Jen looked a little edgy, clearly she was more fond of holding the feather than being subjected to it, so to speak. I knew a few like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked a bit apprehensive as well, though a little less frightened. \"It won't be too bad, right? I mean, I guess I can handle a bit of tickling... I get plenty of that from my co-workers at the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened. \"Really?\" I asked, sensing the answer would be quite interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You know how some lifeguards like to wear those shades? Well, for some of us it's because sometimes we like to catch a few Z's while we're up there,\" she admitted with a laugh. \"And my co-workers love to poke my ribs and tickle my feet as they walked past, saying they were just making sure I wasn't dozing off. A few times they even invited some swimmers to do it too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's unbelievable,\" I laughed, visualizing the incident in my mind. I instantly wished I spent more time at the pool, and made a mental note to remedy that when - if - we got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not funny!\" Liz exclaimed, trying to keep a straight face, though a smile was tugging at her lips. I reached over stroked her sides, making her burst into cute giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, it <i>is</i> a little bit funny, isn't it?\" I teased, continuing to flick a finger across her sides, her thin pajamas providing little resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, maybe it is a little funny,\" Liz giggled, giving me a big smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like you three are the lucky ones who get the pleasure of trying out Research Team D 's exciting new inventions!\" blared an annoyingly ecstatic voice. I mentally groaned as the frenetic voice of Professor Vordin ruined yet another one of these moments. Dammit, just leave us alone for a few seconds! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned and saw that the Professor himself was choosing to oversee the events, with the moody Kelliah in tow behind him. The professor was a little shorter than I imagined, and the tentacles on his head that served as his species' equivalent of hair was a little shorter than I'd thought, but I instantly recognized his irritatingly high-pitched voice and frantic babbling. I really hoped he wouldn't start a running commentary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team D, show us what brilliant machines you wish to test on these very eager test subjects,\" Vordin beamed as one group of three nervous-looking purple-skinned scientists walked forward, each with a metal suitcase-like contraption in hand. \"Come on now, don't be shy! Tell us what miraculous devices you've created!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientists actually seemed a tad bit overwhelmed by Vordin's enthusiasm, one of them timidly offering their device. It was if they brought a baking soda volcano to a science fair and the announcer was hyping up the crowd. \"We've developed a machine in the guise of a simple outdoor sleeping device,\" the scientist said, rolling out a rather plain-looking sleeping bag onto one of the metal beds. Kelliah raised her eyebrows (eyebrow muscles) skeptically at the device. \"It's designed to look innocuous to lure a potential victim or fool a tired captive,\" the scientist said nervously, reaching into his pocket for a black handkerchief and dabbing his face with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what does it do?\" Kelliah asked loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course, um,\" the scientist stammered, looking at Jen and Liz and I. \"Cou-could one of you please demonstrate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now who wants to be the lucky first person?\" Vordin asked cheerily as he looked over at the three of us.   </span></div></div>",

Thank you very much, number six, I'm sure you'll love this device!\" Vordin exclaimed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, right,\" she grumbled, clearly growing a little annoyed by the guy's voice herself. \"So, what do I do?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist motioned to the sleeping bag and Liz climbed in tentatively. I felt a bit bad about letting Liz take a hit - after all, she was tickled pretty good out there - but I figured that she was the one who volunteered, and I wasn't feeling to preppy after Rachel's victory tickles myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the material comfortable? We took lengths to ensure to fabric would not irritate the skin previous to activation,\" the scientist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, it's pretty comfy,\" Liz replied, sounding a bit surprised by the scientist's apparent concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also intended for a secondary function of the device to be used a standard sleeping device if need be,\" the scientist said, reporting to Vordin, who nodded sagely. Kelliah, on the other hand, was a lot less impressed and sighed impatiently. \"We have yet to see if the primary function works. Was a greater deal of time and resources spent in developing this secondary function?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it most certainly was not!\" the scientist cried sharply. \"Please allow us to demonstrate,\" he said, pulling out a black remote control. \"Each unit is remotely controlled by one of these. It controls the unit's functions, one of which is quick and effective restraint. Observe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz gasped as the sleeping bag visibly tightened around her like it had shrunk three sizes, wrapping her like a mummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We implemented reinforced cords within the cushioning which tighten and constrain the target, also foring excess materials and vibrators into available crevice like between the arms and toes. They are unbreakable by most species, and can be magnitized to stick to any metal surface, keeping the subject still,\" the scientist said proudly. To prove his point, he asked, \"Can you move, number six?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. Not at all,\" Liz said, trying but failing to squirm out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, of course, we know that there are those interrogators who prefer to work personally, and we included an option to expose areas of the captive's body as they please,\" the scientist continued, pressing another button on his little remote. The material beneath Liz's bound ankles blossomed open, revealing a pair of ticklish Australian feet. She wiggled her red-painted toes nervously, aware of how exposed and trapped her bare feet now were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I think we ought to test how secure those cords are,\" Kelliah purred, walking over to where Liz's soft feet laid ripe for the taking, or rather, tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Kelliah, you never could resist taking a hands-on approach, could you?\" Vordin laughed good-naturedly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not doctor. I wonder, are all you humans as ticklish as number five over there?\" she asked rhetorically, shrugging a shoulder towards me. \"If so, then I will surely enjoy myself.\" Jen glanced at me sideways and I felt my cheeks flushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask,\" I whispered to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't need to, I can guess well enough,\" she giggled as she quickly skittered her hands over my ribs. I couldn't suppress a squeak, but thankfully Kelliah had already begun on Liz's feet, the Aussie's giggling masking any noise I made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelliah was complimenting the heavily-modified sleeping bag's design as she casually dragged her nails up and down Liz's sensitive soles, scratching up and down her arches. Liz tried to thrash around, but all she could do was scrunch her toes and shake her blonde hair wildly. With a smile on his face, the scientist helpfully pressed a button on the remote that shot out additional straps that went around Liz\u2019s wiggling red-painted toes, leaving her worst spot fully exposed. I didn't know whether he was motivated at the popularity of his device or how entertaining the show was, but regardless Liz now found that she was no longer able to protect her worst sweet spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahah! Gohohohod thahahat tickles!\" she said, laughing ever harder now as Kelliah's wicked sharp nails prodded and scratched all over her toes, pinching them and scratching between and underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, we also know that sometimes an interrogator will be content to let the machine do its job. That is what these other dials are for,\" the scientist explained, gesturing to the remote as Kelliah stopped her assault and Liz's laughter began to die down. \"We have installed vibrators at strategic locations, observe,\" he announced, turning one of the dials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Liz's head jolted to one side, the life guard once again giggling and squeaking with laughter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject six, can you report where the tickling is situated?\" the scientist asked inquiringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My tuhuhumy heheheheh,\" Liz squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist returned the knob to its original position and another dial was turned. \"How about now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My knehehees,\" Liz panted, now only occasionally giggling. Evidently her knees were not an especially ticklish spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA different dial turned. \"And now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhohohhoho, my gahahahawd! My armpihihits!\" Liz said, exploding with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, after returning the setting to zero, the scientist pressed an ominous red button. \"Now where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohohohoho gohohohowd, everyhehehehhewhere!\" Liz said, shrieking with laughter, tears in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist pressed the red button again, letting Liz catch her breath. \"You see, Professor Vordin, we planted a vibrator at several strategic locations. As a result, whoever controls the remote has the luxury of easily tickling the subject's knees, underarms, sides, stomach, thighs, or feet. All at once is an option as well, as you have just observed\" the scientist said, pressing the red button again and Liz again began screaming with laughter. \"The machine can remain active for suspended durations of time as well. The battery easily lasts over ninety-six hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A most remarkable invention,\" Vordin said, applauding the device. \"Genius if I may say so myself. And who would ever see it coming? A most effective trap indeed!\" I found it a little scary to be honest. I sure wouldn't want to be tickled constantly for more than four days straight like that. I'd lose my mind! Of course, Vordin's comment sort of ruined the scariness. I couldn't help but roll my eyes - who wouldn't be suspicious of random sleeping bag just lying around in the middle of nowhere. Then again, who would see it coming?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So as you can see, it is quite effective and useful, and we feel that it deserves some extra funding. Given the time and money, we can develop the vibrators a bit more and perhaps invent a way to stretch the target beneath the exterior so that all locations are exposed,\" the scientist smiled. It seemed hearing Liz's ticklish laughter and given him a much needed confidence-boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say, subject six? Was it effective? Was my tickling worse or the device's?\" Kelliah said in a tone that could almost be interpreted as threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I would, uh, have to say that,\" Liz stuttered, wilting under Kelliah's stern glare. \"They were both, as um, effective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelliah turned to Vordin. \"Well,\" she said decisively, \"any device that can tickle half as well as I can is a worthy investment in my opinion. I personally believe that this project is worth the investment. What do you say Doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree wholly Kelliah! So it is decided, congratulations!\" Vordin nodded, leaping forward and energetically shaking the scientist's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist pressed a button and the sleeping bag went slack, letting the Aussie move freely. As he and Vording and Kelliah all shook hands and talked, Liz crawled out of the device, looking absolutely exhausted, and I rushed forward to help her up. \"You, okay?\" I asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... bit... too intense... for my... liking,\" she said between breaths. \"Promise me you'll never tickle me that hard, alright? You too, Jen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed, happy to see that, although fatigued, she was otherwise unharmed and okay. \"We promise,\" we both said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I think I'm gonna take a nap now. I need some real sleep.\" Liz said as she yawned and dropped to the floor rather unceremoniously. Her body curled up into the fetal position, and Jen and I couldn't help but share a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe weren't the only ones to notice Liz's exhaustion. Upon glancing at the tired blonde, Kelliah gestured to the guards. \"She's had enough for today. Take her back to her room and give her something soft to lay on that's not one of those units.\" Nodding, a pair of guards walked forward. One stooped down and picked Liz up in a bridal carry, and soon it was just me and Jen and the aliens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's a get move on, shall we?\" Vordin asked, even more enthusiastic after the success of the previous demonstration. \"We still two more inventions to evaluate, and two more eager test subjects!\" he gabbled, as I noticed the next alien scientist in line bring their suitcase over. \"Do we have a volunteer? Who wants to be tortured for the sake of science next? Come now, don't make me choose!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen and I looked at each other. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I really goofed up in the game just now, boss. I'll take this one,\" Jen told me solemnly, standing up to volunteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Jen, you don't have to do this,\" I whispered, grabbing her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling back down, she gave a sad smile. \"Don't worry. It's sweet that you're concerned though.\" Her smile quickly turned mischievous. \"I'm sure you can think of a way to make it up to me later,\" she whispered back as she gave me a parting poke to the sides. Giggling, I reluctanly let her arm go. She stood up and stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, just wonderful!\" Vordin exclaimed excitedly. \"Always a delight to see a subject curious to make his or her or its own mark on history!\" Vordin cheered, clapping his hands together happily. I was vexingly reminded of a giddy child on christmas. \"Now what incredible innovative invention do you have to show us?\" he asked, addressing the scientist currently setting up his device. In his hands were a mandheld laser gun and a small black monitor that looked remarkably like an iPad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have been developing a weapon designed for more covert forms of torture and distance stimulation,\" the scientist said confidently. Obviously this purple-skinned alien was far more sure of himself than his colleague before him, never skipping a beat when showing his invention to Vordin up close. \"It works by essentially creating a magnetic trace of the nerve endings in the target, and the infra-red lasers connects those to transmit the signals to the target.\" Vordin nodded sagely, but everyone else - including the other scientists - had a blank look on their face that said that they had no idea what he just said. \"Perhaps a demonstration would aid this explanation.\" Aiming the laser at Jen's feet, he pushed a button and an outline of Jen's bare feet appeared on the iPad monitor. It was an exact visual replica, everthing from the cute birthmark she had under the ball of her right foot to her slightly calloused heels. The scientist casually dragged a finger down Jen's left arch, and her eyebrows shot up as she gave a little squeal, hopping up and rubbing her foot and flexing it to rub off the phantom tickles. On the monitor, the image of her feet flexed in time with the original. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's absolutely amazing!\" I found myself saying out loud, sitting up straight on the floor and staring wide-eyed at the monitor. It was true. While the first invention had been something that humans could have conceivably invented, this was something that on all acounts should have been impossible. But if there was one thing I knew, it was that once aliens were involved, everything you knew about physics and science went out the window. My enthusiasm was contagious as Doctor Vordin practiacally mirrored me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number five is correct. This is a remarkable breakthrough in stimulation development! True scientific progress!\" Vordin said, almost crying with laughter. In fact, he was so enthused that he leaped forward and began shaking the scientist's hand with vigor. The presenter smiled proudly, drawing the ire of the other scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It truly is amazing gimmick. Though you have yet to explain how this is useful,\" Kelliah said skeptically. \"How is this superior to standard interrogation procedures? Especially if it only works when the subject needs to be naked?\" she asked, pointing at Jen's bare feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist stiffened, too wrapped up in Vordin's hype to take offense at the verbal jab, replied excitedly. \"Well, Madame Kelliah, the subject need not be unclothed for the devices to work,\" he answered, bringing out two other monitors and pointing the laser gun at Jen's belly and underarms. Visual copies appeared on the two new monitors, every bend and shift Jen made affecting the image. \"This device can target any area on the body, and the lasers can pass through several layers of clothing,\" he said, demonstrating. He wiggled his fingers into the monitor of Jen's belly until she was squealing with laughter, despite the fact her pajama top actually covered her stomach considerably adequately. \"Please observe as well that using the monitors we can also implement certain specified tools.\" As the scientist now began tapping the handheld monitors that represented Jen's tummy with a pen, she burst into uncontrollable fits of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monitors were being passed around, everyone taking turns tickling poor Jen to tears, and now Kelliah had her hands on the monitor that held Jen's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Kelliah began playing with Jen's feet, finding it most amusing as she began stroking her sole on the monitor with a pen and seeing the foot wiggle both on the monitor and in person as Jen tried to shake and rub her feet to get rid of the lingering sensations to no avail. The details looked perfect from what I could see. It was really was a piece of incredible technology. Kelliah seemed impressed by the technology as well, as she gave the tops of the Jen's plump toes a quick tickle, watching them scrunch and wiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVordin had the monitor denoting Jen's stomach, and was prodding and poking it with the pen, tittering quietly as he saw Jen clutch her torso and laugh. A few experimental delves into Jen's belly button revealed that it was quite a vulnerable spot, based on her surprisingly high-pitched squeals of laughter. Since Jen was such a tomboy I didn't know her voice would actually go that high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Kelliah also had a play with Jen's armpits, stroking them till Jen was almost weeping with laughter, the scientist continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lasers also leave a residue that lasts from ten to twelve standard days, meaning that the laser gun does not need to be constantly renewed every hour and thus can be used to interrogate targets from a distance over several days. One can sometimes endure one tickling session, but a non-stop session that disrupts their routine and affects their mental and physical state? No one can endure that,\" the scientist said self-assuredly. Jen looked very frightened at the prospect of suffering this for ten days, and noticing her concerned face the scientist wuickly reassured her. \"The residue used at present is of a more short-term variety, lasting only an hour or two. Don't worry number two, we will not force you to be subjected to this for days.\" Jen looked relieved, at least as relieved as she could be while laughing her head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Kelliah?\" Vordin asked after a few more quick pokes of Jen's navel. \"I believe this device has great, great potential!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all due respect, Professor, you always believe that. A test subject is only so reliable. I doubt this device is truly as impactful as they claim. May I?\" Kelliah asked, gesturing to Vordin, who nodded as Kelliah stood up. \"I doubt that your machine is nearly as efficient as an old-fashioned hands-on approach. It seems to be nothing but a superfluous and unnecessary invention.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist smiled through gritted teeth. \"The device is not meant merely for standard interrogation tasks. Imagine the ace pilot in an enemy fleet, about to engage the enemy only to suddenly be overcome by sensations that seem to come from nowhere. Provided this invention stay top-secret, it can even be used to convince individuals of their own insanity.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt a few lingering sensations would drastically effect the performance of the truly talented,\" Kelliah said snidely, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'd like to suggest a wager,\" the scientist said boldly. After conferring with his colleagues for a moment, he returned and voiced the wager. \"We believe that our device could affect the performance of one even as mighty as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a fool if you think I will-\" Kelliah began, her voice dangerous.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelliah! I do apologize, but I am pulling rank on you,\" Vordin said apologetically. \"If you are truly convinced it will have no effect, then you should accept this wager. I wish to see the device in a practical situation and assess it's potency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. But if I am to accept this wager, I wish to add a term. If this device fails, I would like to see the presenting scientist punished for his insolent behavior and insubordination. And that I will handle the disciplining myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shivered. I remember being under Kelliah's wicked sharp purple fingernails. It was quite an intense and harrowing event, even for a self-proclaimed veteran of such experiences like myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confident scientist didn't miss a beat however. \"We accept your terms on the conditions that should you lose, you will assist the next group in their next demonstration. As a test subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was rapidly developing a great deal of respect for this man for the sheer size of his balls, er, or whatever the alien equivalent was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelliah looked like she was considering doing something drastic, but a look from Vordin disarmed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I won't lose anyway,\" she said, crossing her arms. \"You will regret making such a foolish wager.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You have a reputation for being a gifted speaker, Madame Kelliah. Could you read this copy of the speech you gave at the previous Tehnological Advancement Convention?\" The scientist handed Kelliah a stack of papers (aliens use paper, go figure) and she snatched it out of his hands. Vordin, eager to see thepractical experiment smiled at Jen and motioned for her to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting calmly on her reclined chair, Kelliah crossed her legs, cleared her throat, and began to read aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved to be free of further testing, Jen walked tiredly back over to where I was sitting, joining me again. \"You sure lucked out,\" I half-whispered to her as she sat down. \"They barely tickled you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't call that barely, though maybe it is by your standards,\" she sighed, shrugging. \"But I don't blame 'em. That purple chick looks way prettier and way more ticklish than me,\" she commented, sounding a tad insecure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she mentioned that Kelliah was more ticklish than she was in a sad tone, I arched my eyebrows slightly. Still, I felt a twinge of sympathy as I put a reassuring arm around her shoulders, pulling her closer. I realized that Jen, being a bit of a tomboy, must have been teased in class at some point for not being like the girly-girls. After all, seeing her in battle earlier, I felt pretty certain this girl would rather play paintball than go to cheer practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" I asked, a tad bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she replied, hugging her knees and looking at her toes. I noticed for the first time that her toenails were painted black to match her short dark hair and dark eyes. I remembered my friend Robb once telling me about his theory that a lot of girls who put on make up and nail polish do it because they don't feel pretty enough and they need it to boost their confidence. It was very deep, and I found myself agreeing with his reasoning. Of course, this was coming from a guy who once, in all seriousness, told me that he thought X-men were real. He still hasn't lived that down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're definitely way prettier than her, Jen. For a start, her hair is pretty freaky,\" I said, trying to cheer her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her hair is a little weird, isn't it?\" she agreed, breaking into a smile as she looked at the purple mop of tentacles on Kelliah's head, taking comfort that someone thought she looked better than this alien suit. \"Thanks, I guess I was feeling a tad down and very tired,\" she admitted, looking down at her toes again and blushing gently. \"I needed that. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry about it, Jen. And by the way, just my own observation,  I think you're for sure as ticklish as her,\" I said, poking her in the sides and getting a quiet squeak. \"If not more,\" I teased, sticking my tongue at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still nowhere near as sensitive as you though,\" she teased back, returning the poke. On that note, with smiles on both our faces, we sat back and focused our attention on Kelliah's show. What happened next was probably the most entertaining thing we ever saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter zapping Kelliah's feet with the receptor, the presenting scientist placed his monitor on his lap. With the pen, he began making long slow strokes up and down the outline of a pair of arches. I noticed that he had changed something on his pen, as a tiny feather-like attachment had replaced the pointy tip that was there before. Nonetheless, it was just as effective, if not even more in this circumstance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelliah's voice trembled ever so slightly and I saw her shake a little, crossing her legs again. It seemed she had just felt the ticklish lick of a feather slowly tracing along her feet. She seemed to shake it off quickly and continued talking calmly and clearly, doing her best to the show the tickling wasn't affecting her, but I knew from experience that feathers were terrific for inciting the kind of giggly laughter that is hard to ignore. The scientist had started at one heel and slowly swept the feather up and down the foot, using long teasing stokes on Kelliah\u2019s soles. The purple-skinned alien woman began to squirm more as the feather went from heel to toe in a slow rhythmic pattern. Twice I caught Kelliah cracking a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also began to realize how covert this could be. To a casual observer, the scientist would look to be a reporter, writing notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was also reminded of a funny moment I had in maths class a few years back. It was warm summer's day so I was wearing flip-flops, and I had made the mistake of using my foot to poke the sides of a cute girl sitting next to me in class. After I prodded her in the ribs, making her let out an adorable ticklish squeak that she somehow managed to pass off as a sneeze, she slipped my flip-flop off and refused to give it back. After pressing my foot in her lap, hissing at her to give my shoe back, she just grinned evilly and locked my foot in the crook of her arm. With my sensitive foot trapped there, she just tickled away as I tried to hold my giggles in as to not draw the teacher's ire. It got especially hilarious when the teacher asked me to answer a question and I couldn't help but giggling. Of course, soon the teacher saw that she had grabbed my foot and sent the two of us to detention. She felt guilty afterwards though, and I got a date with her for my troubles when I got to find out just how ticklish belly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelliah started slipping up and making more mistakes a few minutes in. At the five-minute mark she repeatedly mispronounced a difficult-to-say name due to the scientist constantly slipping the feathery quill in-between her toes. She closed her mouth, trying to keep the giggles from becoming too audible. She sighed, cleared her throat and attempted to center herself and continue the speech, but the tickling was clearly taking its toll. Kelliah began talking much quicker, speaking through gritted teeth with giggles slipping in every mid-sentence. Every now and then she had her hand over her mouth just to hide the fact she had a wide smile on her face that did not fit her serious demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen and I found the whole affair rather amusing, seeing Kelliah try her best to repress and deny the fact that she was in fact, feather-ticklish. I noticed when the feather teased her toes she couldn't stop her face from temporarily tightening in a ticklish grin, an expression that was erased as soon as it appeared. She began fidgeting much more now, her legs were constantly shifting and wiggling. She put her feet flat on the floor, crossed her legs, but not matter what she did it seemed like she couldn't shake the sensations that must've been flooding through her. Kelliah said her next few lines in a single rush of breath, speaking faster so as to try and get this speech over and done with, which made me think maybe she was further along the ticklish progreesion than I realized. It seemed she was barely about to suppress the giggles now as I watched the scientist drag the feather down the image of Kelliah's left arch. The remaining half of whatever she was saying turned into incomprehensible giggles. It looked like it was already over, and now it was only a matter of time until everyone here, including Kelliah herself, admitted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were at the eight minute mark and it seemed that the scientist decided he'd had enough fun teasing Kelliah's pretty purple feet and was going to make her really squeal with laughter now. I saw him click the pen, and the feather tip was replaced with a far more bristly yet equally soft end, a paintbrush maybe. Then like he was painting a picture, he quickly waved the brush up Kelliah's scrunched feet, from her heel up to her toes like he was trying to outline every single wrinkle in her soles. The headstrong business woman, who had been worn-out from trying to keep her laughter bottled up for so long, couldn't handle the sudden intensity of tickling, and giggles burst from her mouth. The giggles quickly turned into straight, loud laughter when the brush snaked in-between her toes while they waited and began thoroughly exploring all those ticklish nooks and crannies along her poor toes. Kelliah panted, still giggling. All that fighting had worn her out and I doubted she could take another attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Vordin, I believe this should be a sufficient demonstration of how our invention affcts the performances of talented individuals, even Madame Kelliah,\" the scientist said smoothly, ceasing his tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed! Well then, it looks like you've lost the wager Kelliah...\" Vordin trailed off, smiling at the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Kelliah insisted, still huffing and puffing. \"I can... I can keep going!\" Then the scientist scraped the brush up and down her soles, making the purple-skinned woman jump up and shriek with laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, my dear, but it seems that this invention has gotten the better of you!\" Vordin said, laughing good-naturedly as Kelliah's breathing recovered and she sat back down, grumbling under her breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt significantly better knowing that whatever the next invention was, I would have Kelliah laughing alongside me, an idea I found myself rather liking. No matter how intense it was, there would be a part of me that would be enjoying it. The same couldn't be said for Kelliah, and the idea of the high and mighty Kelliah squeaking with laughter next to me filled me with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, without any further ado, let us see the final invention then!\" Vordin said excitedly. \"We now have two more subjects ready to be tested for science!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next and final invention to be tested on the two of us was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oooh, now what is this?\" Vordin exclaimed as the last presenter stepped forward, holding out his invention. Two large metal armbands rested in his palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These were designed as new appendage extension utilities with a built in fail-safe mechanism. They were also designed to automatically incapacitate and interrogate captured targets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't look very impressive. What are they meant to do?\" Kelliah asked pointedly, her tickling having not humbled nor embarrassed her in the slightest it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May we demonstrate?\" the scientist replied. Pressing a button on the armbands, he held them up and watched with us as they opened up slightly, letting someone slip their hands through. I couldn't help but notice how rather much they looked like iron shackles. The scientist looked from me to Kelliah. \"An accurate demonstration requires two subjects, one wearing these...\" he said uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans first,\" Kelliah said with mock politeness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaring at her, I offered my arms and  the scientist fixed the metal bands to my wrists. I winced slightly as the band tightened, digging into my skin and getting real tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty snug,\" I said, \"and not really in a good way. What do I do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try reaching your appendage out,\" the scientist said helpfully, pointing to a series of metal chunks he set out for the demonstration. \"See if you can pick one of those up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at him with doubt, but Professor Vordin stared at me expectantly with a manic excited expression on my face, so I decided I might as well try. Reaching my hand out, I was shocked when five metal tendrils flew out of slits on the armband, mirroring the actions of my fingers. I made a fist and the 'fingers' of the armband closed as well. Disappointingly enough, the tendrils seemed too heavy to pull my arm back and punch someone with, which meant my fantasy of becoming a superhero with them would have to be put on hold. Still, it was undeniably cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible! Absolutely incredible!\" Vordin exclaimed very excitedly. \"A most marvelous invention! I assume there are motion-sensitive neurons built into the surface of the material which is partially what allows it to mimic the action of the subject's organic arm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the scientist and the professor continued to talk in techno-babble, I couldn't resist getting a dig in at Kelliah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you wish you could have a play with this, huh? It's a pretty cool toy,\" I bragged, wiggling my fingers and watching the tendrils coming from my wrist wiggle like little snakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems to me you weren't listening, subject five,\" she replied, arms crossed. \"Remember these terms? 'Fail-safe mechanism', 'automatically incapacitate and interrogate targets'. I've been in this business long enough to know what they suggest. Those metal tendrils will turn on you soon.\" She gave me an evil smile. \"And I look forward to seeing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's the case, I'll be sure to at least take you down with me,\" I threatened, wiggling my fingers. I hadn't actually meant to do it, but once I started wiggling my fingers at her the tendrils shot out and snared her wrists and ankles and lifted her up in the air. My arm strained at the weight, but thankfully I was in pretty good shape and the diminutive Kelliah couldn't have weighed much more than a hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two tendrils taking care of binding her ankles and wrists together, there were eight other tendrils eager to instigate their programmed function. Kelliah was beginning to giggle as the vine-like tendrils began to poke around her midsection, her business attire providing little protection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellliah was doing her best to draw Vordin's attention, but her pride stopped her from screaming at him as more tendrils began to tickle both her underarms as well, the metal burrowing through her sleeves and into her uniform. She flinched and shuddered as the cold metal wiggled and burrowed into her armpits. Vordin and the scientist continued to have an animated conversation about the tool's design, seemingly oblivious to Kelliah's predicament. The guards overlooking us seemed conflicted. On the one hand, that was one of their bosses being lifted and tormented. On the other hand, they had been specifically told that they should not risk damaging any prototypes at all costs. Then again, Kelliah would probably punish them severely if it turned out she was in real risk. But then again, they had all heard the wager Kelliah had lost and this would likely be a part of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all those things in mind, they decided the best action was to do nothing, aside from occasionally look at each uncertainly as they waited for an order from Vordin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter realizing that the guards weren't going to intervene, I started trying to direct the tendrils' attacks, and realized they were incredibly responsive to my pointing and gesturing. I nudged the tendrils and their blunt tips, aiming through her sleeves to continue worming along her underarms. Soon I could see the tendrils sliding along her hips and at the tops of her thighs as well, leading her to let out girlish squeaks with laughter I hadn't expected to hear from the serious business woman. With two strong tendrils restraining her and keeping her in the air, there were eight tendrils away at her ticklish body and though I was slightly disappointed to see that they lacked the manual dexterity to pull her heels off, they were more than sufficiently in tickling her into silent laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelliah giggled helpless in the air, I felt a rush of power that these armbands gave me. I actually considered trying to escape with the armbands as my weapons, busting out my friends and tickling anyone who stood in my way. The thought was dispelled when I remembered Kelliah's words, that the bands had a fail-safe mechanism. I also remembered the dozen guards who stood around me with stun guns and other weapons designed to immobilize me if not outright tickle into submission. There was also the fact that, even though I had been more or less tickled into signing the contract, I was beginning to have fun with her. It was like getting an easy and fun summer job, only weirder. But that aside, it even involved all my favorite things! I even made new friends here, and there was a part of me that just didn't want to see it all change too soon. I looked at the laughing purple-skinned alien in front of me. Sure, they were a strange species that seemed to believe all kinds of bizarre things about humans, but they weren't evil. You couldn't look at the joy on Vordin's face when he saw a new invention and say that he was evil. You couldn't look at the innate curiosity in Adeara's eyes and see evil. You couldn't look at Kelliah's detached demeanor and really say evil... maybe corporate, and a little unscrupulous, but not unrepentantly evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled as Kelliah threw her head back in bursting laughter as a tendril had found a way to her tummy and was slowly exploring the insides of her belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A truly fascinating insight, Professor Vordin,\" the scientist smiled, as the pair finished their technical conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please call me Solaris. And we should continue this conversation another time in my laboratory,\" Vordin nodded, as they turned to me and realized I had lifted Kelliah in the air and was tickling the living daylights out of her. I smiled guiltily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked at me, Kelliah and then at each other. \"What an enthusiastic subject. Ever-eager to venture in the name of science,\" Vordin said after a moment of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vordin!\" Kelliah exclaimed angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did lose the wager, Kelliah... Still, could you please set her down subject five?\" Vordin asked, before seeing my confused expression and gesturing to the scientist. \"Kindly advice him, Timorous.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wiggle your fingers again, it will release the ensnared subject and reset the product's targeting-system,\" the scientist named Timorous chimed helpfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wiggled my fingers and the tendrils instantly retracted, dropping a breathless Kelliah unceremoniously to the ground. A guard immediately went to her and helped her to her feet, but she quickly waved him away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Scientist!\" Kelliah snapped. Timorous jumped and looked at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? How may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The product's fail-safe mechanism. Activate it. Now,\" she commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist looked at her then at Vordin. \"The fail-safe mechanism will also initiate the device's interrogation protocols, did you wish to see a demonstration of those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I did,\" Kelliah said through gritted teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVordin shrugged again. \"You do have to admire her scientific curiosity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist pulled out a remote and pressed it. Suddenly, the armbands starting bending backwards as if pulled back by some unknown force. I tried resisting it, but before long my arms had been pulled backwards and the bands had snapped together behind my back like handcuffs. Then to make matters worse, the tendrils that I had freely manipulated like my fingers pulled up my ankles, hogtying me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelliah cracked her knuckles. \"Now, if you don't mind, I intend to test just how secure those bonds are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, very well, Kelliah,\" Vordin nodded, before turning to his scientist friend, \"She certainly is keen, isn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelliah licked her lips as she slowly made her way to me, her heels clacking on the metal floors. It certainly looked like she was looking forward to having revenge on me...  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I recall Professor Adearon telling me of a curious human phrase. I believe it goes 'the shoe is on the other foot', yes?\" Kelliah said as she flipped me onto my belly and dug her hands vigorously into my underarms, scratching her nails into my hollows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHit with the sudden tickle attack, I tried squirming loose. Aside from squirming left and right however, there was little I could do. My underarms were completely helpless, and hers to explore in any way she pleased. Kelliah had a wide smile on her face as I attempted to roll around in ticklish agony. To make matters worse, I felt a cool tendril slipped around my big toes, pulling my feet taut as well. Cold metal tendrils then began slowly tracing up and down my trapped soles, making me lay on my side, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes. As Madame Kelliah is\u2026 demonstrating, the product does come with a built-in fail-safe mechanism,\" the scientist Tomorous explained.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to tease the sensitive skin of my underarms with her fingers, circling the edge of my armpit and slowly closing in on the center of one hollow while using slow, deliberate strokes on the other. It was always nerve-wracking when my ticklers would play these mind games with me, because sometimes I would realize I knew what was coming next and would start preemptively giggling, which would only make things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI instinctively pulled at my restraints, but they still held tight, leaving my arms stretched out and helpless to resist the torment. As the circling got smaller and smaller, I began cackling louder right until her fingers brushed across the spot right at the the top of my ribs, where I couldn't help but give a rather unmanly squeak. Kelliah grinned, seeming to instantly realize that she had just stumbled across an especially soft spot. Still grinning, she placed two fingers on either side and claw her fingers on the exact spot on both sides like no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitch of my laughter heightened, and Kelliah seemed to enjoy this change, so she abandoned my underarms and turned me on my side to better access my stomach. She smiled, cracking her knuckles again and went and went in at full force along my rib cage with her devilish long fingernails. She alternated from stroking and scratching to poking and prodding. She jabbed her nails up and down my rib cage and rapidly all over my stomach. This was a very different type of tickling. It was still a scratchy tickling when she used the nails, but she was also poking and grabbing at my ribs, which is more of a muscle-stimulating tickle, which I quickly realized results in a much more guffawing version of my squeaky laughter.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while the tendrils on my feet never stopped. They weren't the worst of it by far, but I was already breathless with laughter, and I didn't need yet another tickling stimuli in the background further overloading me with ticklish sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and those would be the self-interrogation protocols,\" Tomorous explained, noticing Vordin looking at the tendrils who never stopped stroking up and down on my feet. \"We designed the devices to not only neutralize their users in the event of a perceived betrayal, but also activate their aiming protocols and begin torturing their former users.\"\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense, especially after the Weeper disaster that happened two standard years ago,\" Kelliah added, casually joining the conversation as she continued torment my stomach. Both Vordin and Tomorous looked a bit surprised at her mulit-tasking, joining their conversation while all the while tickling me.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming to realize her fun was due to end soon, Kelliah pulled out all the stops and she seemed determined to make me really scream with laughter for getting her earlier on.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lunged with her fingers and plowed into my sides, being almost instantly rewarded with peals of frantic laughter. She moved one hand to my stomach and wiggling all around my navel, occasionally dipping in an out of it to keep things lively. She quickly skittered her fingers all over my mid-section, trying to give me a good all-over tickling. She started high, burrowing her fingers into my underarms again, before starting to move down, digging her nails along my ribs and into the spaces between them. The devious purple-skinned woman then began gliding up and down my quivering sides, right before stopping at my tummy and scritching at it lightly before digging her fingers into my belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo finish off, Kelliah would then use the tips of her nails to tickle my hipbones, before slowly working her way up again, going at my belly, stroking my sides, teasing my ribs before scraping her nails all over my underarms.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Kelliah. As mastered as you are in this art, that is sufficient. You have more than adequately demonstrated the sturdiness of the bindings. Please try not to break subject five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelliah gave a little sigh, before giving me a parting poke in the ribs as she stood up and returned to Vordin's side. Noticing that I was still a quivering giggling mess on the floor, Vordin stroked his chin thoughtfully.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps now would be an ideal time to test how the specimen responds to sleep deprivation-based interrogation techniques...\"\u00c2\u00a0</span></div></div>",

Vordin and Kelliah were all up for testing you some more before I pulled rank as their human specialist and said you probably wouldn't survive,\" Professor Adeara greeted cheerily. I groggily got up in what was probably the infirmary, judging all the beeping medical equipment and white sheets. \"Of course, that's not quite true. You humans are an awfully resilient bunch, aren't you?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we are. Morning sleepyhead,\" answered a friendly voice. I turned to my left and saw my brown-haired friend Rachel sitting on the be beside mine. \"Well, I'm not sure terms like morning apply when you're in space, but good to see you nonetheless,\" she smiled, scratching her head.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject three and I were having the most enlightening conversation,\" Adeara said excitedly. \"I had no idea Earth courtship rituals were so varied and intricate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Rach? What have you been telling her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, y'know. Just girl talk,\" Rachel said, smiling mischievously. \"Anyway, is he going to be discharged soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The monitors indicate he has returned to a normal state of health,\" Adeara said, reading the machines. \"He should be, as soon as a discharge is authorized.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what are you doing here Rachel? Are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, y'see, with you taking a nap, Adeara needed another human interviewee. Seeing as there wasn't anything better to do, I volunteered. And I felt guilty for kicking your butt in the last game, so I asked if we could check in on you,\" Rachel said, I watched her sit on the edge of my bed and kick her tanned legs up and down as she explained. I noticed she was donning a white patient's gown, a mirror image of my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we came in, sat down, and you woke up a few minutes later,\" Adeara said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, what happened to my clothes?\" I said, sniffing my new garments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been in those stinky old clothes for so long, aren't you glad we at least have something new to wear?\" Rachel said grumpily. I guess it was my mistake for bringing it up. Issues of fashion were savagely female-dominated in my life.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"They will be returned to you once your contract is completed,\" Adeara added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, so when can I get out of here?\" I grumbled, as I leaned back into the pillow that smelled like bleach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as someone with the proper authority signs you out,\" Adeara explained. She reached for a pen and signed a clipboard at the foot of my bed. \"And now someone with the proper authority has signed you out,\" she grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been such a good influence on her,\" I whispered to Rachel, who just smiled mysteriously at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Adeara, now that he's up, didn't you promise a tour of the labs?\" Rachel asked. \"Humans never break promises y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Adeara murmured, scrawling in her handheld notebook again. \"Very well then, you two have been such a great help to me and my research. It seems only appropriate I return the favor,\" Adeara said as she opened the door to the infirmary and guided us out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdeara led us to a large elevator, inside of which she pressed a button with some strange writing on it. In this place it was hard to tell whether we were going up or down, but either way we arrived at our floor within a few seconds. We entered some kind of entryway guarded by two muscly aliens, but neither acknowledged our arrival aside from a respectful nod at Adeara. We opened a pair of double doors and walked into a large hall, with tables full of strange devices and blueprints and purple-skinned scientists working on all sorts of inventions. Further along the hallway narrowed a bit to accompany a series of rooms walled off by glass windows, probably experimenting rooms. The place was bustling with activity, and a few scientists greeted Adeara as they passed, unconcerned with the two test subjects. \"Wow, so these are the labs. Look at all this amazing technology!\" Rachel exclaimed, clearly impressed. I was a bit surprised at this; I hadn't really pegged her as the geeky tech-loving type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, looks like you're making some impressive things here. But with all this, how did you guys make a gun that didn't work? I mean, aside from screwing with me, obviously,\" I said, a tad sarcastically. It seemed sarcasm was lost on Adeara though, as she tugged the arm of one of the scientists nearby and promptly introduced me to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Fellis!\" she introduced cheerily. Fellis seemed none too happy to see us. Or at least one of us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject five, I know. The one who threw my restrainer gun,\" he growled. From up close, I recognized him as the ballsy presenter who showcased the tickling monitors and won the wager with Kelliah. He was a bit on the short side, but his glare was still intimating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair, it didn't work. What else could I do with it?\" I said, trying to explain myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you read the instructions?\" he asked, incredulous. My explanation did little to appease him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were instructions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, all our weapons had instructions. Didn't you notice?\" Rachel added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not helping Rach!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh, of course. The lack of translation,\" Fellis sighed. \"Damn shame. And I had wagered Tomorous that it would take two people out as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, what does your gun actually do?\" I asked curiously, before hastily adding a \"sir\", when he glared at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In simpler terms, it launches a pulse bubble, creating a static electro-void that causing all muscles within to seize up. Excellent for creating traps,\" he explained, sounding rather proud. \"I actually have the prototype here, if you're eager for a demonstration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, but your prototype didn't work! I pulled the trigger and everything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why we need our instructions translated. The gun requires a minimum charge time to create the energy for the pulse bubble. You're meant to hold the trigger down, then it fires at the nearest surface upon release,\" Fellis grumbled, taking me by the arm. \"I'll show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet,\" Rachel whistled, grinning. I bet she could smell that a good tickling was coming along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFellis lead/dragged me into an empty experimentation room and held out the prototype. He pulled the trigger, and after a charging period of about five seconds he released and a large, glowing, almost transparent sphere the size of a beach ball flew out of the gun and hovered a few feet from the ceiling.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything you have on Earth that can do this?\" he boasted proudly, adjusting a knob and the gun and the blue sphere followed wherever he was aiming at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does it do?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when he was about to answer, Rachel and Adeara burst in, having just caught up. \"Ooooh, what's that thing? It looks pretty trippy!\" Rachel giggled, pointing at the shimmering sphere right about her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stick your hands in it, Rach. The scientist over here will show you,\" I said, thinking fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel narrowed her eyes suspiciously, but it seemed her curiosity got the better of her and she raised her hands into the sphere. They didn't get very far until her arms slowed to a stop, most of her forearm inside the hovering ball of pulsating energy. Rachel was puzzled. \"I don't feel anything...\" she said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not meant to cause sensation, only immobilize the muscles. Try pulling away,\" the scientist instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel tried giving a little yank on her arm, but nothing happened. She tried again to pull away, this time using all her might.  Still nothing happened. It seemed like her arms were caught in mid-air. \"Neat,\" I said, grinning. \"Let's test how immobile she is. Want to join me, Adeara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? Comehohohon you guhuhuys!\" Rachel began to complain, but I had already slipped my fingernails into the soft hollows under Rachel's arm and began wiggling them around. Throwing her head back, she laughed very hard as my nails skittered around her ticklish tanned skin. Adeara seemed conflicted at first, but her curiosity seemed to get the better of her as she began to caress Rachel\u2019s ticklish sides with her long fingernails. Adeara began to snicker and giggle at the sight of her human friend being tickled to hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are tickling all humans such fun?\" Adeara asked with a giggle, as the sound of Rachel's melodic laughter filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say so, yeah,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, having tickled my fill and accruing enough guilt to actually feel bad, I decided that Rachel was done and stopped. Adeara reluctantly withdrew soon after, and Fellis retracted the sphere, leaving a giggling Rachel curled up on the floor. Impressed by the usefulness of the prototype I had assumed broken, I apologized for being rude to him and tossing his gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time don't do something that may damage the weapon - these prototypes aren't cheap to make!\" he scolded before softening somewhat. \"You should pay a visit to Timorous. He said he wanted a word with you, Professor Adearon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like to see next?\" Adeara asked. I pondered our options. We could head to see the scientist Timorous, who had made the metallic armbands I had used to such great effect against Kelliah, or keep exploring. I could hear muffled laughter farther down the corridor, coming from the other experiment rooms. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's pay this Timorous dude a visit,\" I said, remembering the talkative presenter. Rachel gave me a funny look, and I explained how the scientist showcased the tentacle-wristbands-thingies as we headed for Timorous' lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it that you meet all these people so fast?\" she asked, still a bit breathless from her previous ordeal.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"It's a gift. I guess I just attract people who have an affinity for tickling. Actually, these inventors remind me of Catherine back on Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot bothering to explain, I just poked in her ribs. \"Short version, she's basically like the scientists here, only... weirder. She builds stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds incredible. When we get back to Earth, you have to introduce me to her!\" Rachel said cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, about that...\" Adeara cut in, somewhat nervous. \"Forgive me for eavesdropping, but would you consider another contract?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Rachel and me so off-guard that we stopped right where we were, forcing Adeara to stop as well. \"Wait, what?\" I asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we know so little about humans, and you're the first we've picked up ever. I - we, we wish to study you, as well as have you test some of our non-military products. You could come to my world, see more of the galaxy,\" Adeara explained, looking a bit embarrassed at having brought it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a kind offer Adeara, but as fun as this was I should really be getting myself back home as soon as I can. There're a lot of people waiting for me, a lot of things I need to get back to. I'm afraid I'm going to have to turn you down,\" Rachel said, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human specialist then turned to me. This was so sudden and I hadn't really even thought about spending more time in space. Though now that I started thinking, it really appealed to me. Sure, I had things back in Earth, so did everybody, but nothing that I couldn't put on hold. Still, my parents...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm interested, but I need to think about it. I'll get back to you, okay?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please consider it, won't you?\" she said in such in such a hopeful manner I couldn't help but smile. \"Anyway, we should move on. I feel we may be obstructing the hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everybody getting the same offer?\" I asked as we resumed walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. With so few humans to begin with, I can't be choosy. I'll take whoever'd interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha. Anyway, let's go visit this Timorous guy, yeah?\" I said, trying to get us back on track. A few minutes later we found ourselves in a fancy-looking office overlooking a few separate experimenting rooms and a large lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, Professor Adearon!\" Timorous greeted her merrily. \"So glad you could stop by. Do you like my new office? Professor Vordin bestowed it on me and has tripled my funding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congrats,\" I said automatically. Timorous peered at me, then a smile lit up his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, I recognize you, human! Subject five, right?\" he exclaimed proudly, as if distinguishing one human from another was a great achievement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, that's not my name...\" I began to say, but he had already moved onto his next sentence. No wonder he and Vordin got on so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings you here, Adearon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was giving them a tour of the labs,\" Adeara answered. \u00a0\"They wanted to see some of our projects, so I'm showing them around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, of course! And this is perfect! I was about to call and ask you to recommend a human specimen or two for some experimentation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't call us specimens,\" Rachel said. \"And what kind of experiments are you talking about here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked, number three! Perhaps a demonstration would suffice?\" For some reason, the minute I heard that phrase all my muscles tensed up. Then I recalled all the times I'd heard that during my team's punishment. Timorous noticed and laughed at my reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry subject five! I simply meant I would show you what the team is working on,\" he chuckled, leading us to a small elevator that took us down into the lab below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... anything interesting happen recently?\" I asked randomly as the lift doors opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've received a new office,\" Tomorous said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've met some human beings,\" Adeara smiled.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen a lot of weird tickling devices,\" Rachel snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I do have to ask, why tickling? Was it just the first thing that popped into mind?\" I asked, directing my questions to Timorous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you know about the Pacification Principle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and Rachel nodded. \"Adeara told me after the battle.\u00a0Basically it says that you can't kill anyone, even in warfare, or there are harsh consequences. So a new range of non-lethal weapons were made, meant for tickling instead of injuring. Right?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an accurate summary. Well, by fortunate coincidence, all the species who signed the pact happened to have innately high sensitivity in one region or another. Thus, tickling was logically the easiest non-lethal solution,\" Timorous explained.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I thought I had just gotten lucky,\" I sniggered, prompting Rachel to jab me in the ribs.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonetheless, I am glad I could clear that up for you, number five. But now I wish for your feedback,\" Timorous said as we began nearing the experimentation rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we peered into the first room, I could see a purple-skinned woman laughing hysterically. At least I assumed she was. Her mouth was wide open but I couldn't hear a thing, so I guessed that the rooms were soundproofed. I guess it's hard to concentrate with people screaming in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was trapped in some kind of rather devious x-frame. Her ankles and wrists were clamped in these strange cuffs, which were attached to some machine behind her. From the machine were several small mechanical arms, equipped with feathers that were brushing up and down her body. Each time she yanked on her wrists or ankles, the speed of the feathers increased slightly and another was added to the torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks evil,\" Rachel said, looking nervous. \"You aren't about to make us go in, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! Unless one of you want to, of course...\" Timorous said, his voice trailing off as he looked at us. I was seriously considering, but felt now was not the time. After a few seconds of silence, he continued. \"You see, this interrogation device is designed to prey on the victim's mental state. The more you struggle, the more intense the torture becomes. It encourages the patient to be passive, which is exactly the mindset interrogative want,\" Tomorous said matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are the subjects?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards, of course. We have a rotation so every guard of average or above-average sensitivity has to spend a certain amount of time here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was quite surprised to learn that the oddly-attractive purple-skinned woman laughing her head was in fact a guard. After, um, 'observing' her figure, I realized she was quite lean and muscular. To be honest, I had thought all the guards were men, but as I thought about it I could see how it would be impossible to tell. Since they all wore bucket-helmets and armor thicker than what knights wore, distinction between male and female was almost impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were totally checking her out,\" Rachel whispered as we moved on to the next experiment. I couldn't resist making one playful crack at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, Rach. I was imagining you in her position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your dreams,\" she said, laughing.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrived at the next room to see another guard in what appeared to be the alien equivalent of a bathing suit. She seemed to be half-submerged in some kind of liquid, her arms shackled above her, leaving her underarms firmly exposed and taut. A pair of long automated scrub brushes were vigorously scrubbing every available inch of the ticklish girl. At her feet there were even small brushes going between her toes.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, part of the Pacification Principle is a law that we must treat all prisoners with basic decency, allowing them to wash regularly. We like to take advantage of a nifty little loophole,\" Tomorous said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks quite... tickly,\" Rachel shuddered, brushing her skin instinctively. Watching the bristly scrubbers work must have made her own skin feel tingly like she was the one being tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next room was empty, aside from a pair of stocks. Timorous hummed in acknowledgment. \"Ah, yes. This is why I called for your assistance, Adearon. Engineering has requested more crew members to help, leaving us short a few guards for subjects. Could you recommend one of your human subjects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, hold up! I don't want to get in there! My feet are way too ticklish for it!\" Rachel exclaimed, looking at the brushes that surrounded the automated stocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind so much. Or...\" I said, before turning cheekily to Adeara. \"Why don't you have a go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I... have never been tickled before,\" she admitted, looking almost embarrassed about it. \"And I am not certain I wish this to be my first experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, back in Earth we have a way of solving problems like this,\" Rachel said with a smile. \"It's called rock-paper-scissors. Sound fair?\" After we explained the rules to Adeara, it was time to play.</span></div></div>",

That was truly an enlightening experience.\" Adeara celebrated with a big smile. I couldn't help but smile as well seeing her so excited over something as simple as this. However, I realized one more failure and I would end up in those stocks. I had to hope that I would be victorious against Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job!\" I congratulated her and then turned to Rachel. \"Well Rach I guess it's between you and me huh?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"One, two, three!\" Rachel announced as we stuck our hands out. Both Rachel and I went for paper and Adeara had opted for stone, her small purple fist clenched rather tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! I win, correct? Stone crushes palm!\" Adeara cheered. It sounded like her excitement at playing a human game had not worn off. Rock-paper-scissors wasn't THAT fun.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, paper wraps rock, so... You lose. Sorry,\" Rachel said, shrugging.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paper wraps rock? How does that work? It seems... most illogical...\" Adeara pouted. I could tell she was rather anxious about her time in those stocks, and I found her distress to be rather adorable to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but that's how the game works. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, Adearon. I am able to halt the proceedings at any time should your condition require it,\" Timorous assured her as he pushed the glass door open and invited her in. \"A clock wille be set for a short ten minute run, after which I will stop the machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, very well... but do, erm, have the machine function at a lower intensity, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Timorous conferred as he locked her in. Adeara slid her purple feet out of her black workboots and slipped them into the stocks. Soon after a loud click confirmed that her feet were trapped in place.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I am unsure of this...\" Adeara said, gulping as bands sprung out, wrapped around her shapely toes, and gently pulled them back. Her feet looked quite helpless in their stretched position. I had to say, I still found purple feet to be a bit strange, but I rather enjoyed the sight of her slender feet shaking in the stocks as she tested her bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck!\" I called, flashing her a thumbs-up, which she returned nervously, as we closed the door and waited for the machine to work its magic. Four purple digits appeared on a display beside the room, denoting ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what kind of device is that anyway?\" Rachel asked curiously as we gathered to watch through the observation window. We stared for a moment, just watching Adeara look around nervously and wiggle her toes.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why isn't it working?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, you see, it takes a moment to scan the nerve mappings and align the targeting algorithms. Do you see those sensors?\" Timorous queried, pointing at black bulbs at the front of the top of the stocks. \"They analyze sensitivity of skin by measuring the receptivity of nerves,\" he explained, staring at Adeara's purple feet.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm,\" I affirmed, grinning at the target of Timous' interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I'd forgotten to answer your question, subject three,\" Timorous said, realizing he left Rachel hanging. He seemed entranced at the sight of Adeara's bare feet. I laughed to myself. Subtlety wasn't his strong suit.\u00a0\"They are specialized automated stocks, rather simple and inexpensive to manufacture. But for some reason despite its inefficiency and natural obstacles, foot tickling remains remarkably popular as an interrogation method universe-wide. Several of our planetside stores report that they sell out quite quickly, even the ones designed for recreational purposes. They're one of our top five selling products.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing,\" I laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you guys have stores?\" Rachel asked mouth agape. I could tell she was imagining a shopping mall full of nothing but tickle tools. I had to admit it wasn't a bad fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, OmniProd Corp has stores on 200 planets galaxy-wide, dominating the markets in almost a dozen clusters. We are even considering having one out on your pre-spaceflight planet, Earth. Do you think there would be a market for such items here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and Rachel looked at each other and couldn't resist giggling. \"Oh, definitely,\" we said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what an intriguing prospect. I shall have to bring that up with Solaris or Kelliah next time I see either of them,\" Timorous nodded. \"Ah, it seems the device has completed the alignment of the targeting algorithms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the machine stopped scanning and several fuzzy bendable sticks, which reminded me a lot of pipe-cleaners, popped out and began creeping through the gaps between Adeara's toes. I saw Adeara gasp, try to hold it in, before bursting into laughter over the span of about five seconds. Laughing her head off, the alien could do nothing but grab at the stocks as the sticks flexed and stroked all along her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems the targeting system analyzed that the tops of the feet are her most vulnerable spot,\" Timorous observed, reaching into his pocket for one of those small monitors I saw a lot of scientists carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool, but is it really necessary to note that down?\" Rachel asked, peering over and grinning knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am merely recording observational results!\" Tomorous denied.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we get it,\" I laughed, patting Tomorous on the shoulder. A gesture he responded to with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... well, moving on. These stocks have several functions and tools, and after they analyze the target's weak spot, they send out tools specialized to get the best reaction. Those,\" he said, pointing at the fuzzy pipe-cleaners, \"are but one of the installed tools. It also comes equipped with quills, brushes, and feathers,\" Timorous proudly informed us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, I said, \"That's a good selection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there will be other attachments sold separately for the domestic model,\" he added.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are quite cool actually. Any chance I can bring a copy when I head back to Earth?\" Rachel laughed, joking. At least I assumed she was joking. Rachel enjoyed the odd tickle fight and a few playful tickles every now and then, but it wasn't till we arrived here that I realized she might be more into this than I thought. It seemed that she was really turning out to be a rather enthusiastic tickle fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, professor? Are there security cameras here?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. All experimentation areas have several security cameras installed all over,\" Timorous nodded. I found it rather amusing to be having a conversation while our tour guide was bursting with laughter inside a soundproofed room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you asking?\" Rachel probed suspiciously, arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd quite like to get a tape of this,\" I answered, eyebrows raised. \"I mean you would, wouldn't you Professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimorous just ignored me though and continued to watch Adeara thrash and squirm as her the pipe-cleaners tormented every spot of her ticklish purple toes. Rachel glared at me for a minute, and then her face softened. \"She sure does look like she's having some fun, doesn't she? I feel a bit bad though; that's no way to have your first tickle.\" For some reason I found her phrasing amusing. She said \"first tickle\" the way a romantic might say \"first kiss\".\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be down, Rach. If you really want to, you can try out the next one,\" I teased, slipping my hands under her armpits and wiggling them. She shrieked and pushed me away, giggling.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're getting it now,\" she declared, grabbing my ribs and tickling me to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wait until we leave the labs to do that, the scientists are easily distracted\" Timorous muttered as he walked in and separated the two of us. We were both giggling as we stood up.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. By the way, aren't the ten minutes up?\" Rachel said, still a wide-smile on her face as she glanced at the digital clock inside the observation room. Four zeros were flashing incessantly, trying to get attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course,\" Tomorous said almost reluctantly, pressing a button and stopping the machine from further tormenting Adeara's ticklish toes. Rachel and I walked in and helped a shaky Adeara to her feet as Timorous bustled off to fetch her a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it?\" Rachel asked as she helped Adeara put her boots back on.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was rather... intense,\" Adeara panted, her purple forehead damp with sweat. \"I would prefer it to be more gentle in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that can be arranged,\" Rachel giggled as she stroked a finger up Adeara's sole before slipping her second shoe on. \"Can you walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdeara nodded and got to her feet as Tomorous handed her a glass of water, which she chugged down quickly. \"Thank you, Timorous. When your machine is finished, let me know. I think I would like to purchase one,\" she said, smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you're alright,\" I nodded, holding open the door for her as we all gathered outside the experimentation rooms.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was quite the experience. But I fear that may have been too time-consuming. We were meant to meet Madame Kelliah as soon as you recovered. We are behind schedule for the next mock battle, you see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we're behind schedule anyway, what's another hour going to be? I say we keep exploring!\" Rachel said rebelliously, looking at me for support.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I woke up tied to the bed surrounded by a huge group of middle-school girls. They tickled me all over for a few hours; even moved me to a different part of the house at one point.\" I replied nonchalantly, like I might say \"One of the corn flakes in my breakfast cereal was shaped like a maple leaf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really wasn't that bad for most of it, it was when they decided to hang me from the garage ceiling and take a feather drill to my-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb broke in. \"Wait! Are you actually serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely. I would never have been able to dream that up myself. As I was sayin'...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. They really tickled you for hours straight? Why didn't one of your family members come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were all out. Remind to keep some of my, uh, 'instruments', under lock and key in the future. It's ridiculous how many feathers you can find just lying around your house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel broke in, looking animated. \"It's too bad they beat me to the punch. Maybe I should ask them which spots to press and how to press them to really drive you crazy for future reference. What did you say their names were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't. And I only got the names of two of them. Their leader looked to be the oldest. About fourteen, brunette, named Katelyn, actually pretty big for a little kid. One of the other's was a blonde named Cindy, and I think they must do this sort of thing all the time, judging from the way they handled some of those feathers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb shifted his huge feet unconsciously. \"Back up? Did you say her name was Katelyn, and she had dark hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. She sounds familiar, where have I heard that name before...Oh yeah! I think her parents asked me if I could baby-sit her for the evening. It could be a different Katelyn, but how many dark-haired, fourteen year-old girls are there running around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snickered. \"If that's the case, I think you'll have a busy evening, knowing her. If she asks if she could invite some friends over, me-thinks you're in for a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob shifted nervously, obviously not liking the idea that he would be alone in a house with a resourceful tickle-sadist, even if she was barely a teenager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I didn't tell you guys? She even got it all on film. At least the part where her group had strung me up and were tickling me all over. Damn it was embarrassing, I wish there was some way to get the footage back before she does anything with it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel, who had been looking intently between us as we discussed what Rob might be in for, suddenly spoke up.  \"What if we got Rob here to convince her to give the tape back? Or, more risky but with a higher chance of success, what if you sneak into the house and search her room while Robb's babysitting her? The two of them being the only others in the house... You should be able to recover it easily enough while she's distracted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head in wonder. \"Great idea, Rach. You up for it, Robb? You'd basically just be doing your job anyways, but keeping her downstairs long enough for me to retrieve something that was ill-gotten anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb nodded resignedly. \"Okay, I'll help you. Just let me know when you're done, and try not to make it very obvious that somebody ransacked her room at the exact same evening she was alone in the house with somebody she didn't even know very well, who just happened to go to the same school and be the same age as one of her most recent victims.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just grinned, glad to have some help. \"Thanks a lot, man. Just be careful around her, you never know what tricks she'll have up her sleeve. If she suspects us... Well, anyways, I wanna get ready ahead of time. What's the address?\"</span></div></div>",

A cloaked figure emerged and planted itself at the foot of my bed, within arms-reach of my vulnerable feet. The figure did a great job masking its figure. The only portion of the body that was revealed was the lower part of the face. In fact, I could only assume it was a female because of the fullness of the lips and what seemed to be a dark shade of lipstick. She spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at her, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, but it looks like you are a part of some sort of cult if I had to guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't call it a cult exactly. Have you ever heard of an organization called, The Shriek?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened upon hearing this. I had heard of The Shriek before. Nobody besides their victims had ever seen them before. It's a group that appears to target young adults, teenagers, and occasionally children. These victims have generally been described as degenerate young people in need of some sort of discipline. The Shriek apparently uses tickling to help correct bad behaviors, which kind of excites you. What could this woman possibly want with you? You rarely get yourself in any serious trouble, nothing that The Shriek would ever catch wind of. Apparently you've done something wrong if she's here. Either way, you aren't too worried. In fact, you might end up enjoying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard of you. Your group breaks into houses and tortures people, sound about right?\" You intentionally sounded a bit snarky, in hopes of getting her upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we break into the houses of whiny brats such as yourself and teach them lessons of respect and obedience. It appears that you could benefit from such a correction, yes? That is not why I am here, however. I am actually here to recruit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was quite surprised by this. I was also pretty confused as to why she felt the need to tie me up and strip me if she was only going to hire me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why go through all the trouble of stripping me and tying me up if you were just going to ask me to join you? I'm not saying I will join, but you have peaked my curiousity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh but that's where you're wrong. First of all, it was no trouble at all. I have access to magics that did this to you. I can strip you, tie you up, and tickle you senseless without even lifting a finger. Secondly, I sense a strong magical connection to you. I know you love being tickled, as well as tickling others, which is why I am here. I also know that you're smart. I had a feeling that once you knew where I was from, that you would try to bait me into tickling you. I also have a feeling that you might try to deny my request in hopes that I would try to persuade you otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart was racing at this point. She pulled back her hood to reveal her beauty, as well as her long brunette hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest assured, young man, no matter what you say, these long nails and luscious lips will soon be all over you, finding every little tickle spot that drives you wild. My only question for you is, where would you like me to start?\"</span></div></div>",

She had ebony, black hair with the tips dyed bright pink. She had mischievous, hazel eyes and purple eye shadow and lipstick which complimented the wide smirk she had right now. She was also wearing a camo tank top, and black jeans. Back when me being home alone was more common, Stephanie would come over and babysit me all the time. We got along quite well, especially after we discovered that we both had an interest in tickling. After that, there were a number of times where we spent the visit tying each other up and tickling the other senseless. The nudity was something new however. And as hot as Steph was, not unwelcome at all. <br>\r\n\"Indeed it does. Although not EVERYTHING about this does.\"<br>\r\nShe smirked even wider. \"Well it's been awhile. Thought I'd bring some new tricks since last time.\" She said as she started crawling up on top of me. I saw that her nails were painted black.<br>\r\n\"Since when is undressing someone and tying them up in their sleep a trick.\"<br>\r\n\"Since this!\" She then started digging into my hip bones which caused me to squeal rather loudly. And cause a little something to pop up. \"Good to see you're just as ticklish as ever.\" She noticed my erection before skittering two of her nails across it. \"It's also good that you're just as into it.\"<br>\r\n\"Well Steph. You got me good. It appears I'm at your mercy.\"<br>\r\nShe grinned widely and she started tickling...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Good morning student,\" greeted an unbelievably cheerful voice. I looked towards the entrance and saw a woman in her early thirties, maybe late twenties, walk in the room with a pile of books under one arm. Her red hair was tied back into a bun and on the bridge of her nose sat a pair of glasses, which she adjusted slightly upon entering. A white blouse hugged her body, and a knee-length black skirt covered her thighs. On her feet a pair of high heeled shoes hugged her soles and toes, making <i>my</i> feet hurt just watching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Miss Heart, and your parents hired me to be your personal tutor for the week,\" she continued. As she walked towards my bed, I sat there in disbelief. A tutor walked in while I was sleeping, stripped me, and tied me to the bed? What was she teaching me, sexual intercourse? Though to be honest, that wouldn't have been so bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately I asked the most obvious question: \"Why am I tied up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Heart smiled at me. \"Why, it's all for the sake of your education of course! True, my methods aren't common practice, but I have the best reputation in the area as my students have never failed a subject that I have tutored them in. Your family is out for the entire week to New York. I remember you father and mother were excited about going to the Rockefeller center, and your elder sister was eager to visit the shops around Times Square.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heels hit the floor beside my bed as she set down her books on my desk and turned to face me, resting a well-manicured hand on her sexy hip. Pulling myself out of a trance, I realized I was no closer to having answers. \"You still haven't told me exactly why I'm tied naked to my own bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, it's for the sake of your education. You see, my methods don't work on just anybody. I may have the best reputation in this area, but unfortunately I can't help everybody who's failing class. Luckily however, I can help you. While hiring me, your mother mentioned to me that you aren't just extremely ticklish; you are <i>deathly</i> ticklish, and she joked that I could tickle you to help you remember. And that's what I'm going to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brain froze. Did she really say she was going to tickle me to help me study? I didn't see how that was going to help at all. Not only did the thought of being restrained and tickled turn me on embarrassingly, my mother had told a complete stranger that I was deathly ticklish and that that same stranger had tied me up and intended to do just that. If she started tickling my exposed body, she wouldn't need to teach sexual intercourse to realize how much of a turn-on it was for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's how my lessons are going to go.,\" Miss Heart began. \"Every day I'll be teaching you about a subject and reading you a couple text books from that subject. After every chapter, I will ask you a ten question quiz. Each wrong answer will be worth a minute of tickling. At the end of each book, I'll give you a fifty question test. Each wrong answer will be worth two minutes of tickling. Each time I am interrupted, whether reading or not, will be worth five minutes. At the end of the lesson, once all the books are read, I add up the minutes and tickle you for that amount of time, no matter how late it goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was insane! My day was like a cross between a daydream and a nightmare, and she was staying all week! I was at war with myself whether or not to fail just to get her to tickle me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today's lesson is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" I asked, knowing it would add to my time later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Heart gave me a very sly smirk. \"Five minutes,\" she said. \"Today's lesson is in American History. We start with the first British Colony in the Americas, which was Jamestown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Miss Heart went through an entire American History text book, her sitting on a chair next to my naked body tied to my bed. When she finished with that one, she started another. And another. I did my best to pay attention and learn, for even if I failed her tests the information would still help. The books took hours to get through as she read from cover to cover, even the index to make sure I pronounced everything right and knew the definition of every word. But what was important was at the end of the lesson when she told me my results</span></div></div>",

While there's still room for improvement, this means you'll receive only thirteen minutes of tickling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only thirteen?\" I asked with a wry smile, not entirely angry with the result. \"Would you be saying that if we had switched positions and I was tickling you instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Heavens no,\" Miss Heart answered and I caught a glint in her eye. \"Why, I'm exceedingly ticklish and even the slightest stroke of a feather leaves me a giggling mess. I can barely stop myself if I'm so much as goosed in the ribs. If I was being under threat of being tickled for getting questions wrong, you better believe that I would be hitting the books.\" She gave me a bright smile. \"Not that a good boy like you would ever think of tying me down and tickling me until I beg for mercy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gritted my teeth as I realised that I was at the mercy of a full fledged tease. Miss Heart had a sparkle in her eyes that gave away the fact that despite her business like demeanour, she knew exactly what she was doing and loved every minute of it. I felt an erection grow as my imagination went to images of her being tied down naked as I tickled and teased her bare skin and it wasn't long before a rather sizable tent was pitched under the sheet. I went red with embarrassment while Miss Heart retained her bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting the book onto the floor, Miss Heart walked over to the bed and sat down beside my waist as she looked down at my bare torso. \"Time for our correction treatment to begin then,\" she said before bringing up her hands and I noticed her long nails were decorated with bright red nail polish. \"Thirteen minutes of tickling,\" she repeated, adjusting her watch to give it an alarm at the thirteen minute mark. \"I hope you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not reallEEHEEHEEHEEHEEEEEEEE!!!\" I squealed as the tickle attack came from nowhere. Miss Heart dived her fingers deep into my underarms and started wriggling without a moment's hesitation. I let out an embarrassing sounding laugh as the tickling struck my hollows and I bounced in my bonds, bucking and twisting however much I could. Miss Heart's long fingernails had points at the end which tickled madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Heart didn't waste any time as her fingers scratched my smooth hollows, teasing and tickling them with a technique that showed she had plenty of experience doing this. Eight of her fingers wriggled right into the centre of my armpits, scratching lightly but fast and always focusing right in the middle. Her long nails moved only slightly, but that was enough to tickle badly as my skin was so sensitive. Deathly ticklish was an appropriate adjective. Each scrape was like a small lightning shock running through me and I tried yanking at the ropes binding my wrists to pull my arms down for some protection but with no luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed long and hard, trying to stop myself from bucking too much lest the thin sheet covering what was left of my modesty came right off. Being tied and tickled like this was incredibly erotic though and it only made my arousal worse as Miss Heart got in close to tickle down to my ribs as well, flicking her fingers across the top of my ribs before diving back into my underarms, keeping up her short but devastating strokes to my pits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STAHAHAPPPTHAHAHHAATTT!!!\" I screamed in protest as her fingers continued to delve deep unto my armpits, making me squeak and squeal with laughter each time she tickled those sensitive areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're only a minute in,\" Miss Heart countered as I felt an equal amount of dread and delight surge within me. \"Although I should probably change targets. It'd be a shame if I were to desensitize such ticklish underarms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she...</span></div></div>",

Tingling badly, I really wanted to lower my hands and just rub the feelings away but my bonds prevented that. I eventually calmed down into heavy breathing and realised Miss Heart had moved from her spot. I looked around blearily and saw her at the foot of the bed, right by my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of sheer instinct, I curled my toes up defensively \"Nooo...\" I protested weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Heart simply grinned in response \"Yes...\" She replied and flicked her long nails over my soles. I pursed my lips to stop any sound from escaping but I was already over-sensitised from my arousal and the previous tickling putting me on edge. A few more light, spider tickles on my feet had me going right into giggling and then outright laughter as they didn't stop. Miss Heart's long nails kept up their quick and constant teases on my feet, causing me to twitch them rapidly as I tried to escape but with little impact as the nails just followed my ticklish feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to laugh and was getting louder with each drag of the nail on my soles. Miss Heart explored my feet carefully, tenderly scraping up and down over my heels, soles and arches, trying to find what spots made me laugh the most. As she soon discovered, it was pretty much all of them as I continued to laugh long and hard with each soft tickle on my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the tickling remaining relatively light, I was soon howling with laughter while bouncing on the bed. Despite it not being very hard, the tickling was constant and went all over my sensitive spots at a meticulous fashion. Each scratch on my soles or scrape of those nails against my feet only caused me to laugh harder than before and what made it worse was the fact the tickling continued to arouse me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constant tickling I was going through made me as hard as I could remember being with my erection straining under the sheets, the fabric offering something to rub against which only made my arousal worse. I started to let out moans through my laughter even as I realised Miss Heart was still only teasing my feet and that she hadn't even begun on the full torture yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I continued to laugh with Miss Heart wriggling her nails into my arches, I didn't know she was planning on...</span></div></div>",

You truly are a ticklish young man aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer taunts only made me more embarrassed. My situation was bad enough without her taunts over my sensitivity, particularly when she was exploiting it for all it was worth! I remained silent and tried to glare at her although I could imagine with my sweaty face and heavy breathing, I wasn't really making much of an impact. Miss Heart merely giggled at my efforts before surprisingly getting down on her knees before my feet \"But back to your penalty. I think I've waisted enough time with idle chit chat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Heart then licked her lips and I realised with mounting horror what she was planning \"Noooo!!\" I almost shouted and tried to pull my feet back but with no luck at all. Miss Heart gave another giggle before she leaned in and started licking my left foot slowly. Her tongue went up and down over my sole, moving it over my skin with slow precision, keeping up a constant tickly presence. Even worse, her right hand went over to my other foot and started tickling lightly once again, her long nails spider-tickling over my heel and sole as she went with her double assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NYAAHHHANNOHHOTTHHAHAHATTT!!!\" I screamed through my laughter, bouncing on the bed as I tried yanking my legs back to protect my feet. Everything I tried to do though had no effect and only seemed to encourage Miss Heart to continue. Her tongue bathed my naked foot with long licks, flicking the tip of her tongue right in the middle of my arch, a move that proved to tickle worse than I expected. Added to that were her fingers continuing their playful tickling of my other foot, even wriggling into the base of my toes to gain further laughter from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part of all of this though was the bed sheet providing friction against my erection that got worse with each tickle I received. Bouncing on the bed as I was tickled made me rub my cock against the sheet and only increased my arousal to breaking point. Combined with the tickling on my feet sending waves of electricity through my body, I felt as if it wasn't long before I'd burst. I tried to plead through my laughter for the tickling to stop, not wanting to embarrass myself by losing all control but Miss Heart continued the licking, her tongue starting to probe between my toes as she teased and tickled there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I felt it couldn't get any worse, Miss Heart</span></div></div>",

Speaking of comfortable, the way her body was positioned now there was no way she didn't know of my 'enthusiasm' but for whatever reason she chose to ignore it as she began slowly fluttering her long nails up and down my ribs. This new stimulus set me to bouncing and flopping on the bed again as I desperately tried to tumble left and right to avoid her devilish fingers. Miss Heart knew she was doing, and was expertly hitting all the spots as she poked my ribcage making me splutter and guffaw, drew circles along my tummy to make me giggle, squeezed my sides to make me jolt and corkscrewed a finger into my bellybutton to make me scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were questioning my teaching methods a moment ago, so here's Education 101: the best way to improve student behavior is to use a good mix of positive and negative reinforcement,\" she said, though I could barely hear her over the sound of my own wild laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Heart slowed down her ticklish assault to let me breath. \"Positive reinforcement is when you reward a student's good behavior and provide an incentive for them to continue doing said behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped and almost lost control right there when Miss Heart began skittering her long nails over the covers right where my urgent member lay. The touch was light, but the effect was powerful as waves of pleasure flooded my body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, studies say that positive reinforcement isn't nearly as efficient as negative reinforcement in quickly correcting student behavior,\" Miss Heart grinned. It took a moment for me to process what she said, with the lingering feelings from her nails but I soon got the message as I spasmed as Miss Heart dug her nails into my underarms again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what would you say is the more effective method, my eager young pupil?\" Miss Heart asked coyly, as I laughed myself silly as her long nails stroked all over the hollows of my armpits?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I screamed with laughter as I thrashed and spasmed uncontrollably. She continued this for the remaining, minutes. Tickling my armpits, my ribs, my belly, my hips. When the time was over. I lied there, giggling quietly as the effects wore off and as she untied me. \"Now. I am going to go warm us up some breakfast. When you are ready, please join me. I have some more details I'd like to share with you.\" With that, she grabbed her heels and walked out the room without putting them on. I waited a few minutes for my erection to die down, and then I got dressed and went down stairs to find myself greeted by a plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup. \"Hello. Sit. I have things I need to tell you about my tutoring program.\" I quickly sat down and started eating. \"Now. First off, let me explain that while your parents hired me for the week, if you wish, I will come after the week is done and help you any day during the summer that you wish. Secondly, because of legal reasons, I have to allow you tickle me for every minute that I have tickled you if you wish. And since I stripped you during your tickling, you're allowed to strip me.\" She looked at me with a knowing smile. \"Should I assume from your...enjoyment of my methods that you wish to do both of these things?\" I eagerly nodded, my head daydreaming of stripping her naked and tickling her senseless. She seemed to be attempting to hide a smile at this. \"Good! I mean, very well! In any case, you have two choices. You can do it at the end of each session. For example, you can tickle me for thirteen minutes today. Or you can let the minutes build up and at the end of the week, tickle me for all the time combined.

And if you wish, I may be stripped naked and tied to the bed as you were. Does that sound fair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yes\u2014I mean, of course. That\u2019s fair.\u201d I stuttered to get the words out. I still couldn\u2019t believe it. This gorgeous woman was going to be tied up naked for me to tickle? It was a dream come true. Just thinking about it made me as hard as I had been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, let\u2019s proceed.\u201d She rose from her chair and I did the same. I followed her back upstairs to my bedroom, trying not to appear too eager to get her at my mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as we entered the room she began undressing. First she took off her glasses and set them on my desk. Her eyes were even more striking than before. Then she undid her bun and let her wavy red hair flow down to the middle of her back. She gave a quick shake to loosen it up. I stood speechless as she unbuttoned her blouse, displaying a black lace bra that struggled to contain her breasts. She then slid her skirt off to reveal matching panties. Next came her stockings. She sat down on the bed and rolled them off over her exquisitely dainty and smooth feet. I was beside myself already, but she didn\u2019t stop there. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes when she unhooked her bra and exposed her perfect breasts, which were large but certainly perky for their size. Her flawless nipples hardened when met by the cool air. She stood up again and I almost forgot to breathe when she lowered her panties down to her floor and slipped them off. She had a short neatly trimmed bush which sat upon her deliciously sublime pussy. Her round plump ass met my bed again and she turned and laid onto her back with her arms over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, are we going to get started?\u201d she inquired seductively. For a moment I just stood there letting my eyes take in the amazing sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sorry, of course.\u201d I was nervous with arousal and excitement but I tried to contain my enthusiasm as I fastened her to the bed in a spread-eagle position. I stepped back to admire my handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she was, in the same predicament and in the same restraints that I was in not very long ago. She was completely naked and bound tightly with not even a sheet to protect her beautiful ticklish body. I tried not to let my mouth water. She looked up at me with a polite smile. In this compromising  position she seemed different before\u2014almost innocent in a way. It was hard to believe that this was the same woman who had delighted in torturing me a short while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll kindly set the timer for thirteen minutes, then I\u2019m all yours.\u201d Miss Heart paused for a moment before continuing. \u201cNow as I said before, I'm exceedingly ticklish, so it won\u2019t be necessary to tickle me very hard in order to elicit a response. I assure you that even the lightest and softest tickles will turn me into a giggling mess. I\u2019m nothing if not fair, and since it was your first day I hope you know that I went easy on you. I expect you to do the same for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasy on me? I almost said something, but I thought better of it. Nevertheless, I now had her right where I wanted her and she was all mine to tease and torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, thirteen minutes\u201d I said as I started the timer.

I still had to all week to tickle her, which also meant that she still had all week to tickle me. The last thing I wanted to do was make her angry since tomorrow I would surely be at her mercy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood over Miss Heart\u2019s naked body, my eyes darting around trying to figure out where to begin. Under her arms maybe? That\u2019s where she started with me. Or perhaps her delicious tummy. I bet her nipples were ticklish too. After taking in the wondrous sight for a few minutes, I walked over to the foot of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll start with your feet.\u201d I grinned as I started the timer. \u201cThirteen minutes.\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything, but I could tell she breathing heavier now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lip and her toes curled with anticipation as my wiggling fingers inched closer and closer to her beautiful delicate feet. The instant I made contact she burst into a fit of of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeheehee! Ahaha!\u201d she cried. \u201cN-noho! Plehease!\u201d The sound was music to my ears. Her feet pulled and kicked in their restraints, but my hands followed their movements as I scribbled up and down her soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thou-ha-hought youhoo were gohoing to go eaheheasy on meahaha!\u201d she screamed and flailed on the bed. To be honest I thought I was going easy on her. This woman was really ticklish. I could only imagine her reaction if I really gave it to her. I might\u2019ve felt bad, but I remembered all too well how she had teased and tormented me earlier. I continued my attack on her toes as she squealed and begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlehease! I cahahan\u2019t take it!\u201d She bucked up and down on the bed, desperate for relief. I continued to dance my fingers all over her helpless feet.

Stohahahahap!\u201d I traced and stroked and spidered and kneaded each part of her heavenly feet. Her toes flared and curled with every pass; her naked body thrashed about as she laughed and howled. After a few more minutes of nonstop tickling, I decided to give her a short break so she could catch her breath. Her breasts heaved as she panted for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t take anymore\u201d she gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re a very good tickler.\u201d I could see that even though she had begged me to stop, she was clearly enjoying this.

She may have thought that she had gone easy on me, but I was going to make sure that she knew I wasn\u2019t going to be as nice. I decided to tickle her senseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood over her helpless naked body, completely exposed for me to do with as I pleased. I looked her over from head to toe before deciding on a spot to begin. Finally I sat down on the bed next to her chest and placed my hands over her armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we start here since that\u2019s where you started with me?\u201d I asked teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please, not there\u201d she winced. I had a suspicion that her underarms may have been her most ticklish spot. She bit her lip and closed her eyes in anticipation, but I also noticed the slightest bit of a smile hidden underneath her shrinking expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held my fingers over her bare skin and paused for just a second. Then without remorse I dug deep into her pits and kneaded furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeeyahahahaha!\u201d she erupted into a fit of laughter. \u201cNoowhahahaha!\u201d She screamed and convulsed on the bed, overwhelmed with sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStohahahahap!

Nohoho!\u201d she shrieked as she reflexively tried to pull her arms down to protect her defenseless body. Her restraints held strong though and she had no choice but to submit to the torturous tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlehehease stop!\u201d she implored. \u201cI-I cahahan\u2019t take it!\u201d I gave her no relief though and moved down to attack her abdomen. I scribbled and spidered my fingers all over her tummy. I dug and twisted in her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEekahahaha! Nowahaha!\u201d she squealed. No longer was she the professional composed woman that had dominated me earlier. I had reduced her to a giggling little girl, frightened of my menacing fingers. My next targets were her juicy inner thighs. I pinched and squeezed as she desperately and unsuccessfully tried to close her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThihihis isn\u2019t faihahahar!\u201d she protested. \u201cI-hi didn\u2019t tickle youhoo this hahahahard!\u201d She was right. As bad as she tormented me before, I was giving it to her a lot worse. And I was loving every second of it. This was a dream come true. I had this gorgeous nude woman at my mercy and I had no mercy to give her\u2014only more ticklish agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou-you\u2019re gohoing to be in sohahaha much tr-trouble!\u201d she warned. \u201cWahait until I gehet my hahahands on you!\u201d I\u2019m sure her threat was genuine, and maybe part of me was hoping that it was. As aroused as I already was, I got even more excited at the thought of her getting revenge on me tomorrow. But for right now, she was mine and I delighted in dishing out more than she could handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed her sides and dug in, taking hold as she twisted and writhed in anguish. She pulled away but had nowhere to go. I followed all of her movements and gave her no reprieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for several more minutes. I jumped from place to place\u2014armpits, ribs, stomach, thighs, then back to stomach, ribs again, and armpits. Every time she thought she was safe I found another spot to tease and tickle. Finally the timer went off. The thirteen minutes were over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused and let Miss Heart catch her breath. Her beautiful form was now glistening with sweat. Her once neat hair was now a mess and she had tears in her eyes from laughing so hard. Her breasts heaved up and down as she took in precious air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAl-alright\u201d she panted. \u201cTh-that\u2019s thirteen minutes.

If she hadn\u2019t noticed my erection under the sheets before, there was certainly nothing hiding from her now. I just stared at her in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at me with mock pity. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You didn\u2019t think I stripped you for nothing, did you? If I left you covered, I wouldn\u2019t have access to all of your sensitive ticklish areas.

I\u2019m going to make sure of it.\u201d She leaned in close to my face. Her beautiful eyes were fixed with mine. \u201cNow hush. You\u2019ve still got twelve more minutes and I\u2019ve got a lot to explore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding her gaze as she spoke, she lowered her fingers down to my sides and scribbled relentlessly up and down from the bottom of my ribs to the top of my hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWahahaha!\u201d I bucked and thrashed on my bed as she increased the pressure little by little. \u201cNohoho!\u201d I pleaded, desperate for relief. Her movements were rhythmic and deliberate; she knew exactly what to do to drive me wild. Just when I thought I couldn\u2019t take anymore, her fingers crept inward and assailed my stomach. She danced her nails all over my abdomen, occasionally digging into my bellybutton and making me squeal with agony and delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeeahahaha! N-no! I cahahan\u2019t take it!\u201d My begging fell on deaf ears. Miss Heart had no intentions of slowing down, and I think my despair only made her attack more fervently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlehehehease!\u201d I cried. She tickled and teased as I laughed and begged, sometimes giggling to herself in amusement at my predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoowahaha!\u201d I pulled up and twisted away from her as much as I could, but my restraints prevented me from making much progress. I briefly managed to turn my backside to her, which prompted a sharp slap on my left butt cheek. \u201cOw!\u201d I shrieked as I reflexively returned to my position flat on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow stop that!\u201d She said sternly. \u201cYou will lie here take your consequences like a good boy. If these restraints aren\u2019t enough to keep you still then I\u2019ll have to climb onto this bed and pin you down myself. Don\u2019t make me warn you again.\u201d The thought of this gorgeous woman sitting on top of me and tickling me made my already hard penis throb with desire, but I dared not disobey her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, let\u2019s continue.\u201d She set about on my hips, wiggling her fingers along the sides and digging into my pelvic area. She was dangerously close to my cock now, and I both worried and excited about what she might do next. Her hands slowly made their way lower and lower until she was delving and probing into the creases between my thighs and my groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEehehe-ahaha!\u201d I cried and convulsed, much to her delight. Her nails spidered along  my inner thighs reducing me to a giggling mess. Finally after a moment she let up and gave me a much needed break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re about halfway done,\u201d she said matter-of-factly as she paused the timer, \u201cwhich means we still have six and a half more minutes of tickling left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly halfway?\u201d I thought to myself. \u201cHow on Earth am I going to survive this?\u201d I laid there sweating and breathing heavily knowing that my reprieve wouldn\u2019t last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how should we proceed from here?\u201d she asked, though I suspected it was a rhetorical question. She eyed my helpless body with an evil smirk, holding her gaze on my twitching member. \u201cShall we head for the \u2018main event\u2019 or somewhere else...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Even such a slight touch made me shiver with pleasure and ache for release. By this point I was extra sensitive everywhere and I didn\u2019t know how much more I could take. \u201cI know you\u2019re dying for relief, and since it is only your first lesson I suppose I should be nice and give you what you\u2019re longing for.\u201d She placed her right hand in a soft grip around my penis and slowly begin to slide up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh-\u201d I gasped. I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. My satisfaction was short lived however as Miss Heart soon released her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut not so fast\u201d she said with an evil smirk. \u201cRemember, this is a tickling session and I intend to give you what I came here for.\u201d With that she resumed the timer and dug into my pubic area. She began tickling me ferociously around the base of my penis with what seemed to be a new resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhahahaaa!\u201d I shouted. \u201cNohooo!\u201d She scribbled across my scrotum and wiggled her fingers down to my taint, leaving no spot unexplored. I didn\u2019t even know my balls could be this ticklish! I reflexively tried to squeeze my legs together but the restraints stopped me from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhehehee!\u201d I squealed. \u201cPlehease! Noho! N-not there!\u201d She spidered her nails up and down my shaft. I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. It felt so good and yet so unbearable at the same time. This torture when on for several more minutes, and I was sure I was going to explode. By now I dripping with precum and throbbing with arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you we were going to give him some attention,\u201d she teased. \u201cLook how happy he is!\u201d Then she grabbed my cock with her left hand and lowered the palm of her right hand onto the freshly lubricated head of my penis. She rubbed and stroked in a circular motion, speeding up and slowing down in response to my uncontrollable reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPle-plehehease!\u201d I begged. \u201cPlease let me cum! I cahahan\u2019t t-take it anymore. I knew I wouldn\u2019t last much longer, but Miss Heart was obviously enjoying my torment so much that I didn\u2019t know if she would finish me off or leave me unsatisfied.

With her right hand she softly fondled my balls, occasionally giving me a little tickle on the sides with her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u201d I moaned. Every stroke was heavenly. Her touch sent shivers throughout my whole body as I writhed with pleasure. As she continued to pump with her left hand, she brought her right thumb to the head of my cock. Ever so lightly she began flicking the base of the head. I had already been so turned on by the tickling that I knew I wouldn\u2019t last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh\u201d I sighed. She continued to milk faster and faster with her left hand and moved her right hand to my chest. She slowly and softly caressed me, running her fingers over my nipples and whispering to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on\u201d she said quietly, over and over. Her strokes increased. Her gaze was fixed on my throbbing member. She knew I was aching to come. She steadily sped up until eventually she was pumping my shaft furiously, running her other hand down to my abdomen and tickling my stomach lightly. I couldn\u2019t hold on any longer and it sent me over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Oh!\u201d I wailed. \u201cAhhh!\u201d I erupted with orgasmic pleasure, shooting all over my stomach and chest and covering her hands with my seed. The electric sensation pulsed throughout my body, leaving me weak with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go\u201d she smiled. She grabbed a tissue and wiped her hands while I lay on bed sweating and catching my breath. I looked at her with contentment and she looked back with temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it looks like we\u2019ve still got a minute or two left on the timer\u201d Miss Heart observed. \u201cYou know what that means?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u201d I squeaked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes\u201d she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the tickling began again. She ran her scribbling fingers all over my body, jumping from my armpits to my stomach to my ribs to my sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ahahahaha! Noowahahaha!\u201d I cried. I was extra sensitive since I had just cum, and the tickling felt ten times more intense than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed my thighs and spidered her nails up my chest. As I twisted and turned in my restraints she kneaded across my back. Everywhere was ticklish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha! No! Wahaha!\u201d I howled. \u201cI can\u2019t-I can\u2019t tahahake it! Plehease!\u201d My protests only encouraged her. She delighted in my post-orgasm torture. She dug into my armpits and poked in between each of my ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlehehease!\u201d I implored. \u201cNo-no more.\u201d She skittered around my abdomen a little while longer until finally the timer went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, times up\u201d she lamented, giving my still-sensitive cock another playful wiggle. As I caught my breath she stood up and undid the ties that had bound me. I was a sweaty mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lay there in my bed, finally free from my restraints yet unable to move. I could still feel waves rushing over me. My skin was still tingling. Even the slight breeze tickled my naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done today\u201d she stated as she suddenly resumed her professionalism. \u201cYour first lesson was quite successful. I\u2019m going to collect my things, and then the rest of the day is yours. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow at the same time. I\u2019ll let myself out.\u201d She put her books away and slipped her heels back on as I was still catching my breath. As she walked towards the door she turned back to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you\u201d she said. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s lesson is much more difficult, so you had better be prepared.\u201d She gave me one last wink and smile, and then she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was relieved, but at the same time I was sad to see her go.

I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve never had a student perform this poorly.\u201d She took off her glasses and set them on the nightstand next to my bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d I confessed, \u201cI guess I\u2019m just really nervous.\u201d It was true. First of all, I already was red with embarrassment due to being completely naked and tied to my bed in front of this beautiful stranger. Second, I knew this beautiful stranger would soon be tickling me senseless, which was both a torture and a turn-on for me. I just couldn\u2019t concentrate or pay attention to the lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell test taking can be very stressful\u201d she explained, \u201cand you need to be able to think under pressure. That\u2019s part of what makes my tutoring method so successful. If students can handle me, they can handle an exam.\u201d She undid her bun and let her long red hair flow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I think I was just distracted\u201d I excused I really was a good student most of the time. I just wasn\u2019t prepared for this. \u201cBesides, I didn\u2019t do that badly, did I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou answered a total of 25 questions wrong and had 6 interruptions after I repeatedly warned you\u201d she scorned. \u201cThat\u2019s what troubles me the most. I\u2019m afraid this adds up to a full hour and 20 minutes of tickling.\u201d She adjusted her watch and set up a timer. \u201cAnd this sort of deplorable behavior warrants an extreme form of correction that goes beyond mere tickling.\u201d Beyond tickling? What did she mean by that? While I considered my situation, Miss Heart stood up and looked me over with contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems I have my work cut out for me\u201d she said with pity. \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready for this.\u201d I began futilely pulling at my restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me retake the tests,\u201d I bargained. \u201cI\u2019ll do better this time; honest.\u201d I admit I was aroused at the thought of being tickled by this gorgeous woman, but an an hour and 20 minutes? I wasn\u2019t kidding about being deathly ticklish and I don\u2019t think I could handle that! She shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I\u2019m nothing if not fair, \u201cshe lectured, \u201cand it wouldn\u2019t be right to allow you any retakes. If I don\u2019t follow through with my corrective treatment, then I\u2019m robbing you of my teaching skills. Besides, I told you the rules before we started. We had an agreement, young man.\u201d I didn\u2019t exactly remember agreeing to this, but I thought better than to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that there was no talking her out of it, I resigned to my fate. I relaxed my body and readied myself for the consequences, but I wasn\u2019t prepared at all for what she did next. Without saying a word, Miss Heart began unbuttoning her blouse, revealing a black lace bra that struggled to contain her breasts. I stared at her in disbelief as she set finished removing it and set it neatly on my desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-what are you doing?\u201d I inquired with bewilderment. She began lowering her skirt to the floor, displaying matching black panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said before,\u201d she told me matter-of-factly, \u201cyour performance necessitates an extreme form of correction. It\u2019s an advanced learning technique and I think you\u2019re the perfect candidate for it.\u201d I was beside myself. What could she possibly have meant by that? I contemplated her intentions while she slid her stockings down her long shapely legs and flicked them off of her perfect dainty feet. I was blushing even more now, and my growing erection couldn\u2019t have gone unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be embarrassed,\u201d Miss Heart assured me as my arousal became uncomfortably obvious. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural, and I expect us to have quite an intimate relationship by the time this lesson is over.\u201d I could feel my heart rate increasing. Just how intimate did she mean? I was aching to find out as she continued undressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy standard tickling treatment is quite well researched and proven effective,\u201d she declared, \u201cbut this new method is a bit experimental.\u201d With that she unhooked her bra and exposed her spectacular bare breasts to my widening eyes. Her perfect pink nipples hardened as they met the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill,\u201d she continued, \u201cI believe a student in your circumstances will benefit greatly from it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she removed her panties, leaving behind the last bit of clothing from her stunning nude form. The morning light from my window danced gracefully on her immaculate bare pussy. I shifted in my bed with excitement, unable to move but still trying to fully take in the wondrous sight in front of me. As she turned around to place her the rest of her clothes on my desk, I got a breathtaking view of her plump round ass. It was sizable but also firm and tight; clearly this woman took excellent care of her body. She looked positively edible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached my bed with her hands on her hips and examined my helpless restrained body. I could sense a certain hunger in her eyes, and I didn\u2019t know whether to be fearful or thankful for my predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Heart then sat down on my bed near my waist and gave me what seemed to be a kind and merciful smile, though I suspected she would be anything but lenient on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet us begin\u201d she said calmly. \u201cThe first hour will be standard tickling, followed by 20 minutes of a much more extreme form of punishment. I gulped apprehensively and closed my eyes with nervous anticipation as she...</span></div></div>",

Plehehease!\u201d Every squeeze sent an overwhelming electric impulse surging throughout my body. She ran down my arms from my elbows to my ribs, pausing to jab into my pits and make me squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStahahahap!\u201d I begged. \u201cI cahahahan\u2019t take it!\u201d My pleas were ignored though, and the attack only increased in ferocity. She poked and prodded without remorse, clearly delighted by my anguish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, you are a ticklish one indeed\u201d she teased. \u201cI can see that this is going to be a very productive week.\u201d I instinctively pulled at my restraints, desperate for my arms to come down and cover my defenseless body. Of course I found no relief, and the thought that I had no means of protecting myself only made it tickle even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Heart finally gave my underarms a rest for a second only to immediately assault my ribs and chest with a renewed determination to torture me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahanowahaha!\u201d I cried. \u201cPlehease stahap!\u201d She grinned deviously and pressed in between each rib, dragging her fingers from the sides to the center of my chest and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she brought her wiggling fingers down to my abdomen and scribbled them mercilessly across my belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeeyahaha!\u201d I shrieked as she pinched my sides and spidered her nails around my stomach. Occasionally she would twist a knuckle into my bellybutton and laugh as I was reduced to s giggling mess. Despite her professional demeanor, she obviously enjoyed tormenting me. This was as much a pleasure for her as it a nightmare for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, in the midst of my agony, I couldn\u2019t help but be extremely turned on by the whole procedure. The physiological mixture of my helpless submission combined with the overwhelming physical sensation was almost too much to bare. My penis was now hard as a rock, and I\u2019m sure she knew she was driving me crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis torture went on for a half hour before the timer gave a short beep. Miss Heart paused her watch and gave me a much needed break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPa-please.\u201d I entreated, trying to catch my breath. \u201cI-I can\u2019t-I can\u2019t take anymore. Please. N-no more.\u201d Miss Heart looked at me with a slight frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we\u2019re only just getting started. What kind of instructor would I be if I denied my students a proper education?\u201d she posited. \u201cIt would be downright cruel.\u201d The irony of this statement was not lost on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still have 30 more minutes of routine tickling before we move on to the advanced corrective action,\u201d she reminded me, \u201cand I intend to spare you no consequences whatsoever.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miss Heart got up and walked to the end of the bed. I had almost forgotten that she was naked since I had been so overcome with unbearable ticklishness during her vicious assault. I took this brief opportunity to admire her figure once again. Her breasts were large but exquisitely perky, hardly moving at all when she stood up. Her smooth curvy ass bounced back and forth as she stepped about the room gracefully. My admiration of her was short lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we give these feet some attention?\u201d she asked, as if anything I said would change her mind. \u201cI bet they\u2019re super ticklish.\u201d She was right. My feet were extra sensitive. I couldn\u2019t even get foot massages because it tickled so much. I curled my toes with fear as she kneeled down and lowered her teasing fingers onto my soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeeyohohonohoho!\u201d I squealed. \u201cAhahaha!\u201d She skittered up and down the bottoms of my feet, wiggling in between my toes and kneading into my arches. I pulled and kicked as much as I could, but my efforts proved useless, much to her delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, does somebody have ticklish little toes?\u201d she teased me. \u201cWhen your mother and I were discussing the terms of your tutoring experience, she mentioned how much she used to tickle you when you were a child.\u201d Miss Heart was right. My mother would tickle my sister and I all the time. Even now that I was older we would still sometimes get into tickle fights. I\u2019m not entirely sure, but it may be the reason that I developed such a strong fetish for ticking in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe told me how she used to nibble on your tiny feet and drive you wild.\u201d With that statement Miss Heart gently bit down on the side of my left foot and munched like it was corn on the cob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoo! Wahahaha!\u201d I bucked. \u201cEehehehehah!\u201d I could feel her tongue sliding across my sole making me laugh and cry at the same time. This was as humiliating as it was erotic. I felt like a helpless little kid again, reduced to a fit of giggles. She held the foot with both hands, preventing any sort of resistance from the torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlehehease nahot that!\u201d I beseeched her. She was ravenous and unrelenting. Finally she let go, and I foolishly thought for a moment that she was taking pity on me. Instead she simply switched to my right foot and began feasting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMihihihiss Hahaheart! Plehease! Noho more!\u201d I implored, but she was having too much fun. She took my toes into her mouth and circled each of them with her tongue. I screamed and pleaded as she left no spot unexplored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished, my feet were slippery with saliva. She used this condition as an opportunity to attack my soles again with her fingers, wiggling and scribbling up and down. I laughed and convulsed in my bed hopelessly, knowing my cries only made her more enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for the remainder of the 30 minutes, until eventually her watch beeped for a second time, signaling the end of this part of the session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFa-finally\u201d I said breathlessly. Miss Heart stood up again and you took a deep breath as if she was the one who was exhausted. I lay in my bed a sweaty mess, red all over with dried tears on my cheeks from laughing so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must say,\u201d she began as she paused the timer, \u201cyou handled the last hour quite well. Perhaps I went a bit too easy on you.\u201d I don\u2019t know if she was joking with me or teasing me, but I was too worn out to respond. I couldn\u2019t believe I was still alive after being tickled for an hour. \u201cNow then, I suspect that this treatment has given you plenty of time to consider the merits of proper studying. However, we\u2019re not finished just yet.\u201d She stepped over to the side of my bed once again. \u201cThe penalty for your interruptions will be much more severe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I nervously eyed her glamorous nude body, she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To my surprise, Miss Heart climbed onto my bed and stood over me with her feet at sides. I stared up at her naked form, her enchanting figure towering over me. She gazed into my eyes for a moment, then without speaking stepped forward and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now standing near my head facing away from me. He legs were spread apart slightly with her feet on either side of my ears. It would\u2019ve been a wonderful sight if I wasn\u2019t so terrified of what new torment she had in mind for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever pleasured a woman, young man?\u201d she asked without facing me. I didn\u2019t quite know how to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2014uh, well, I mean\u2014\u201c I stuttered. What on earth was she planning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo matter\u201d she cut in. \u201cYou\u2019ll learn today or you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d With that perplexing warning she kneeled down on the bed with her knees resting at my sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly lowered her perfect bare ass onto my face. Her strong but soft cheeks met with mine as she engulfed me and pressed her tight pristine asshole onto the tip of my nose. She shifted back and forth slightly as if to make herself comfortable and settle in for a long stay. My mouth met with her warm juicy pussy and it seemed to lock firmly into place. Most of her weight was on me, but strangely it didn\u2019t feel heavy. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere now,\u201d she stated nonchalantly. \u201cOur advanced corrective treatment can begin.\u201d I was already in heaven, but still I was both anxious and eager awaiting what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe that studying and test taking require a combination of many different skills and abilities to handle stress and distraction\u201d she lectured. \u201cFor the next 20 minutes, you will use your mouth and your tongue and attempt to bring me to orgasm. During this time I will continue to tickle you, certainly giving you as much of a distraction from your task as possible. If you are able to remain focused and give me an orgasm in the next 20 minutes, your experimental treatment will be considered a success and you will be suitably rewarded. However, if your efforts fail and the tickling proves to be too much of a disturbance, then you will be appropriately punished instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was overwhelmed. On one hand, this was a dream come true. This beautiful graceful creature had her voluptuous naked body sitting right on top of my face, her succulent bare pussy awaiting my pleasure. On the other hand, I hardly survived the last hour. I didn\u2019t know how much more tickling I could take, let alone with an assignment to accomplish before my time ran out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this may seem like an impossible task,\u201d she said compassionately \u201cbut I assure you that I am quite receptive to these kinds of sensations. After all, I myself am exceedingly ticklish, including in areas that you may not expect.\u201d I wondered where exactly she could mean and in what way I would have access to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFurthermore,\u201d she continued with an air of professionalism despite the subject matter, \u201cI will admit that I am already aroused as it is, so 20 minutes should be more than ample time to complete this requirement.\u201d She wasn\u2019t kidding. I could tell her pussy was already moist with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour time begins now\u201d she said as she set her watch. \u201cYou best get to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still shocked by this whole development, but I knew better than to waste time with her. I closed my eyes and set to work eating her out, licking slowly at first to build up her arousal even further. Truth be told I didn\u2019t really have much experience in this area, but the process came to me almost instinctively. I just did what felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u201d she cooed. \u201cMmm.\u201d I must have been doing something right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slid my tongue up and down her vulva, lapping on her clit like ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u201d she gasped as I pressed my tongue into her delicious pussy. \u201cCareful, young man. Don\u2019t get too comfortable. Remember this is a penalty, not a reward.\u201d No sooner did she say this than attack my exposed belly, tickling savagely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmph! Mm! Ma-ahahahaha!\u201d I howled, my laughter muffled by her flesh. She tickled me even more fervently than before, rendering me completely unable to continue my task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo-mm-hmm-hmph!\u201d I cried as she pressed down and stifled me. Her skittering fingers danced all around my upper body. She lightly pinched my nipples and kneaded across my ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime is wasting,\u201d she warned. \u201cYou had better get back to work.\u201d How could I possibly pleasure her while she was torturing me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-mmm-I haha\u2014I can\u2019t\u201d I said truthfully. The whole scenario was far too much for me to manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is not the correct attitude to have,\u201d she rebuked me. \u201cRemember this is for the sake of education. Exam questions often require handling multiple problems at the same time, often while under pressure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but I\u2014mmph, I cahahan\u2019t breathe!\u201d I exclaimed. Her smooth sleek ass cheeks covered my face, and although I loved her idea of her body being this closely aquatinted with me, I needed to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well then\u201d she sighed. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll have to give you some air.\u201d She leaned forward, allowing me to breathe through my nose, but her wet pussy now pushed further onto my mouth. I took in a couple of life-saving breaths and resumed licking. Her mercy came at cost however. The tickling continued, only now she assaulted my groin and inner thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhahaha!\u201d I wailed in between licks. She wiggled and squiggled her fingers around my scrotum and penis. By now my throbbing cock was aching for release, but she ignored it completely and teased elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery so often, if I managed to licked her in just the right spot, she would give into the feeling and temporarily pause her tickling. Eventually she sat back up and began swinging her hips forwards and backwards, riding all over my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI carried on lapping at her pussy when it came by, but as I watched her ass shift forward, I felt a temptation. When it came swaying back I reached my head forward and gave her spotless asshole a lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOohoohoo\u201d she giggled. \u201cI see you\u2019ve found one of my more ticklish spots.\u201d I never imagined that her sweet little she would be so ticklish here, but now that I had uncovered this secret I used it to my advantage. Strange as it was, she clearly enjoyed it, and it temporarily made her lose focus, though not for long. She dug into my armpits as I buried my face in her, trying as much to stop the tickling as I was trying to pleasure her. She leaned forward once again and assaulted my stomach, this time pushing her delicious meaty butt further onto me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer warm and flawless ass jiggled around me as I tickled her tight immaculate asshole with my tongue. All the while she persisted in assailing my helpless tummy, occasionally clawing into my sides whenever the sensation became a little too much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Heart fluctuated between giggling with laughter and moaning with pleasure, as did I. I was so turned on by everything that was happening that I was nearly ready to erupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis exchange went on for some time, both of us becoming more aroused by the second. Suddenly...</span></div></div>",

It's a good thing my intense love of tickling - both receiving and dishing it out - is no secret. Can't wait to see what I get into! This sleepy suburban town also has an extensive and strange history filled with all kinds of weird happenings, so I bet something wacky's bound to happen sooner or later.

Any number of things may have happened. Did he get pranked by a bunch of classmates? Made a guinea pig by some evil corporation? Stumble across some crazy cult? Abducted by aliens? Tortured by a witch? Captured by an evil ring of traffickers?
