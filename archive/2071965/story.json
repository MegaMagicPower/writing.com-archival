She had to hold it shut with a safety pin most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria unbuttoned her blazer and draped it over the table before unbuttoning the bottom half of the buttons on her shirt underneath and holding it open so that people could see her now clearly there bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria is twelve weeks pregnant now everyone. That means that the baby inside her is about the size of a lime right now.\" Mrs. Smith said happily as she had Maria step up on a small platform and turn sideways. \"And because of that her womb is starting to push her belly out because there's only so much space on the inside. Maria's belly is started to push out now at about the right point for three months into a pregnancy with just one like we gave her. But from now on it's going to grow faster than it was before so keep an eye on things.\" She said cheerily before looking to Maria. \"Tell us a little bit about how your breasts are doing.\" The teacher said nodding to where the development of breasts were becoming obvious on Maria's chest. The girl blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I have to wear bras now and they're a bit sore. My nipples got darker too.\" She mumbled making the teacher nod and look to the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria is developing right on time. Everyone write down your observations in your notebooks.\" Maria fidgeted a little and looked down to her rounding belly. It was a bit bigger on her due to not being the size of an adult but she had to admit she was kind of liking the feeling of having a baby grow inside her belly.</span></div></div>",

Sure it was a little heartwarming from getting so much attention, but she was in a position where she just wanted to eat in peace...which seemed less and less likely by the second. \"Ok, back it up, girls!\" a male teacher said, breaking the ever increasing group up to give the pregnant girl some space. \"Are you ok?\" he asked, crouching down to her level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...just...y'know...\" she meekly replied, shrugging.

Even now, her white shirt was hanging on by the thread of her buttons, the pin not doing much to hold it in any more. \"O-Ok!\" the student stammered.

It's so I can get to your body better for measuring.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out a white tape measure, the tailor measured Maria's gut and waist first, then her arms, thighs, and finishing with her feet, noting the dimensions on a scrap of lined paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, there we go!\" the older woman smiled, packing away her tape and notes. \"We'll be in touch.\" she added to the principal, shaking his hand upon leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get yourself decent and head on home, Maria.

I would have to say that there's at least seven. Possibly eight.\" He sighed, eyes still fixed on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose felt her cheeks heat up at the thought that that many puppies were inside her belly. The doctor licked his lips and pushed his free hand through his hair. \"Listen, I don't know what's going on here but it's pretty evident that your daughter is pregnant with a litter of puppies. I've got a cousin who's a vet. Let me give her a call and have her come down to take a look at the situation. I can tell she's pregnant but not how long or how long it will be like this...\" He said carefully as he shut off the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't tell me more?\" Rose's mom asked worriedly, stroking her young daughter's hair as she sat on a chair beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid not. This is obviously a unique situation, after all.\" He said slowly. All eyes in the room went to Rose's stomach. Now that the truth was revealed to them, it was quite clear that it wasn't swelling or gained weight, but instead  closer to an eighteen week pregnancy bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow...\" The vet breathed as about a half hour later, the eleven year old was having her second sonogram. She leaned over to look at the screen, eyes wide. \"That's really a litter of puppies. How many did you count?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven or eight. It's hard to tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big litter then. Most get six max.\" The vet mused. \"I can't tell the breed and we likely won't be able to until they come, but this looks like they're about four weeks in development. Did you have any encounter with a dog about a month ago sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Rose said softly. She hadn't brought up her wish on the star, thinking the adults around her wouldn't accept it as the cause of her puppies. She had thought it was a little silly herself when she had done it, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" The vet frowned and looked back to the screen a moment. \"Jaime, would you mind if I took on her as my patient? I get the feeling this is going to go more like a dog's pregnancy anyway. It would be better if we handled this at my office.\" The doctor nodded as he shut off the sonogram and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I'll leave you to it, then.\" He gave them all a nod and stepped out of the exam room. The vet smiled kindly and helped Rose clean off her belly and sit up. Rose pulled her shirt down, but it didn't fully cover her stomach, leaving some skin visible above where her pants were held shut with a safety pin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we've really be properly introduced, my cousin wanted to get my input so bad. I'm Dr. Juniper.\" She chirped happily, shaking Rose's mother's hand before sitting down opposite her. \"Now, I know this is scary, but it's something we can deal with. Since a puppy is smaller than a newborn, I don't think it would be a danger for Rose to deliver them like a human child would. Assuming you're not going to have this terminated, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would rather not have to explain this to someone else. It's embarrassing enough already.\" Rose's mother said bluntly as Rose rested a hand on her stomach. \"I'll have to find some excuse to pull her from school until this is... over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. We'll keep it as quiet as possible. I own my own vet clinic so you can bring Rose in to see me after hours so nobody else has to know.\" Dr. Juniper assured. \"Assuming this keeps on track with a dog's pregnancy, she'll be due in eight more weeks. I'd like to see Rose weekly to make sure she's well and still on track. This is a big litter so we do have to be a little careful.\" Rose's mother nodded stiffly. \"Good. Now, there is one thing to talk about before you bring Rose around for her first checkup with me. I'd like to document this case. It's so bizarre that I do want to study what's happening. Nothing invasive, but I'd like your permission to take photos, measurements, and do other small tests. I'll keep your privacy by referring to Rose as Subject R and keeping her face out of the photos. In return, I won't charge you a penny for my services.\" Rose looked at the vet in surprise, holding her belly with both hands. Her? A research subject?</span></div></div>",

Dr. Juniper took pictures of Rose from multiple angles, focusing on her belly and breasts. These, along with Rose's height, weight, and other measurements, went into a file marked SUBJECT R.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Rose,\" Dr. Juniper said, \"my cousin tells me that you're perfectly healthy, with the possible exception of your delicate condition. He also says that you're bright for your age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose smiled at the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to return to the topic that has brought us together,\" the vet said. \"Such a bright girl surely knows that human babies don't just appear in their mother's womb, and that puppies in a human womb is a completely unprecedented occurrence. So, Rose, I want you to think back to last month. I want you to tell me about anything out of the ordinary you did a month ago, no matter how insignificant it may seem to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose knew that this was it. She had kept her wish a secret, but, given what was happening, she couldn't keep it secret any longer. \"I made a wish on a falling star.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Juniper blinked. \"That's it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose nodded. \"I wished I could have a puppy.\" She put her hands on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's the only thing you did, that you don't normally do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor,\" Mom said, \"do you really believe that my daughter is pregnant with puppies because... because of a <i>wish?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Newsome,\" the vet said, \"if you had told me before yesterday that I would be examining an 11-year-old girl who was pregnant with a litter of puppies, I would never have believed you. But that is the case, nevertheless. With this wish being the only explanation currently available, I have to accept that it... it's no stranger than the current situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Juniper left the room, then came back with some pill bottles. \"These are prenatal vitamins that we normally give to dogs. Give her these according to the directions on the bottles.\" She turned to Rose. \"If I tell you to take them, your mother won't have to hide them in a slice of cheese, will she?\" she asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll expect you in a week. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call.\"</span></div></div>",

She doesn't want anyone seeing her car here or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really cares about appearances, huh?\" Juniper muttered under her breath with a shake of her head before helping Rose up onto an exam table. \"You're getting pretty big.\" She chuckled as she looked over the young girl. In just the seven days since she had last seen Rose, the girl's belly had swelled forth a few more inches, leaving her looking 25 weeks pregnant, despite only being 5 weeks along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. I felt the puppies move too.\" She said with wide eyes as she touched her round belly. There clearly hadn't been an opportunity to find maternity clothes for Rose yet as her stomach was bulging from under her t-shirt, the top only covering a third of her baby bump. The stretchy waistband of the sweatpants the girl wore were also stretched to their limit underneath the bump. Juniper gave a hum and laid one hand on each side of the bump as she examined it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. You're gonna feel that a lot more coming up. You've got a whole lot of babies in this belly of yours.\" She said with a wide smile. \"Bet this isn't what you were looking for when you wished for a puppy, huh?\" Rose shook her head as she looked down at herself, feeling the light flutters of the puppies in her womb. \"Well, hopefully your mom let's you keep one of them after you went through all this.\" Dr. Juniper said cheerily before stepping away to grab her camera and other supplies so they could take the information needed for the Subject R file.</span></div></div>",

Looking in the mirror, she saw that it clung to her belly and breasts, showing how her body was getting ready for bringing these puppies into the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were other clothing options as well: T-shirts and jeans, bib overalls, even sleepwear. <i>I'll have to get mighty big to outgrow all of these,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, with as many puppies as she was having, and considering how big she'd already grown, that seemed pretty likely.</span></div></div>",

If Juniper didn't know any better, she would think the young girl was about to pop at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi doctor!\" Rose puffed as she pushed herself to sit up a little more.

Juniper smiled and moved to help get the girl on her feet as she started examining her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look ready to burst.\" She chuckled, though her amusment faded slightly at the panicked look on Rose's face. \"Don't worry. It's just an expression. You're not going to pop. I just mean that you're getting really big.

It was no wonder she didn't have much bladder capacity anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They move around a lot now...\" Rose murmured and Juniper laid a hand over the stretch marks on the side of the girl's belly, feeling the shifting movements of a litter of puppies under her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sure are.

She groaned lowly as she hefted herself off the couch, only to hold her belly as she sucked in a sharp breath. Juniper rubbed the small of her patient's back. \"My belly hurts sometimes...\" She complained with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... When a baby is born, the momma's belly squeezes tight to help it get out. It's called a contraction. You're pregnant enough that your body is starting to practice it's contractions just a little bit. The real ones will feel different but, it's like your belly is working out to get ready for when the puppies come.\" She explained, patting the girl's overdue belly like she was a prize heifer. She nearly was, really, for all the benefits that would come with this research project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Rose hummed before waddling a few steps away from the couch, each step slow and heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. It's getting really hard for you to move around now, huh?\" It was only to be expected from the girl's shape and weight ballooning so quickly, really. Rose nodded, hands propped in the small of her back as she turned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel really full and they're so heavy.\" She groaned, cheeks lightly flushed. She didn't want to say it out loud, but she really liked feeling her belly full of squirming puppies weighing her down. Whenever she laid down, she could feel them shift inside her and she loved waking up to them wiggling and kicking energetically. Juniper smiled a little and knelt down in front of the heavily pregnant girl, pushing her shirt up over her belly to where her milky breasts were perched above it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, only three more weeks until you have them, momma. Then you've got to wait until you have a real baby to get this big and heavy again.\" She hummed as Rose licked her lips and looked down at the roundness that jutted out from her.</span></div></div>",

Under the covers, her hands stroked her overdue pregnant bump, feeling her litter of pups kick at her hands. She giggled, unable to be mad at them even if she knew that they would still be squirming around when she wanted to go to bed later in the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three more weeks...\" She sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose didn't know how much bigger she was going to be by the time she had her litter. Dr.Juniper didn't know and neither did her mother. Everyone who knew about her puppy pregnancy was left in the dark just like she was when it came to what would happen next. With a yawn, Rose decided not to think too much on the subject. The girl gave her tummy a pat and turned over on her side to look out of her bedroom window. As she turned over, she could feel the pups inside of her kicking out in protest and she put her hand back on her belly to calm them down once she was safely on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, out of the corner of Rose's eye, she saw something glittering. She gasped and her unborn occupants fell still. There was another star shooting across the sky! She knew that the last one she had seen nine weeks ago had given her the puppy she always wanted (and some others) which told the eleven year old that her wish would certainly come true if she made another one. The next question that came to her mind was if she would actually make another wish.</span></div></div>",

She was certain it had worked and as long as she believed, it would be alright.

Her mind immediately went to her puppies and she asked if they were alright. The wand was put to her belly and Dr.Juniper assured her that they were but, Rose knew something wasn't right. She asked to hear the heartbeats and the vet pursed her lips, turning up the noise on the ultrasound so everyone could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rose's mother shook her head and started pacing but Rose's eyes went wide. \"I-It worked...

She began to explain that because of Rose's wish, the puppies inside of her not only multiplied, but they had also become smaller. Now all of Rose's puppies were only at most a week and a half to two weeks along. That meant that Rose was going to be pregnant for ten more weeks now <i>if</i> she gave birth on time. The veterinarian explained that because this was uncharted territory yet again, she would prefer to visit every other day now as Rose would be growing at an extremely fast rate and she was worried for the eleven year old's safety.

The puppies were active, and her belly visibly squirmed with their movements within her. <i>Just a few more weeks... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began heading toward the stairs, but she stopped when she reached the guest bedroom. Looking in, she saw an expanse of unfurnished floor space that appealed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the quilt, sheets, and pillows off the bed, she spread the quilt on the floor, then spread the sheets over the quilt. She didn't know <i>why</i> she did it this way, only that something within told her that it must be this way. Putting the pillows against the wall, she stepped back and looked at her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose turned slowly. \"Mom! I, uh, I didn't see you there!

In your case, your needs are simple: an out-of-the-way place to bring your puppies into the world.\" Mom wrapped her arm around Rose. \"How about I get your sheets and pillows, pick out some clothes, and you start sleeping here? You won't have to traipse all over the house for the next few weeks, and you'll be close to your nest, either to put on the finishing touches or to give birth when the time comes.

She had decided now that the young girl was ten weeks pregnant, it was high time that she give the girl a little birthing coaching. They had gone over a few potential positions she could give birth in, such as squatting or being on all fours, but right now Rose was reclined on a mountain of pillows piled up in the corner of the room, knees bent and legs wide apart. \"This is how most people have a human baby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the opportunity to feel the underside of Rose's puppy filled mound. Things were starting to prepare for their arrival. Rose hadn't dropped yet, but her womb was settling lower in her hips in preparation, and Rose's mother had told her the girl had started lactating just the day before. Juniper had readied herself to always be on call, just in case Rose's young body went into a premature labor and had already stashed her needed supplies in the nearby closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose, for her part, was really getting used to being so heavily pregnant. She felt absolutely massive and the puppies had had a bit of a growth spurt in the last week, so her belly loomed high over her body. She had officially outgrown a lot of her maternity wear this week and with so little left, they had decided to just make what they had work, so she rotated the few pairs of sweatpants that fit under her belly and let her belly hang out under her shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I think I'm ready for this. I'm ready to be a mommy.\" Rose realized in that moment, that last sentence felt really good to say.</span></div></div>",

On the first time,when she was sure that everyone was asleep Rose had some difficult searching for any potition to sleep, to the point that it take her a few hours to finally position herself, she sudden started curl herself on the floor mostly because of the feeling of the big weight of the little litters trying to get themselves some space on the little tummy of her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRose feel a warm coming from her belly that sometimes bugging her on the mornings, thankfully, in that cold night that warmth was making her falling asleep thanks to the relaxing temperature that her own body was making, unconsiously, reaching her upper body to her big belly trying to be the most closest to her own puppies.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe next morning after she woke up and picked up her things on the floor to put it on the bed. During the morning after she eated her breakfast and her mother left for work, not without remind her to not left the house for any reason, Rose decided to spent her time playing on the garden of her house, trying to imagine herself after all of this with her own puppy. During her small walk, she couldn't help but touch her belly barely cover for the blue dress she was using.<br>\r\n\"I wonder wich one of you, will be the one that my mommy will let me have.\" Rose started to say to her belly, even if she knew that her litters couldn't listen her.<br>\r\n \"I can't wait to meet you, all of you. I can't wait the day to...playing with you, carrying you around, feeding it with...my...milk\" Rose started to number the things that she was imagine to do with them, not realizing of what she just said thanks to the next thing.<br>\r\nDuring this minutes Rose started to feel the hot sun starting to affecting her more than usual, at first she didn't care believing it was for the summer than just her.<br>\r\nRose started to return to the house beleiving that the sudden heat will come out once she was on her comfy house...it didn't.<br>\r\nThe heat was worse, to the point Rose started to sweat up and run to the shower to wash herself to cool down. After grabbing a towel to cover her big belly and hair,Rose returned to her bed to find new clothes to put on, but like yesterday something happened, she stopped to search from the pile of clothes on her closet becuase another pleasent idea came to her, she didn't knew why but the moment she put the tower aside, the idea of being just naked like this when no one was around sounded good all of the sudden.<br>\r\n\"My mother just told to not be seeing by anyone but her friends, while Iwas expecting the puppies,...but she didn't say anything else, right?\" She said to herself trying to convice herself. \"What would be the problem if I do this on the house? Besides if I do this when I'm alone mommy won't worry about it, I don't want to be more worried that she already is.\" She said confident, not seeing anything bad or off about her way of think. In fact she believed that it was normal. <br>\r\nThe Dr. Juniper tried to explained to her that women suffers of behaviour changes, and starting to like things she didn't liked before thanks to the babies forming inside of them. But Rose didn't get it completely,beliving that applied by everything she did,from her point of view because she was getting puppies she believed it was normal for her to have that kind of urges.<br>\r\nThis misunderstanding lead to path ideas that affected her behaviour more and more.<br>\r\nDuring the currently week Rose started to develop in secret a conduct, that even the most refined person would describe as a dog behaviour.<br>\r\nFirst it was just being naked and sleeping on the comfy floor. For the third day she started to feel that her back has killing her and started to go on four, feeling that the sudden weight of puppies she was carrying and expanding day by day, was less painful than being on her two feet.<br>\r\nShe started to do almost every single thing on that position, sleeping,eating, moving around the house.<br>\r\nWhen May and Abby visit her she started to ask questions about it, the questions went from how it feel, to some changes that she was having. At some point Rose commented new likes and her sudden routine to her best friends, fortunately thet seemed to be ok, finding themselves fascinated with the pregnancy of her friend promising that they will kept this to themselves beleiving it was part of keeping this on secret like the mother of Rose wanted.<br>\r\nOn their spare time the girls started to rub her friend's belly, this happened because the constant grunts and complains of Rose about the sudden incomformity that sometimes she had with the big bump she was always carrying around and the obvious curiosity of the enormous belly with little litters that were residing inside of her.<br>\r\nEven if at first the three of them were shy about the idea, it didn't take too much for them to gain comfort and started to rub on every corner of her expanding skin that they could put their hand on.<br>\r\nRose on the other hand was discovering some pleasant feeling on being laying on her back while hands rubbed the big sack attached to her.<br>\r\nThe movement of the little ones was making insde of her was now easying more and more with each rub she was recieving in return. She actually...feel good.<br>\r\n\"*whimper**moan*\"<br>\r\nAbby and May suddenly stooped her \"rubbing show\" when she heard Rose make high noises and moving by reflex one of her legs. The suddenly stop of this make Rose recover her senses, seeing Abby and May looked at her clearly surprised.<br>\r\n\"What? Girls, why did you stop?\" Rose said clearly oblivious of her previous state.<br>\r\n\"Rose, you started to make cute noises\" Abby said to her friend while trying to not chuckled like May for the sudden action of her friend.<br>\r\nRose feeling a little embarrased tried to make an excuse of being just a behavious she gained with the pregnancy. Before she could even continue May interrupted her putting a pair of fingers on her overreacting friend.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, in fact we find it kind of cute, actually.\" May finalized making Rose a little more relieved.<br>\r\n\"You don't mind?\" Rose said a little surprised. \"No, you are our friend and we will always love you no matter what.\" Abby continued where May was.<br>\r\nAfter a small talk Rose's mom returned asking for the girls to leave for the day.<br>\r\nDuring the fifth day day, Rose experienced some weird sensitivity not only on her ears but also on her nose, hearing the sudden tap of her mother shoes echoing on the hall waking her up to eat, just in time to put everything on the place for the day, to the recognizable smell of pancakes that she was just sniffed from her room. <br>\r\nThe same went when she smell the pressence of Abby and May approaching them and then suddenly heard them arriving just at the corner of her house.<br>\r\nThe last straw that finished her complete behaviour was when she started to have to urge to go to the bathroom every single time after she finished to eat. <br>\r\nDuring the night thanks to having problems to sleep, so she decided to view some videos of how take care of the dogs, specifically the new born ones, apparently the newborn litters needed to be washed up, get some sleep, but also they need to be feed by the mother in order to gain nutrients, and need a place where they need to be trained on how they need to go to do their needs,in order to not getting the place...dirty.<br>\r\nAt some point Rose was ok with the idea until the video mentioned that it was recommended that the parents of the puppies could do it in order to give an example to the babies and make more easy to train them to do it.<br>\r\nRose was nervous about the fact but more about the sudden realization that she almost forget during her time in this whole thing. She was the mother of the puppies.<br>\r\nEvery single one of them are thecnically her babies, even though her Mother told her that they only to behave themselves right?<br>\r\nThe sudden thought of something happened to the little creatures gained over the doubt if there was something wrong with doing that.<br>\r\nSneaking up to the garden, naked without a shame on her face started to slowly to crawl to the tree that was on the center of the garden.<br>\r\n'This for the puppies right? At these hours no one will be looking nor are outside of the house, so I won't be seeing by anyone just like mommy wanted, so I'm not doing anything wrong right? Right?' she debated with herself trying to be the most careful that she can be.<br>\r\nWhen she was at the tree she taked a few deep breaths before starting to raise clumsily her leg, trying to remember the words that her mom said when she tried to go for the bathroom the first time<br>\r\n'Just breath,*inhale* *exhale* and then imagine a waterfall falling on a river making a sound like a...'<br>\r\n*drip drip*<br>\r\nAfter a few moments Rose finished up and started to get herself up not caring to sudden hurt of being on her two feet and finally run to her bedroom jumping to the bed and covering on the blankets.<br>\r\nRose's face reflected a complete shock after the sudden things she started to do recently.<br>\r\nAlmost like if her words and body were on different side she only could think was...<br>\r\n'What did-d I j-just do?' Rose said with a blush that cover in red her face.<br>\r\n\"I know that was something weird but the Dr. Juniper told me this was normal, so... Why do I feel so weird about it? Even though...it felt...so good.~*bark!**pant*\" Rose suddenly get complete silent when she just heard herself. She did just bark, like , like a...puppy. During the last hours Rose tried to force herself to sleep expecting that find the answer when she woke up in the morning.<br>\r\nMaybe all that she needed was a moment of peace to think clearly right? Right?</span></div></div>",

It had become a common feeling to her ever since her litter of puppies had started to move inside her pregnant belly. The wish she had made had to be one of the best things she had ever done. She knew magic had to be real and the changes taking place in her proved it. It had started with feeling sick a mere eight weeks ago, followed by her belly starting to grow. An ultrasound had revealed the litter of puppies nestled safe inside her womb and determined that her pregnancy would likely only last as long as that of a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best part had been that there were no questions. Everyone had just gone with things like it was perfectly normal for an 11 year old girl to turn up pregnant with puppies. Rose was grateful that her wish had done that for her, saving her so much trouble. She blew out a breath as she carefully pushed herself to sit up, one hand cradling her belly that had started to grow heavy as it grew and filled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith still four weeks to go until she birthed her litter, Rose looked as though she were 8 months pregnant with a single child. Her bump was free to the air as any pajamas that she owned would not cover the heavy pup filled mound. She perched on the edge of the bed, rubbing at the bare skin with a smile as she marveled at it. Her fingers poked at her popped out belly button for a moment before she hefted herself to her feet. She was lucky school had let out for summer in the second week of her pregnancy when she was just starting to grow. There was no way her uniform would fit her now and she was in no mood to attend classes while so heavily pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose waddled back and forth for a moment as she marveled at her pregnant body. As scary as it had been at first when she found out she would be mother to puppies, she was finding herself very much enjoying the feeling now. Perhaps the wishing star had granted her wish better than she initially thought. </span></div></div>",

She looked at herself in the mirror and rubbed her tummy, pleased with how big the suit made her look.

Her mother looked concerned upon noticing that Rose had chosen to wear a two-piece. \"Are you sure you want others to see your belly exposed?\" she asked with uncertainty. \"I'm sure, mom, hardly anyone gives me any trouble about it, so I figured, why not. Besides, I won't mind if anyone offers to rub my tummy.\" Her mother figured she had a point but was still a bit reluctant for her 11-year-old daughter to show off her swelling belly for all to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose put on regular clothes over her swimsuit, and they drove to the pool. When they arrived, Rose could see her friends Kary and Maxine swimming around. Quickly, she took off her regular clothes to reveal her in her two-piece and started walking towards them, both hands on her swollen midsection. \"Morning, girls,\" Rose called to them. Both of them waved back and started swimming towards her as she waited on the steps, knee-deep in water. \"Wow, Rose,\" exclaimed Maxine, \"you're getting big!\" Rose proudly patted and rubbed her tummy in response. </span></div></div>",

Before Rose could respond, her mother ran up to her. \"Sweetie, you forgot to put on sunblock.\" Rose apologized and got out of the water to have the lotion applied. She rubbed some sunblock on her arms and face, while her mom did her legs and back. Then her mother poured quite a bit of lotion on Rose's enormous belly. Rose then turned to her two friends as she stepped back down the steps. \"Care to do the honors?\" she asked, presenting her belly for rubbing. Kary and Maxine eagerly got up and started rubbing the sunscreen all over their friend's midsection. They loved every second of rubbing Rose's big belly, and they even felt the puppies kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose moaned in pleasure; she felt like she was in heaven. Until now, no one else, other than her mother, rubbed her belly, so it felt good knowing that her two best friends cared a lot about her new litter. \"Do you know what kind of puppies you're having?\" asked Maxine. \"The vet confirmed that I'm carrying a litter of Corgis,\" Rose responded. She looked down at her belly, which was shining brightly in the summer sun, thanks to all that lotion. \"Do you know what names you're gonna give them?\" Kary asked. \"Not yet, I don't know how many I've got in me or what their genders are.\" Rose patted her tummy in anticipation. \"You know, I can't wait to have my puppies born, but I'll miss this big belly. It just feels so good to be so round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends completely understood this; they would also miss Rose's belly. They wished they could rub it all the time, but that time would come to an end once Rose was due to give birth. \"So, what do you guys have planned for the summer?\" Rose asked, interrupting their thoughts. \"Well, we were thinking of maybe.\"</span></div></div>",

The overall wearing girl stood on her tippy-toes and stretched out her legs before sitting back down. She seemed relived to be back on the ground and with a few grunts, she now faced Rose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You look so cute with your little tummy.\" Kary said, reaching a hand out to give Rose's eight week pregnant belly a few pats before she rested a hand back on her own.

I still can't believe you're only two and a half weeks along Maxi. You look like you were ready to pop two months ago!\" Rose said with a hint of envy in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wait. How did Rose know how far along Maxine was? Remembering that the stars seemed to change reality made Rose's own memories change as well. She could remember the phone call when Maxi told her she was having puppies too and she remembered the photo she got of her friend's belly. She had looked seven months along with a normal baby then. As the dirty blonde haired girl laid on her back, Rose couldn't help but gasp at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maxine's white tank top had changed to be bigger just like Kary's overalls but, it seemed to Rose that it took into effect that Maxi would have loved to show off her massive tummy. It seemed to wiggle ever so slightly from all the puppies that had been stuffed inside of her. The tank top was caught on her friend's popped out belly button, the slightly pointed nub having a hard time keeping the shirt below it as Maxine lay there on the blanket. Rose couldn't help but oggle at Maxine as she groaned, pulling her shirt up to show her skin off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The doctor said that if I was having a normal baby, I would look like I had been pregnant for a whole year already.\" The poor girl said, slowly rubbing her massive puppy filled mound. \"That's twelve months. I'm just so huuuuge!\" She said with a heavy sigh. \"I wouldn't change it though. Would you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The girls said no, both blushing at the question. Kary then decided to crawl on her hands and knees over to Maxine and lay down too, unbuckling her overalls and putting her shirt up to her modest breasts to follow Maxi a bit, showing her big puppy pregnancy off to Rose. As she looked at her twin braided friend, she figured out that Kary looked like she was ten months pregnant! Rose couldn't deny the jealousy she was feeling as she looked on at her two friends and their huge pregnant stomachs. Her wish had made them both so much bigger than her and she only hoped she wasn't that much further along than Kary at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luckily, a memory flashed behind Rose's eyes and she 'remembered' that Kary was just about five weeks pregnant with her litter. The corgis in Rose pushed out at her hands and she relaxed, doing her best to calm them down. Her friends looked so peaceful laying there with their plump puppy filled bellies on full display as the moon shined down on them and she couldn't hold on to her jealousy any longer. The original mommy was amazed at what two wishes from shooting stars could do to not just her, but her friends too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the moon crept further into the sky, the sound of cars snapped the trio to attention. It might be their mothers coming to get them! Slowly helping one another to their feet, the young pregnant girls waited to see if it was their mothers, the sounds of a peaceful night resounding through the rest of the park behind them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was one of the more beneficial effects as it meant she could be a wet nurse to the tribe infants if their mothers needed it. Her skirt was low on her hips due to how loose it was but in the coming weeks it would fit better as her hips widened with the change of her fruit bearing so that she could carry them better.

She gave a slight wave to some of the men who were doing their usual fishing as this was the season that they returned to their part of the river. The village couldn't just eat only fruit all the time after all. She made her way over the fallen tree that was their bridge and ducked past a few plants to reach the small grotto that she liked to do her bathing in as the waters were always warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe undressed herself and stepped into the water, washing herself clean before simply settling in for a relaxing float. By the time that she had decided to finish and get out of the water she could already see that her body was changing. The biggest change was that when she put on her skirt, it fit her properly, meaning that her hips had widened out for her motherhood of the fruit. She ran her hand over her stomach, feeling the way that it had grown plump as the fruits and womb waters began to fill her. She could feel it within her, the weight beginning to settle into her pelvis along with the full feeling that the growth was giving her. She noticed that her small breasts were growing the slightest bit larger as well when she returned her top to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wandered back towards the village, fingers drumming lightly on the tightening skin of her stomach.</span></div></div>",

I know the fruit bearing can make you hunger quite a bit.\" She pat the spot next to her and gave her daughter a bowl filled with sweet fruits, much like she was growing within her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTess felt suddenly starved and scarfed all of the fruit down quickly.

The first time someone takes the pills it decides how many babies they have. One pill for one baby. Two for two babies. Then on and on.

You guys need to take three so your baby starts growing.\" She said, though neither of the other girls could see any change in her thanks to the looseness of her button up. Becky shrugged and simply popped three pills in her mouth all at once. She made a soft sound in the back of her throat and leaned back on the wall, something clearly happening though her nightdress hid the change as well. \"Your turn Ava!\" Emily said, pushing three pills into her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva swallowed and looked down at herself. With her shorts and form fitting tank top, nothing would be left to the imagination if her belly started to grow. But then again...Wasn't that the whole point of this? To finally see her belly with a baby inside? Ava blew out a breath and knocked back all three pills right away. She was startled by the way that a warmth pooled low inside her and just a moment later she could feel something inside her changing. She started feeling full, as though someone were pumping up a balloon inside her stomach. When she looked down at herself, she gasped. The feeling of growth faded as her belly stopped rounding out, leaving behind the gentle outward curve of twelve weeks of pregnancy.</span></div></div>",

I just want to keep growing this baby is all.\" Ava said with a little shrug before she popped the pill into her mouth. She made a pleased noise at the feeling of her body moving forward in the pregnancy, making her bump fill out to the 20th week. She looked well and truly pregnant now as her tank top continued to ride up on her body. Her fingers that were still playing with her belly button could tell how it had gotten more shallow with the growth. \"You should keep going. It feels amazing.\" She sighed as one of her fingers poked at her modest breasts that  had begun to plump up with her growth. Emily watched as she ate her own pill, crawling closer to Ava as her own body progressed. She reached out and gently squeezed Ava's breast with a little smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think someone's starting to get her milk.\" She giggled, earning her hands being swatted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself.\" Ava shot back when Emily settled back on her knees.

The little girl refused to even look at her friends, doing her best to ignore them now as she started to get lost in her own thoughts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ava was so surprised she tried to jerk upright, and tried to squeal in alarm, and accidentally swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! See, that wasn't so bad, was it?\" Emily asked, giggling and giving a victorious little bounce. She rolled off of Ava, and Becky did the same. Panicking slightly, Ava sat up and put both her hands down over her stomach. She expected to feel it swell up big and round as a beach ball all at once. Her heart raced as she waited for it. But long moments passed, and nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell. No, something did happen. She felt herself blush. And she had the strangest sensation of heat in her belly, really low down. It started small and then bloomed all through her, a good, <i>right </i> and significant feeling. Suddenly, she felt very comfortable and happy all over, in every bit of herself. Beside her, Becky took the bottle from Emily and swallowed just one pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Emily asked.

And a gooey, nice feeling all throughout the rest of her. If the pills had worked, there were two babies inside her already. She felt herself blush again. She couldn't deny that part of her was excited at the thought. For years, she had liked to pretend she was going to be a mommy. She would bundle up one of her baby dolls in a blanket, and put the blanket under her shirt, and make believe it was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it really was real. She settled back down nervously and looked at the two other girls. At least she wasn't alone, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was mean, you guys,\" she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily held out a hand with three pills in it.

It was already done, wasn't it? She sighed and swallowed one. Again, she got a feeling of warmth down low in her tummy. Frowning, she took another. The warmth increased. On the third, she became aware of a tightness inside her. A hard, heavy feeling of weight right between her hip bones. Her hands jerked down to her middle, and she felt her normally flat belly curve outward beneath her fingers.</span></div></div>",

Perched atop her bump was her now ample bosom, breasts heavy and full of milk in the end of her pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie looked much the same as she waddled over, hands propped in the small of her back. \"I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.\" She groaned before dropping into her own seat and rubbing the side of her heavy bump. \"I hope we're done making them soon.\" Molly let out a little laugh as she wandered over as well with the pill bottle in her hand, her body developing to match the others with her most recent pill as she had been a little behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I don't know if I can hide this from mom any longer.\" All three neighbor girls giggled, the babies in their bellies squirming in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, either way, I call this meeting of the Little Mommies Club to order.\" Aya said patting her midsection and earning herself a stong kick from the child within her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll take it.\" She offered, earning herself a nod of approval from the other heavily pregnant girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your feet.\" Molly said as she handed a pill to Annie. Annie nodded and got up, standing in front of the other two girls to be observed in her growth. Little did she know, she was already full term and on the cusp of giving birth. It was clear to anyone but the girls. Molly's belly jutted out proudly from her body, the baby within her having already flipped so the head was settled in her pelvis. Her once non-existent breasts had plumped up and filled with milk. Her pregnancy had come along greatly since she first began taking the pills that had made her a mother. She popped the pill into her mouth and was surprised when she didn't feel the usual feeling of growth. Instead something felt funny inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\" Aya asked with a tilt of her head as Annie held her heavy belly with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I feel funny...\" Annie groaned softly before gasping sharply as she felt her first sharp contraction. \"M-My belly hurts!\" Both the other pregnant preteens were up on their feet as fast as they could manage and hurrying to her aid. The 10 year old continued to moan and groan as they helped her to sit down and lean against the wall, contractions coming strong and rapid as her body rushed through the labor thanks to the pill. It would never have been so rough if she had just gone into labor naturally, an event that would have occurred in just four days if she had not brought it on at this meeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a moment her water broke, soaking her shorts with fluid. The other girls did everything they could to help but that didn't amount to much other than holding her hands and trying to soothe her as her body began trying to shove her child out. It was lucky that there were no adults around to hear her pained sobs as she labored without any painkillers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a half hour after her water had broken that Annie was slumped against the wall, a baby crying between her legs and belly deflated. Molly gasped and grabbed a pair of scissors from the desk nearby, cutting the cord. Aya grabbed a towel and wrapped the baby up. \"You...You had a baby...\" Molly rasped with wide eyes as Annie slowly redressed herself and caught her breath. Aya gave the child to her and it quieted in its mother's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.\" Annie breathed as she looked down at  her daughter that had been within her womb not long ago. \"But I thought these were just fake bellies! I didn't think I had a real baby in me.\"</span></div></div>",

Ever since she first laid her eyes upon a pregnant woman at age 3, she was incredibly interested in her, obsessed even. Even to this day, whenever a mother-to-be passes her line of sight, the young girl would stare at them with a big smile until they left. This upset and worried her parents, who just so happened to be expecting their second child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small, brown haired girl had recently turned 11 and was about to start 5th grade. She was already downstairs with her father Paul, who was already making breakfast for the family. Soon, Anya's mother - Joanne - followed suit and came down in her pink bathrobe, which strained to keep her 8 month belly covered up. \"Morning, guys.\" Jo yawned, taking a seat beside her first daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, like she usually did, Anya touched her mother's belly. Between her slender hand and her mother's swollen midriff was a soft blue glow that seemed to make Joanne's belly shrink...and Anya's to grow. Once Jo returned to her slim figure, Anya gripped onto her new belly as stretch marks formed on her skin, straining the buttons on her pyjamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Anya...?\" Jo stammered, putting her own hand on her daughter's belly. It was real alright. The dome of flesh was as hard as a bowling ball, noticeable heat coming off it too upon feeling. \"We better keep you inside, honey. This is going to be awkward for anyone to see.\" Quickly, Anya's parents whisked her back upstairs to her bed, tucking her in. \"Don't worry, honey. We'll try to find a way to revert this.\"</span></div></div>",

Her mother had said she was \"carrying low\" and it was easy to see what she meant, as well as feel it. Millie's wide hips ached with the weight of her full womb sitting in them and pressing on hr bladder so she had to waddle to the bathroom so much more often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie grunted as she made her way over to the window, rubbing a hand over her tight skin as she looked out over the thick blanket of snow that had come down over her street overnight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Millie stamped her foot against the floorboards in frustration before collapsing atop of her Hello Kitty mattress with an irate groan. It was Christmas morning and, while millions of other lucky kids across the world were busily and happily unwrapping cool new toys and other presents right now, not only had Santa not delivered her anything new, but all of the presents that had been under the tree the nights prior and marked for her were also missing, to boot! Now, this was no act of thievery. At least, no simple one. All of the presents that were for both her parents and elder and younger sister were all still there - intact and sitting just as nice-as-you-please, along with a host of other new goodies. But nothing at all for <i>her!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Well, that wasn't *quite* true. There was, in fact, one set of things left specifically for her. A bundle of several objects that had been placed into her stocking. The most prominent and pertinent of which was a handwritten note, on high-quality paper. Though the handwriting of it was clear, it also showed evidence of being quite tersely-written; the letters seemingly grinding into the paper and coming very close to tearing it in certain spots from the pressure of the hand that wrote them. The letter read as follows...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie (No. I'm skipping the 'Dear' on this note. You haven't been anything at all like a 'dear' child, as of late, and I'll be telling you just why, at that.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must say, that, while I've mostly fallen out of the habits of my old days - such as leaving coal and switches in the stockings of naughty little boys and girls (and I <i>long</i> ago convinced my superiors just what a truly <i>dreadful</i> idea of what hiring that awful brute, Krampus, was in the first place. Ugh...) - I simply cannot turn a blind eye to the selfish, self-centered and - I'll say it bluntly- outright <i>bratty</i> that you have displayed in the past month towards your parents, sisters, and friends. ...All of whom love you dearly and deserve much better than the treatment that you have been showing to them in recent months. Since we have to start off <i>somewhere</i> I'll begin with the behavior you've been showing towards your parents. All of this past year, ever since they told you that they had looked into those Hatchimal toys, found them quite substandardly-designed, and tried to tell you - quite rightly - that they'd only bring disappointment if they got you one, you not only threw the mother of all temper tantrums on them (on Christmas day!) but have been getting steadily more disrespectful and insolent towards them since... Back-talking them. Slacking off in your chores. Badmouthing them to that crowd of girls you've been calling 'friends' as of late (more on <i>them</i> later). It's simply inexcusable. Your parents gave you life, brought you into this word with love and nurtured you through the years to today - at not-inconsiderable cost and trouble to themselves, I might add - and this behavior is how you think to repay them? I simply won't stand for it. Then - as promised - there's the matter of that crowd of snooty delinquents that you have - for reasons that escape me - been attempting to ingratiate yourself with, as of late. You seem to have gotten it into your head that, just because they come from well-off families and have access to all the currently-fashionable clothes, hair, and devices, that that somehow means that they get a white card to treat others in deplorably unkind ways. Why any child would idolize them I just don't understand, but you seem to have gotten it into your head that they are 'the cool crowd', and, in turn, you have been both neglecting and mistreating your older, truer friends in an effort to ingratiate yourself to them. You even made jokes about Lacy Whitmoore - your <i>actual</i> best friend since kindergarten - and your sisters - your own flesh and blood - behind their backs, just to give those girls a cruel and undeserved laugh. For shame!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, here is the deal (Not that you will actually have the luxury of declining like any standard form of fair dealing. At least not in all aspects of it)... My dear reindeer might be highly magical, and the 'main 9' (including sweet Rudolph) you know of from song and legend do, indeed, pull my personal sleigh each and every year. But 'magical' doesn't always equate to 'can do the entire job all by themselves'. They each have great stamina and plucky drive, but it's a very big world, and it takes more than just the efforts of nine reindeer to deliver gifts all around the globe to little boys and girls; We need lots of other sleighs, pulled by reserve teams of other fine exemplars of their breed in order to properly cater to everyone. 7-and-a-half-plus-billion-and-still-growing people means a lot of magical reindeer are needed for the task of gift delivery each year, with more called for all the time. That is where <i>you</i> will be coming in. You already know that my office gifts out magical pregnancies to desiring <i>good</i> girls from time to time. As you know, your older sister asked for one three years ago, and your family owes the existence of your horse nephew to it. At that, your little sister happens to have been gifted one just today in response for her wish to have some cute puppies about the house, as well. Well, even though you have <i>not</i> been a good girl this past year, you will still be getting one of these pregnancies as well. Specifically, you will be required to carry and birth one of my aforementioned magical reindeer. How do you think that nasty little clique of so-called 'friends' you have been associating with will react when they see you walking - or should I say, 'waddling' - down the school hall while you are all swollen up huge with a growing reindeer calf? Do you think they will be kind and supportive to you? Or do you think they will just laugh and jeer at you, much like they did over your <i>real</i> friend, Lacy, when you made that awful joke to them about her looking like a 'cow' just because she happens to be pregnant with and by one? I do wonder (but not <i>that</i> hard). Also, though reindeer calves <i>typically</i> require 222 days (that's just a bit over 7 months) I happened to request that this one be dropped off in you womb with just enough gestational-accelerant to push you just past the point of showing by tomorrow morning. That might mean a little less time having to carry the calf, in-of-itself, but it <i>also</i> means there will be no time to try hiding or make excuses for your condition  - from <i>anyone</i> - by the time your school gets back in session by the 4th. You're welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo. Beyond getting a valuable new reindeer for my reserves, what do *I* hope to get out of doing this? Well, it's at least my <i>hope</i> that you learn at least a modicum of humility and responsibility for your actions by being pressed into this task. If motherhood proves to be too much of a challenge for you to handle, I will send a special team of elves about a month after you birth it (to allow for proper weaning), in order bring it back to my personal stables up North, and we will call it a lesson learned. But, that said, I truly hope that you can manage to pull your act together and manage to surpass my bare expectations for you. If you turn your behavior around... Do things like start treating your family and friends better and taking proper responsibility about the house again, then that same team of elves will <i>also</i> drop all of the toys and gifts you would have <i>normally</i> received this morning at the same tie that the retrieve the calf. If you actually manage to truly go above and beyond the call... Take real responsibility for your actions and do things like admit to Lacy and your sister the jokes that you made about them behind their backs, and apologize for it, and take pains to take exceptional care of both yourself and the calf while it is in your care, the you will actually be allowed to <i>keep</i> the calf, and be a proper mother to it - Raising it throughout the majority of each and every year, and we'll only require you to be parted from it for a few days around each Christmas for it to do its work. But whether you accomplish - or even <i>desire</i> - that, will be up for your upcoming future actions to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. Just so you don't think of me as an overbearing ogre over this, I <i>have</i> decided to leave you some materials to help you out a little - Like a elf-written guide to the developmental needs of gestating and newborn caribou (which is what 'reindeer' technically are) calves, as well as some anti-morning sickness maternity candies, as well as a small package of cookies and hot chocolate for you to at least enjoy <i>something</i> about this Christmas day. Like I said before. I'm not that nasty fiend Krampus. You really don't want to know how he'd handle this situation if <i>he</i> were still in charge of naughty children...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie groans again, and runs her hand over her belly. Santa really wasn't kidding about that gestational accelerant he mentioned in the letter. She can already feel her waistline starting to puff, and dreaded just how her figure would be ruined by tomorrow, or the looks she'd inevitably get when she walked into school after the break ended at the start of the coming year. Ugh... Could she <i>really</i> fess up to both Lacy and her older sis about the jokes she made about them? Did she even <i>want</i> to? They'd definitely both be upset. But then. she <i>did</i> kind of miss hanging with Lacy, and was kind of wondering how things were going with her own cow pregnancy. If they manged to forgive her, maybe they could each help her through this coming reindeer ...er... caribou... Err... <i>whatever</i> of her own...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...At least the anti-morning sickness candies Santa gifted her were, indeed, helping with the nausea she was feeling. Tasty too. Mm.</span></div></div>",

She could hear a happy squeal coming from another room and moments later, her door burst open to show her little sister. Millie wasn't fond of her seven and a half year old sister named Jenny. Of all things her parents named her sister it had to be Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Millie, Millie!\" Jenny cried. \"Look. Look at me Millie!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a grumble, the older sibling looked at her sister and had to take another look at what she saw. Jenny didn't look like herself. She looked a bit taller, her hair longer than it had been last night before everyone had to go to bed. The most distinguishing feature however, was the onesie Jenny was wearing. Right around the middle, the kitty onesie was pulled a bit tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Santa gave me my two most favorite things this year.\" Jenny cooed. \"Now, I'm eight and a half, not seven and a half.\" The little girl said with an ear to ear smile. \"And, did you see it? Did you? Huh?\" Jenny bounced a bit where she stood before she squealed again, taking the zipper on her onesie in her fingers. \"Tadaaa!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Millie's jaw dropped. She had been right and Santa hadn't lied. Jenny's tummy was indeed swollen out. It wasn't necessarily much but, it was obvious on such a young girl. Millie took a second to work out how big her sister's belly was but she was interrupted and growled, clenching a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Santa said I'm gonna be a mommy.\" Jenny said. Her small hands were on her baby bump as she went back and forth, swinging her tummy about. \"He gave me a letter and said that I'm gonna have a litter of puppies because I was a good girl this year. Plus, he said I was gonna have a biiig litter for being extra good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The older sister scoffed. She was pregnant too! Even so, she bit her tongue and offered a forced smile as she looked at her younger sibling and the pregnancy at her hips. Jenny went on to explain that Santa had made her three weeks along with her litter of eight very large pups to celebrate her turning eight years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mommy found a doppler in the spare bedroom when we went in there.\" Jenny said. \"She wants you to come and look at the puppies in my tummy with us. Pleeease come watch. I want you there too big sis Mill!\" Jenny was pleading, her four month looking bump being cradled by one hand while the other rubbed at the top of the swell.</span></div></div>",

That didn't dissuade her though, as she kept calling the younger mother fat. Eventually Jenny had enough and zipped up her onesie, sniffling. Millie grinned and stuck out her tongue for added effect before she slumped into her bed, having gotten up while she was being rude to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I'll show you I'm not fat when mommy give me a picture of my babies.

She left the room soon after and Millie took a deep breath and sighed. She was really mad she got forced to have a reindeer. She wanted to have kittens or maybe rabbits. But here she was, grumbling to herself about how much her belly was starting to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Millie was unaware that she was already going down to the naughty list for next year. Santa had also failed to mention (or most likely didn't tell the girl on purpose) that the further she got on the naughty list, the faster her pregnancy would speed up. There was a cap to the speed though as Santa again, wasn't Krampus. If she continued her rudeness, it would leave her due around a month instead of four or five months. She couldn't gain most of her pregnancy in a day but over a week she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Currently though, her words had made her gain an extra two weeks, making her four weeks pregnant. Her belly though, was still catching up from all the comments she made. If she didn't be mean for a moment, she'd grow until she looked like she was six months pregnant with a human baby! As the eleven year old laid on her back, her pregnant middle was now becoming more distinct, looking to be three months along as it rounded out under her already tight shirt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One that would make his daughter have even more babies. The best part? He didn't even know she was going to be having a foal instead of his grandchild.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't really like needles but, she didn't complain as the pinch was worth getting rid of her upset stomach. As she went to pull down her pink shirt, her father stopped her. She looked at him curiously and saw he had another needle, this one longer than the last one.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Daddy?\" Fel called out. \"Why do you have another needle?

He had to pay attention to how much he gave his daughter as if he gave too much, she could end up with too many babies to handle, even with his medical knowledge and equipment. Even so, he had been monitoring Felly and knew she could handle a baby or two. He had been the one who had been giving her supplements in the meals he cooked so she would be able to have a baby for him when she was ready. Of course, when she started getting symptoms, he thought he had messed something up with the supplements but, he hadn't.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The doctor had figured out his daughter must have either come in contact with another male (Who he would kill if he found.) Or, she was like the virgin Mary, which would be a breakthrough in science and surely make him famous when he figured out how she managed to wind up pregnant at such a tender age without any outside interference. With a deep breath, the salt and pepper bearded father snapped out of his thoughts and looked at the syringe to see how much of the mixture he had put into his little girl's belly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had been so lost in his thoughts on being a world renown scientist that he had put the whole concoction into his daughter's belly. He started to sweat, pulling out the needle and swallowing hard.

He put the needle away and looked at his daughter who had passed out, obviously tired.

He took a deep breath and walked to the bedroom door, shutting off the light before he too went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i><b>Week 2</b></i></div><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felicity had been excused from school for the rest of the week thanks to her father giving the school a doctor's note. She didn't know what was going on with her belly but as she rubbed the gentle swell of her distended midsection, she couldn't help but dread what was going to happen. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0following her dad into a room, Fel was put on a table, shivering at how cold it was. Her dad slid her shirt up below her small but slightly there bust and took a deep breath. Felicity's belly looked like she was sporting a twenty-one week pregnant belly already. There was a \"spluurt\" and Felly let out a squeak. Her dad had put a clear gel on her belly and now had a weird device on her tummy, pressing it lightly into her belly as he looked at a screen. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell...?\" He muttered. The longer he looked, the more he began to move the doppler over his daughter's belly. \"There's one... Two? Three, and there's a fourth one right there. Wait, there's a fifth one hiding right behind the second one! There's Five babies inside of you Felly.\" There was a pause as the salt and pepper bearded man took in the new information. He smacked his lips and looked at the monitor again before he nodded, pursing his lips. \"You're having FIVE?!\" Felly watched as her father looked at her in a panic. \"Fel baby. Don't panic. It's going to be alright. Don't tell anyone, don't worry about it. Daddy will take care of you.\" He said as he helped her off the bench. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felicity was told to keep her shirt up and her dad took a few pictures before she was told to let go of her shirt. Before she let go, she cleaned off her rounding tummy and then there were more pictures being taken once her shirt was down. Felly asked her dad why he was panicking and then asked him why he was taking so many pictures before she asked why she had been growing only at her belly. He licked his lips and explained to her only what she needed to know. With a tilt of her head, she tried to take it all in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, she was pregnant. Well, more than pregnant because she had more than one bundle of joy inside of her. Heck ,she had more then three of them! She was going to have five babies and her father told her that her twenty-one week looking tummy was very small in comparison to how big he expected her to get by the time she had her little ones. He was taking the pictures so she could see how much bigger she was after each session of taking pictures. She thought that was alright and was curious to see her size after each week too.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He looked down at his little girl and watched as she rubbed her pregnant belly, unaware of just how serious the situation was now that she was fully confirmed to be pregnant. The doctor still didn't know that his daughter had made a wish to have her own Clydesdale. Now, because he hadn't paid attention a week ago, he had given her four extra foals as well and she was going to  only be pregnant for a little over two more months. Felicity was in for a fast ride as her quints grow bigger and bigger inside of her small body. Her pregnancy will end up being one for the records when she give birth and her dad was certain of it.</div></span></div></div>",

She let out a groan and pulled one of the pillows from behind her head over her eyes to shield herself from the light. It had been a week since she was told by her father that she was going to be having quintuplets and with the quints being horses, Felly's tummy was growing quickly. Her blanket was already being pushed up quite a bit from how big she was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fel? It's time to get up.

Her dad had been checking on her constantly. He let her sleep and play with her dolls when she wanted but, it seemed like he always got her up early. Looking at her bedside clock, she found out it was two in the afternoon. With a grumble, Felicity got out of bed and pushed at her spine to stretch. Her pregnant tummy looked a lot bigger as she walked over to her long, full body mirror that her mom had gotten her yesterday after she caught her daughter trying to see her rounding bump in the bathroom mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Funnily enough, Felicity had on a pair of horse print pajamas, the waistband not even on her belly and the buttons were undone to show off just how big she was already. She got her phone and looked up \"Pregnant with quints, three weeks.\" When she found nothing to compare to, she pouted. Before she started a temper tantrum however, there was a knock at her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Felly honey? It's daddy.\" The little girl told her dad he could come in and he just smiled, watching her study herself in the mirror, turning this way and that. She asked if he could tell her how pregnant she looked and he gulped. She was quite the curious little thing wasn't she? \"W-Well... That's an interesting question sweetie. Come here and let daddy look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fel did as she was directed to do and stood in front of her dad who was sitting on her bed now, hands on his knees. Her face lit up as he praised her, telling her she already looked close to having a normal baby. The man told her she looked thirty four weeks to be exact. As her father pulled out a camera, she sighed, patting her large belly as she went and put on her \"Bump Progression\" outfit. It consisted of an easy to pull up blue tank top and gray sweatpants. After the initial pictures she had her daddy take a few more of her in her pajamas and then he gave her a pat on the head before he left the room, muttering the whole way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once the salt and pepper bearded doctor was gone, the pregnant girl looked over at her desk. Her pink computer at full charge. Upon seeing that, she thought about watching videos but was interrupted when she saw herself in the mirror again. Felicity bit her lip. She kind of wanted to play dress up too. Watch videos or try on clothes. The eleven year old couldn't really decide and she pouted, lip coming out as she crossed her arms under her non-existent chest. She sat down right where she was, tummy in her lap as she debated on what to do for a few hours before she went back to bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She rang the bell to call for her maids to help her dress so that she would be able to go and have breakfast as she was actually feeling quite hungry this morning, which was rare for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my lady.\" A maid said cheerily as she entered the room with a box in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Miriam.\" Eliza chirped from where she was brushing out her long gold locks at her vanity, not seeing the box that had been brought in her distraction. \"I'd like to wear my blue dress this morning.\" Miriam nodded and went to the wardrobe, quickly placing the dresses that had been made overnight in for when they would be needed. All the staff had been quietly informed of the truth of what was to come for Eliza, and were to do all they could to make it easy for her. That had included the quick creation of maternity dresses. Miriam pulled out the desired dress and glanced over at the princess. Well, the girl seemed no more pregnant than she had the day before, so there was no reason to try and place her in maternity wear right away. She laid the dress out on the bed and went to help Eliza to place her hair in intricate braids before moving to help her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the sleeping shift was laid aside, Miriam was able to see that the young princess was indeed with child, though it was not by much. The young girl was just thicker in the middle really, a small curve of a 12 week pregnancy poking out on her slender body. Miriam made sure to say nothing, though, helping Eliza to step into her dress and starting to lace up the back, praying it would fit.</span></div></div>",

She bit the inside of her cheek and tried to push it off but said \"Uh oh.\" when she noticed it felt like it was on top of her! Tossing the blanket aside, Eliza saw her night shirt pushed up, barely on her swollen tummy after the blanket was tossed off of her. She called for a servant who quickly came in, covering their mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sight before them was quite interesting to say the least. The king's daughter already looked five or six months pregnant and because she was so small, it showed up on her easily. It was like someone cut a sphere and then slimmed the sides of it down to fit on her. Obviously they had given the poor girl more than one child.  More than one of her father's children, her siblings they should think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Going over to her, the servant tilted their head, looking at Eliza even closer. \"Does it hurt?\" They asked in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-No...\" The girl replied, a hand on her swollen belly.

Her tummy shifted as she did this and she took a deep breath. Her shirt showed a bump but it didn't look too obvious. Was she sick? Bloated from dinner last night? Maybe she just had to go to the bathroom. Lifting up her pajama top, Eliza stared in wonder at herself. Her belly really looked puffed out now that she saw it directly. She pursed her lips and pushed, face going red as her little tummy bulged out even more from her for a few seconds. She gasped, taking a breath as it returned to it's five months or so size. The little girl gave the gentle swell the most tender caress in the world, sending goosebumps up her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think I just need to go back to sleep.\" The child murmured, letting her shirt fall. With a heavy sigh Eliza went back to her bed, crawling on her hands and knees to her pillows before she spun around and flopped onto her back. She slid into her heavy blanket and turned on her side, slipping back into sleep for a few extra hours.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Emmy hadn't lied to her yet in the 11 years she had known the girl so why would she lie about this? All of her symptoms matched up with being pregnant too so she supposed she shouldn't even doubt what her friend was telling her. She smiled, patting her flat belly. <i>'If Emeila is right, I'll really be a mommy to a baby soon.'</i> Haley thought. It was at that moment that the young blonde began to think about what kind of baby she could be having.

Just a few more months to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her shirt back down, sat down, and picked up the visual aid. \"Baby's grown to the size of this cantaloupe. All the parts are there, but baby isn't ready to use them yet. Technically, baby will be full term at 37 weeks, but most mommies carry their babies for 40 weeks.\" She let out a breath. \"Makes me tired just thinking about it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe how much the vlog has taken off. I mean, I've got viewers all over the world, and three TV shows have talked to my folks about interviews. Who would have thought that so many people find little old me interesting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of you may be wondering, What's with all the stuff around me? Well, believe it or not, all these things were sent to me by viewers like you. I'd thank you individually, but some of your handles are extremely dirty, and I don't want baby to hear those words. Yeah, my baby can hear me, and I just love reading to my baby every night. Hopefully, baby remembers that better than the things I say when I get up to use the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're just about out of time. I'd like to thank you all for watching, and a special thank you to those who sent me baby gifts: I appreciate them, almost as much as I appreciate you. I'll be back next week with more. See you then.\"</span></div></div>",

I've been moved into a bedroom on the ground floor. I can walk from my bed to a chair at the kitchen table, from there to the couch, from there to either the bathroom or out to the car. And, of course, my comfy chair. That's why the room behind me looks different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her T-shirt to show, not only her belly, but her bra as well. \"Baby's really getting big, with an estimated 12 weeks to go. And I'm wearing a nursing bra, now.\" She picked up a small flower-shaped pad. \"My breasts are leaking, so I have to put these pads on to absorb the milk.\" She picked up the week's visual aid. \"Baby's the size of this eggplant now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting close now.

It's just, I don't know what to really say.\" Emelia sighed and asked Haley about her ultrasound the other day. \"Well, according to the doctors, I'm going to have a very odd pregnancy.\" The camera girl asked what kind of pregnancy. \"I-I was told I was going to have an elephant pregnancy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that out of the way, Haley watched Emelia gesture that it was time to show her pregnant belly. The blonde took a deep breath and moved the pillow covering her expanding midsection out of the way. When she stood up, it was obvious something was under her shirt. There was a large sphere jutting out and straining the yellow top below Haley's chest line which hadn't grown yet and she cradled it as if it was a little weighted. Turning to her side, Haley made sure the shape of her belly could be seen better through the shirt and then, with a few words from Emelia again, she lifted up her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Haley's pregnant belly was a bit pale and it looked like she had swallowed a junior medicine ball. If those watching had to guess, they thought Haley looked a little over thirty seven weeks pregnant with an actual baby and couldn't beleive she had went from not showing, to looking due in a week. After a few seconds passed, Haley covered her belly and quickly went back to sitting on her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Before anyone asks. No. I-I didn't skip a few months for this video and I'm not tricking anyone.\" Haley rubbed her arm and then put her hands on her bump. \"I really am three weeks pregnant. Elephant babies are supposedly really really big.\" She had a blush on her cheeks for a moment before it went away. \"Okay I have some other things to do so I guess I'll see you in another week. B-Bye!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmeila turned off the recording and Haley let out a cry of relief. She was so embarrassed! She had read a few comments on her last video and a lot of them were rude. Emmy assured her that the majority of people were just skeptical and with time and updates, Haley would prove she was actually carrying elephants in her womb. It still didn't help the poor blonde though. She already was dreading her next pregnancy update and could only hope her best friend was right.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now it's the final question before going back to the story at Haley's <b>third week</b> of pregnancy. Will she be pregnant for about two times the normal speed for an elephant pregnancy or will she be pregnant for around the same time an elephant is and carry her twin calves for around two years? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Note that with these options Haley will turn 12 and maybe 13 depending on what one you choose. Naturally, she should grow in that time as most kids do. Maybe with age and height comes more room for her twins to fill out her tummy!

It's week three so that means it's my third week of pregnancy with my baby.\" Haley smiled and shook her shoulders a bit before calming down. \"I can't wait to tell everyone this but first, let me show you all something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pregnant eleven year old had Emelia pick up the camera and bring it towards her. On her princess Belle pillow were three watermelons. \"Can you all guess why there's three watermelons on my bed?\" Haley's voice asked. The camera stayed on the watermelons for a bit before quickly going back to the stand it was previously on.

She gave the side facing the camera a few quick pats before her small hand reached to the hem of her shirt and gripped the end. She closed her eyes and then pulled her shirt up with a visible grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The eleven year old's skin was clear of stretchmarks and her belly button appeared as a round ball at the end of her nearly forty-three week looking belly. Haley took a deep breath and exhaled, moving her hips from side to side as she stood there, obviously way more pleased with herself now than she had been last week. In total, she had been pregnant for only a month. Thirty days and that was all. She put a hand on her pregnant bump and gently rubbed it, eyes still closed as her cheeks formed a light blush on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emelia cleared her throat and Haley came back to reality, giggling adorably. \"S-Sorry!\" The little girl squeaked. \"As I was going to say earlier though, I'm nice and pregnant as you can all tell.\" She licked her lips, hand rubbing over her skin to emphasize her fourty-three week looking midsection. \"The reason why? Drumroll please... It's because there's three babies in my tummy right now!\" She squealed and cradled the underside of her baby bump as she turned to face the camera, belly still on full display as she held her shirt up. From this angle, everyone could see just how big the child's belly button had gotten too. It was a round sphere at the head of Haley's big fertile swell of alien life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay well. I guess that's enough tum for everyone. Have a good week without us. Buh-bye now!\" The screen cut off just before Haley fell backwards onto her bed. Her whole attitude about her condition had changed enough to cause a mild bout of concern in her fans but very few of them had commented their concerns.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is actually a special video.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After she finished speaking, Haley reached behind her and pulled a bottle into view.

Obviously she was quite excited to do this in front of the camera. Without hesitation, Haley slipped off of her bed, stumbling a bit from just how big her belly was.

She stood on her tippy toes, the side of her large tum on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Haley looked like she was forty six weeks pregnant. That meant she went from a nine month belly to a ten and a half belly in the course of two days. The little aliens inside were sure using their mother's stretchy skin to their advantage! There was a 'Spluurt' and then Haley closed the bottle of oil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So. This stuff is more like a goopy oil but, I love it a lot.\" The overdue looking mommy said, beginning to rub the stuff in. \"It's weird because, Emmy told me this stuff appeared at her door two weeks ago and she knew it had to of been for me.\" The child moaned, her finger tips just barely grazing her popped navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There came a point where Haley applied more of her goop-oil on her large bump and she squealed. She really enjoyed doing this. Anyone would be able to see that in her eyes as she went from looking at her distended middle, to the camera, and then back to her bump. Eventually though, The young blonde couldn't keep herself from cooing and moaning at the sensation. She eventually turned to fully face the camera, biting her lip as she tried to reach her belly button. She couldn't and even though she bent over a bit, she still couldn't reach it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As with all videos, they had to come to an end. Luckily for the viewers, Haley had moved onto her bed, her ten and a half tummy in her lap as she continued to rub her shiny tummy. She licked her lips and let out a long breath before tossing her head back, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oooh-kaaay...\" Haley said. \"I guess that'll be bit for the special video everyone. I'm gonna let this stuff sink into my skin and apply the second layer off camera. I hope everyone enjoyed! Next video will be on time I promise.

Oh and did I mention-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m having alien babies too everyone!\u201d Emilia blurted out, laughing joyfully as her blonde friend rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYea. Turns out, that oil I rubbed all over my tummy a few days ago and so far until what? Yesterday?\u201d She looked to Emeila who nodded. \u201cIt was meant to be for Emmy here because she\u2019s actually expecting double the amount of babies I am. I\u2019m sooo jealous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that out of the way, Haley and Emelia tried to shuffle off of the bed, the blonde needing help to get onto her feet. They both raised their shirts up together and Haley smiled while Emmy smirked. As the duo turned to their sides, they had their backs to one another, bellies bulging out from their small bodies. The red head even put a hand to her back and pushed her tummy out even more, obviously trying to tease those who were watching the vlogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The viewers had a hard time determining who looked more stunning. While Haley had grown even more, Emelia had obviously been hiding her pregnancy very well. The original mommy had a round, bowling ball shaped belly, looking like she had been pregnant for a whole entire year. The newer mommy seemed to have a large curve to her tum but it didn\u2019t bulge out on the sides like her friend\u2019s belly did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In terms of weeks, Haley looked fifty three weeks along while Emelia looked thirty two weeks along. No one watching knew that both girls would be expecting to deliver by their fourth months. They were too busy watching Haley\u2019s popped out belly button press into Emmy\u2019s gentle nub at the front of her swollen mound. The young girls had their hands locked together and were trying to get as close to one another as they could. After a few grunts and encouraging words to try a bit harder, they gave up, bellies expanding back to normal as they decided enough was enough for the vlog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emelia and Haley rubbed over their fertile swells while Emmy explained that at some point, she was gonna pass Haley\u2019s size. The red headed girl looked so smug when she said it too! As it was time to end the video for sure now, Haley blew a kiss at the camera and Em pushed out her tummy one last time before the vlog stopped.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well...\" She set the card down and shot a glance at Emmy, who nodded encouragingly. \"You see, my town is where that meteor hit two weeks ago. I was right by the impact site when it came down. But it wasn't a meteor, it was an alien ship. It grabbed me and pulled me inside and made me drink weird stuff. When it let me go, I got examined and told I'm pregnant.

I have... oh, what did they call it? Broodmare access. Apparently having babies in me means that the ship actually listens to me instead of all the scientists who had been prodding it, so I get to spend all day down there now. I'll try and sneak some footage next time, okay?\" Haley uncapped the tube and chugged the entire contents easily, looking dazed for a second when she finished before she started hefting herself to her feet with a groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what four weeks of me feeding them properly looks like!\" She sighed, rolling up her shirt and turning.

Suzie scampered to her friend\u2019s side, and started rubbing her stomach. \u201cHow\u2019d you do that, you feel pregnant.\u201d \u201cMagic spells, I drink water to fill up, and I can drain myself whenever I want, you interested.\u201d Lisa said flashing her the piece of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch!\u201d Lisa said as she sat down on a toilet. She looked at the paper and realized a problem, the spells were smudged beyond recognition. Now that she was on the spot she tried her best to say the spell as she could remember, and parse from the smudgy scribbles. She started reciting the spell hoping it would work. \u201cFahshuk manate.. aquanan expandus\u2026 absoro\u201d Much to her surprise, she started feeling something, the lights started flickering, and then nothing. The girls sat in silence for a few moments, until Suzie spoke up. \u201cSo, what was that supposed to do?\u201d She inquired. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Lisa replied a sense of dread welling up in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another moment of silence, Suzie once again asked another question. \u201cSo you can cast that spell on me too right.\u201d Lisa panicked as she realized that was going to be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, I can do it when you come over after school.\u201d Lisa said trying to change the subject. \u201cHey, I thought you had the spells right there.\u201d Suzie countered pointing at the paper. \u201cYeah, I guess I do.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She couldn\u2019t tell for sure, but her belly didn\u2019t feel as tight as before, she didn\u2019t feel as bloated. Sitting next to her Suzie kept fidgeting in her seat, obviously something was wrong with her. Finally noticing her friend\u2019s situation Lisa asked quietly. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d \u201cAre you sure you read that spell correctly?\u201d Suzie replied quietly in an accusing tone that worried Lisa. \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d She asked with a nervous smile. \u201cBecause my pants feel tight and I haven\u2019t drunk any water yet.\u201d Suzie said with a scowl. \u201cLook!\u2019 she said lifting up her shirt slightly so just Lisa could see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere before her eye Lisa, could see her friend\u2019s belly was muffin topping slightly, and as she continued to watch she noticed the bulge seemed to be growing. \u201cOh my god Suzie, you\u2019re growing.\u201d Lisa screamed in a whisper. \u201cI am!\u201d Suzie said quietly as she realized something her face showing her shock. With a tiny \u201cpop,\u201d the button on Suzie\u2019s pants came undone making her appear four months gone. \u201cYou did read that spell wrong didn\u2019t you.\u201d Suzie said her anger obvious by her expression. \u201cOkay, maybe I did, but it doesn\u2019t matter, when we get to my house after school, I can get the right spell and fix you.\u201d Lisa said defensively trying to downplay the seriousness of the situation. \u201cI\u2019m blowing up like a water balloon, and we still have a few hours before school gets out.\u201d Suzie interjected with whispered fury, before she moaned quietly as the bottom button on her shirt popped off. Luckily for Suzie she was wearing a stretchy t-shirt as an undershirt so her swollen stomach wasn\u2019t visible, but her clothes would be ruined at this rate. \u201cShhh, try not to make a scene we don\u2019t want to attract attention.\u201d Lisa said under her breath, much to Suzie\u2019s begrudging agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on Suzie got bigger and bigger, she only had three buttons left on her shirt, by the time school was let out, her stomach reaching third trimester size, and by the time they got to Lisa\u2019s house she had one button left, and a belly comparable to twins. \u201cNow get on the toilet and I\u2019ll get the spell book.\u201d Lisa grabbed the book, looked up the appropriate spell, and went to her friend in the bathroom. Alright her it is just read this, Lisa said pointing out the spell to Suzie. \u201cFahshuk matan aguanan expellus korpo.\u201d Suzie said and after a moment there was a popping sound as Suzie expelled the huge amount of water, leaving her relieved and exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the nonsense with Suzie, Lisa had forgotten about the miscast spell she had made earlier to demonstrate for Suzie, but as she began to cast the emptying spell on herself the effects of that spell might manifest. After standing in the tub, Lisa recited the words aloud with confidence. \u201cFahshuk matan aguanan expellus korpo.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leaving Lisa alone with Suzie, who was still looking into what Lisa might have done earlier to cause her inability to empty herself. The young teen placed a hand on her little bump with a mix of fear, and slight arousal. If her hunch was right, she now had two spells effected her, who's effect she didn't know, at least completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time it was a little thrilling. The fact that she couldn't get rid of her belly made it feel all the more like a real pregnancy. And while she had faith that Suzie would find a solution eventfully, maybe it wouldn't be too bad to be stuck with a fake baby bump for awhile? \"I should pace myself on drinking though, at least until Suzie finds something.\" As she said that though, she felt something shiver though her body as her mouth felt uncomfortably dry. Like she had just been outside in the sun for hours, and had sweated out buckets! Lisa found herself turning towards the kitchen, eyes trained on the sink as a single droplet of water dripped from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to taunt her as she realized she never felt more thirsty in her entire life. \"I-it's alright if I take a sip right? Just to take the edge off.\" Lisa tried to rationalize , already starting to walk into the kitchen. Her mind felt like it was in a daze whenever she thought about something that wasn't getting a drink. Like she was forgetting something, but it wasn't as important as grabbing the glass and filling it with water. Lisa found herself licking her lips as she left the water running, and began chugging the glass, letting out a moan as she felt the cool refreshing liquid run down her throat, momentarily fighting back the unbearable dryness in her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least until the cup was empty. The water was already running, and she was still thirsty. So Lisa just tipped it back under the flow, and brought it back to her lips. Again, and again. It was just as blissful as the first, and though she felt a slight pressure, she felt it no mind. She was so consumed with drinking glass after glass that the rest of the world was forgotten, at least until she tipped a still empty glass back to her lips. Now she had no more water to drink, Liisa opened her eyes to see why. What she found shocked the poor girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had drank a lot, enough to rival the size she was the first night. Looking close to term with triplets once more. And this was the reason why she had stopped drinking, as he water filled womb grew too large for her to reach the faucet with the cup. She was thankful that it had happened, as she could feel her mouth dry up once more, the flowing water calling to her again. But the heavy weight of her womb on her hips kept her from falling completely into the trance.</span></div></div>",

I see.\" Ann smiled a little and darted out to clean up so they could close the shop down for the day, mind constantly wandering to the treats now.</span></div></div>",

James called out from the front and she peeked her head out of the kitchen. \"I'm locking up okay? When you're done just leave out the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\", she called, and continued cleaning up the bakery. When she finished, Ann hit the lights, slumped down in one of the cafe's chairs, and checked her phone. It was just after dinnertime - she should really be going. But as she laid her hand on the exit door to the alley behind the bakery, she stopped. Her hand went to her stomach. She was pretty hungry right now... a couple baked goods couldn't hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn returned to the kitchen, walking past the fridge where she returned some of the baked goods earlier. There was a second fridge closer to James' office, stocked with more than what was in the first fridge. Ann had been told only to concern herself with the first fridge. Given what James had said earlier though, she had more than a sneaking suspicion what was inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped into his office - James never left it locked - and rummaged around his desk, being careful to replace things where she found them. After a few minutes, she found what she was looking for in one of his drawers. \"Product list.\", she smiled to herself, and walked back to the second fridge. Ann held up the stapled package to the dim light of a digital thermometer, squinting to read the stock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby brownies - 40 units<br>\r\nMilk Cake - 15 units (too dry, fix next batch)<br>\r\nGrowth cookies - 7 packages of 40<br>\r\nSwell macarons, asst. - 20 boxes of 6...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's too many on the list to go through individually. Ann shrugged, grabbing a couple of the listed goods and some from the upper shelf. She changed the stock numbers on James' sheet and replaced it in his drawer. After putting the treats in her bag,  Ann was just about to leave, but she stopped, heading back to the register and ringing in her purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bus, she nibbled on one of the cookies she grabbed. It tasted pretty good. It was an oatmeal raisin cookie, sweet and tasting like cinammon~... Ann frowned.  She had grabbed the goods as a snack, but even as she polished off her second cookie and worked on a third, they weren't curbing her hunger. Rather than taking the edge of, she stayed about as hungry as she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn bounded inside, waving to her mom as she ran upstairs to put her bag away, and she returned a moment later to sit at the kitchen table. \"Hey hun. Little late from work today?\", her mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, James had me closing down the shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, he's giving you a bit more responsibilty, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, guess he trusts me.\", she shrugged, \"Do we have any pickles, or beets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom nodded, getting up and fetching a jar from the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\", Ann nodded and put a few onto her plate. They talked idly about their days before cleaning up the dishes, and Ann left back upstairs.</span></div></div>",

She took out her text book and sighed, flipping through the pages that were covered in the day's lessons. Every so often, she reached down into her bag, and munched on another cookie. Within an hour, she could feel her skirt getting tight. Ann brushed against her tummy, feeling a pudgy cushion where a flat middle used to be. Pinching around, she could even feel some extra padding on her hips. As she was prodding, she could even feel a stiff lump in her core, warmer than the rest of her skin. It brought a whole new meaning to the phrase \"food baby\". Ann giggled. It<br>\r\nwasn't that she didn't believe James, it was just so strange she thought he was joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was happy he wasn't, though. Ann had been curious about pregnancy for a while. It seemed so fun, and pregnant women always looked so content... well, as long as their feet didn't hurt. She wanted to try it herself one day, but she didn't expect it to be so soon~ The best part was - no risks! According to James, after a couple hours it'd be back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn switched into her PJ's and pulled the treats from her bag, hiding them in a drawer of her nightstand.

She was full from dinner - she even ate more than usual - but something told her it wouldn't be a problem. She rolled up her top and popped a cookie in her mouth. \"No change. Figured as much.\", Ann thought, and massaged her slightly chubby middle in gentle circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out her phone and turned on a video, still munching on the cookies. Just like earlier, they weren't filling. Still tasted good, though. Ann looked over into her drawer to see if she grabbed another flavor, too. Guess not... just oatmeal raisin for now. She worked tomorrow, though. Could swap them out for another variety. Ann munched on another and looked at the bag in her hand. Looked like the cookies were half-gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn looked down at her belly. She had subtly felt something as she ate, but it totally didn't feel like this much. It would've rolled up her top if she didn't do it herself earlier. Ann put down her phone and rested her hands on it and to the side. It stuck almost half a foot from her body, and when she pressed down, there was very little give. Anyone who saw her would say that, undeniably, she had a baby bump. There was even a dark line running down her midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe murmered excitedly and pet her belly. If she had to guess, Ann would say she was getting into the heart of her third trimester. She pulled down her PJ top as far as she could - just under her navel - and went to stand up, but rocked back onto her rear. \"Oof\", she gasped, and tried again, swinging her legs over the side first. Ann wiped the crumbs from her sheets and walked towards her door, hand on the small of her back. She looked outside. No sign of mom. She went to the bathroom and admired her figure in the full-length mirror, leaning back to make her belly look bigger. Ann smiled and returned to her room and threw the covers over herself, falling asleep as she rubbed her bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke, Ann drew the covers, looking down at her flat stomach, looking just as it did yesterday morning. She poked at it, looking for any lingering firmness, but just as James said, it only lasted for a few hours. Ann grinned. She was excited to try it again. She got dressed and grabbed the cookies and a brownie before heading downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat flavour was the brownie?</span></div></div>",

She had looked at pictures of pregnant women online before and if she had to guess she was likely close to the size of a woman 15 weeks into a pregnancy, certainly plump but not exactly clearly pregnant at a glance. She set the baggie of macaroons on the bed beside her hip and stared at her stomach as she grabbed one and shoved it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange feeling swept over her, different from when she had eaten the cookies. She did not feel any fuller, like with the cookies, but low in her belly, where it had pushed forward and swelled up, she felt a warmth and heaviness, as though she had been filled with warm water. While her stomach did not feel full at all, her bump felt warm, full, and heavy.  She rubbed a hand over her belly through her shirt and smiled to herself. This was a much more tangible feeling than the cookies and she found herself greatly enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother macaroon followed the first quickly and each one after kept that feeling of warm fullness in her growing belly. She wasn't paying attention to how many that she was eating, but after some time, her round stomach was causing some strain on the buttons of the button-up pajamas. She grinned and slowly opened up the buttons one by one to take a look at her belly, now seeming to be closer to 32 weeks pregnant. Her belly arched out from her body, full and heavy.</span></div></div>",

Huh, I wonder, Ann thought as she looked at her stash of pilfered treats. She took out a milk cake, and quickly scarfed it down. Based on its name she had a pretty good idea what it did and she was anticipating the result. She didn\u2019t wait long as a feeling like a burp crawled up her throat but unlike a burp it never came all the way up, lingering around her chest. Looking in the mirror she watched as her breasts swelled up becoming fuller and filling out her bra more. The fullness of her breasts caused Ann smile from how good it felt. When the feeling stopped, she noticed with some disappointment that her breasts didn\u2019t get much bigger, maybe a cup, but they had become really bloated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder.\u201d Ann thought to herself grabbing another milk cake. She ate it and the feeling returned, as she suspected her breasts grew larger swelling up like balloons. She clenched her teeth as the full feeling increased. \u201cOh man, that feels incredible.\u201d Ann said dreamily as she looked at her reflection again. Her tits were huge for her size having grown to c-cups, they were perky too, the milk inside them making them full. She gently squeezed one and a they leaked, causing a wet spot on her overfilled bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so crazy!\u201d She exclaimed staring down at her chest, a thought crossed her mind and she glanced back at the milk cakes. Did she dare? With some hesitance she picked up another and scarfed it down. The result was unsurprising, but unexpected, as the feeling returned and her breasts swelled even larger, Ann groaned in pain. The fullness grew more and since her breasts were already so full it became painful. She collapsed on her bed and held her full chest, the movement causing them to leak more. When the feeling ceased, she looked down and saw her huge DD breasts. They were so bloated with milk it appeared that she had gotten implants, her breasts filled to the brim with milk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She nodded off and would have more fun tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up the next morning, Ann felt so much lighter. As she got up, she found James had not been lying she was back to her usual skinny self. No sign remained of her food baby or her milky chest. \u201cThat is so freaky.\u201d Ann said poking her breast, it and her middle still felt a little tender, but otherwise there was no sign that she had ballooned up like she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ann was eating breakfast she thought of the various treats at her bakery. So, Growth Cookies make your belly bigger, Swell Macaroons make you fuller and heavier, the Milk Cakes fill you with milk. There was still one she hadn\u2019t tried the Baby Brownies, what would those do she wondered. Returning to her room, she took a brownie and popped it in her mouth. As she waited for the brownie to take effect, she read the box. Baby Brownies use indigestion to simulate a squirming infant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does what?\u201d Ann said not believing what she was reading. To prove this point, the brownie started to take effect, causing a bubbling sensation in Ann\u2019s gut. As she felt this she focused on the feeling, when suddenly her stomach lurched like an infant doing a somersault. She tentatively raised her hand to her still flat stomach, hoping to feel that again. She was reward with a much more forceful kicking sensation, which made her recoil her hand. \u201cOh man, I don\u2019t like this, it feels really weird.\u201d As Ann regained her composure, she continued reading the box. Chocolate will have kicks and squirming, blueberry will cause more kicks, strawberry will cause more squirming, and double chocolate is more frequent kicks and squirming to simulate multiples, warning effects can last for three hours, and eating more than one with amplify the effects. \u201cThree hours!\u201d Ann cried as another lurch in her stomach made her nauseous. \u201cOh great, now I\u2019m going to have to deal with this at school.\u201d She growled in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gathered her things to take to school she thought of the delicious baked goods.</span></div></div>",

Ms Miller was quite young, as teachers go, and had quite an attractive body, which was quite distracting for the pubescent boys in her class, especially with her blonde hair done up in a tight and her spectacles giving her look of a naughty librarian, which didn\u2019t help with boys\u2019 concentration, neither did the tight blouse wore or the way she walked slowly through the desk whilst reading the text book.<br>\r\nAlice didn\u2019t have this problem though and was able to concentrate well and was able to keep up, occasionally replying to a comment from her friend Mel. Mel was of Hispanic descent and whilst not as svelte as Alice was far from chubby, she wore thick rimmed glasses quite different from Ms Miller\u2019s.<br>\r\nMs. Miller walked back up to the front of the class, her shapely hips and behind swaying hypnotically. \u201cSince we only have a few minutes left I\u2019ll give your homework,\u201d she said.<br>\r\nThe was a collective groan from many in the class room, Ms. Miller ignore this and continue by saying, \u201cYou will be each given a some pea seed, your home work is to plant one and grow it,\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis sound like an elementary school project,\u201d said Mel dismissively.<br>\r\n\u201cThis may sound like something you would do in elementary school, but you have to bring the plant in each day and during class sketch it and do a write up on which stage the plant is in its life cycle,\u201d said Ms. Miller.<br>\r\n\u201cStill sounds like a\u2026\u201d began Mel<br>\r\n\u201cBe sure to take note of any reproductive features of the plant as this is the introduction to your reproduction modal,\u201d continued Ms. Miller.<br>\r\nIt was at the point the bell rang signifying the end of the school day, \u201cI\u2019ll leave the box of seeds by the door, please collect one packet on the way out, you only need to plant one seed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems strange that they are teaching us about reproduction by start off pea, I\u2019m it\u2019s not even an animal,\u201d said Mel as she and Alice walked out of the class collecting the seed packets as they went.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what teachers are like, they think if they teach us exactly how to do \u2018it\u2019 we\u2019ll all go sex mad, so they\u2019ll just dance around the issue until we have already found out,\u201d replied Alice.<br>\r\n\u201cBut it means we\u2019ve got bring a plant to and from school each day for the next two weeks,\u201d said Mel.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you complaining you live just up the road, I\u2019ve got to catch a bus,\u201d said Alice gesturing to said bus.<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said Mel, \u201cand we don\u2019t have to bring it in on Friday because of the inter-school swimming carnival, I can\u2019t believe they are making us go to it even if we are not participating.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d said Alice as she hoped on the bus and waved goodbye to Mel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she sat down on a seat next to a kid from the next door elementary and the bus started moving, the person in the seat directly in front of her turned around and said, \u201cHey Alice.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Tim,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\nTimothy was her next door neighbour and a friend from elementary school, though they weren\u2019t in any classes together this year so they really only met on the bus.<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe they are making us watch the inter-school swimming carnival on Friday instead of class, even if we\u2019re not participating,\u201d he said pushing his sand coloured hair out of his blue eyes, they were still a bit young for being attracted members of the opposite gender, but it wouldn\u2019t be long before they would and Alice got a giddy feeling when Tim gave his corny grin.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d said Alice flicking her own hair and giving Tim his own giddy feeling.<br>\r\n\u201cEasy for you say,\u201d he replied, \u201cyou\u2019re participating, I could be skiving off in art class.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSucks to be you then,\u201d Alice joked before poking her tongue out at him.<br>\r\nTim blushed and deciding to change the topic, \u201cgot you doing pea plants as well?\u201d he said point at the seed packet poking out of Alice\u2019s bag.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, where\u2019s yours?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI did it last week,\u201d said Tim.<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see you bring you plant?\u201d said Alice in an accusatory tone.<br>\r\nTim shrugged, \u201cI just got some random plant at school, stuck it in a pot and on the last day bought a pea plant and brought it into class.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s cheating!\u201d<br>\r\nTim shrugged again, \u201cGot me a C+.\u201d<br>\r\nIt was at that point the bus arrived at their stop and the pair of them hopped off.<br>\r\nThe walked to their houses and said their farewells, \u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d said Alice.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, if you want help choosing a plant at school to so don\u2019t have to grow that pea, ask me tomorrow,\u201d he replied.<br>\r\nAlice stuck her tongue out at him again, and he turned away and walked to his place to hide his blush.</span></div></div>",

She placed it next to the house before standing back to take a look at her handiwork. The plant looked very small in its pot in the backyard, Alice thought about all the neighbourhood dogs and cats that could knock over the pot during the night. \u201cI could put it on my windowsill,\u201d she said picking up the pot, \u201cit\u2019s only a small pot plant and would only be there for a couple of weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the pot upstairs and placed it on the windowsill next to her desk. She then proceeded to work at said desk, doing the rest of the homework she had been set. She took a break for dinner and finished work a couple hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a bath and got dressed for bed making sure to leave her shirt in the basket to get washed. The school uniform was a white shirt (either a button up or polo) with school\u2019s logo on top left side, and whilst there was official school shorts and skirts students were allowed their own shorts, skirts and trousers within reason (meaning most just wore jeans). Alice had two of each shirt meaning one had to get washed during the week so she had enough.<br>\r\nShe said goodnight to her parents and went to bed, as she laid in bed waiting to fall asleep she looked at the plant pot and wondered if she should open the window so it had enough fresh air. She decided to open the window, it was well into spring after all, she crossed room and open the curtains, moonlight arced across the floor and her bed. Alice then with a bit of effort opened the window as far as it could go letting the cool air flow it the room, Alice went back to bed and shortly fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later a beam pulsating came through the open window and cover the sleeping the sleeping girl, after a few second Alice and the other items in the light\u2019s path slowly rose and drifted out the window, and up into the sky towards a dark object that was the source of the beam. Once Alice was inside the object it flew away.<br>\r\nIt was several hours later, just before dawn, did the UFO come back and returned Alice (along with all the items from her room that the aliens accidentally took and hadn\u2019t lost) before leaving, and they wouldn\u2019t return until the end of the week when they would collect what they left growing inside Alice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While her memories of what exactly had happened on the alien ship were incredibly foggy and she couldn't remember exactly what they had done to impregnate her, she knew she carried alien spawn in her young womb. They had essentially reprogrammed her mind into the state of being the perfect broodmother for their young, leaving the girl happy and pleased to have the alien litter growing within her. She propped herself up on her elbows and looked down at herself to see that her loose pajama top had grown tighter with the implantation of the large alien embryos into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice opened up the bottom half of the buttons of her pajama top and ran her hand over her rounding out midsection that had swollen out to look about 12 weeks pregnant. She pushed a finger against it, feeling it press into it a small amount before feeling the hardness underneath the soft layer of her flesh that was her packed full womb. She cooed softly to the bump, caressing it with her fingertips as the mental reprogramming gave her intense affection to her offspring (Along with other fierce desires such as that to protect her brood). She sat up and swung her legs out of bed as she heard the front door slam, telling her that her parents had just left for work and she had about an hour before the bus would come to pick her up from school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wandered over to the full length mirror against the wall, hand constantly rubbing and caressing the gentle swell of her belly that was a bit larger on her than an average pregnancy thanks to her smaller size. She turned sideways to stare at her form in the mirror, one hand touching her small and tender breasts for a moment, excited for when they would fill with milk for her 'children'. </span></div></div>",

The normally loose shirt was unable to hide the swell of her stomach from view, she found, the top remaining mostly loose aside from where her belly pressed to the fabric, not tightly held but also not hiding the swell away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she were to go to school like this then questions would be asked about the swelling. She couldn't have anyone finding out about the brood nestled inside her so, she took her polo off and grabbed a tank top from the dresser, putting it on instead. The stretchy fabric clung to her form accentuating the curve of her belly that Alice was quickly growing to absolutely love the shape of. She left on the pajama pants that were pushed down a bit in front by her bump and wandered out of her room and down the stairs to get her brood some breakfast.</span></div></div>",

She pulled the half of a watermelon that was in the fridge out and looked the fruit over before grabbing a spoon and digging into it. It didn't take her long to hollow out the half of a melon, scarfing down all of the red fruit inside. Once she had finished that her stomach was still groaning and churning, wanting more inside it. It didn't even register to her that she was eating the rind of the fruit until she had swallowed the last part of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust minutes later she found herself stuffing handfuls of cereal in her mouth with alternating swigs from a jug of milk. The box was completely gone not long after, the milk following down her throat just as quickly. When the groaning of her stomach was finally quelled she cleaned her mess up and wandered back up to her room. Her stomach ached, packed full of everything that she had eaten, far far more than she could normally get down in one sitting. She rubbed a hand over her middle as she plodded over to her bed and flopped down into it. It was easy to doze off with a belly full of food and the energy that her strange pregnancy was taking from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alice awoke again it had only been an hour. Her tank top was tighter and upon going over to the mirror and looking herself over she was surprised to see that her brood had grown, filling her womb more, causing her belly to swell out like a woman 22 weeks pregnant.</span></div></div>",

I only just fed you all.\" She giggled as she held her belly with both hands. \"You'll be mighty large and out of me mighty quick if you keep me eating so much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her tone was teasing, Alice relented to the demands of the brood tucked away inside her and made her way downstairs again to poke around for something else to eat. She explored the fridge and the cabinets for a while before managing to find a few containers of leftover pasta from the last handful of nights. She didn't even bother heating it up and instead plopped down on the floor, leaned back on the cabinets to dig in.

Mel concernedly checked on Alice while Kate and her friends laughed at Alice, \u201cIf that\u2019s the kind of conversation we\u2019re going to get here I say we head elsewhere,\u201d and with that Kate dramatically turned and walked away.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d asked Mel.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m just hung\u2019ugh\u2019ry,\u201d said Alice wincing as another pang of ravenous hunger hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair found a bench to sit down on and they took out their lunch boxes, Alice had an apple, and a sandwich packed for later, while Mel had two sandwiches. Mel watched with alarm as Alice devoured her packed lunch, \u201cYou\u2019re not meant to eat the core,\u201d she said as Alice ate every part of the apple before jamming the entirety of the sandwich into her mouth at once. Once she had finished her own food, Alice snatched the half-eaten sandwich from her friend\u2019s hands, \u201cHey, that\u2019s mine and it has mayo on it, you hate mayo,\u201d said Mel but Alice didn\u2019t seem to be hearing her. <br>\r\nIt was true that Alice didn\u2019t like mayo and part of brained gagged in revulsion at the taste of the sandwich in her mouth but it was overruled by the alien influence in her brain that demanded she eat and as much as possible, with this Alice then snatched the remaining sandwich from Mel\u2019s lunch box. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d asked Mel as Alice stuffed the sandwich into her mouth without bothering to take off the plastic wrapping. After eating both of their lunches within a minute Alice let the empty lunch boxes dropped to the ground as she stood up and ran off leaving Mel sitting by herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice tore around the school grabbing bags, stripping them of food and stuffing what she found into her mouth. Despite several eyewitnesses complaining later the staff decided to blame it on foxes as the amount of food eaten was far too much to consumed by any person in one sitting little lone a 14-year-old girl. It was more than anyone person could eat, Alice had taken the lunch of over thirty students during recess, as she ate more and more Alice started feeling a new pain in her stomach that of a stomach ache as her body tried to contain the amount of food she was eating. This pain was initially overruled her insatiable hunger but as she ate the pain grew worse and worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes before the end of recess Alice, now somewhat in control of herself stumbled into one of the rest rooms, moaning as she clutched her swollen stomach feeling like she was about to explode. She went into one of the cubicles ready to throw up, but she couldn\u2019t. Her body was sending messages saying that she eaten to much food and was fit to burst but it refused to give any of it up. Alice knelt there until the unbearable pain in her belly became a dull throb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to exit the cubicle when she heard someone outside, it was Kate. Alice couldn\u2019t let Kate or friends see her like this (or anyone else for that matter), Alice couldn\u2019t get a clear view of how big her stomach was but it was obviously swollen. She didn\u2019t know how long Kate and her friends were there beforehand but it was clear they didn\u2019t know that Alice was in here, or that it was Alice at the very least. Alice waited as Kate and her entourage finished what they came in to do (fix their hair and makeup by sounds of it) while Kate boasted about her rich, well connected parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kate and her hangers-on had left the rest room Alice open the cubicle door and check to see if the bathroom was clear. It was and Alice stepped out of the cubicle, and examined herself in the mirror. Whilst it still covered her Alice\u2019s shirt couldn\u2019t hide the shape of her belly which was a definite curve bulging out from Alice\u2019s body. She peeled up the material to take look at her stomach and shuddered when it became apparent that the belly was all her, taut skin and flattened belly button making her look 20 weeks pregnant. She gingerly prodded her swollen middle with a finger and winced both from the conformation that it was real and the pain of her already tight gut being poked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door suddenly open, Alice\u2019s first thought was to hide but there was not enough time. She saw that the person entering the rest room was Mel, who upon spotting Alice started saying, \u201cAlice there you are, what is going on with y\u2026\u201d she fell silent as she saw the bulge of Alice\u2019s bare belly still visible. There was moment of brief silence which was broken by Mel asking, \u201cIs that real?\u201d she said reaching out a hand to touch her friend\u2019s swollen stomach.<br>\r\nAlice instinctively stepped back subconsciously moving her hands protectively over her belly and its contents, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d continued Mel.<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d exclaimed Alice imminently, \u201cI\u2026Well\u2026Just,\u201d she stuttered, \u201cever since this morning I have been really hungry and just kept eating and now,\u201d she gestured to the curve of her belly.<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to see the school nurse,\u201d said Mel.<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d said Alice much louder and more urgently than she intended. The alien embryos currently growing inside her were making many changes to Alice. Her 14-year-old body was being flooded with a variety of hormones many of which were alien in chemical makeup. One of these was giving strong desire to protect her unborn brood, Alice didn\u2019t know what she was carrying inside her or what was happening to body but she had a strong desire to protect her\u2026'belly\u2019 from threatened.<br>\r\nMel was taken aback by her friend\u2019s sudden response, \u201cNo?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t science class about to start?\u201d said Alice.<br>\r\n\u201cWell yes, but what about you?\u201d asked Mel.<br>\r\nAlice decided to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She only had a few minutes before class would be out and she could start her weekend. It was to be another training weekend for her. She had been going through her training and had become used to the sensation of carrying a pregnancy on the 3 day course but now she would be doing her first nine hour pregnancies. There would be 3 this weekend. One tonight, one on Saturday, and one on Sunday. It was going to be a rather intensive training session but she was excited about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was lucky that her father's connections had gotten them use of synthetic pregnancy serums. A simple injection and her body would go through an entire pregnancy on its own but at the birth the child would be simply made of a jelly-like substance that would remain firm until it had been out of her body a few minutes and then could simply be tossed out. Only official matches resulted in a living child and those would be given to pre-determined parents after everything was all said and done. At least this way Nina could practice carrying a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe practice had left its mark on her body. After her fist pregnancy her hips had widened, leading to a need for her to get a new wardrobe. Her once barely-there breasts had filled with milk and now were a little on the ample side for a girl her age. Part of the image of being a mother was good milk production though so she didn't mind the need that she had to pump them in the morning and before bed to keep the milk pressure from building up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the tone of the end of day bell Nina jumped up and hurried off to her locker to gather her things up so she could leave for home. The eighth grader packed her bag with practiced ease and trotted out the doors to the car where her father was waiting for her. A silver box with a small hole in it was waiting on the front seat for her. Nina picked it up and buckled in, holding it in her lap. She stuffed her finger in the hole and felt a small prick of a needle. There was a whirring noise, a second prick, and finally a cheery beep to let her know the serum was properly in her body. She pulled her finger out and turned to put the box in the backseat. It would take only a few moments for the serum to travel her body and the pregnancy to begin, from there it was only nine hours until she was ready to begin her labor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the next big step in your training, Nina.\" Her father said, not taking his eyes off the road. \"You're finally preparing for your league. You'll be my shining star the second you're ready to go on the team if your keep up like this. Most girls don't do rapid league until they've actually played long league for a year. Are you excited?\"</span></div></div>",

You could always run a little over too, though. You should be getting about one week of growth every fifteen minutes so you're going to balloon up a lot quicker than you're used to.

We can't have you stretching out another one of your school uniforms.\" Nina nodded at what she was told and bent over to pull the book she was meant to read for her literature class out of her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever they were in a training session, whether it be over the course of a three day weekend, a school break, or summer vacation, Nina's father took her to their cabin out in the country. It was surrounded by woods and secluded enough that they wouldn't shock anyone with the sight of a pregnant 13 year old so she would be free to go outside and relax a little. Not to mention they wouldn't wake anyone when she went into labor that night if she were to make any noise. It was a good 2 hours to drive there though so she would be able to get through a small chunk of her homework before they arrived. </span></div></div>",

By the time they pulled up to the cabin, Nina was squirming in her seat as the waistband of her uniform skirt was digging into her skin thanks to her now three month pregnant form. She got out of the car and dashed inside as soon as the door of the cabin was unlocked. She slipped into her bedroom and unzipped the skirt, letting out a sigh of relief as she rubbed a hand over her now rather plump midsection. She slipped off her button up and blazer as well before putting on a pair of sweatpants with a nice stretchy waistband and a tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tank top was form fitting and would only ride up on her belly as he pregnancy progressed but Nina liked the feeling that she was overfilling her clothing and popping out of them. The tank top's nice stretchable material was perfect for this and the growth wouldn't ruin any clothes this way. She wandered out of her room and dug in the duffel bag of things that had been brought from home to grab her pump. She milked herself to keep the pressure from building up and simply poured the milk out as she didn't have any child to feed it to. Her father was coming out of his own room as she finished pouring it out, having finished putting his own things away for the weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming along very nicely.\" he hummed as he knelt down and rolled Nina's shirt up, pressing his fingers lightly to the swell of her midsection. \"Your body is certainly handling the rapid growth speed like it should.

I'm hitting the second trimester stride, I think.\" Nina stroked a hand over her stomach with a grin. \"Just look at how big I'm already getting.\" She chirped, giving her stomach a firm pat as she glanced at the clock, noting that she had progressed another half a month since arriving at the cabin, her belly standing at three and a half months of growth.</span></div></div>",

Milk began to wet her bra, startling her. \"A-ah! Why does it feel so weird!?\" she cried, pulling her bra out from under her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look on the bright side, Sammy!\" Ellie laughed from behind her puny 3 month one baby belly, ticking Sam off even more than Ellie's use of the childish nickname. \"It looks like your turn's over, and you've only got triplets!

Once it stopped rolling, the two of them felt instantly better. Last turn's effect had worn off, and they  both breathed a sigh of relief. Ellie took off her hoodie and threw it on the bed. If something was going to happen to her, she wanted to see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at where the die had landed she said, \"Ooh, a six...\", with a hint of smugness in her voice.

Before, they were just a little chubbier around their midsection. Now, their tummies were getting a rounded paunch, and the tank top that had accentuated Ellie's slimness that afternoon was starting to betray her, slipping up to her bellybutton and leaving nothing underneath to the imagination. She prodded it with her finger, finding that it still had some give, but that there was a foreign firmness in its core. Sam was at that moment finding the same thing. Her belly was still largely concealed by her shirt, but it wouldn't stay that way for much longer than a turn or two more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point they're almost a third of the way through the second trimester zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked between her belly and that of her friend's. Sam's middle had now rounded out, the skin looking to be a smooth spherical curve. A dark brownish line ran from her belly button down into her parts, and a lighter line ran from her belly button up to her chest.  Speaking of her belly button, it had popped out now. It had gone from its usual innie state and had popped out from the increased pressure, protruding almost half an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam rubbed her belly with both hands. \"Ugghhhh, I feel so fuuuulll...\" She could barely sit cross-legged at this point.

Sam's jeans were starting to get strained, and since she unbuttoned them earlier, the zipper had come the rest of the way undone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie squeezed one of her chubby hips. \"This is gonna be such a pain to work off.\", she complained. She worked herself onto one knee, then to standing, and waddled to her mirror. Ellie ran her hands down her bulging baby bump, turning to see how she looked from the side. \"Geez, I look so big...\" Her tank top had long since rolled up and didn't cover an inch of her belly. She poked at her belly button, shivering a little at how it felt. It was pretty sensitive... She looked down at the card she drew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting bigger, it's what you'd expect,<br>\r\nbut now you're going to get a little more wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chest increases in size, and you begin <br>\r\nlactating if you haven't already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tank slid a little higher, bulging out as her chest grew half a cup size more than its already swollen state. Just a few moments afterwards, Ellie felt a tingling, and two blotches appeared, milk leaking into the fabric. She squeezed her chest, and a white spurt dripped down her front on each side. \"Hey, can we take a break?\", Ellie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, could use one.\", Sam scooched back and leaned on the bed to help her stand up. When she did stand, her belly slumped down, putting extra pressure on her bladder. \"Oh boy, these two feel like they're gonna fall out.\", she joked. \"I gotta get to the bathroom.\" She waddled past Ellie and out into the hall, disappearing into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the weight of her child on her frame for the first time, Ellie would have to agree. She slowly began to descend the stairs one at a time, leaning on the railing for support. When she did make it to the bathroom, she didn't have much time to spare. It was surreal, being completely normal earlier that day, and now having to spread her legs wide just to accommodate her belly when she sat down... It was then that she felt movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie gasped, and watched as a bump appeared on the surface of her skin. She quickly finished and left, calling for Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here.\", came the reply, and Ellie followed it into the kitchen. \"I was just making something to eat. I'm starving!\", Sam just finished cutting a sandwich and putting it on a plate, piled high with chips. She passed the plate to Ellie. \"There's a glass of juice for you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that, Sam! I felt it moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\", smirked Sam. \"Me too.\", she nodded her head towards her belly, and Ellie saw that every so often, a bump appeared from a kick. Without giving it much thought, she put a hand on Sam's stomach, feeling the twins squirming inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, even if this is a little scary... I'm kind of into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say that after you're carrying twins... and after birth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat dampened the mode a little, both of them fearing how it would feel, but somewhat encouraged by the idea that a magical pregnancy would probably reduce some of the pain. They returned upstairs with sandwiches and juice in hand, and on the way Ellie noticed Sam wasn't wearing her jeans. \"Yeah, they were getting a little tight so I left 'em in the bathroom.\", she snapped the waistband of her panties. \"You've got it easy with sweatpants.\" The two of them sat back down by the board game and started munching their snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn, right Sam?\"</span></div></div>",

Sam reached for her piece over her gravid belly, and tapped it across the third trimester line until she landed on Ellie's space. \"Boy...twins sure make you grow faster...\" Despite being at the same time in development, about seven or eight months, Sam looked like she was full term. She put both hands on either side of her belly. \"They're sitting right against my cervix, El.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\", Ellie asked, only half paying attention. She was rubbing the brown line that separated her belly in two, and flicking her outtie bellybutton playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Earth to Ellie. Another card. Could you pass it? I'm a little far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie nodded, pushing the pile so it was more between them, rather than on her side. Sam closed her eyes and drew the blue card from the top of the stack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid, this won't hurt.<br>\r\nAll mommies get a little growth spurt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll players' hips increase and move forward 2 spaces\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them both held their legs, feeling as their hips widened, giving more space between their legs for their babies' eventual delivery. At this point, Ellie decided to join Sam. She stood up with a grunt, undid the drawsting of her sweatpants and slipped them down under her now-cushy butt. She stepped out of them and kicked them in the direction of her closet, all the while clutching her belly. \"God I'm so fat...at least that card was pretty tame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't fat~\", Sam reassured her. \"You're... fertile!\", and she grinned, and moved her piece the required two spaces, leaning back as her womb bloated another half an inch, filling up with more amniotic fluid and baby, the twins rushing to take up space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie stuck out her tongue. \"Who's fertile now?\", and she moved her piece forward with her toe, tipping forward a little as the extra weight was added to her middle while she was standing up. She sat back down again with a thump, her chest bouncing and spurting a little more milk. It had been quietly seeping since last turn, and dark lines of wetness ran all the way down her tank top. \"Me, I guess.\", and the two of them laughed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were quiet for a moment, patting their tummies as the babies inside kicked and wiggled in return. There was an occasional \"oof\" or \"oww\" as they kicked at more tender spots, but for the most part it was fun.  \"You know...\", Ellie said, \"I was kinda freaked out at first\", she looked to Sam, \"and I still kind of am... But this feels pretty nice.\" She uncrossed her legs, spreading them out to give her belly room, even if it did still rest on her thighs a little. \"I might be tempted to play again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey El, let's just get through this game and see if you wanna play again, okay?\", Sam rocked onto her side and picked up the dice, blushing, \"...but I might want to join you if you do...Your turn.\"</span></div></div>",

She pulled at the neckline of her stretched tank top at her breasts, already outgrowing and slipping out of her bra. They had grown a little bigger over the last few turns, getting more firm, and the nipples discoloring to match that of the line running down her belly. She moved the dice Sam's way. \"How's your chest doing?\", she asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam picked up the die and felt her chest. Things were getting tight, but she could still use her bra, even if it was starting to slip downwards. \"Not bad. Wondering if the two of them'll have enough to eat.\", she smiled and patted her belly, shirt rolling up suddenly to her chest. She blushed and pulled it back down, hooking it on her belly button. It held for a moment, stretching tight over her skin, but it scrunched back almost immediately. Seems that it would no longer hold the growth of two squirming kicking babies AND a growing chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shook the dice in her hand and took a drink. \"C'mon three...\", and she let go, watching as it clattered to the board and showed four pips. Ellie stuck her tongue out teasingly, and Sam grinned back in reply. She moved her piece to land one ahead of Ellie, and within a few turns of the end of the third trimester. Her belly was growing more rapidly than ever, visibly expanding out with each square passed. Sam groaned lightly as each growth occurred, and when she finished she was looking a little overdue. Her womb was stuffed so full of her unborn children that she leaned forward even when sitting, resting her hands on top. There was a shininess to it, light reflecting off the taut, smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a pink card from the top of the deck and read it to herself, then read it again. \"Hmmm...\", she mumbled, and grinned as she looked to Ellie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move too fast and your water may break,<br>\r\nchoose a player to whom this card takes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoose one player to move straight to the<br>\r\nBirth Star.

What the heck?\" She cried out. Groaning as she grew bigger and bigger all around her body as she moved her piece down the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, sorry Ellie, I just needed a breather after all of that growth.\" Sam replied, shrugging as her friend glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well jokes on you because at this point even though I'm on the birth star you're still bigger than me!\" Ellie pointed out, sticking her tongue out at Sam in mockery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of the birth star, Sam shifted in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey El?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Sam?\" Ellie frowned as she heard the concern in her friend's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That space on the board won't actually make you give birth will it?\" Sam inquired with a nervous look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I don't think so,\" Ellie chuckled, shaking her head in dismissal, \"whatever this magic stuff mimicking a pregnancy is will probably go away her in a few minutes I'm sure and...\" Ellie suddenly froze midsentence as her eyes widened as if suddenly realizing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...Ellie?\" Sam asked anxiously, noting her friend's sudden silence. \"Are you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam,\" Ellie suddenly interrupted, her voice eerily calm, \"I think I might have been wrong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Sam questioned, her friend's distant stare beginning to terrify her. Instead of answering her friend however, Ellie simply heaved herself upright, revealing that the bottom half of her was now damp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My water broke...\" Ellie finished, clutching her belly tightly as she looked down in horror before looking back up to meet her friend's equally terrified visage. \"Sam I think we should- Ahhhaaa!\" Ellie cried out and doubled over in pain as she felt what could only be a contraction hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie!\" Sam cried out, hoisting herself upright and moving to her friends side of the table as fast as she could before placing a hand on her back in support. \"Come on now deep breaths...just hang on we have to get you to a hospital!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no time!\" Ellie shakily whispered, \"I can- Ahghhh- I can feel it coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how are we going to deliver your baby Ellie?!?\" Sam yelled, \"I don't know anything on it and I might go into labor too at this rate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not s-sure...\" Ellie grunted, \"there has t-to...oh god...has to be...a way!\" Ellie opened her mouth to speak, before suddenly vanishing from Sam's vision entirely, leaving the twin-laden girl alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie? Ellie!!!\" Sam screamed, desperately looking around for her friend but finding no trace of her existence in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a card that looked identical to the mama cards appeared in front of Sam face down. She hesitantly took the card before turning it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations! One or more players have currently been transferred to the delivery room in order to bring their newborn(s) into the world! The affected players will be gone for a minimum of two turns, with an extra turn for each baby past a single delivery. Make sure to congratulate them on their bundle(s) of joy once they return!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief wasged over Sam as she finished reading the card. \"Well at least that means Ellie is safe and sound.\" She muttered to herself. Guess I'm going solo for a couple of turns then...\" Sighing, Sam put the card down and picked the dice back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next two turns...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Settle down!\" The mother to be groaned as she reluctantly picked up the dice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her suprise, she ended up rolling another six. Sam sighed in frustration as she moved her piece once again, growing and growing even larger, her belly making her sit further and further from the table's edge until she found herself placed on a very familiar space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The birth star...\" She muttered, \"well...I guess after throwing Ellie under the bus like that I guess my turn had to come eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing for the pain she knew was coming, Sam gritted her teeth. However, after a minute or so of silence, she unclenched her jaw and looked around in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I could have sworn something should have happened like it did for Ellie, maybe I have to wait for her to get back?\" She wondered. However, just as Sam contemplated getting up and taking another turn, she felt something akin to a balloon popping within her, followed by a wet feeling coming from her lower torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess not...\" Sam sighed as she knew her water broke, \"which means that -Ooohhh...oh god\" Sam fell back into her chair as a sharp pain emitted from her lower abdomen, and her children kicked even more furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't feel great at all...\" Sam groaned, before an especially strong contraction hit her and almost made her scream aloud in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow crying, Sam wiped away her tears and tried to stand, but could only whimper and rub her belly as the pain refused to subside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just before she thought she reached her limit, she was engulfed in a flash of light and felt her vision start to swim and lose focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments Sam found that she was no longer at rhe table playing the game, but rather lying down on what seemed to be a hospital bed. Looking around, she noticed that the hospital had set her up quite nicely, and was already monitoring her heart rate and vital signs even though she'd just arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you must be Sam!\" A voice called out, which made the girl look around feverishly at the source of the voice, only to find that there was no one other than herself present in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?\" Sam asked fearfully, biting her lip as she tried to ignore another incoming contraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"I am the entity in charge of enforcing the rules of the birth star!\" It replied calmly, making Sam relax a little bit as she firgured that without anyone present the voice couldn't really harm her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do to me?\" Sam asked after a few moments of contemplation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am merely here to make sure that the birth of your twins goes as planned, and that in the alloted time you and your children will be returned from whence you came!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie?\" The voice finished, \" worry not, your friend has already delivered her child and is now back in your realm to take her alotted three turns of play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she's safe then...good\" Sam sighed in relief, lying back in her bed before another jolt of pain nearly made her sit upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My your children seem eager to come out!\" The voice chuckled, \"in that case let us begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Ell, I hope mine will go as smooth as yours...\" Sam muttered before she began to push.<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\nBack at the house, Ellie found herself seated at the table once more, but this time with a much flatter belly and a child attached to left breast, feeding on the milk that her mother had produced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man that was awful...\" Ellie groaned, before smiling down at her daughter, \"though I guess it wasn't too bad if it gave me a cutie like you!\" After cooing at her daughter affectionately, she looked around and noticed something out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did Sam go? Don't tell me she bailed on me...\" Ellie frowned before noticing a card in front of her. It turned out to be exactly the same message that Sam had read when Ellie had been carted off to the delivery space. After reading the card, Ellie had noticed that Sam had indeed made it to the Birth Star as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...serves her right after making me go first...\" Ellie smirked, \"though I guess since she had twins she will be out for three turns...\"Noticing that in front of her piece was five red spaces followed by the end of the game, Ellie cautiously picked up the dice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, here goes nothing...\" Ellie muttered, before throwing the dice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter bouncing around for a few moments, the dice finally landed on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rolling her eyes, she picked it up with her free hand and began to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Mama wasn't careful enough and got herself pregnant again, or maybe it her plan? Either way, your body's inner fertility seemed to have been awakened this time around, as you've been blessed with quintiplets as you move back to the first trimester!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie paled as she read the latter half of the card. Her hand shaking as she finally finished reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-five more?\" She whimpered, before feeling a curious sensation within her. It felt miniscule, as though five very small things had taken root inside of her, and as she looked back to the board, she gawked in disbelief as her piece had moved itself back to the beginning of the first trimester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing as she knew there was no other way to continue, she looked down to her daughter and addressed her, \"Well, it looks like you'll be getting some siblings soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling the dice once more, she found that she rolled a five, which luckily was a normal tile with no cards or effects with it. However, Ellie had noticed that even though she was only five spaces into the board, she had already begun to grow a bump. It was almost unnoticeable, but it was something Ellie had been sure was different from last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, if I'm already starting to show again at five spaces...\" She whimpered in terror, \"how big will I be at the third trimester...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Ellie picked up the dice once more, and had ended up with a three this time, putting her on a space that let her draw her first mama card of the run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be an easy one...\" She groaned, feeling her belly jut out ever so slightly as she picked up the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My how time flies when your pregnancy is fun! Move to the end of the first trimester and keep up that energy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie barely had time to react before her piece moved itself to the end of the first trimester. Three seconds later Ellie found her belly growing much more rapidly than it had previously, and along with it her breasts enlarged considerably, presumably to feed the litter that Ellie had growing inside of her at this point. Her hips also widened to comical proportions, and if her belly hadn't been there they would have given her an almost perfect hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is ridiculous!\" Ellie panted, the growth leaving her exhausted, \"I'm already almost as big as I was before I gave birth!\" She sighed, before looking down at her daughter, who seemed content to keep on feeding from her now much larger breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take too much now,\" Ellie chided, \"your brothers and sisters will defintely want some when they get out and I do not plan to have more than six of you all today!\" As expected, her daughter gave no response, and so Ellie merely shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before she could pick up the dice, a flash of light shone from the other side of the table, and once it had faded revealed none other than her friend Sam, though now much smaller in the belly department and with her two twins fedding from each of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Sam blanched, \"that was the most painful thing I've ever done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam.\" Ellie dryly muttered, in no mood to be addressed due to her current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie! You're safe! And...pregnant again? How did you get back to the third trimester like that?\" Sam gestured with a nod of her head towards Ellie's newly engorged abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not at the third trimester...\" Ellie sighed weakly, before pointing to her piece on the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Sam bobbled with her words as she saw where Ellie was in relation to her size. \"How many-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five,\" Ellie grunted, \" just don't roll a five from where you are and you'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok...\" Sam replied, still shaken by the turn of events.

There was a large pair of overalls with a t shirt, a frilly baby blue dress that looks to have a lot of space for a belly, and a comfy looking T-shirt and sweatpants pair. </span></div></div>",

She pressed her hand s to her stomach and brightened up when she felt something inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first there was a slight weight low in her but then she felt her hands being pushed apart as her belly started started to swell and round outwards. It didn\u2019t stop until she looked slightly overdue, her breasts filling her bra a bit more and becoming heavy with milk. The shirt strained over her heavy and full middle. Nancy ran a hand over it as there was movement inside and groaned softly. This must be clothing meant for a woman who was about to give birth. She could feel the head of a child pressing heavily down into her pelvis, causing a slight ache and making her stand a bit differently. She puffed out a breath and looked in the mirror at the 15 year old girl before her who looked ready to have her water break at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel the pregnancy straining on her and she stumbled back to sink into the bench in the changing room, sinking down onto it with a groan.

She slipped out of the clothing and put on her regular clothes only to be able to dart out of the changing room. She came back a moment later with a maternity bra and panty set. She changed into those, grinning when her hips and bust adjusted to them, feeling her chest get heavy with milk before her shirt was even back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips adjusted again with the addition of the sweatpants and her belly swelled heavy and round when the shirt was added back on. She huffed at the weight and rubbed her hands over her middle with a grin as she finished swelling and the child within her settled low in her pelvis again, clearly indicating this was clothing for women who were mere days from giving birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuffed her old clothing into her backpack with a smirk. She looked the part of a pregnant teen. There was nothing that they could say to her about leaving. She ripped the tags of the clothing off and tossed them on the changing room floor before she put her backpack on and waddled out of the changing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until she was actively moving that she began to really feel the weight of her pregnancy, propping her hands int eh small of her back to offset the heavy weight while she ambled towards the front of the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was shocked that she made it out of the place without running into a single member of the staff, if she was being honest. She didn't know however, that the changes to her body became solidly real and permanent the moment she had set foot out the door. She now really was a pregnant teen, due to give birth any day to the child that filled her womb. Nancy rubbed a hand over her belly, none the wiser to the way her life had changed forever with one single trip to the mall as she wondered what to do now.</span></div></div>",

Her parents came to the bazaar to look for things for the baby. Well babies technically. Hannah's mother specialized in surrogacy and was pregnant with twin girls. Hannah grew jealous of her mother. She knew she was young but that didn't stop the urges of wanting to be pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah browsed through various vendors until she stopped at a booth. She eyed a bracelet that was locked away in a case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how much for the bracelet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seller walks over. \"Oh! $10 for thing such as this,\" he says in broken english. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"$10 huh? I'll take it.\" Hannah hands the money over to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful with this, bracelet is magic. Wearer will be big in the belly with babies.\" He hands it over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic isn't real.\" She scoffs and walks to another booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The seller watches her. \"Always the non-belivers.\" He shakes his head and disappears as if he was never there, booth and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 15 year old walks around. \"It's really pretty for a bracelet.\" She moves her wrist around to show off the piece of jewelry. \"Ugh!\" She thinks back on what the man said. \"Might as well test this thing out.\" She walks around looking for a pregnant woman. After a while, she does! The woman had a decent sized belly that was too big on her. Hannah points the bracelet at the woman. To her amazement, the woman's belly begins to shrink. \"What the-?\" Then Hannah feels a gurgle and a feeling of nausea wells up in her. \"Urgh! Now is not the time to get sick!\" Unknown to her, her flat stomach swells up to the woman's size. It wasn't until her belly was big that Hannah looks down. A round mound sticks out in front of her. \"Oh god! It really worked!\" In her mind, she could sense the genders of the babies and who their parents where. Hannah was carrying twin boys who's mother was young. Their father was their mother's older husband and the boys have some siblings already. \"Hey guys.\" A kick greets her. \"Want me to take you back to your mommy?\" Hannah's back was hurting and her breasts swelled uncomfortably against her bra. She could feel a baby right near her cevix, as if he was ready to be born. Maybe she could take a pregnancy where the babies aren't full developed. \"Come on then.\" She starts looking for the babies' mother.</span></div></div>",

Finally, Hannah spots her. She points the bracelet at the woman and her belly grows while Hannah's shrinks. The blond breathes a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I don't have all that weight in front!\" She goes looking for her parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she's looking for them, Hannah thinks of various ways to test the bracelet out. One of her cousins is in the early stages with triplets and an aunt is having a girl. There were probably more women in her family that were pregnant that she didn't know about. Luckily for Hannah, there was a family reunion that weekend for her to test it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finds her parents. Her dad sees her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah Banana!\" She groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy! You know I don't like that nickname!\" What if one of her classmates heard? Or worse, what if Kyle heard? She would never hear the end if it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles. \"Sorry honey, you know I like to call you that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark!\" Hannah tears her eyes away from her dad.

Take it easy, you are carrying precious cargo.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that both of my girls are here, let's go home and get ready for the family reunion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom groans. \"Really? I don't want to deal with anyone right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say hello then go back to our room.\" Her dad was smiling but it seemed a bit forced. \"I can't wait until this pregnancy is over.\" They head time in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day of the reunion came. Hannah was wearing a skirt paired with a sweater. Under the skirt was stockings, on her feet was her favorite pair of lace boots that had leg warmers under it. True to her word, Taylor said hello and went back to the room. The rest of Hannah's family was seated at the long table Mark pulled out. She looked around. Baby fever must have been in the air a few weeks ago because she could see swollen bellies on almost every cousin and young aunt she had. Of course some of those bellies were still in the early stages. Most of her aunts were having one baby while her cousins were pregnant with multiples. Hannah itched to try her bracelet out. Where to go first?</span></div></div>",

Hannah's favorite cousin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate was wearing a button up dress. As Hannah got closer, she couldn't believe her eyes. Under the fabric, she could see the tiny swell of a belly.

It would be better to have him feeding through an umbilical cord than from her breast. She widened her legs again and blindly lowered Jumbo between them, carefully pressing him into her waiting entrance. She could no longer see over her belly so it was a bit of a long shot about getting him inside but she managed and soon felt him moving into her ever more heavy womb. She sighed at the feeling of fullness it gave her as she picked up the last pup and held him to her other breast as his sister drank greedily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to think I was only going to take one of you little guys a day.\" She told them as she carefully got up, leaning on on the wall to steady herself a bit as her heavy womb settled a bit more into her pelvis.

Two pups nursed at her ample chest that was at least a cup size larger than before while under them stuck out a belly on the verge bursting at what looked to be full term.

Or too much partying. Had she snuck out to a party, last night? But as she finished heaving over the toilet, everything started coming back to her. Her hands flew down to her stomach. But... but it was perfectly normal, trim and flat. No bump. No baby. Had it all been just a weird dream?</span></div></div>",

She had put her half-sister inside her, she had carried out her plan. So where was the kid now? Macy checked all around the room.

It was flat. There was just the normal little hint of her abs. Nothing more. How had this happened? It wasn't supposed to go this way. She had thought the baby would just... stay the same size. It wasn't supposed to shrink down. She didn't even look pregnant. How was she supposed to pull this stupid plan off now?</span></div></div>",

She looked down at her stomach, and felt... just a little trace of anxiety. Somehow, this didn't seem very real. She didn't look different, she didn't feel different. And yet, the thought of carrying a baby, of it really growing inside her for a long time, seemed a lot more serious than just keeping it for a little while. This was her father's child. And her stepmom's, she reminded herself. And now it was tucked away in her womb, getting ready to start developing. How weird. </span></div></div>",

Her heart began to beat faster. In a moment, just a moment, the child would be inside her. She would be pregnant again. He was a bigger baby than her half sister had been, and it was a slow process. It hurt a little, a kind of burning too-tightness, like she might split right in half. But at last the head touched her cervix, and Macy took a deep breath and pushed hard and slow until the baby began to slip up inside her womb. She watched her belly this time. It rippled, bulging first a little bit as the head popped in. The shoulders were harder. She strained again, and gave a little shout of discomfort, but then it was done. The child slid completely inside her. It thrashed and shifted, and Macy rolled forward with her hands over her stretched middle, gasping as she felt fluid rush into her womb to cushion its new passenger.</span></div></div>",

Hiking the folds up under her fatter, heavier boobs, Macy spread her legs wide open. \"You're already all round,\" Lucile commented, making Macy blush. Her cousin's hand pressed down over her stomach. Really pressed, until she must have felt what Macy had felt before, the startling firmness of her pseudo-fertilized womb, just beginning to be detectable low down in her middle. \"You're going to be totally huge. Oh well. Here it goes...\"</span></div></div>",

She should stop it, she ought to scream no way to all of this and stand up and not do it at all. But instead she lay still, terrified by what was coming, so excited she could barely breathe because of what was coming. She closed her eyes. Felt fingers spread her wide, and then draw away. For a moment there was nothing, only shivering waiting before this Really Bad Idea became something she couldn't undo. And then there was a warm contact between her legs. She gasped, as her cousin began to push the baby inside of her. She put her hands down over her belly. She could feel it from the outside. The sudden hard bulge working its way slowly, very slowly up inside of her. It was another big baby. Its mass stretched her body achingly taut. Just an inch at a time, and she could feel the weight of it both in her belly and stretching her abdomen up under her hands bit by bit. By the time she felt its head touch her cervix, she was jerking both her legs, trying to get them spread even farther apart, desperate to relieve the mounting pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, it's too much...\" she began, and broke off with a startled yowl as Lucile suddenly bore down harder, forcing the child's head to pop through into her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Macy panicked. The panic was overwhelming. This was her very last chance to get out of this, before it was too late. She shouldn't do it. Whose baby was this, anyway? She didn't even know. This whole thing was one big terrible decision, and she ought to be looking for a way to get out of it, not make it worse. How could she not want it, and really-really want it, so much at the same time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't!\" she gasped. At the very same time that Lucile pushed really hard, there was an intense pain of stretching, and the baby's broad shoulders penetrated her cervix. The rest of it slipped inside of her uterus all at once, drawn in by a startled clenching of her muscles, and Macy felt her womb seal tight shut behind its new passenger. A few moments later there was that other feeling, the sudden rush of fluid. And then Macy was heavily, heavily full with child.</span></div></div>",

Hey bellybutton was even sticking out, a hard round knot that she could just barely reach with her palm. The child thrashed and kicked inside her, then settled down. It was done. She had made the mistake, and there was no getting out of it now. The passage the child had come through still ached from the ordeal. But the baby itself was snugly inside her. With, she remembered, its two siblings. Lucile had crawled up to lie right beside her. She was rubbing a hand over Macy's swollen stomach, staring at it in mischievous wonder. \"Wow. If this is how big it is now, what will it be like when they're all developed together?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw... you...\" Macy gasped, right before she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile was still lying there when she woke up. As Macy stirred back to consciousness, her cousin did too. She touched Macy's belly again. The gigantic mound was gone, just like the last two times. But unlike the last two times, a little firm bulge remained. A pregnancy that was just beginning to be really obvious. \"If this all started with the first time...\" Lucile said. \"Then you're probably like, three months along? Four? I don't know. But there's three babies in you, and you've got this skinny little body. So it's already sticking out, majorly. Are you going to try and hide it?\"</span></div></div>",

Lucile didn't seem to listen though as she pushed the baby further in. Macy gritted her teeth when the head bumped against her cervix and shook her head. \"It's not opening.\" She groaned, only for her womb to open at another of Lucile's shoves.

Macy cried out again as the shoulders were pushed into her and only one more push later, the head was being forced through her cervix.

Lucile dabbed her sweaty forehead with a towel before she fell asleep from the exhaustion of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was morning when Macy awoke. Lucile had gone, leaving only a note saying she needed to get home in her wake. Macy's hips were sore from her experience the day before as she sat up, laying a hand on her greatly shrunken stomach. She licked her lips and took in the sight of the swell that jutted out from her body. Three months pregnant with quintuplets... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly stood and felt the weight of it in her body.

That had started from nothing inside her and were now growing bigger and bigger. She was going to get so fat. What would she tell her Daddy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, calm down!

She crossed her legs beneath her, and realized her belly was hanging out enough that she could feel the bottom of it's tight bulge against her ankles. She started to hyperventilate a little. Lucile rubbed her shoulders harder, in big circles, and made shushing noises. Her cousin had small, strong hands. They rubbed the upper parts of Macy's arms. And they came around (brushing her tight, swollen boobs, which made her wince) and then clasped over the plumpness of her belly. Lucile rubbed up and down the gentle curve. She tickled Macy's thick sides, and swirled a fingertip around her bellybutton. Which, Macy realized, was a lot shallower than it used to be.</span></div></div>",

Then they climbed onto inflatable pool floats and lounged in silence. Macy flipped her sunglasses down over her eyes. And she waited a long time, until Lucile had floated to the other end of the pool and seemed to be dozing, before she lifted the sunglasses back up and stared down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt about it.

But the two sides of the metal teeth were straining to meet. Ugh, the wrong size.

Her face was maybe just the tiniest bit softer, her hips the teeniest bit wider, though she was still fit and skinny. But her stomach... it looked so full.

Like she had just eaten a big meal, and was too full to squeeze it down, especially low under her bellybutton. And, okay, maybe she sort of had been overdoing it on the snacks lately. Or possibly taking that baby inside had left her abs a little softened, an effect that would surely wear off soon? She had slept a whole night away last time she had done that, after all. Maybe the whole thing was still wearing off. There was no time to dwell too much on the problem right now.

She could tell he was looking at her stomach, which despite her best efforts to hold it in, still looked a bit plump. \"Hm,\" he said, at length. \"Doesn't fit just right, does it? Well.

Macy didn't want to share her Daddy with anybody. Not a spoiled little sibling, and not a so-skinny-and-pretty trophy wife, either. She told her Daddy she would go see her stepmother right away, and ask her about the dress. Daddy said fine, he had to run to a meeting anyway, and kissed her on top of the head. When he came back, he would be all hers again. Macy figured, if it was easy to make one problem disappear, why not another? Why not a <i>bigger</i> problem? And then things would go back to the way they used to be. Just her and Daddy shopping, eating out, going on trips together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept the dress on and walked up to the main house. It was quiet. She let herself upstairs and stepped into the master bedroom, and found her stepmother asleep. Perfect, beautiful. She was such a young woman. And what Macy really hated, more than that the woman was gorgeous, was that she was also really nice. One of those genuinely sweet, quiet, lovable people who were so rare. It was the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne weird trait, though. The woman slept really, really soundly. Nothing could wake her.

She didn't want to give herself a chance to calm down or change her mind. Daddy might love this woman as much as he loved her. She could see that now. It hadn't ever really been the stepsister that was the problem. This whole situation was simply not cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure if she could do it with a grown, large body. And in the end, she wasn't sure if she really had or not. She had only started to try when that sudden sleepiness came over her. She fell back on the bed, unconscious.

She lifted her hands up and squeezed her breasts too, noticing they were easily two cup sizes bigger than they used to be. And it <i>hurt</i> to touch them, they throbbed painfully in her grasp. She looked up at the mirror. A strange reflection gazed back at her. A girlish body that was beginning to show all undeniable signs of motherhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the bathroom door. \"Daddy, this dress doesn't fit either, and I think I ought to tell you why...\" She put both hands over the little curve of her stomach.</span></div></div>",

She would always complain about how the baby was too big or how he was kicking her too hard etc. That was nine months ago and her half brother was bigger then he was at birth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Macy huffs and leans over to turn off the baby monitor. She takes her half brother out of his crib and quietly goes back to the guesthouse. She slips into her room and locks the door. She places the baby on the bed and sits with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacy had planned on going out to hook up with a guy, so she was wearing sexy clothes. She had on a tight halter top and a short skirt paired with heels. Her long hair was flat ironed to look straight and she also had makeup on. She looked sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacy picks up the baby and unwraps him from the blanket. She also takes off his diaper. She unzips her skirt and pulls her panties down. She brings his head to her opening with her legs spread. Her lips remained firmly shut until it started to crack open a bit. The baby presses his head into it and starts stretching her wide. Macy moans as the tip of his head enters her and moves down into her cervix. After a bit, he enters her womb. Her stomach starts to get a bit round by it. With a push, his whole body enters her womb. Her cervix shuts behind him. Within minutes, she was pregnant. Her hands run over her swollen belly. With a gurgle, her bump fills up with fluids which makes her round out. Also, the placenta is attached to the walls of her uterus. The umbilical cord attaches to his belly button and he curls up in her womb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacy pulls her panties back up and tries to zip up her skirt, but can't. Her shirt had rolled up as her half brother entered her and her breasts was now the size of bowling balls. She huffs and waddles over to her closet. Her back starts aching right away so she rubs the spot where it hurts the most. Macy's eyes fall on a striped shirt and tiny looking shorts. She grabs them and struggles to put them on with the belly in the way. After a while, she succeeds and takes a look at herself in the mirror. Her belly had grown to the size of twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I look sexy pregnant.\" She takes a wipe and removes her makeup. Her hands rub her swollen globe of a belly causing the baby to wake up, kicking her furiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no stop that!\" Macy groans and sits down on her bed. She could see the movements through her shirt. She yawns and covers her mouth. \"Well, let's go to sleep huh baby?\" She hurls her pregnant frame up and pulled the covers of her bed back. She climbs in, and lays on her side. \"You know, I don't know what she was complaining about. You feel pretty good in my womb.

This is sponsored by a special corporation who wants to ensure they know a woman's limit so they can judge just how well their Elasto-jection works in terms of allowing a woman to hold more children than usual as well as allowing them to store more milk all the while decreasing the amount of time it takes for gestation to complete. This corporation is called Elastical Extensional Breast &amp; Preg Accerlation co.. They've chosen me as the test subject for it because they gave me it so I can hold more babies and will give me quite the princely sum for each pregnancy I carry out that increases for each amount of infants I grow and how large my breasts grow. I was all for this since I wanted to have this happen to me anyway. So for now they gave me a needle that has twins inside it for now. That's all for my first vlog. Bye now!</span></div></div>",

As I know I have more of those needles with each one larger than the last and let me just say, no stretch marks on me meaning that serum works alright! I will continue working with this company for a long time and they also gave me a serum that apparently slows my aging down so I age like half as fast for now. This is so nice.

She had inherited it from her grandfather just this year after he had passed away. She'd helped out on the farm during her summers growing up but now owning it for herself had been a big shift for her. It was a breeding farm, meant to use the animals to make more animals and profit off their sale rather than the products she could get from them. But the problem was that her breeding numbers had gotten much much lower than she would have liked them to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the papers spread out over the table in front of her and wondered how exactly she was going to bring them up. Unfortunately, it seemed she was down to only one option left, throwing her own womb into the fray. She rubbed a hand over her stomach in thought. She hadn't exactly wanted to do this. There were some farms, she knew, where the girls of the family would have themselves bred to help with the numbers and such. It was never spoken of outside farm communities, though.  Grandpapa had always denied the idea outright, thinking only his animals should be bred. Ellie knew she had no other option now though given the breeding numbers were slipping. It was going to make her chores harder but she really had no other choice if she wanted to keep the breeding numbers up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big choice was if she was going to breed herself through artificial insemination or...\"the old fashioned way\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ellie looked over her pens. Rabbit breeding had become quite popular in the farming industry as of late. More farm-to-table restaurants were trying unique dishes, and that meant a higher demand for unique ingredients. She spied what she was looking for. Nico, a New Zealand White rabbit, and her best buck. He'd been one of her most productive stud rabbits, so he was probably her best bet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked him up in her arms and took him to her room, setting him aside in a cage while she picked up a small bottle. It was a condensed vial containing doe rabbit scent. Something to... encourage Nico. She pulled down her jeans and took out the dropper, dabbing a few drops around her groin and rubbing in the fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetrieving Nico from his cage, she laid down on her back and placed him between her legs, hoping he'd get the idea and get started on his own. At first, he only wandered around, nose twitching as he inspected the area. Ellie was getting ready to help him along, but Nico turned and put his front paws up on her mound. He prodded in the general area a couple times before she could feel him entering her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSize-wise, it was pretty disappointing. \"What else could you expect from a rabbit?\", she asked aloud. Although, the rapidness of the thrusting almost felt like a vibrator, which was going to have to do. It wasn't long before Nico started to tense up, and Ellie could feel small spurts shooting into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked, running a hand along her abdomen. Optimistically, this first batch would take, but if it didn't, there'd always be a next time. Her thoughts turned to what rabbit pregnancy would be like. Whenever she'd heard of other breeding farms doing something like this, they always said the ova would split to match up with the number of offspring the species usually had - sometimes even more for smaller animals - and at least the birth probably wouldn't be too hard, with how small kits are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie place Nico back in the temporary cage in her bedroom. Just to be sure, she'd breed a few more times over the next week or so, to make sure she got pregnant. Slipping her pants back on, she left the farmhouse to take care of the day's chores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be another three days before she got the first hints of her new condition. It started with getting woozy while milking the cows, but feeling nauseous around lunch time was her sign to try a pregnancy test. She stood in the bathroom and waited for the stick to dry, staring down at it until two pink lines appeared in its handle. She was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, over the course of her breeding adventures, does she experience any... bodily changes?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first week passed by almost completely uneventfully, save for the rapid growth of Ellie's middle. Bunnies only took a month to grow a whole litter, so by that time her womb had already swelled into a sizeable paunch. On any other woman, somebody would say they were at the end of their first trimester, and she was starting to feel the usual soreness and lethargy that every pregnant woman tends to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on the sixth day that something unusual started to happen. While Ellie was showering that morning, she felt that the hair along her groin was... thicker... than she remembered. Though, the hair was smoother, so that was a plus. She didn't even notice her earlobes were longer when she looked in the mirror, or that they were higher on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe differences were still subtle as they slowly changed Ellie's body until the night she felt the first movements. The night of day 10 in her pregnancy, she reclined on the porch, massaging a sore spot at the base of her spine. Her womb had since swelled in front of her body, and she was forced to spread her legs to make room. She had since stopped hooking up her coverall straps every morning and instead let the front hang down to make space for her belly. Even though she had purchased larger clothing before this little experiment, she hadn't expected to look ready to birth by the end of the second week. It was then that Ellie felt what she mistook for a gurgle in her stomach. It was quickly followed up by what could only be squirming. She gasped and stared down at her lap, concentrating on the next movement. After almost three minutes, she was ready to look away before she felt a decisive kick. Ellie regretted not having a hand on her belly to feel it, but wasn't disappointed when another tiny bump hit just below her ribs on the other side, near where she had placed her hands. That night, she was excited with the realization that she was really growing all these little babies inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, all the excitement drained away to be replaced by panic. Eyes still closed, Ellie swung her legs out of bed and wandered to the bathroom joined to her bedroom. She bent down to the sink to get a drink, but stopped drinking when she realized the water sounded like it was coming from someplace else. She opened her eyes and flicked on the light, coming face-to-face with herself... only with bunny ears. Ellie stared, mouth agape and reached up to touch the new additions. They were real. She could hear from them, feel when she touched them. She willed them to move and felt them turn and lay flat against her hair, along with the sensation of something touching her ass. Concerned about what other changes had happened overnight, but already guessing what it was, Ellie gathered fistfuls of her nightgown until she could raise it above her rear. Turning around, she saw in the mirror that just above her panties was a small, fist-sized, tear drop-shaped bunny tail that twitched nervously and flapped along with her ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so stunned, it took another 10 minuted of testing her ears and tail to notice that all her hair had changed from it's usual brown to a snowy white and that her eyes had changed from green to a piercing scarlet. Instinctively, Ellie wanted to scream, but forced herself to calm down. Okay. Had this kind of thing happened to the other girls who did stuff like this? Was she the exception? There was a sudden kick from inside her belly. What about the babies?! Had they changed? What would she do?</span></div></div>",

Just as usual, her mind was filled with lingering images and sensations from her dreams; dreams that invariably consisted of animals and pregnancy, especially that of her atypical pregnancy. As the young woman\u2019s mind dispelled the last enduring traces of sleep, she thought back to what she had to do in order to keep her ranch running. A shudder ran through her body, but it was more out of arousal than disgust. Even as a little girl she had been enraptured by pregnancy, starting when her mother swelled up with the twins. And now here she was pregnant herself, but the fact that it was a calf rather than a human child would do more than raise a few eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie remained in bed, enjoying the chance to laze around. The sound of the animals on the ranch waking up put an end to that. Sighing, the young woman knew that she had to get up and get going for the day, no matter how much she wanted to stay in bed for a bit longer. Throwing the covers back, she got to her feet, and as she did most often, glanced over to the mirror that granted a view of herself.</span></div></div>",

As she stroked the vast swell of her middle, a sudden forceful kick added further strain to her already taut skin, followed by several more in different directions. Heat crept into her cheeks as she made soothing sounds at her unusual child. As she finally settled down again, Ellie set to work getting ready for the day. After a quick and invigorating shower, she started the lengthy process of getting dressed. The sheer size of her womb meant that she had to abandon all hope of her clothing covering it. She instead had to settle for pulling her shirt as far down over her engorged breasts as it would go, and leaving her pants almost completely undone and hidden under the curve of her stomach. Her wide and soft hips pulled the garment tight, so at least she didn\u2019t have to worry about them falling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a quick bite to eat, she headed out and made her early rounds of the ranch. It was quite a chore to waddle around entire location, but she had to do it since there was no one else to help. Maybe if her additional breeding helped get the ranch to turn around, she could think about hiring some additional help, but until then, she forced herself to keep moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally got around to her cattle, things seemed pretty usual at first. Slowly she became aware that the cattle were acting more affectionate towards her today for some reason. As she went through her routine, the rancher wondered if they were somehow responding to her pregnancy. She shook it off though; there was no way for anything like that to happen though\u2026right? She continued to feel her mind drifting back to that throughout the day as she continued the required chores no matter how many times she tried to force it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, Ellie was clad to be able to return home to get a bit of rest before staring it all over again. She quickly ate dinner before sitting down for a bit of time in front of the television. Her legs and back ached from hoisting the rather active calf around, so she was glad to finally get off of her feet. When she found herself drifting off, she still forced herself to get up and toddle off to her bedroom. Finally reaching her destination, she let out a loud yawn before getting ready for bed. Partway through her preparations, she froze when she saw something that she shouldn\u2019t have.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The warmth that had originally spread across her face as she gazes at her strong, good-natured Buzz soon blossoms in Ellie's stomach as well, before quickly spreading to her loins. She smiled as she let her eyes drift to Buzz's underside, and linger over the form of his virile genitals. No. There would be no particular need for any fancy or special medical treatments this day. She knew her dear Buzz was more than up to the task to give her elder foal \u2014 Scout \u2014 a brand new younger sibling. She knew that the farm's numbers could technically use more than one extra horse, but she had very much enjoyed the experience of carrying and birthing her first foal, and already felt more than willing to have a follow-up pregnancy or two to get those numbers into shape. If need turned out to call for it, she could always turn to the fertility clinic later to get some gestational-accelerant drugs if time demanded more horses sooner, rather than later. The money she was already saving skipping over fertilization fees this way should cover most such costs, if it should come to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming to herself merrily as the gently-warm spring breeze swirls about both her toned, 19-year old frame, Ellie carefully drags out the tall, reinforced wooden bench from the nearby shed (the one she knew from experience was study enough to handle a vigorously-bucking stallion plus some atop of it, and had - in fact - taken the effort to carve away bits and round off the corners of the bench's form to provide proper allowance and comfort for her dear Buzz's legs as he worked upon her) into the openness of the yard, before proceeding to haul out several blankets and a large pillow for comfortable cushioning. Buzz, who was watching from nearby, immediately pricks his ears in interest and begins to merrily trot in circles about both Ellie and the bench. He already knew what Ellie was prepping, having been through this routine with her prior, and - if one were to judge from the appearance of his already distending and stiffening phallus - he was already more than eager to provide his assistance to his beloved mistress in the task of making more little horses about the farm. This impression was proven spot-on because Ellie had only just laid herself supine atop the freshly-padded surface of the bench than Buzz reared up to made a quick hop and his big body neatly smacks against Ellie's own; Forcing a strained whoosh of breath out of her as the curves of her 38F-cup bust wound up immediately sandwiched against her ribcage firmly as Buzz's hefty weight settled atop of her. Winded though she was from the impact, Ellie was - as a born-and-bred farm girl - tough enough to handle this. ...Especially with her prior experience aiding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe. Alright Stud. You know the drill. Just take it easy for a minute before ramping up to full throttle on me, Okay, Sweetheart? ...I'm not <i>quite</i> as sturdy as the other mares, you know.\", she gently cautioned him with a smile, giving him a pat on the neck and a kiss on the nose before bracing her hands in the leather hand-grips she has tethered to the end of the bench for herself for support.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBuzz - ever the beautiful creature that he was - naturally heeded his mistress' request, and stared off by pressing his hips forth with only a partial portion of the (quite literal) horsepower available to him. ...An act that still, nevertheless, easily drives the now-turgid length of Buzz's just-over-two-foot-long cock deeply into Ellie's ready pelvis up to the bouncing sack of his balls, and immediately elicits a pealing squeal of delight from the young farm maid beneath him. Not every human girl could accept the fully-primed form of a mighty horse-cock in this manner, and - to be fair - even Ellie had had to 'train' herself first with larger and larger dildos (as well as the members of other smaller beasts), but said 'training', combined with her experience, had long since paid off, and she felt no discomfort at the task of nestling Buzz's thick shaft and softball-sized cock head inside of her hips. Only pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmn...\", Ellie grunts, giving her equine lover a grin. \"Alright Buzz. Let's make a baby brother or sister for our sweet Scout...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbuzz didn't need to be told twice, and, with that, his ploughing of his pretty little human paramour began in earnest. Buzz begins to grunt, rhythmically and happily as his powerful equine hips crash ever-more fiercely and determinedly against Ellie's own and Ellie - now swooning with delight as she feels Buzz's mighty and powerful member sliding and throbbing hard against her clit and cervix - finds she has to bring a hand to her mouth and bite down firmly on her knuckle - eyes squinted shut - in order to keep from literally howling out in rapturous delight over her intense screwing and spooking all of the other animals on the farm in her nigh-delirious state of sustained bliss. Just like before... Just like <i>always</i> ... Her dear, sweet, wonderful Buzz was proving himself utterly amazing. Though she could - in a way - scarcely withstand the state of her own pleasure, she nevertheless, wished it would never end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, at some point it all <i>did</i> have to end, but Buzz - ever to his credit - kept his human lover securely in her nigh-delirious state of joy for over ten, long, extraordinary minutes - bringing her to eye-rolling, toe-curling orgasm numerous times over - before finally climaxing himself in a spectacular hot, sticky display; Sending a torrential wave of his jetting horse-cum deep, deep all over the interior of Ellie's ready-and-willing womb, before the overflowing excess rocketed back out trough Ellie's overstuffed pussy and erupted all over the still-slapping thighs of both farm girl and equine. Still moaning with delight - almost sobbing, at that - Ellie eagerly kissed and stroked her beloved horse stud as he leaned against her, panting, and, moments later, he reciprocated with a deeply-satisfied whinny and nicker and strokes his large, warm tongue against Ellie's cheek as she hugs him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm the 'thorough bred' one between us, now, aren't I, Sweetie?\", quips Ellie between pants as her breath and rationality slowly return to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuzz - having heard this awful pun from his mistress several times over already, actually rolls his eyes, and hitches his body back to haul himself back off the table once more; His cock slipping free of Ellie's snatch with a wet, sloppy noise and a spattering of dribbly cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie laughs at this and sits up to hug her adorable and adored stud. \"Ahaha. I'm sorry Buzz, Baby. You did great. You did better than great, in fact. You did spectacularly...\", she says, gifting him with numerous follow-up kisses. \"Nothing but the sweetest oats  and fruits for you, tonight, Sweetie. There's no way I'm not knocked up after stuffing me full of that much cum...\", Ellie observes, as she rubs the surface of her tummy eagerly - still feeling the sensation Buzz's warm spent seed seeping oozing within her. Our family is going to be growing further real soon. I know it...\", she says, continuing to rub her abdomen as her eyes cloud over,d dreamily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, this tale being what it is, Ellie is absolutely right of course. ...But, though she is most assuredly now harboring Buzz's offspring within her womb once again, there still remains questions to be answered. For example. Though Ellie made the choice to forgo fertility enhancement, sometimes Nature likes to drop a few extra eggs into the equation of entirely it's own accord, unannounced, regardless. Twins and even triplets - though rare - are not at all unheard of among equine gestation. So, what we must now determine, dear reader, is if the young foal Scout is getting one brand new sibling... or several...</span></div></div>",

She knew her business in running a farm quite well, and he combination of her experience, steadfast care and cleaning, and reliable techniques like laying down fresh herbs and rose petals (as well as simply keeping good air circulation by way of a few smartly-installed box fans) meant that there was actually scarcely any of the typical odor associated with chickens one might expect if they were only familiar with other, less-cared-for coops. ...But even with that said, it didn't take much to set morning sickness off, and, if anything about the farm would do it, it would be even just a minor whiff of the ammonia-like scent of chicken manure. That said, she reasoned that fact only made tackling this chore first all the <i>more</i> logical. ...If she was going to have to deal with it anyway (and she was) then it was best to get over the roughest bumps in her routine straightaway, so they were over and done with. Thinking like that suited her work ethic and care for her animals just right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie's intuition about her condition turned out to be spot on, for, upon approaching the coop's exterior, the breeze shifts and - though it is only just the very barest, wispiest trace of ammonia that drifts from the coop to hit her nose, Ellie quickly finds her gait turning away from the gate of the pen in order to bring her round about over to its side, instead, whereupon she bends over a conveniently-placed bush (She knew she left that bush there for a good reason...) and - as quietly and reservedly as she can muster - retches a few mouthfuls of bile at the base of it. Fortunately, this bout of vomiting subsides quite a bit more swiftly than the one that struck her over by the house... Quite likely because she had already emptied a good deal of her stomach's contents just minutes prior, and what she just sicked-up now was more-or-less bilious leavings. She fingered the bottle of raspberry-and-ginger infused water at her hip... then thought better of it for the moment. Oh, she definitely intended to drink her beverage in due time (Regular vomiting of any type made it all the more important to keep one's fluids up) but, that said, as long as she was about the coop's perimeter, the ghostly tint of its scent would likely lead to anything that she poured into her stomach just coming right back up on her. Her drink would keep within her sealed Nalgene bottle until she was done with the work with the chickens, at least, and then she could take a few to properly re-hydrate once she had put some distance between herself and the coop once again. Besides, as bad as her nausea was striking, it was still staggered out every few hours. Even a single hour would be more than enough time to take care of affairs here at the coop\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Speaking of which, the \u2018coop\u2019, in this case, was really a building the size of a small warehouse - actually slightly surpassing the size of the main barn, slightly. Fortunately, for the sake of Ellie\u2019s daily regimen, their farm - not being a specific egg farm - didn\u2019t host an exorbitant number of hens or eggs, but, rather, was one of the few places about the country that hosted hens and eggs of a rather remarkably-great <i>size</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, it was discovered a while back (and Ellie was proud that her family and those like her own - willing to tackle bold and experimental breeding tactics - had been both at the forefront and instrument to discovering this) that although the ova of humans tended to bond best with other fellow mammals in acts of strict <i>conception</i>, their adaptive genes and wombs nevertheless meant that they could still host and birth babies of more\u2026 exotic backgrounds - such as birds, lizards, and fish. In certain ways, the task actually less-complex than breeding with mammals, as all that the task <i>really</i> required, in most cases, as simply sliding up a living egg of the donor species into the vaginal canal of  human woman, where muscular action would then pull it and nest it within the depths of her womb. And, in fact, that, in of itself, actually turned out to be enough to kickstart the process, for though, what many would consider to be an indispensable key to the process of procreation - sex/insemination - hadn\u2019t even been instituted upon the egg in question, as you yet, the permeable shell of the egg would simply absorb DNA from contact with the \u2018host mother\u2019s\u2019 womb and, essentially, inseminate itself at which point it would begin gestating as normal. This regarded in the birthing of strictly female offspring (as no masculine,  Y-chromosomes were involved), but said children could were, regardless, fully fertile in-of-themselves upon attaining maturity, and could (and later, did) begin lines of further offspring of their own - female *and* male - after receiving fertilization from another source, like artificial insemination, or just good-old-fashioned sex. The only caveat was that the offspring of this form of \u2018host fertilization\u2019 would, invariably, take something of a rather wild wild and unpredictable turn right after womb implantation and gestation began, as - upon mingling with the variances of Human DNA - the genetic code of the child-to-be would undergo a dramatic shifting from the basic code of it\u2019s non-human ancestors, and would invariably begin to grow and gestate at a fantastic rate (oft reaching full maturity within the human host-mother\u2019s womb within a period of only a few weeks or even just mere days) and also typically being born far, far, far larger than normal when compared to the typical scale of their non-human heritage, with the resultant eggs in question often winding up being \u2018laid\u2019 after swelling to dozens of pounds (often anywhere between 45-60lbs.... if not even more, for certain species of beast) within the wombs of the human host-mothers. Often it struck researchers into the matter that the mingling of DNA between biological kingdoms set off something of a radical \u2018throwback effect\u2019 where the resultant offspring could be considered more akin to the (previously) extinct megafauna of Earth\u2019s distant history rather than what nature produced today. These huge \u2018throwback children\u2019 could often hold great potential and unique options over their more-typical normal peers. Though the coop Ellie now approached hosted pens filled with several dozen normal hens, which catered to more 'mundane' egg production and sale, what made her family's farm stand out from the crowd and took up the majority of its living space were the one- dozen 'Mega-Hens' that it housed - Each one of which stood as tall as, and - if not for their shorter bodies and hollow bones - would weigh comparatively with a typical horse stallion, not-unlike Buzz. These hens regularly produced eggs of size and quality that put that of ostrich eggs to shame, and - so long as they were unfertilized - Ellie saw no particular qualms selling them to anyone about the community for the purposes of consumption. Ellie's own family had once hosted a huge free omelette/scrambled-egg breakfast bake-off for their community and neighbors, just to spread goodwill and word-of-mouth. Ellie herself was not the mother of any of these particular hens but they technically <i>could</i> be counted as her siblings; They having been laid by her own mother. At that, though Ellie herself was currently carrying horse foals, and, overall, she tended to lean towards the fuzzier, more personable company of mammals like Buzz, the back of her mind had always toyed with giving the notion of laying an egg-or-three a shot, sometime or other... Just for the fun and experience of it all, really. Down the road, perhaps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie had, in fact, once read a magazine article detailing the experience of a female aquatic researcher on this matter who lived out on the East Coast of the U.S. who had, on her own initiative and terms, carried and birthed to an optopi child that had weighed larger than a typical elephant calf at its birthing, and that was now - several years down the road and buoyed by the freedom that aquatic species enjoy in their growth over land-based ones - now massing and sizing at a scale larger than a U.S. aircraft carrier\u2026 and she was still slowly growing! The mothering researcher - who had always loved the ocean and surfed for recreation regularly - had bonded with her octopi child and her daughter - hailing from a very naturally-intelligent species of creature - had bonded right back with her. When it became clear that the woman's aquatic daughter showed no intent of abandoning her human mother's company in favor of ocean\u2019s deeper waters, the two struck a deal with their community to allow her daughter to inhabit the local beachfront; Allowing her daughter to freely inhabit the local waters, in exchange for the daughter\u2019s aid in aquatic cleanup and salvage - aided by her incredible strength and resistance to water pressure - as well as simply serving the community\u2019s beach &amp; tourist economy by visiting and acting as an attractant for the local beaches and gently playing-with and safeguarding the local bathers and children. At the time of the article\u2019s writing, the woman was actually looking forward to becoming a grandmother - having discovered that her daughter had laid her own clutch of eggs (having drawn the affections of a smaller - but still serviceably-large male octopi of the waters nearby). The article had  ended with the woman joking that she and her growing family were looking to form the aquatic core of the country\u2019s \u2018anti-kaiju defense force\u2019 at this rate. The read had proven a very warm, fuzzy, feel-good experience for Ellie, and she hoped that, if she and her family ever paid a visit out to the coast, that perhaps she could make a point to meet both that woman and her daughter face-to-face. Their tale and experience seemed so delightful... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Heya ladies. How are things hanging, today?\" Ellie merrily asks as she walks up the ramp of the coop. She is greeted by burst of clucking in reply as the hens take note of her appearance. ...Actually ringing out a bit louder, ironically, from the direction of the much smaller normal hens than her Mega-Hen siblings, as the larger size and much greater intellect provided them by their half-human heritage meant that her feathery 'sisters' meant that it took something a lot more startling that a human farmgirl appearing through a nearby door to spook them. Nevertheless, each clucked softly to her in greeting, trotting their way up to the edges of their pens to give their greetings to Ellie, and receive their appreciated stroked and petting along their thick downy necks in return. Ellie gave each of her hen siblings a once over - doing a basic check to see if any showed any obvious signs of sickness or distress - and, seeing that all looked fine and hale, turned her attention to the smaller, normal hens, and the - ironically - larger and more time-consuming chore that they represented for her, what with most of them skirting about in their pens and being harder to corner and examine. Fortunately, none show any particular signs of distress, and, Ellie, quite pleased, turns her attention to sweeping the pens out of stray feathers and bird droppings - a task fortunately only very briefly delayed only once by another very minor retch of morning sickness - and easily tended to by waltzing over to a small waste bin she had presciently-placed over by the edge of the pen to sick just a few coughings of bile into -  before following up with a good washing of the pens with the installed wall-tap and extra-long-length of rollable garden hose over by the coop's interior wall, before following things up with a spritzing of vinegar for disinfection, and giving things a fresh covering of herbs and sawdust bedding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the threat of tracking about or slipping in chicken manure was - thankfully - a non-issue, Ellie dusted her hands and set about the chore of gathering up all the eggs laid today. Now the shoe swaps to the other foot, a bit, on the front of challenge presented by each grouping of hens, for, while the collection of the eggs of the basic hens is a relatively simple (if repetitious) affair, easy enough to handle with a simple stack of egg-washing trays, each of the eggs laid by her mega-hen sisters (of which there were 9, today) were enormous, 4-dozen pound affairs. Of course, this was hardly her first rodeo, and Ellie had a tool specifically prepped for the chore in advance - A wide-topped wheelbarrow that had had its interior thoroughly padded to cradle each egg, and safeguard and carry it without too much rocking and rolling over to a prepping area back outside of the coop, whereupon they and the gathered regular-sized eggs were all given a thorough wash-down with the hose and moved into a refrigerated unit around the back of the coop for safe storage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was onto the favorite part of Ellie's daily task, both for herself and for the hens themselves, and that was feeding time. \"Come help yourselves, ladies!\", chirped Ellie,  smiling widely as she filled up the hens' troughs with a nice, healthy mixing of oatmeal, sunflower, and sesame seeds, before topping the whole shebang with several helping scoopfuls of squirming mealworms that were kept in a large bin off to the coop's side. The hens - both normal and mega - all clucked delightedly as the feast was laid out before them, and as always, Ellie found herself clucking and whistling right along with them as she warmly watched them happily feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one more particular task that required her attention before she could move on, and that was tending to and feeding the singular male resident of the coop - The Mega-Cock ('H-Hey! Stop laughing, back there!) Chanticleer, who was reachable via a ramp that led up to the coop's upper floor. Despite being a fellow Mega-Chicken, ol' Chanti was not a beast-sibling birthed by Ellie's mom, but rather a later-generational exemplar of his kind obtained from another farm like Ellie's own, specifically to avoid any potential riskings of inbreeding amongst the chickens. ironically, despite being a Mega-Chicken himself, Chanti only occasioanlly got the opportunity to enjoy private time with Ellie's Mega-Hen sisters, as the coop could only be expanded just so quickly, and the great size of Mega-Chickens meant that the speed of their breeding and the available space for new pens and enclosures for the Mega-hens always had to be taken into account. Thus, Chanti typically had to be content in his own, private pen upstairs, and having his seed regularly milked for the purpose of impregnating the regular hens (a task it was every bit as adequate for as that of creating 'little' mega-chickens) as was needed to keep their numbers up. ...That all said, with the expansions going on about the farm, in general, it was quite likely that Chanticleer would get an opportunity to enjoy some actual 'private time' with at least a few of Ellie's hen-sisters downstairs in the near future... Though, the end result of which might wind up the construction of an entirely separate, second coop to tend to each day, put up adjacent to this existing one. The time might soon come that Ellie would have to consider taking some of the farm's profits and hiring on another farmhand or two to handle some of the growing labor requirements... Something that seemed all the more likely to be necessary when considering that, a some point in the foreseeable future, the three foals currently-nestled deep within Ellie's tummy would eventually swell up to their second and *especially* third-trimester sizes, and it would undoubtedly become quite a daunting task just for Ellie to manage maneuvering in and out of her bed and bath, or through the doorways of the house with just how big, wide, and heavy her belly was promising to soon grow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually... Hmm... As her mind mulls over the option of 'hiring help', a notion occurs to Ellie. Perhaps, instead of hiring rank strangers, she might do well to turn to the aid of her family on this one. As it stood, Ellie wasn't her mother's only <i>human</i> child... She happened to have three younger human sisters - There was Rebekah, who was currently 14, and the identical twins, Faith and Hope, each 10, all of whom might be worth contacting for assistance. Though it might seem odd to those outside of the family, none of the four girls - Ellie herself, included, had a human father... Although inter-species tended to strongly favor the creation of offspring tending towards the more animalistic parent of the pairing, human-type infants were, nevertheless, a result of the unioning every so often, and Ellie's mother - not unlike Ellie herself now did -had busily and happily bred with the beasts of her farm quite a <i>lot</i>, so the eventual arrival of Ellie and her three sisters was not at all to be unexpected. Technically, the four girls were only half-siblings (aside from the twins), given that they each had been fathered by different animals of their mother's, but it wasn't like any of them really gave a damn about semantics like that. Sisters were sisters. Ellie's own father had actually been an Angus bull named Samson ('Ellie' being shorthand slang for her *actual* name - Delilah) and, while Ellie certainly didn't possess any odd or out-of-place bodily features for dint of her atypical parentage (no horns or tail or long ears, or anything like that), she, nevertheless, liked to think that she could thank her dad's genetic influence for her red hair, tough stamina, and very-generous, natural 38G-cup (and currently swelling ) breasts. Of course, given that her Mom would always need some capable <i>humanoid</i> descendants to hand the running of the farm's operations over to, in time, it was actually quite a blessing that she got some human kids from all of her fun with the animals from time to time... Ellie herself wondered just which of the animals about here might wind up being drawn as the father of her *own* human children someday. Would it be Buzz, or one of the other beasts? Of course, she wasn't at all *against* the idea of taking actual *human* lovers, to fulfill the role, but, with her close bond to Buzz, there was the risk the stallion might well get just a bit jealous if she went out looking for a human boyfriend. Still, even if stallions had them beat in the goods downstairs, there were still very nice things and roles that only human men might possibly offer her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Mmm... Wait... What had she been thinking about again? Oh. Right. Calling upon her sisters for help. Anyway. Ellie's mother - always responsible - had made a point of discouraging her human daughters away from actual *sex* - either with human <i>or</i> beast partners - until they were of age at 18. but, that said, she still allowed her daughters the joy of experiencing <i>pregnancy</i> through the science of artificial insemination, and made sure that they knew it was an option for them to take pretty much right after each of the girls showed their very first periods. Though she might technically ask any of her three human siblings for assistance, she had a particular eye towards asking the twins, Faith and Hope, if they might be willing to tackle the challenge of assisting with the numbers of the Mega-Hens... Though the odd genetic quirkings of host-carrying eggs could often prove somewhat physically challenging to the host mother, the highly-accelerated speed of only two weeks of time or so mean that the girls would not be inconvenienced from school or homework for very long. Moreover, Ellie knew that Hope and Faith *also* happened to know several schoolmates who were enraptured by the notion of what their family did, and oft-wished that they could experience such pregnancies too. This would be a perfect intro-challenge for the set of them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ellie most certainly *did* wish to spend more time with her strong and virile stallion-beau and the sweet and adorable young colt that they had jointly made together... But, then again, it was exactly thinking about the two most important men in her life like that wound up bolstering Ellie's work ethic. All of the animals on the farm - <i>including</i> Buzz and Scout - all owed their ability to enjoy their pleasant and comfortable lives here each day due to the work that she put into the place, everyday, and that her mom had put in before her... She couldn't let them all down by letting herself get fickle and careless just because her hormones were running a bit amok, at the moment. Of course, she couldn't (and didn't <i>want</i> to) deny that it just felt damn <i>*good*</i> to satisfy the urges of those hormones of hers, so she'd just have to make a point of pulling Buzz aside later and \u2018playing\u2019 every bit as hard as she had worked once the chores were all finally put out of the way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie intended to take care of the hay, next - It was always nice to have fresh reserves of it at the side and ready before tending to the all of the farm's grazers, and having the fresh-cut scent of it lingering about should help stifle her morning sickness at least just a bit... Perhaps not <i>entirely</i> but it should still certainly help... Ah. Right. Speaking of which, now that she had put the work with the chicken coop behind her, this was an excellent point to take just a few and get a bit re-hydrated, to help compensate for the fluids she had been sicking-up now and again since she had woken. Ellie leaned back against the post of one of the fences and took a long, refreshing draw off her Nalgene bottle. She idly rubbed a palm over the swell of her foal-filling belly as she let the tart-and-tingling flavors of mingled ginger and raspberry play over her taste buds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs chance would have it, it was then that Ellie noticed her equine son, Scout, round the corner of the stables and she smiled tenderly as she saw that he was evidently coming to see her. \u201cHey there, Baby\u201d, she cooed to him; Reaching out to hug him neck and give soft the soft hair of mane a playful ruffle, in greeting. Scout reciprocated by leaning into his mother\u2019s embrace eagerly, and planting a lick of affection on her neck. \u201cYou come to check up on your mama and your baby brothers and/or sisters, Love Bug?\u201d Scout nodded and whickered in the affirmative, but then made an addendum with a tapping of his hoof, as well as a tilting of his head alongside of a flicking of his tail. Though Ellie already technically knew just how smart her son was, it nevertheless always made her hear tingle in awe to see him put it on display. Though her son might appear to be a full-blooded horse to outside observers, his half-human heritage meant that he was smarter than common horses by orders of magnitude. Though Ellie would never in a million years dream of saying that his father, Buzz, was \u2018stupid\u2019, Buzz, nevertheless, was a typical horse at the end of the day, and he though, acted, and reacted more like an instinctual animal than anything like a human. He owed his own degree of \u2018smarts\u2019 and his ability to follow Ellie\u2019s more complex desires due to a constant interaction with humans since his birth, as well as an exceptionally close familiarity to his mistress\u2019s moods and wants at that. In contrast, Ellie would unreservedly say that her son was easily and objectively as smart as any human of his own age bracket. While his father could do the \u2018old horse trick\u2019 of keeping track of some basic counting, Scout could keep track of much bigger numbers and more advanced arithmetic, as well as showing indications that he could comprehend and follow human-oriented conversation topics whenever his mom, grandmother, and aunties were speaking around him. It was really only his lack of human vocal cords that kept him from more-actively <i>participating</i> in said conversations, and, even then, as he grew, Scout had been steadily developing a clever series of gestures and intimation which he could use to get his meaning across to others\u2026 Such as right now, as he indicated to his mother with his motions that he wanted to assist her in the chore of gathering the hay with her, by way of gesturing to the small horse-drawn hay reaper and buckrake, each set just under a small, protective lean-to nearby. \u201cWell now. Aren\u2019t you just the bestest and sweetest little boy that any mother could ever ask for?\u201d, Ellie marveled with a grin. \u201c...But ...Isn\u2019t it a chore it\u2019d be more appropriate for your father to help with. You\u2019re growing up like a weed, but you\u2019re not all the way there, just yet, after all.\u201d Scout snorted and gestured his head and tail in another direction past the farm\u2019s corral towards the fields, and - now that she was straining her ears and paying attention - Ellie could now make out the noises of mares whinnying out in heat\u2026 as well a a meaty-slapping of horse flanks as <i>someone</i>eagerly went about tending to the needs of said mares. Ellie rolled her eyes. Of <i>course</i> Buzz would go off to go screw the farm\u2019s other mares. ...Knowing quite well how the flow of farm life just naturally went since she was a little girl, she wasn\u2019t at all about to get <i>jealous</i> over him going off to have fun with the other girls. She had already been mulling over the fact that Buzz was, in spirit, just a simple horse, after all, and that he possessed inherent urges and desires of such, as well. Buzz detected mares in heat around the farm about himself, and it was only natural that, as a healthy stallion, he go satisfy himself with them, and fulfill his compunction to help make little horses about the place. No. it was more like... she simply felt *exasperated*  than truly upset. Just the thought of other girls getting to enjoy the touch of 'her man'... Well... Reflecting on her own thoughts, maybe she <i>was</i> ever-so-slightly jealous, but, then again, she *still* couldn't rationally blame anyone but herself for feeling that way, as she was the only party in this cuckolding triangle that could actually be expected to exercise anything like self-control. ...Well, perhaps she <i>was</i> feeling slightly jealous of the other mares, after all, at that. She sighed. Screw it. She might not be Buzz's <i>only</i> girl, but - nevertheless - she could still make sure that Buzz knew that she was his <i>best</i> by arranging some intense private time with him later tonight, after-hours. Work hard. Play hard, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... At least I can count on *you* to be responsible, Scout. You might have gotten your good looks from your dad, but you got your brains and common sense from *my* side of the family. ...Alright. Sit tight for a moment. Mommy needs just a minute to get some fresh fluids for the little ones in her, but then we'll work on that hay together, K?\", she tells her foal, scratching him behind the ears as she did so. Scout nodded happily and leans his face up against the slight swell of his mother's pregnant belly to cuddle up to his gestating siblings in affection. Ellie smiled and patted the head of her first-born tenderly as her thoughts dwelled on her yet-to-be-born deep within her. Even if his dad <i>could</i> be a slight bit of a flake, she knew she could and would never, ever regret choosing Buzz to love, for the sake of getting the blessing of both this beautiful little boy and whatever other wonderful little children she would bear for him. It also helped that though still not 'mature' for a horse, Scout was already quite large - already bearing about 80% of his father's mass - and should likely be able to help her work the reaper with little struggle. As he grew, Scout would also come to enjoy a great degree of hybrid-born strength and vitality over the proficient amount that standard horses already enjoyed, and even though he would grow up quite a bit faster than a human child would, that vitality of his would give him a longer lifespan and greater degree of vivacity over the course of his adult life... Like getting something of a fast-forwarded start on life, but making up for it with extra time provided later. After a few minutes time, Ellie had drained the lion's share of the contents of her Nalgene bottle and, setting aside about a quarter of it for later, she and Scout ambled over to the reaper and Ellie hooked her son into its harness securely before sitting her pregnant body down in the set of the device. \"Right. Let's do it to it, Scout!\", she merrily chirped, giving her son an encouraging pat on his flank. Scout, only too pleased to be of use, gave a happy nicker and clopping of his hooves before starting forwards and, with only a scant modicum of effort, pulling both him mom and the hay-reaper right along with him. Patches of hay began to topple over in fluffy masses behind them as the the mother-and-son farmers made their way through the pasture in strips of activity. Once that was done, the two repeated the process with the buckrake, and gathered up the fresh-cut hay into bales. That all finally accomplished the now enormously-proud and thankful Ellie made sure that Scout was set up with some delicious fruit in his feed for a treat and turned on the wall-mounted TV in his personal stable stall to some entertaining PBS (Scout being the only horse on the farm who actually held any ability to appreciate watching TV programming, at that).</span></div></div>",

Even though some complained, everyone got used to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose was excited when she finally got home and heard from her mom that they'd got a deal with a new tech firm. After a dinner of talking of what happen in college. The two were soon in the lab, leaving their mother to do the dishes. They do mingle with people from time to time but mostly they stay in the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dad! This is a cool plan! But I'm having problems what it does as some of the formulas are quite confusing.\" Rose said as she studied her father's plan on the drafting board. For any normal person, their head would just fry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that. It works! I didn't get the deal if the theory wasn't ideal. I just need to physically prove it.\" Her father said. Wearing the usual white lab coat, brown pants, checkered T-shirt with googles and slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose wore a lab coat as well but with eye glasses. She wore a red blouse that covered her endowments. Denim jeans and low cut sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it exactly we're working on dad?\" Rose asked in a curious manner as she looked at the invention that her father was working on. Rose fixed her long hair into a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father looked at her as he swiped some sweat off his forehead with his right forearm, \"Well, honey! Its a....\"</span></div></div>",

Her zipper on her pants was broken and zipped all the down to make way of her belly. Her breasts which were softball sized had grown quite a bit as cleavage was visible as she looked down on it. She felt movement from her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Great. I'm officially pregnant due to a teleportation error. But I don't remember the Korsaks having any kids or Zoe having a kid for that manner. I wonder besides how this kid got into me is whose kid is this.</i>\" Rose thought as she rubbed her belly. Her belly growled as her now child was kicking a storm. Rose decided to take a bath and change into more loose clothing. Purple sweat pants and a white shirt to cover her belly with sports bra and underwear to match. She slowly made her way downstairs to the kitchen and hopefully to find her father and an explanation to what happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her dismay, she found a note on the fridge. It was from her father as it explained he took her mother along with him to show the success of the test. They would be gone for a bit and left her some money for the time being. Her mother had cooked her mak and cheese. Rose took the money and the food along with some milk and ate till she was full. She placed her dishes in the dishwasher and left it for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is annoying.\" Rose said to herself as she found the disadvantages of being pregnant. Her belly bumped into furniture and had to walk slowly. She always had a slim figure with big boobs but nothing had her prepared for getting instantly pregnant. She decided to go back to the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the mini elevator, she saw that both teleporters had been returned and side by side. She also saw the log book and her father's laptop on the center desk near the teleporter. She made her way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>There has to be something that explains how I got this kid stuck in me.</i>\" Rose thought as she brushed a bang to the side and began speed reading through the notes and reports. She found nothing as she sat in a high stool with both hands on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives. There should be a proper explanation howbI got this!\" Rose yelled as she patted her belly. \"Did dad leave that detail or did some reality shift occur. I'm sure they were the ones who carried me home...\" as she became depressed about the situation. She looked down at herself as she estimated she would be ready to give birth. Question was when or would she be stuck like this. Rose shook her head as she went back upstairs.</span></div></div>",

Charlotte's bookstore was a hit with all the 6 old people in town who still read books instead of fancy new-fangled phoneymessages or texty mail. Despite being the exact age to be into all that, Charlotte wasn't into all that. All she needed to be happy was a good book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that and her spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started when she was at the old bookstore she ended up replacing. The age of their books trumped even hers. She used to joke with the owner, a lovely old woman, that she got the books from the old Library of Alexandria herself. Despite being a \"haha you're old\" joke, they both shared a nice laugh over it. On the last-day sale of the store about three days ago, Charlotte practically bought out her whole store. The most enticing book in her newfound collection, and the one she opened the moment she got home, was a particularly uniquely titled handbook named \"Slews of Brews, and Some Swell Spells: A Treatise on the Arcane\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set out immediately on testing each of these so called \"spells\". She was surprised to see them work. She cast a spell that made her lamp levitate above its stand. She brewed a potion that dyed her hair solid purple for a week. She got through the entire first chapter of cantrips and minor potions in one night. Then came the second chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was today that she moved on to the second chapter. The real deal. The spells that actually did things. Most of these spells, much to her dismay, were really hard to perform and required exotic materials with names in such obscure languages, even she couldn't get an idea of they said. There was, however, one spell that required ingredients she actually had:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bountiful Body?\" Charlotte read aloud, confused at such a vague name. \"What does that mean?\" Charlotte asked, looking down at her... less-than-average sized body. Well, not just less than average. Charlotte was a twig. She had no padding at all, especially not in her feminine areas. If it weren't for her long, forearm length hair and sort of female looking facial features, she would be easily confused for a petite boy. Because of her \"shortcomings\", having a bountiful body piqued her interest. She had assumed that meant an increase in chest size. While she wasn't interested in appearance and all that, the idea of actually being called beautiful or even sexy sounded appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be easy,\" Charlotte said, smirking. \"Just a few chants, and I get to have a bigger bust? Sounds like a win to me! Here we go! Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blinding light came from the center of her body, and...</span></div></div>",

Once she could see, she saw how right had been. A pair of breasts far beyond what she had possessed before pulled her shirt taut. A veritable canyon of cleavage was visible through the over strained collar. She was even more impressed when she saw that the spell had affected her hips and rump as much, pushing her pants past to their breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman jumped for joy. Her new expanded assets shook and quivered from the sudden motion. Charlotte loved how that felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was exploring her new body and giving slight thought to how she was going to cover up for the trip back home, when a curious sensation came over her. An odd bubbling and stretching feeling filled her middle, centered on her stomach it seemed. She furrowed her brow as she reached around her bust since she couldn\u2019t see past it any longer. She gasped and jumped as her fingers brushed bare skin far soon than they should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun on her heel and dashed for the backroom, and the bathroom off of it. Flicking the light on, she jumped again, sending her curvaceous frame wiggling again. The cracked mirror over the sink wasn\u2019t perfect, but it showed enough. She saw her gaping mouth, shock paling the usually chocolaty skin across her face. She saw her expanded bust straining against the tight confines of her shirt. And she saw her stomach peeking out from under the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome small portion of her mind supposed that with her breasts taking up so much room in her shirt, it would only be obvious that the lower hem would end up raised. That didn\u2019t account for all she saw though. Instead of the usual washboard flat stomach she should have been seeing, there was a rounded dome pressing out from her body. She felt light headed as she realized with a jolt that she could even see the dome expanding further and further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte groaned as she could hear her shirt creaking and groaning as more and more stress added to the unfortunate garment. Beads of sweat started to break out across her face as she realized that her skin was starting to creak and groan as well. The surface of her belly was turning shiny before long. She thought for sure that she was going to pop or explode or any number of things as the tightness continued to build. Just when she thought she couldn\u2019t any more, the growth stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience left her panting for breath, though a slight moan built in the back of her throat. She could now see the mountain of her stomach rising beyond the closer hills of her breasts. Her hand trembled as reached for it. It was really there, her first tentative touches confirmed. The next touches went on a bit longer and she found that the surface was smooth to the touch. It felt almost like a balloon filled with air. She felt like a balloon that was for sure, but it wasn\u2019t air filling it, that much she was sure of as well. The weight of the bloated ball that was her stomach was pulling on her back already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It has to be that spell</i> she thought. <i>The whole \u201cBountiful Body\u201d thing must not have meant what I thought it did.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was reaching for the door to pull it open again, when another sudden feeling hit her middle. Her stomach became a cold knot as she thought she must be expanding again. But a quick glance in the mirror again showed that to not be the case. She scratched her head as she puzzled over the oddity. Then it happened again. This time, she was looking at her reflection, so she saw a lump of her stomach stretch further than the rest. It retreated as soon as it appeared. Several more followed in quick succession, each in a different spot. The icy chill in her stomach only deepened as the implications hit her though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pregnant!?\u201d she screamed as she fought to remain on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome part of her sometimes fantasized about her body swelling up with life. But not yet, and certainly not like this either. She nibbled on her lip as she stared at the mirror. Charlotte did have to admit that the big belly did look good on her. A violent shake of her head cleared that thought away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, this is absurd. I have to fix this, there has to be something in the book about removing the pregnancy at least.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to the door again and walked out of the bathroom. The sudden mother faltered in her steps as another flurry of activity came from within. She moaned again, even louder this time. Her hand reached down to brush against her belly as well. The sensations that this was stirring up within her, she could get used to\u2014 No, she had to resist and undo that portion of the spell\u2026no matter how nice it felt. Charlotte was oblivious of how she continued to caress her fertile belly.</span></div></div>",

Willa made a soft sound as the worm pushed itself into her body, sliding up her channel and into her waiting womb. It was a few minutes before it was entirely inside, curled up and safe. \"All done!\" She let Willa's legs out of the stirrups and the girl sat up, tugging on a pair of comfy sweatpants as she looked down at herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving the Parthax in her womb had made it plump up a little already, leaving her looking about three months pregnant.

She pulled her hand away and stared down at her plump middle. She felt the worm press its body to the top of her womb and a moment later felt something new settle in her womb. \"Oh!\" The worm stopped pressing and settled again and she realized it must have laid an egg because her belly had pushed out a bit more. She smiled and laid back on the couch, rubbing her bump. \"You lay all the eggs you need to it there.\" She hummed, relaxing as she grabbed the remote to turn on a movie.</span></div></div>",

She had been watching this movie since she was eight; in fact, it was this movie that inspired Willa to volunteer for this alien project in the first place. The lab technicians even assured her that the aliens wouldn't burst out of her chest. During the movie, the worm laid more eggs inside Willa's womb, making her tummy swell even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie, Willa looked at her belly, pleased that her worm buddy had laid more eggs. She rubbed her swollen midsection with pleasure, enjoying the feeling of carrying unborn life in her tummy. Then, her belly let out an enormous growl, shaking violently as the worm thrashed about inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, what is it, girl?\" Willa asked, clutching her trembling belly. She then realized she hadn't eaten all day since she got home. \"Are you hungry?\" she guessed. Immediately, the worm calmed down, and Willa once again heard her tummy begging for food. \"Okay, all you had to do was ask,\" she said sarcastically. She would love to feed her babies anytime if it meant providing nutrients to help them grow big and strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked towards the fridge and looked inside. There was a lot to choose from; she eventually decided on some leftover pasta. She patted her belly, which kept rumbling, wanting to get food in it immediately. \"Don't worry, little guys,\" she said to the eggs in her womb, \"you're gonna get your food right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Willa ate, she could feel the rumbling grow softer and softer. \"You know,\" Willa said through mouthfuls, \"I feel you should have a name rather than Parthax.\" She smiled as the worm wriggled up to the top of her womb. Willa thought of different names, until eventually, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Bella?\"</span></div></div>",

She also undresses the baby girl and puts her head near LeeAnn's opening. With a grunt, LeeAnn forces Grace inside her. As Grace travels to her new mom's uterus, LeeAnn could see a bulge in her lower stomach. Slowly, Grace enters LeeAnn's womb. An umbilical cord gets attached and the uterus fills up with amniotic fluid. As soon as Grace is comfortable, she starts kicking and moving rapidly. LeeAnn giggles and rubs her twin sized belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there baby girl. Mama's got you.\" She cups the bottom of her bump and feels Grace's jabs. Her breasts also grew a cup size bigger. Getting her phone, she takes a picture of her glowing pregnant body. Getting Daniella to rest on her chest and bump, LeeAnn takes more photos<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, time for your sister.\" LeeAnn takes Daniella's clothes off and pushes her inside to join Grace. LeeAnn gets bigger, now sporting a pregnant belly that looked like she was pregnant with quads. Her breasts grew as well, leaking milk from her nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahh!!\" She looks over and Ryan is squirming in his carrier, hungry for food. LeeAnn's heart aches, so she releases him and takes him up to her teats, resting his body on her bump. Ryan latches on and begins to drink greedily. She gets her phone and takes a picture. Her head goes in the direction of Jade's crib as she hears her daughter fuss. LeeAnn waddles over and takes Jade in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh....easy there. Mama's here.\" She lets out a groan as Sarah's twins move furiously. Ryan lets go of LeeAnn's nipple and smacks his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now that wasn't so bad right?\" Ryan moves his arms around and yawns. LeeAnn smiles, and puts him in a different crib while still holding her daughter. Jade goes to one of her mother's leaking nipples and drinks the milk. LeeAnn snaps a photo again. With a sigh, she places her phone down and Jade lets go of her mother with a pop. The young mom places her daughter on the bed with no diaper on. Turning to look at herself in the mirror, she notices that her hips and butt had gotten larger as well. She twists and turns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I look huge!\" She runs her palms over the shiny marked skin, running her fingers over her enlarged belly button. She shudders as it sent waves of pleasure through out her body. She yawns, suddenly tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, time for me to go to sleep.\" She goes to her closet and finds a maternity style nightgown with no underwear on. She puts it on and heads to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night everyone.\" She lays on her back and goes under the covers and closes her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the night, Jade was awake. She had gotten under the covers and spread her mom's legs apart. Pushing her head against LeeAnn's pussy, it goes in with a pop. The rest of her body follows in. An umbilical cord got attached to Jade and LeeAnn's belly got even bigger and her breasts got tight against her nightgown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, LeeAnn wakes up with a groan feeling even more pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's going on?\" She then notices that Jade wasn't on the bed with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade?! Where are you?\" There was a tap coming from one of the babies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you. I have to find my daughter!\" The tap comes again and LeeAnn feels her lips are wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? Jade is that you?\" She grunts as there's a strong kick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" LeeAnn places her feet on the side of the bed and stands up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you girls are heavy. I can't carry all of this weight. I'm going to have to give birth.\" She glances down at her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who to choose though? I do miss having Jade in me, although the twins make me look like a fertility goddess.\" She knew who she chose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having the twins.
