But that was too long ago for anyone to remember. Right? Anyway, Liara had grown from the eager scientist out to discover the universe's secrets to the new Shadow Broker: a near omniscient force in the galaxy due to a network of secret agents and alliances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara could definitely find out more about this device. She might even be able to use it with a trusted agent to find some high-level information that could benefit the war with the reapers or the construction of the crucible. Anything that could help The Shadow Broker could help save the earth from Reaper occupation. There was no time to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Liara was a very busy broker.

That'd show her that he was serious. But who would be the right fit?</span></div></div>",

You and her had known each other for years now, so keeping it formal just felt so... Impersonal. Normally you were fine with that, but seeing as how you were on a first-name basis with your entire crew since you all had worked together for years... Everyone tended to drop the military formalities around you and instead acting a bit more personal and relaxed. Not that you minded, of course; you were just Shepard, nothing more, nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard!\" The blue-skinned doctor moonlighting as the mighty Shadow Broker looked up from her computers and meet your gaze with a welcoming smile. \"Of course. What can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou responded to her smile with one of your own, and gestured with the device still in your hand. \"I found this during our latest operation against Cerberus. Wanted to check if you can find out anything about it.\" The device exchanged hands - from yours to hers - and the doctor looked curiously at the meek device lying in her hand. Without warning, the instruction-sheet popped up, causing a startled reaction from both of you, but it didn't take long for Liara to gather her wits again and skim through them. \"Interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Anything you recognize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I haven't heard of anything like it, Shepard. I knew Cerberus had some cutting edge technology, but... No, I'm afraid I have nothing for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit disappointed, but not surprised. Throughout your short period of working alongside Cerberus, you hadn't gotten a good look at their tech. Important as you may be, but they never needed you to control any advanced tech that happened to be theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... Maybe Liara could find SOMETHING to look at? She was the Shadow Broker after all, so chances are she should be able to find anything that could potentially help them. She was good with technology to boot; maybe not as good as Mordin, but between the two he trusted her a bit more. Mordin wasn't untruthworthy - his morals were just a bit more... Blurred. Although, you could take the more risky route and try it out for yourself, have Liara tag along if she wanted to...</span></div></div>",

You invited your personal girl friday to your quarters so she could locate whomever you wanted to try on. But as Specialist Traynor exited the elevator. You knew she'd be the perfect space guinea pig. You offered her a relaxing shower, as was your tradition, as you planned your renegade scheme. She hated the main showers and this would make the job of stripping her lovely dark complexion even easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://th02.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2012/143/3/5/samantha_traynor_07_by_johntesh-d50u4yh.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://th02.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked past the rows of model ships, she turned to you in curious interest. You had never made a move on her, given than she was playing for a different team. But maybe you could make a move <i>as her</i>. In a zap, the specialist collapsed to the floor. It worked. It actually worked. The once imposing figure was now a pile of hollow flesh. The shower couldn't detect anyone inside and automatically shut-off. You stripped out of your ridiculously corny overalls and finally got into a lesbian's panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the feet were first actually. Your masculine legs distorted the feminine sleek curvature of Traynor's mocha legs. The skin was stretching, but that wasn't enough. You looked like a man with hairless legs that clearly belonged to another race. And the empty husk of Traynor's torso, arms &amp; head didn't help the image. Your erect cock pushing out under her well-trimmed mound definitely didn't help. It looked like a real vagina, but you still felt your old equipment underneath.  You soldiered on. Maybe it'd all be activated a bit later. The ray definitely worked. So the suit must work too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pulled the torso over your own, the problem of scale wasn't getting any better. Vega's regimen had given you a solid chest and Traynor's breasts looked ridiculous spread across it. Your arms looked even stranger underneath her skin. But at least you were closer to the end now. If it didn't work, that'd be fine. But the thought that it might intoxicated you with exotic anticipation. Your dick was bloomed to burst. You needed to activate this suit fast or you'd cum all over the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you pulled up Traynor's head mask. It was a tight fit, but it stretched like the rest of the suit. Well, it stretched at first. But after you adjusted the fit for a few seconds, it suddenly seemed to lock into place. You looked in the mirror to see Traynor's distorted face atop your hunky body. And then in milliseconds that only EDI's fasted cameras could capture, her face, her chest, her whole body distorted you instead. It didn't hurt. But it was a hell of a surprise to find yourself inches shorter with a whole new body. Well, a well used body. Liara had to see this. But how could you show her?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being Traynor was intoxicating, to say the least. Every single little inch of you was now all Traynor, and all of it belonged to you. Her naked body was at your command, and it felt you with a feeling of utter intoxication. You idly ran your new hands across your soft and well-shapen body, and with them followed blissful shuddering. You realised that Traynor (or was it You now?) hadn't finished her shower, and you smiled lustfully to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an occupant now inside, the shower started up, enveloping you in a warm and delightful haze. Your intense erection had somehow been converted into an odd (but just as horny) feeling in your new genitals, but it didn't disturb you - rather, making it much more exoticating. While idly wrapping your new and long hair to the back of your head, you let your hand slowly guide itself to your vagina, slowly stroking the entire front of your body. The whole thing felt so incredible you almost gasped, but you managed to pull through. Masturbating as a girl was entirely different for obvious reasons, but it didn't turn you on - quite the opposite, in fact. Slowly, you stroked the mounds of your new flesh, letting out a faint wimper as you did. The sensation felt like nothing unusual (presumbably due to the part of you that was Traynor), but at the same time you weren't sure you were supposed to move around it. You hesitated slightly, before slowly starting to move your fingers around it, increasing the sensation to practically unbearable (for you) levels. Soon enough, your fingers slipped inside, and you slowly moved them around in a pattern. In, out, in, out. All the while, you couldn't help but let out a few more uncontrolled gaps. You imagined that if Traynor did this by herself, there wouldn't be much sound to think of, but you weren't really sure how to control it, either from your desire to hear a woman moan for you, or because it was so entirely alien that it just wasn't controllable at all. You started to pick up the pace, and with it your levels of pure bliss. Eventually, what could be best described as an explosion of intense pleasure enveloped you as your back arched upward, visibly shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower-beams ran down your smooth skin as you gasped for breath, and took in every minute of it all. To say the least of it, it was absolutely incredible. Nevertheless, you decided to have some more fun, and tried out cleaning your new long hair, which was an experience in and of itself. After you felt like you had at least done an okay job, you exited the shower and dried yourself with a towel. Traynor had brought a spare of her own uniforms with her, which saved you a heap of trouble, and you thanked her for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you exited the bathroom, you took a glance at your new self in the reflection of the glass surrounding yours (or was it Shepards?) models, and smiled to yourself. Wow, you really <i>were</i> Traynor, and loving every second of it. Moving for the elevator, you kind of expected EDI to say something aimed towards what you just had done, but she remained silent. Probably for the better; explaining the situation wouldn't be easy, even if it was to an AI, unshackled or no. The elevator would usually stop one floor above the Crew's Quarters for Traynor, but this time she went straight for them instead. Apparently, Traynor didn't have much of an connection to Liara, never really engaging in a lot of conversations with her unless it revolved around her specifically, and even then it didn't really lead anywhere. Suffice to say, this'd be a chance to develop that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to Liaras room opened up, and Glyph welcomed you in his usual warm and friendly tone, and you implored you noticed with a faint nod in his direction and a smile. \"Doctor Liara T'soni?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething you had forgotten to check before was if you actually had her voice now, which it turned out you actually did, which was something that left a blanket of relief on your shoulders as soon as you brought the question up inside your mind. \"Yes?\" Liara seemed quite busy, much like usual. This, however, made you realise something - you didn't have anything planned to really strike up a conversation with her and get things moving. \"Do you, uh... Have a moment to talk?\" Was this really the best you had? It was something, yes, but even then you weren't proud of yourself for it. Liara seemed to stop in whatever she was doing, and turned to look at you along with a slight and clearly confused \"Yes, that I do.\" You smiled, while struggling to keep up with something to talk about. \"How are things working out for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are... Going quite well. Are they doing the same for you?\" The confusion and lack of words meant to be aimed towards you was clear in his voice, but it was clear that she at least tried her best at it.</span></div></div>",

Normally you'd just strike up a conversation no problem, but the fact that it wasn'e exactly Shepard talking to Liara but Traynor talking to Liara changed things up more than you had first bargained for. You had never really witnessed Traynor engaging in conversations with anybody other than yourself, and maybe one or two crew-members over the comms to tell them somebody was requesting their presence, but like this... Nope. Besides, had she ever even talked to Liara? You had never bothered to ask either of them, not finding it important or interesting enough; right now, a heavy layer of regret wrapped itself around you for making that decision. Of course you couldn't have expected anything even slightly similar to this, but the fact that it was currently biting you in the ass didn't go away anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in thought, you snapped out of your mental bubble by suddenly straightening yourself and coughing courtly. \"Y-Yes, that they are!\" If Liara suspected anything you couldn't really tell, apart from the confusion on her face being clear as day. Nope, this was definitely not something usual for her, or \"himself\" for that matter. \"...I see.\" she noted, slowly wrapping her fingers together in front of her. Damnit, you needed to come up with something to say, something good for that matter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not interrupting, am I?\"<br>\r\n\"No, not at all. I decided to take a short... Break, so you aren't interrupting me in anything.\" Liara's calming voice and tone flew through the air and stroked your ears gently, just like the wave of ease that ran through you. You had plenty of time, but you'd rather not waste it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it better to just go out with your secret already? You felt impatient, the desire to reveal the incredible device to her growing inside you like butterflies on a sugar high, and at the moment another desire slowly bloomed through you. Maybe it was just you or part of Traynor echoing through you, but you couldn't help yourself with eyeing Liaras delicate... Form. As much as you wanted to talk \"business\", you also wanted to jump her and lick that gorgeous neck of hers and - Christ, why now of all times?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Screw it, it was better to just get out of Traynor before anything you'd later deeply regret happened. Right now you were Traynor to everyone, including Liara - if something was going to happen, you'd rather have know and think around it instead of being lied to. As much as you craved for her bare touch, you should be able to hold out a bit longer, at least long enough to tell her the truth on what you wanted to talk to her about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing your thought to signify what you were going to say was going to be important (and partly to gather courage for the reveal), you locked your gaze with Liara's. \"Doctor T'Soni, there's... A-Ahem, something really important I want to show you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara barely moved an inch from her original stance, her eyes calmly studying you, waiting patiently. \"And that would be...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't press on, and instead focused on showing her. The devices instructions had said something about 'wishing' for an opening to appear, and sure enough you could feel an odd prickly sensation going across your spine, presumably the zipper-like opening you had used to wear the Specialist you currently inhabited without her permission to boot (oops).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shaky, feminine hands started to work off your uniform right in front of Liara, who kept silent, but her eyes were clearly widening in confusion (and possibly admiration, Traynor was a bit of a looker after all), eventually leaving you completely bare. If you were alone you'd probably run your arms over your gorgeous body, but now just wasn't the time. Instead, your arms searched for the zipper running down your back, and with a bit of work you managed to start pulling down the zipper. As the suit started to loosen, you could feel how your actual masculine form started to come back to you, and you wasted no time on shedding what remained of the suit off, leaving you standing completely bare still, but as yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's actually me, Shepard.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor mumbled something inaudible (although you were pretty sure you could hear something similar to \"goddess\" in there), and just stood still, staring at you. \"Here, let me explain...\" you mumbled, trying to ease the incredibly awkward tension as you searched through your (Traynors?) clothes to show Liara the device and explain what had just expired. </span></div></div>",

You sit down, leaning forward, she begins to dance, smiling at you hungrily. Showing off all the curves of her body. The suit definitely hugged every curve and shape of her body. You leaned forward, motion to her, \"How would you like to meet Commander Shepard himself?\" The dancer immediately stopped, her eyes widening at the chance of meeting someone in as high and prestigious position as Shepard. She nodded, \"I would love to!\" she said in a sultry tone, she pulled a coat on, following you back to the Normandy. You took the side way up to the quarters, before getting stopped by the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in the privacy of a quiet area you step back, \"Don't freak out, alright?\" you then begin to remove the suit, she looks shocked at first, like a child but then notices that it's Shepard in a suit. She nods, \"Hello Commander Shepard, I didn't know it was you inside that su--how did you do that?\". You hold up a finger, showing the device, \"This is capable of creating body suits out of people and so much more.\" She looked a bit confused, then scared, \"W-Wait you're going to turn me into a suit?\" she said, \"I don't have anything worthwhile, I barely make ends meet and I dance for a living..\" You shake your head chuckling, \"Quite the opposite, I want to give you the chance to become THE Commander Shepard.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asari was clearly excited at this opportunity. \"I would...it would be amazing to get that opportunity..\"  You smile, \"Show me your hand.\". She shows her hand and you go to remove the glove from herh and, you then place her thumb against the device, it scans her thumb and reassigns the device to her. You then move to put the device in her palm. \"You control the device now, use it to swap us.\". The Asari is practically trembling, she looks at the device, selecting the option.</span></div></div>",

It felt incredibly weird yet incredibly amazing. You could feel it being pulled towards a smaller, shorter, wekaer body. As you found yourself sucked into the new body, you couldn't help but feel more slender, much weaker and very scantily clad, just wearing a skintight curve bearing outfit with a couple of gloves and heels. You blinked for a moment, your new Asari body's eyes adjusting to the light, finding yourself looking at your former form. You looked down to see two globs on your chest, they felt like Traynor's but larger yet somehow REALLY felt like a part of his body. You also looked at your hands, sitll in gloves but you could see how slender they were, surely gloves as small as these wouldn't fit your large hands. On the other hand the Asari now in your body was grinning, clearly in an advantageous position, the body of the Commander smirked. \"This is amazing! I can't believe I'm now in the body of one of the most powerful people in the galaxy! A human spectre and an Alliance Commander at that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asari definatelyt seemed to be quite the actor when she settled back into the demeanor Commander Shepard would normally have. \"What do you think, do I sound like you?\" You were shocked, but nodded, \"Yes, exactly like me.\" She seemed to hug herself before going to hug you a little too tight, you didn't realize how much strength you had in your former body. \"Does this mean I get to be the Commander?\" She says brightly, yet within the Commander's typical emotional limit. You nod, \"Yes, you get to be the Commander..\" She smirked as she grabbed your hand, moving it towards the device, trying to make you push the button that would lock off swaps between the two bodies, essentially making it as if they actually were in their true forms. You tried to use all your strength to prevent her from doing so but she managed to get you to push the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you were zapped, your vision going white for a moment, oddly enough being in the Asari body suddenly felt...normal, but you still had all your memories of being a commander, among other things. She seemed to be heavily smirking, \"Thank you for the chance at becoming the true Commander Shepard, Amara. You on the other hand seemed to be disconcerted with the amount of power the former Asari dancer now was holding in her palm. </span></div></div>",

She seemed quite pleased as she nudged you for the device, after placing a thumb to authenticate, she pushed a few buttons causing a beam to shoot out of the device between both of their heads. You'd feel some memories, some skills being pulled from your head, being replaced with something foreign. It finally began to clear up, it was what little there was of her knowledge as a dancer, a bartender among other things she did at purgatory. Each memory was unique but brought some pretty strange thoughts to your mind. The former Asari on the other hand was getting Spectre access codes, memories of N7 training and past experiences. The last thing to be exchanged was financial states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now realized you were quite broke, though typical for a dancer at Purgatory. You just sat there holding your head, the new Commander on the other hand was smirking. \"This is amazing! I have easily 20-30 times more money, and all this training is amazing! She brought up her omnitool, entering the spectre access codes, taking a look at all the info available. \"So this is what kinda authority Spectre's have, this is amazing!\" she quipped, shocked by the amount of info on her omnitool. \"The military grade omnitool is pretty awesome too!\" she quipped as you looked at your dinky little civilian grade omnitool on your wrist.

You could simply show Liara (and arguably, yourself) that the device actually worked! Granted, you'd be putting yourself at risk as a guinea pig, but you felt that it was worth the risk. The device seemed to be safe, and you couldn't imagine why Cerberus would keep it around to begin with if it could pose a threat to the actual user. ...Even IF it was recovered from a storage room filled with experimental weaponry that could turn practically anyone or anything into a glowing pile of dusty goo. Of course, the device wouldn't do so according to its instructions, but the thought didn't help matters. And IF it did actually really work, you knew that you at the very least were putting yourself in safe hands. Or at least, you imagined Liaras hands to be quite safe. While she still was the Shadow Broker, the infamous information broker, Liara was also just Liara, and Liara was (to him) a very kind and humble individual. If it came to the crew (or Shepard himself), she wouldn't let any of them come to harm if it were in her power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising from your bed, you make a mental note to record something for Liara to explain the situation and not have her worry <i>too</i> much about the whole thing. Walking  into a room with practically everything untouched and the occupants (presumably hollow) body lying on the floor would put everyone on high alert, and that wasn't your intention. Liara may read the instructions, but you doubt she'd do that BEFORE she called someone up or took the matter into her own hands. EDI was also around, but  you weren't sure if you wanted to put all of the work on her and her programming. Of course, putting SOME of it on her didn't really hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDI, first of all; please tell Liara that I wish to meet her in my quarters immediately. When Doctor Liara T'soni arrives in my office, please remind her to keep calm and read the datapad on my desk.\" You authorized to thin air, with EDI replying with a court \"As you wish, Commander.\" to acknowledge that she heard your order. Part of you wondered why she didn't question the whole thing, but you shrugged it off as just being something about her programming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat by the desk, device at your side, and opened up your datapad, granting your newest note open for anybody to read. Liara was the only one you wanted up here for this, and she wasn't the type to bring company (unless Glyph counted, but you weren't sure if you wanted to answer anything involving whether VIs could be considered something other than simply VIs right now), so you felt it best to not go through unneccesary security procedures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liara, don't be worried about me;  if you can notice the device next to whatever I'll be, please read its instructions and if if it's wished for, you are free to try me out. If you do, I wouldn't mind you documenting the whole thing, preferrably via video. You can probably ask EDI to fix that for you, she can probably fix that for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saved the note as finished, and stood up in the middle of your room. Your entire body shook, growing more nervous by the second. \"Right.\" You mumbled to yourself, \"here goes nothing.\" For a second or two, you could see a red line followed by a dot placing itself upon your body, before everything went black.</span></div></div>",

If Shepard wanted something from her or just wanted to talk, he'd always go straight to her office, and vice versa if she wanted to talk with him. Both of them knew that they were free to do so, and because it was the most practical way of doing it it was what they did. With that in mind it was understandable why she found this to be a rather... unusual request. It probably meant that Shepard had something to show her, but couldn't he just bring it with him? Was it too heavy to carry with him? If so, how had he gotten it into his quarters? It felt suspicious, and the only real idea she could settle on was that it was a trap, or that he was hiding something he didn't want to risk the chance of revealing to anybody other than her. He had a brilliant mind, and probably realised the risks of whatever this was about. Even with that in mind however, she couldn't shake off the feeling of how unusual it was. She had never seen or heard of Shepard doing something like this before, not to anybody. He didn't like secrecy, so why was he acting this way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepards quarters were oddly quiet, apart from the vibrant hum from the drive-core that could be heard throughout the ship. Shepard had never been a very loud individual , but the room still felt too quiet for anybody to be there. There was nothing that would indicate a living, breathing soul being in there, apart from herself. Of course, the answer as to why lied in the middle of the room in plain sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the godess!\" was the only thing she could blurt out as she stared at the hollow skin of John Shepard lying in a pile on the floor. Before she could fully comprehend what had happened, EDI spoke with that human yet cold voice of hers. \"Doctor T'soni, the Commander asked me to tell you to look at the datapad on his desk as soon as you arrived.\" She wanted to scream something at EDI, demanding an explanation, but she swallowed her urges and slowly tip-toed over to the desk. What apparently was Shepard seemed immobile enough, but she couldn't stop shuddering as she was even remotely close to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of an explanation as she had hoped, the datapad contained instructions on what to do. Turning her eyes toward the Commander, she noticed the odd-looking device lying next to him, apparently the cause of whatever this was. Slowly, she picked it up, almost as if it was going to detonate then and there. It started up with a beep, followed by a hologram describing how the device was used.</span></div></div>",

Another was genuinely curious about if it would actually work as expected, and possibly a bit aroused. Making sure nobody (except EDI, of course) was watching, she put the device down beside the Commander again, and began undressing out of her uniform. Soon, nothing covered her bare blue skin, tiny dark patches all over her that were highlighted by the damp lighting. \"I'm sorry, Shepard\" she mumbled, holding up the heap in her arms. Even if he seemingly wanted this, she felt bad about using him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hollow skin felt oddly warm to the touch, like on a living creature, only without the whole \"living\"-part to it this time. An opening had appeared where she knew the spine's of humans were, and carefully stuck one of her feet in, slowly filling one of Shepard's. It felt weird and uncomfortable, and looked almost horrifying - regardless, she kept going, presumably due to the lack of pain or anything of the sort, only the tingling sensations in her body. With both her feet in, she worked up the rest of the legs, which looked incredibly odd on her, due to her being shorter than Shepard. The whole thing looked a bit saggy, including what looked to be his... Genitals. She had forgotten those, and blushed at it, before trying to keep her mind of it by putting the rest of the suit on. Eventually, she managed to stick her nonhuman head into his hollow and human one, aligned the eyeholes with her eyes, and closed the opening up. In a matter of seconds, she felt her whole body vibrate and change, and before she knew it she was a couple of feet taller, and a human male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Goddess...\" the voice of Commander Shepard blurted out from his new, unfamiliar mouth, prompting him to gasp and shut up. A quick glance at a nearby mirror revealed the muscular, naked body of Shepard himself looking back at... Himself. He blushed, and tried his best to work his clothes on, a bit unfamiliar with how human articles of clothing actually worked. When he was done, it looked... Acceptable, at least. It was better than nothing.</span></div></div>",

EDI doesn't waste any more time and starts putting her legs in to the skin. \"This will not only help you but also help me in gathering information on human behaviour and interactions\". She pulls the suit up around her hips stretching the skin around her bottom.

EDI pulls the face on and it is all distorted by EDI's hair for a few seconds but then it moves for a split second and there is stood a naked Shepard.

You had plenty of staff, he could even take over some janitor or foolhardy cadet about to get himself killed anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard thought of Javik, the ancient promethean warrior he recently thawed out of suspended animation. Maybe Javik would be more open to the new world if he could blend in. Shepard could take him to the citadel. Maybe even have a 'girls night out' as two female crew members. Javik was a tad dour, but maybe some serrice brandy would lighten him up. But who knows what Wrex might do in the same situation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Better to do what you want and apologize later than ask now and almost definitely be told No. Tali nodded curtly and left the room. You looked around the engine room as you waited for her return. The hum of the drive core permeated the area, despite the billion dollar dampeners surrounding it. You brought the issue up to Lt. Engineer Adams multiple times. He discovered that Tali had specially set the dampeners to underperform in non-critical situations by a .00001% margin. The hum reminded her of home on the fleet. You couldn't hold that against her, even if Donnelly complained to Gabby about it ad nauseum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali returned a few minutes later with none other than her bete noire: Miranda Lawson. Miranda was a genetically perfect prodigy, and she'd be the first to tell you so. But snootiness aside, Miranda earned her ice-queen demeanor. And meathead Vega could attest that she earned that killer body in the Normany's gym. Miranda had significantly mellowed out since you first met her. She had gone from a ruthless Cerberus agent to another member of your team, brazening taking a stand against impossible odds. Oh, also you really wanted to sleep with her. Like constantly. Her butt was awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou signaled for Tali to close the door as she walked in. As soon as the lock sealed, you pressed a button on the device and aimed that red dot at Miranda's forehead. Her instincts were sharp. She had drawn her pistol and prepared a warp by the time you finally figured out how to press FIRE. The biotic energy around her hand dissipated as her skintight outfit and skin itself suddenly hollowed out. Miranda collapsed into a heap in front of you. Tali was shaking with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now Commander?\" Tali asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered this for a bit. Tali could pop into her private room to remove her spacesuit and return in the body of Miss Lawson. Then you could show the quarian how what you learned from 'fleet &amp; flotilla' without worrying about infecting her with anything. Or you could try on Miranda yourself. You were the commander after all. You could call dibs.</span></div></div>",

You had seen Tali's jealous glances as you shamelessly flirted with your Cerberus overseer back before you rather dramatically cut your ties with the Illusive Man. Well, you couldn't exactly see what she was doing under that helmet, but you definitely felt it. You were rather curious what Tali looked like under the elegant designs of her armor. Maybe you could try on a quarian skin after this test. Turn about is fair play after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the spot where Miranda's hollow bodysuit in a bodysuit had collasped. Tali had been in such a rush to 'research a powerful new tool for the flotilla' that she left Miranda's datapad while running into a pressure sealed room to change. You picked up the datapad. It was heavily encrypted. Only Miranda's memories and bio signature could unlock it. That'd be a fine first test of the suits' abilities. This was taking forever. You didn't want to rush the reasonably germ-wary Tali's first moments on the Normandy without a suit, well without a space suit at least. As you waited, you heard a knock on the door. You were excited to finally see the true results of the device. Would Tali really look like Miranda?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised to find EDI's robotic body outside the door. EDI was the ship's unshackled AI. She was everywhere. This platform was merely a convenient way to interact with the crew. She had cameras and processors all around the Normandy. Crap. She heard and saw everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard, should I be concerned with footage of Miss Lawson aiming a weapon at you?\" EDI asked in her friendly, but artificial, tones. \"My signals cut out shortly afterwards. I believe that Tali Zorah may be blocking my signals again.\" You praised Tali under your breath. EDI waited for your reaction patiently. She was not judging. She was merely interested. As EDI stood in the hallway, you heard footsteps behind you. Tali must have finally finished changing. About damn time. You turned around to watch Miranda saunter across the engine room in her classic stride. The suit definitely gave Tali those hips you loved to lust. And as you finally managed, you saw the suit had gifted Tali with Miranda's smug smirk as well. If you didn't see Miranda collapse, you would have sworn this was really her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is satisfactory EDI.\" 'Miranda' told the AI in a crisp british accent. \"Will that be all?\" Tali must have been going through Miranda's memories. This was uncanny. She grabbed the datapad from your hands and opened in it a single flick of her wrist. Her other hand firmly grabbed your bottom. EDI had not moved. \"Still unconvinced?\" Tali's impersonation was dead-on, \"we were just playing a bit of roleplay. You know, whips and chains and guns. Ask Joker about it.\" To emphasize her point, Tali squeezed your ass harder. EDI's cameras definitely picked that up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am quite aware of Jeff's viewing habits.\" EDI responded. \"I was merely curious if the device was satisfactory, <i>Tali Zorah</i>.\" EDI's robotic body looked directly at Tali for emphasis.</span></div></div>",

Of course, it wasn't really out in the field - you were just going to go for a walk on the Citadel with \"Miranda\" and test it out some more, and if you had the time study the mechanics some more. The things it could was truly exhilarating, but at the same time you had absolutely no clue how anything created by today's standard tech could pack so much firepower. Being able to transform vastly different species into each other had some incredible scientific proportions, but first... well, it didn't seem to hurt anyone, and both of you could use some fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, the shuttle-doors of the massive Normandy opened, and along with the strutting vixen Miranda came the short-tempered tattooed 'counterpart', Jack. Putting on Jack was your idea of a joke, considering who Tali was wearing - their rivalry was infamous on the ship, and the thought of them taking a friendly walk across the Citadel just struck both of you as hysterical. Of course, you didn't really ask her either - in fear of awaking her biotic wrath. Even as her, you couldn't really understand how she could be so comfortable with showing so much of her body off - all her many tattoos were quite lovely to admire (you always had a thing for tattoos), and to have all the time in the world to admire them felt... Well, you'd like to enjoy it later. Outside your private quarters however, you decided to wear a synthetic leather-jacket over your torso, with some lewd remarks from \"Miranda\" to tease you. She was having a lot of fun being such a gorgeous specimen, and in a way you envied her - but at the same time, being Jack felt... Well, great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Cheerleader...\" you began, resisting the urge to burst out laughing. \"Where are we headed, sweetietoots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda\" laughed in her gorgeous accent as she replied with something typically clean and systematic, much like Miranda often did while on duty - \"Well darling, we could always just go for a walk, take it all in, or if you're feeling a bit more... Adventurous we could hit up the clubs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you weren't much of a party-goer (it came with the territory - you were usually pretty busy with military-stuff), but now you had as much time as you wanted. You could totally have some fun! On the other hand, it was a bit... Extreme, especially considering neither of you were used to this, even if you acted like it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being Traynor was intoxicating, to say the least. Every single little inch of you was now all Traynor, and all of it belonged to you. Her naked body was at your command, and it felt you with a feeling of utter intoxication. You idly ran your new hands across your soft and well-shapen body, and with them followed blissful shuddering. You realised that Traynor (or was it You now?) hadn't finished her shower, and you smiled lustfully to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an occupant now inside, the shower started up, enveloping you in a warm and delightful haze. Your intense erection had somehow been converted into an odd (but just as horny) feeling in your new genitals, but it didn't disturb you - rather, making it much more exoticating. While idly wrapping your new and long hair to the back of your head, you let your hand slowly guide itself to your vagina, slowly stroking the entire front of your body. The whole thing felt so incredible you almost gasped, but you managed to pull through. Masturbating as a girl was entirely different for obvious reasons, but it didn't turn you on - quite the opposite, in fact. Slowly, you stroked the mounds of your new flesh, letting out a faint wimper as you did. The sensation felt like nothing unusual (presumbably due to the part of you that was Traynor), but at the same time you weren't sure you were supposed to move around it. You hesitated slightly, before slowly starting to move your fingers around it, increasing the sensation to practically unbearable (for you) levels. Soon enough, your fingers slipped inside, and you slowly moved them around in a pattern. In, out, in, out. All the while, you couldn't help but let out a few more uncontrolled gaps. You imagined that if Traynor did this by herself, there wouldn't be much sound to think of, but you weren't really sure how to control it, either from your desire to hear a woman moan for you, or because it was so entirely alien that it just wasn't controllable at all. You started to pick up the pace, and with it your levels of pure bliss. Eventually, what could be best described as an explosion of intense pleasure enveloped you as your back arched upward, visibly shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower-beams ran down your smooth skin as you gasped for breath, and took in every minute of it all. To say the least of it, it was absolutely incredible. Nevertheless, you decided to have some more fun, and tried out cleaning your new long hair, which was an experience in and of itself. After you felt like you had at least done an okay job, you exited the shower and dried yourself with a towel. Traynor had brought a spare of her own uniforms with her, which saved you a heap of trouble, and you thanked her for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you exited the bathroom, you took a glance at your new self in the reflection of the glass surrounding yours (or was it Shepards?) models, and smiled to yourself. Wow, you really were Traynor, and loving every second of it. Moving for the elevator, you kind of expected EDI to say something aimed towards what you just had done, but she remained silent. Probably for the better; explaining the situation wouldn't be easy, even if it was to an AI, unshackled or no. The elevator would usually stop one floor above the Crew's Quarters for Traynor, but this time she went straight for them instead. Apparently, Traynor didn't have much of an connection to Liara, never really engaging in a lot of conversations with her unless it revolved around her specifically, and even then it didn't really lead anywhere. Suffice to say, this'd be a chance to develop that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to Liaras room opened up, and Glyph welcomed you in his usual warm and friendly tone, and you implored you noticed with a faint nod in his direction and a smile. \"Doctor Liara T'soni?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething you had forgotten to check before was if you actually had her voice now, which it turned out you actually did, which was something that left a blanket of relief on your shoulders as soon as you brought the question up inside your mind. \"Yes?\" Liara seemed quite busy, much like usual. This, however, made you realise something - you didn't have anything planned to really strike up a conversation with her and get things moving. \"Do you, uh... Have a moment to talk?\" Was this really the best you had? It was something, yes, but even then you weren't proud of yourself for it. Liara seemed to stop in whatever she was doing, and turned to look at you along with a slight and clearly confused \"Yes, that I do.\" You smiled, while struggling to keep up with something to talk about. \"How are things working out for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are... Going quite well. Are they doing the same for you?\" The confusion and lack of words meant to be aimed towards you was clear in his voice, but it was clear that she at least tried her best at it.</span></div></div>",

You shrug a bit looking at the limp Samatha Traynor's skin laying on the ground harmlessly. You switch a setting on the device firing at Traynor's limp husk. As that happens you see her practically inflating back to her normal proportions, she slightly coughs as she pushes herself up, a bit confused as to what happened but as she locked eyes with you, she somewhat scowled. \"Why did you do that to me Shepard!?\" she yelled a little angrily. She balled up her fists before she saw Samara's skin underneath her feet. \"What's this..?\" she said as she sounded somewhat distracted. It was clear to Shepard in the past that she was somewhat jealous that Samara was a powerful Asari that was capable of doing field ops with ease. She wanted to move into field ops but it was clear that it wasn't really possible. Her body simply wasn't built for fighting. She looked to Shepard,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is all this then? What exactly are you trying to do?\" She quipped calmly, seemingly a little curious as to what Shepard was up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou speak up, trying to keep her calm, \"Well, I know how much you wanted to do field ops, and this is well...your chance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks, \"How did you know?\" She goes to lift up Samara's hollow skin. \"So how do I put this suit on, do I just step in and hope for the best or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply nod, watching her as she stripped down (not that she needed to) and climbed into Samara's skin. She tugged it on properly and you watched as her proportions adjusted to Samara's. She became Samara as she let out a grunt in Samara's even toned voice. She smiled, something Samara normally doesn't do. \"I have her voice, her memories, her accent too, this is amazing!\" She seemingly calmed down before assuming Samara's orderly demeanor. \"I'll act like her and go out on this op...do you want another body though, I'm sure in this body I can handle helping you find one with ease?\" You ponder, thinking of the options.</span></div></div>",

Either way, it really felt like someone making of themselves while playing it entirely straight. Like the situation itself, completely surreal. EDI however didn't seem to your view on the situation, instead adopting her singular analyzing gaze everyone used to conversations with the infiltration unit was quite familiar with. No sort of emotion, except the feeling that she's just studying you, constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, EDI...\" You start with to try to break the stunningly awkward situation. Almost immediately, EDI turns her gaze towards you, and specifically you. \"How does testing the device out with us sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander, while I appreciate your expression of not trying to keep secrets from me, to be completely frank I require no real use of this device, nor can I catalogue a situation where it'd be me useful for me or the Stealth Infiltration Unit I currently inhabit. For what it's worth, as far as I'm concerned the device is aimed towards being used by organics. From the few datalogs Cerberus has kept around about the device, it supposedly has the ability to execute its action just as fine with organics as it does with synthetics, however synthetics, however synthetic-testing was quickly cancelled after \"difficulties\" occuring. The logs don't elaborate on this, nor do datalogs only accessible by those of higher authority.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really should've thought the question through. Of course EDI didn't have any real usage of the device! Living beings however clearly did, as was the intention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh, do you have advice to suggest on what to do with the thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frankly Commander, I'd believe sending it in for research would be a valid action, but I believe that you can see the consequences that could appear due to this decision. The choice is yours entirely, Commander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright, that'll be all. Dismissed.\" you replied with a slight wobble to your voice. The infiltration unit simply turned around and went on her mary way. Turning around, you were treated to the sight of 'Miranda' having removed her grip while you were speaking with EDI, and instead was busy with darting her petite fingers across the datapad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo... Just you and me then.\" You said and added a shrug for emphasis. \"It would appear so\", the crisp and stunningly perfect imitation of Miranda answered, looking up from her datapad and meeting Shepards gaze. It was only then he noticed how her eyes shared the clear and bright curiousity of the Quarian enginneer, and the seductive and frosty queen standing in front of you. For everyone not involved in this, this was Miranda, and it was incredible to behold.</span></div></div>",

Imagine what we could accomplish in such small amounts of time with this tech!

Interspecies relationships, no?\" the ice-queen moved seductively over to you, standing intoxicatingly close to you as she stroked your chest with her fingers, smiling up at you. \"That'd be nice, wouldn't you say?\" she cooed, teasingly grinding herself against you. Okay, you had always lusted about Miranda, but now she was more or less grinding herself on you - or well, Tali AS Miranda was, even if the impersonation was stunning, even if she had just dropped it.

You had grown accustomed to her tender touch. You definitely were not accustomed to her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the moment, laying on the floor of the Normandy's boxing ring, her fist was all you could think about. That sucker punch she landed on your jaw took you completely by surprise. You had no idea that her small frame could pack such a wallop. But that was the joy of sparing. That was the the best part of boxing. You really got to meet a new side of someone by watching them fight. That kind of fight is how you won over the meathead James Vega. And you were discovering all sorts of things about an old friend while boxing the slim form of Kelly Chambers. You were impressed by the skill displayed. You had studied pugilism lightly, but you were clearly fighting an expert. And one hell of a pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had enough, Commander?\" Kelly's voice asked you sweetly as she extended a hand. \"Would you like me to kiss it better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed as you accepted the offer. Both of them. You wish you could have seen the look on Kelly's face when you planted a kiss straight on her lips. You'd trade that to see her blush after you felt up her fine ass shortly afterwards. You smirked as Kelly looked to you in shock. \"What's wrong Chambers? Don't I get a consolation prize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched Kelly pause for a moment, glance at one of EDI's display modules, and gather itself. \"I'm still not sure you didn't let me win, there's no way you're this bad at boxing. Best 3 out of 5.\" You nodded with a smile. You wish you had let her win. But it was quite the opposite. You had tried every dirty trick you knew. But your opponent knew more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd you learn to fight like that?\" You asked dumbfounder as Kelly's body assumed the starting pose and showed off her legs and legwork. \"I mean, how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King fu movies. And Rocky. That's about it.\" Kelly's expression looked a little too cocky for her face. It was one part of the illusion was wasn't dead-on. You had told Joker about the device and asked if he had any preference for a non-essential crew member to wear for a bit. And of course, Joker decided to try on the skin of Miss Kelly Chambers. And the first thing he wanted to do was work out as much as possible. Joker had been incapable of straining or impacting his body in any way without severely endangering his health for all his life. This suit somehow made his body strong and stable. And he was gonna enjoy every minute of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDI, to her credit, was letting Jeff do as he pleased. She needed focus to run the billions of tests and re-tests on the Cerberus device you had found. As the boxing match, EDI made an announcement about the device on your private channel.</span></div></div>",

She realised the potential the device had, but far too many questions were spinning around inside her head for her to focus on its potential. Was this reaper-tech? Was it purely Cerberus? Prothean? Some other species entirely? The possibilities felt endless, and all of them were plausible. It seemed to be meant for use during infiltration-missions, which sort-of ruled out the reapers; they didn't need anything like that, what with indoctrination. Cerberus could use it to cleverly infiltrate more xenophobic species to destroy them from the inside, and the Protheans probably used it for the same reasons, if it was from them. As for something else entirely ... If it was something comparable to those three, Shepard didn't even want to imagine its existance. They had problem as it already was, and really didn't need another galactic threat on their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, and loosened her grip on the device. The safest bet was probably to lend it over to Liara and see if she had something that could link it to the Protheans, and/or give it over to Mordin for him to study. While he didn't share Liaras expertise on getting information and the Protheans, he was still one of the most brilliant researchers she knew. Then again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of her ignored the safety procedures she had been trained to follow so many times before. If the device was able to cause great harm to users, Cerberus would probably not have it just lying around. Knowing them, they'd dispose anything that could pose a threat to themselves (or humanity in general, although that was something that could be debated). Surely there was no harm in trying it out for herself? ...Ah, what the hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard promptly rose from her bed, and started to ponder again. Either she could follow along with the safe route like she first told herself to do, or try the thing out for herself. Even if she honestly felt nervous about it, she was still quite interested in what she could do with it. Nothing major, of course, just a little test. But with whom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship was filled with all kinds of faces, ranging from humans like herself and everything from Quarians, Krogan and Turians! She had a lot to pick between, and being human felt like a wise choice, but the rather exotic idea of becoming an alien felt rather... Appealing, as well. While she could always try both, she was unsure on which to start with, and with whom!</span></div></div>",

Giving the device a test-run was the idea, but even then it felt \"safer\" to perform it on another human being. Human into another human, basically. Granted, the idea of becoming an alien was a once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity (not to mention quite... exotic), but if it would come to that, she'd rather play it safe first. Or well, as safe as anything involving the device could be. In other words, not very.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment's notice, Shepard found herself in the elevator, hovering her index finger over the icons, her thoughts playing a session of mind-Pong. The device made her indeceisive; there were a vast amount of humans on the ship, and with the supposed power of the device, she could pick anyone of them, no questions asked or answered. Because of the lack of restrictions, her mind ran amok. Did she want to play it even safer and go with a girl? Try out being a guy? Tall or short? Techie or Biotic? The possibilities felt absurdly limitless, and it really wasn't a good thing (at least not for her current situation). The device felt cold against your bare hand, a contrast to the wet warmth building up in your grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure why, but your mind settled on Ashley. Maybe it was because she was the one you had known the longest, and she reminded you of yourself in ways, or maybe you just had a thing for her. Either way, you had decided on her, for better or worse. You imagined that you could find her on Starboard, at least if you were lucky. Apart from Samara (who only visited the Starboard on random intervals) possibly showing up, she'd be completely alone, which made your plan even easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Shepard noticed as the door opened was the back, belonging to none other than her target, Ashley Williams. Judging from her pose, she seemed to be in thought, idly looking out at the vast reaches of space spanning outside the thickened plate glass. As soon as the door had closed however, the second human spectre was nothing but a pile of empty skin and clothes on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard wasn't as prepared as she thought that she was. Maybe it was the fact that the device actually worked flawlessly, or how she actually made her friend and fellow soldier into nothing more than a wearable suit. Nevertheless, she did her best to swallow her guilt and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hollow skin had somehow gotten itself a opening on its back, which Shepard figured to be what she'd have to use to enter. First, her feet went in, followed by her arms and chest, sticking rather loosely to her like the oddest bodysuit to ever exist. Lastly, she took a deep breath, and threw the head-mask over her own, closing the opening as she did. In the matter of what seemed to be a second, her body changed into that of who the skin belonged to; Ashley.

This however got cut short as you could hear the sound of steps emmanating from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Samara entered, she was met with the sight of a lone Ashley Williams, adjusting something on her uniforms arm.

She gazed into the mirror for a few minutes, striking poses and pulling faces, muttering and laughing to herself as she ran her hands over her 'borrowed' form'. Shepard then unzipped Ashley's outfit and removed the top half, exposing her breasts clad in a lace bra. \"Very feminine for you Ash, I approve!\" Shepard complimented the Lt Commander's choice of underwear as she explored her body in more detail. Shepard noticed that she even had Ashley's mannerisms as well, and if she concentrated she could access her memories too, such as her time with the 212 back on Eden Prime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard got so lost in herself (and in Ashley) that she forgot Samara was on her way. The door chime suddenly sounded and Shepard spun around, unsure what to do for a moment. \"Ah... shit!\" she cussed, looking around. She quickly re-attired Ashley's upper bod, zipping up her outfit before stepping out of the bathroom and pondering what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could answer the door and try to explain why she (Ashley) was in Shepard's cabin alone. Or she could... oh the temptation was too great. She could use her new device on Samara too, and turn her into a wearable suit. A wicked grin formed on Ashley's face as Shepard's imagination kicked in, thinking what it would be like being a beautiful Asari. She walked calmly to the door and answered it, and stood there was the Asari Justicar in all her glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Lt. Commander Williams, is... Commander Shepard here?\" Samara asked, trying to look past 'Ashley'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... she is... sort of here!\" Shepard replied with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not understand!

What do you wish to know?\" Samara replied gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard smirked as she looked at the alluring figure sat next to her, then she took another drink. \"Okay. When was the last time you got laid?\" Shepard asked, eliciting a raised eyebrow from the Asari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By 'laid' I assume you mean sexual intercourse?\" Samara stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god you make it sound so 'clinical'\" Shepard groaned in her borrowed tone. \"And yes, when was the last time you had sex?\" she asked, rolling her eyes as a smile played around her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara paused, then looked towards the door for a moment, before answering 'Ashley's' question. \"Exactly 143 years ago.

I'm sorry I didn't mean to...\" Shepard began apologizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for apologies Lieutenant Commander.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Garrus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't entirely sure as to why Garrus ended up being your first decision for a guinea-pig, but a few ideas popped up throughout your mind. First of all, he was one of the actual \"male\" aliens on the ship, or male in the human sense of the word. Wrex, Grunt, Mordin and Thane also fit that description however, which made you feel a tad stupid, if not simply ignorant. If anything, you'd probably just have to admit something to yourself; something about Garrus simply made you lust after him. Maybe it just was the voice, or maybe something felt incredibly exotic about him being a turian. He was an entirely different culture and species (two things that were the same for all the others), but even then... He felt... Special? Part of you wanted to say that it was the voice, and part of you wanted to say it was the fact that he was a turian; part of you just told yourself to get on with it, which is what you decided to give up and stick with. Nothing was going to be accomplished if you just stood here and fought yourself over what attracted you to Garrus. It was just better to move on, and get things done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to take things in your own hands, and took the device with you to the Quarters where you'd always find Garrus; calibrating the Normandy's vast weaponry, making sure it worked at the absolute peak. The fact that the room was also on the opposite side of everything else in the vast area made things for the better. You moved swiftly over to his door, greeting everyone you walked past. Some of them had a studying look on their faces, presumably wondering why you seemed like something was going to come down, but nobody dared to ask you (and you didn't feel like explaining).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened up after working its locks for a couple of seconds, and as you imagined, Garrus was busy - Not with calibrating, but rather disassembling his trademark Mantis. You assumed that it was due to maintenance, and didn't press the issue. Garrus didn't notice you at first, probably too engaged in the maintenance, but soon enough he turned his head, with a rather surprised look on his face (or well, as surprised as a Turian could look). \"Ah, Shepard. What can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device hung loosely in your hand, and you bit your lip slightly. \"Well, I kind of wanted help with testing something\", you began. The turian rose, and looked directly at you, a sense of curiousity around him like an aura. \"I'm not sure if I'm the very scientific type, Shepard, but if it involves field-work I could probably lend you a hand.\" Were you going to tell him what this was about, or not? \"I guess you could call it field-work, yeah... Not really the type you'd expect, though.\" No, you weren't going to tell him. With a slight wrist-move, you aimed the device at the turian before he could answer or notice the device. It took about a second, before the Turian and his armor fell clumsily to the ground with a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside, you were completely shocked, both at what had transpired, and the fact that you were behind it. At the same time, you knew that you just had to swallow and move on. You did this for a reason, but even then you kind of felt nervous about it. It was someone else, after all. Removing Garrus hollow body through the now completely hollow opening around the neck-area of the armor, you placed the skinsuit on the floor in front of you. You made sure to have the door be locked, and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that Garrus was a vastly different species kind of worried you, while at the same time you felt that it would really test the abilities of the device. Turning a human into a male(!) turian just like that would really be something to write home about. Turians were covered in chitin, which made parts of Garrus harder than she expected. Nevertheless, she now stood completely naked, prepared to become a male turian, so thinking it through now felt like a rather dumb idea. Starting with the legs, she noted how odd turian legs were compared to a humans. at the least, they looked incredibly odd on a human, as they probably should. Next came the arms, with made it easier for her to keep control over everything she held in her hands. Next came his chitin-covered head, and lastly came the head. She wasn't exactly sure what she was supposed to expect, but she closed the opening on the back anyway. In what seemed like a second, she had grown, become an entirely new species, and Garrus Vakarian. She was now He, and that He was Garrus Vakarian. \"Woah.\" was all that came out of your oddly-shapen \"mouth\" which, while entirely alien, felt completely natural to you. Best yet, it had his voice. Exhilirated, you took a deep breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem! This is Garrus Vakarian, of the SSR-2 Normandy!\" You were absolutely shocked by how smoothly the voice came out, but nevertheless you loved it. Another part of you also seemed to enjoy it, growing outward like a branch. Part of you was surprised, yet lust soon took over that job. You started to move your new arms slowly over your chitin, enveloping in their harsh structure. They moved over your new waist, and eventually one of them found them around your turian genitals, and a low growl, similar to something from a beast, erupted from your absolutely alien mouth. God <i>damn</i> was it sensitive, and you wanted so much more of it. Soon after however, part of you started to come to attention. As intoxicating as the whole experience was, you felt that furiously masturbating as Garrus really wasn't the best idea. It'd have to wait, or else you could find yourself a partner. With some help of his memories, you managed to get your suit of armor on, followed by the odd headpiece he always insisted on wearing, which activated with a loud beep. Being a turian felt incredible to say the least, but the question was; how much of a turian were you now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the genitals acting up against the insides of your armor, quite a lot. You defininitely wanted a test-drive of being a turian, and immediately.</span></div></div>",

Walking had been a bit of a worry, but since it wasn't a problem, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how much of a Turian were you, really? You FELT like you actually were the Turian you looked and acted like, Garrus Vakarian - but <i>were</i> you really him (physically)? Well, if anyone could help you with finding out, it was the friendly space-neighbor doctor, Karin Chakwas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stroll over to her offices from the Battery room was rather brief due to the short distance, and you found Chakwas working on something on her computer. u couldn't tell what it was from over her shoulder (too much of her frame shielded the contents of the screen from your eyes), but judging from her body language she was quite engaged in it. In other words, it was probably something important. Seeing as how she was a military doctor trained in field work however, interrupting her shouldn't be a biggie. Besides, you just wanted to go for a quick check-up. ...Hopefully without shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor Chakwas?\" you asked, leaning against the open door-frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChakwas promptly stopped doing whatever she was doing on the computer and turned around to meet your Turian eyes. \"Yes, Garrus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Wanted to do a quick check-up. You know, just make sure I'm healthy. Been feeling a bit... Under the weather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never took you for the superstitious type, Garrus.\" She eyed you curiously while you nervously stepped into the room, closing the automatic door behind you. \"Well... No, I guess something has just got over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, her face unchanged from her calculative and doctor-like neutrality. \"...Alright then, have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe check-up was more akin to something you were used to than you first had expected. With an entirely different anatomy, it was weird, yeah - but even then a human being and a Turian seemed to be fairly similar to humans, with a few key differences (like the mandibles, or the incredibly thick carapace). It also went surprisingly quickly, and before you knew it you were done, and apparently Chakwas hadn't suspected a thing. Her desire to help overshadowed her suspicion, you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the test at least revealed your big, running question - Yes, you were completely, 100% Turian when wearing Garrus.</span></div></div>",

You decided that you want to have some fun to act like Garrus as much as possible. You walked up and greeting many crew members. Nobody suspect a thing and treat you like you was Garrus himself. As for an acting, you know Garrus enough to impersonate his personality and his habit. You said the right words, you laughed at the right jokes and you reacted to anything that Garrus suppose to react in Garrus way. It was really refreshing that you don't have any burden of commander on your shoulder while talking to your crew. You can be more friendly with them or scold them without any consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the real fun to begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have been notice for a long time that Tali had some interest in his now Turian body. It's just a little thing that the way she gazed at him, the she moved her body in Garrus's presence and some of their conversation that sometimes you caught them and some of their sentences really <b>really</b> close to the manner of 'foreplay'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was the reason why now you was standing in front of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...hem\" you cough, clearing your throat. You were going to take to the new step of the impersonation. You had practice enough to be confident with the previous crew member but Tali is another level. She <i>knows</i> Garrus. You definitely sure that if you made a little wrong move, she would be onto you and reveal your secret. You can't let that happen! The galactic's fate depend on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push the button aside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for a mere second then the door was opened and Tali was in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Garrus, what the reason you come to visit me in such a late timing.\" She asked indifferently but you already knew that this was one of their 'foreplay' so you decide to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus was never a ladyman, his skill for picked up a woman was downright to zero. But once you get to know him, you learn that he was pretty loyal and can be considered a romantic type. He could be deep with his word at time and some of his words really made your heartbeat race faster. From your knowledge, you thought that Garrus and Tali was still in a 'long considering period' whether or not to end up with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you decided to rushed it to another step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, appropriate greeting...in Garrus way. \"Oh! hey Tali. I...I was wandering around when err...when this door pad was acting crazy. I thougt it was malfunctioning so I tried to fix it.\" You tried to act nervous and get a relieve when Tali had no doubt that you were really Garrus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the pad. \"From my inspection, I clearly confirm you it was working properly Garrus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well then.\" You acted out like you were in an awkward situation. \"maybe because I already...fix it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali let out a sighed but you thought you spot some expression on her mask that resemble to human's smirking. \"What the real reason for visiting my domain, Garrus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Err you know...it was simple actually.\" You looked away. \"I...think your helmet look sexy...and your purple suit really bring out the supportive waist of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you think she was ready to slap you in the face but she end up let out a laugh that you never heard her laugh before. \"Oh you are really ridiculous, Garrus. You are so bold and naive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha..What?\" You acted like a dumbstruck Garrus. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...\" Then she came closer, destroy space between you and her. Her arms moved up, hug you above shoulder and move her helmet really close to your Turian's one. \"Why don't you just said a simple word for your simple action like...You are interesting in me instead of some aspect of my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to bring something in your Turian body to acted out like human's blushing as much as possible. \"You don't mind if my mandibles may have gotten hook to your helmet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out another laugh. \"Garrus oh Garrus you sure don't stop to amuse me.\" Her fingers started to move along your mandibles. \"I never will mind your precious and cute mandibles of yours as long as you would never mind my intention to use you for your body.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou definitely hit a jackpot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so mean.\" You let out a final hook line. \"But I'm okay with that.\"     </span></div></div>",

Almost forgot about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped your chaotic thought and focused on your beautiful partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore all this, you knew that Tali was attractive even in general term of all species (You thought about some alien that resemble squid, jellyfish, behemoth squid...okay maybe she was not that gorgeous to <i>all</i> species.). But after assumed the form of Garrus, you found that you feel good to look at curve body of hers. You felt more appreciation toward her feminine outfit. Even her mask, you thought that make her more beautiful in mysterious way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more importantly, you felt something warm inside your chest. A feeling that you never had felt before. It increased every time you look at her on the mask where her eyes should have been. Every time you step in synch with her.. Every time you hold her hands, lead the dance and she hold yours, followed your movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou like this feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...love this feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish this moment will never be stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you continued to dancing for a while, you never notice how you two end up hold each other in a hug.

Shepard is my friend. When she had died, I was devastated. I have lost so many members of my family, but her death effected me the most.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her. Your mandible couldn't form a word to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it was unthinkable.\u201d She continued. \u201cShepard still got a bright future. She\u2019s still so young. My brethren are close to their death door with weak immunology, but hers? Her death taught me many things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed a waver in her voice. You hold her tighter to let her know that you were here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of those is fear.\u201d Her body were shaking. You slowed down to let her rest for a moment. She calmed down a little. \u201cTo be afraid of the unthinkable, anything can happens at anytime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and raised her head to met yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the worst fear...\u201d She touched your face...Garrus\u2019s face with her left hand. \u201cI can\u2019t bare the thought that I will lose you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could do anything, she lifted her mask up, showing a glimpsed of her purple face and glowing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she met her lips with yours.</span></div></div>",

So she thought that you were the best at being this male alien anthro wingless bird? She thought that being Garrus was better than being yourself...being Shepard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought that you were being Garrus better than even Garrus himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that you were being getting her words out of context, but you could not help it to lose yourself in that fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said that she like you more that Garrus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loved her better than Garrus ever could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought was morally wrong, but you know what was the reason this thought was created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loved being Garrus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou liked to feel this much love for your true partner, Tali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally admitted it to yourself, you will never want to stop being Garrus Vakarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will fought as hard as you could to keep his skin on you...as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one can be Garrus Vakarian better than himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you...you are Garrus Vakarian, the true one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you vowed that to yourself, you felt something rised up from your cloaca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurian has a penis after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my\u201d Tali hands softly touched around the rising meat. \u201cThis is first time to see this in real life\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, even evolving from bird like species, Turian\u2019s reproduction system resembles reptilian the most. The base was wide and end up in a pointy tip. You looked at it in amusement. From your eyes, you guess it was around 8 inch in length and 4 inch at the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe examined it with both of her hands. You groaned while her hands move up and down along the length. It was more sensitive than the chitin around your cloaca. It rised proudly as if the body want to show how much proud of it new host change of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked at that thought, but Tali skilled palms brought you back to reality. You started to pants. You could not focused moving your claw to pleasure her any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was to go on, you would lose your virginity like this.(kind of)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot let that happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled both of yours and Garrus\u2019 will. Faster than she could react, you pinned her down to the bed. Your tip aimed at area her envirunmental-suit where you could see her vulva was gaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you, panicked in her voice. \u201cWhat are you..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could change your mind, before you came to your sense and how it will be in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoved yourself inside her...along with her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEEEEKK!!!\u201d She shrieked out from a sudden intrusion. \u201cAhHhH~EeEk\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was so immense at first, but then you felt the warmth that engulf the half of your length. The feeling of her muscle moving around you as if they were trying to pull you in further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with her face of ecstasy that was shrouded by her helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed yourself. In a little deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d She tried to shoved you with her hands. \u201c You are too big! The suit will tear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax\u201d You reassured. \u201cThe suit works in space. It is even bulletproof. You know that\u201d you slowly put in one inch deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u201d Her struggled lessen due to the feeling of your continuation. \u201cToo much...and with the suit...it can\u2019t\u201d she started losing her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hugged her close. You let her weight on you breastplate of your armor that survived the disabling by your love. \u201cRelax\u201d you slowly let her weight down on your length. \u201cYou know better about your limit. And I promise I will stop if it\u2019s too much...you just said that I wasted my life without trying this a moment ago, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you to take this?\u201d You felt the hardest of her suit, but her warmth and her lips conversing around you. It almost as if you truly were inside of her. \u201cMy first time...with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped her struggles. You could see determination start to appear in her body language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lower herself down, taking another inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh\u201d she groaned out at sudden fullness inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh\u201d you hold her \u201cyou need to be more relax, think about when we were cuddling..resting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the muscle around you loosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly shoved all of you length inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed and tried to push herself off your spear, but you hold her close. Whispered to her that everything was fine. How great she really was to take all of you like that. How proud you felt for her. How pleasure she would feel after the time pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed like that for awhile. Let your love rested to adjust to the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tali came to her sense, she felt amaze at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas...was that really inside of me?\u201d She asked in disbelieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shifted hour hips a little, Tali moaned out in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled. \u201cHmm..I think it was inside alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at you and then contracted her muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you are the one to let out a shameful sound of pleasure as you felt wall moving along your length, pulled it in a little further than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gritted your mandibles. And slowly pull yourself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali shuddered at the feeling of the length leaving her, the pleasure continued to mix with the feeling of emptiness that appear as soon as Garrus\u2019 spear leaving her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled out till only the tip was inside then you slowly pushed in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time was easier because the suit already made some space inside of her. In no time, she was impaled fully again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to pull out and pushed in. You didn\u2019t know how much time pass till you increases the rhythm to full speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the moan filled the room. You could not differentiated which sound was yours, which sounds was hers. You could focused onto the sensation of your length, your hands that roaming around your love, these feelings that came with your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, this is your body now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched into her mask and only saw your reflection reflecting back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is you, you are this Turian ex C-Sec turned sniper Archangel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let deep voice out and you could only recognize it as your own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will never go back to being a boring human female spectre ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt something rising inside your length, which from <i>your</i> memory from anatomy lesson, you could guess what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the body under you. You only your true love that you may even fallen for her as soon as you met her for the first time, chasing her through Citadel street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed in hard, readied for what to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you, you are Garrus Vakarian. Former Archangel the vigilante. And the crew of the SR2-Normandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel it, it could not be stopped now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will never stop being him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is your love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling rushing through your length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will never stop being yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This feeling was so strong, your mind blanked out for the moment. You even for got to breath.<br>\r\nYou hold her tight, you kept your alien cock inside her, you did anything to keep this pleasure stay longer with you.<br>\r\nTali also stay still, body rigid then her body became like a jelly inside your hold, seems like she also finished the same time as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panted, out of breath, never before that any activity took this much energy from you and that came from a Spectre.<br>\r\nYou slowly pulled out your sensitive organ. When all hormones finally stop flushing your new brain, it began to hurt from the abuse that you push it against Tali\u2019s suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You watched it retracted inside your chitin sheath. Fascinated with turian\u2019s anatomy, you didn\u2019t notice a smack coming to your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d Even though your chitin acted like your natural armor, it still filled with nerve ending that let you have a sense of touch, temperature, and of course, a smacking to the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you thinking, pushing my suit like that!?\u201d Tali yelled at you. \u201cLook at all this mess!\u201d She pulled out the part of the suit that was pushed inside her. \u201cAh! That\u2019s hurt! You stupid turian don\u2019t even know to control yourself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratched your chitin cheek in embarrassment. \u201cI mean you didn\u2019t complain much though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you to stop! You jerks!\u201d She smacked you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! Okay okay!\u201d You hold out your hands to protect yourself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This...was all new for me. I don\u2019t even know what to control\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stupid ass jerk virgin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically, I\u2019m not anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour spear head could\u2019ve killed me! If it even punctured my suit...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax\u201d you laughed. \u201cI have pride of my equipment but I know that it can\u2019t go through a bulletproof leather...yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErgh...I have to clean it first, can\u2019t take risk with anything these days.\u201d Then Tali ran straight to her bathroom. A sound of water raining down can be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also checked yourself after the event. Your length hid itself completely inside your body. You close the hatch that Tali had dismantled your armor. Fixed some of the loose plate that came from her drastic intrusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finished, Tali also came out of her shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can feel safe and ensure that I will not tease you for a long long time.\u201d She said while pointing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed. \u201cHa!

Mind if I take a crash here at your place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you so your duty as a good side-pillow.\u201d Her breathing slowed down. Maybe all of this exhausted her more than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of tiredness, you felt it\u2019s hard to keep your eyelid open. You close your eyes and let her breathing, her warmth lulled you into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You remembered first time that you entered your first academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father said that it was the best that a turian can fine on our home planet. He patted your head to console you to not worry, to tell that you have enough talent and effort to pass this hellhole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt so proud to prove him right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admitted and join C-Sec forces, to follow the man that took care of you since birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never forget how proud your father show through his eyes when you got your rank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, you two would drank together and he told you how much little did he know how to take care of you when your mother passed away, giving birth to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told him that because of him that you could have become a successful turian like yourself today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen like a fast forward, you relieved the memory of your time since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery criminal you captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery shot you fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou practiced till you never miss anymore...at least with your rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst time you met with commander Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat woman was really good at getting shit done. You felt as if with her, she might actually can change citadel for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not sure at first why your heart always beating when she get close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it was just an interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you talked to her. Lived with her on normandy. Knew a bit more about this quarian girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart just kept beating faster each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you knew that you fell in love.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw only white mist surrounding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of it were claw with chitin protected it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in front of you appeared a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn it, was a body that you quiet similar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a turian, male turian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was the same as yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus Vakarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used your claw to touching his neck, checking his pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was only sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that your chitin had the same hue as Garrus\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGarrus.\u201d You grabbed his right claw in yours. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you aware what happened outside or not. I just...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just want to say...thank you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a wonderful life Garrus. So many people look up to you, trust in you...love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you also capable of loving them back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPast hours, I have felt so many feeling...much more than in my life time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Garrus. I will look after your father...your friends...your lover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause they are mine now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven though it sounds really selfish of me but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleep well Garrus...myself...and\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************<br>\r\nYou woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat dream still lingered in your mind. You made peace with former Garrus. You felt a single tear of happiness fallen down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to began your new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt a pleasure that was already building for awhile on your lower body. You looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali\u2019s hands were playing with your little spear head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunted. You felt the orgasm was coming. She must had been playing with it while you were sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the dream then woke up to this, you didn\u2019t have a chance to control yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spurt of white liquid flow on her hands. She then watched your junk hiding itself inside you once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh must have been useful when wearing this armor.\u201d She used her dextrous hands to reassemble your armor crotch area to fully clothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regained your breathing. \u201cYou could\u2019ve wake me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd missed the opportunity? No, thanks. And...\u201d She grabbed something from behind. \u201cI notice that you got a new toy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hand...was Skinsuit Gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your face got pale as a white ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it do anyway?\u201d She examined the gun. \u201cI have never seen a design like this before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour turian brain was heating up, wanting to find a solution to this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could just tell her the truth. Telling her that this is a gun that change people into a suit and change the wearer. Telling her that you are not really Garrus but her commander, Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could lie to her. Telling her that you just found this gun. You don't know what it can do. Maybe show her the note that came with the gun then you two can play with it. Oh the possibility!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s either Legion or EDI.\u201d She said with a grin...which you couldn\u2019t see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinched. \u201cSo you DO have robophobia!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tilted her head. \u201cAll quarians have childhood trauma from geth, so of course, I am bias against robot, but that is not the main reason.\u201d She showed you the note. \u201cEven my doubt that they are alive, I am agreeing that they are sentient. And if this gun do really work then it won\u2019t effect them much, Legion is a collective of cloud units and EDI real AI core is actually on normandy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought, followed her reasons. \u201cSo you think it will be safe for even if this gun does work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \u201cWhat can I say? I am a robophobe. I might just making up shit to get rid of them once and for all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Tali\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine...joke aside, they will be fine.\u201d She said. \u201c..ish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTali!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be such a goody two shoes Garrus. Live a little, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Then she aimed gun behind your back. \u201cBeside, one of our target just walk right into us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a familiar sound of a skinsuit fallen down to the ground. You quickly turned to look at Tali\u2019s victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou that it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She found a hole to enter on Legion's back. \"But this isn't about hate or if I want to do this or not. Think about it! If this technology is real then infiltration mission will be a peace of cake! We can disguise as anyone with just a click on the trigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" She interrupted you before you could finish speaking. You looked at her legs...or to be more specific her left leg. She already insert it inside Legion's, her left leg didn't have the shape of quarian's anymore. Tali tested moving her toes, one of Legion's...two toes thingy also moved according to her will. She lifted her left leg up, the geth's leg also lifted up from the ground. It was weird as fuck to watch a leg that containing so many wires with only few armor plate from your own former armor attaching to a female quarian body...a body of your lover in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...\" She stared at her leg in shock. \"This is actually working!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sweated nervously. \"Tali, let's calm down and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down!?\" She yelled. \"Do you know what this represent? This have just break all the rule that science has created! Even element zero cannot explain this shit! The word I can only think of...Keelah se'lai...is magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know Tali has such a vulgar vocabulary when frustrated. \"Okay, you know now that this is a real deal....so, can we try to restore him back to normal please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head turned to you. You could imagine a looked of a kid that got his toy take away by parents. \"You don't get it, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can be on Rannoch again.\" She continued to insert herself into the skin. Her right leg disappeared, the geth leg inflated with her mass and regain itself back to normal. Her lower half looked exactly like Legion. \"I can go on my home planet as him, those geth will not attack one of their owns. I can see for myself what my ancestors was talking about....what my father saw...what I forget....what my birthplace was like, a place where I can live with this environmental suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not think out anything to say. You didn't understand what it had been like to experience things that she had been through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even with only the legs, I can fell the air...I feel the cold hard floor under my feet, it is the feeling I miss every time I have to wear this suit! Even geth's has sensory input, maybe if I can gain this technology and apply it to our suits, quarian might have our sense back even outside our planet!\" She pulled the skin up. She now started to put her arms into the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may not understood what drive her to do this, but you understood what it feel like to lack one of sense, For you, it was a sense of love. For her, it was a sense of touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished with her left arm. She inserted her right one inside Legion's. A familiar three prongs hand suddenly came to life. Tali tested move both of her new hands in front of her. She used it to lift the skin above her torso till it met her neck. Now, she had a body of a geth, but with a head of a quarian wearing her signature helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This..\" You said. \"This is weird as hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is also weird for me too.\" She said. \"These wires...\" She moved her new hands along the wires that is now part of her body. \"It feels like my flesh. Only the armor part that I'm not receiving any sense of touch. That...kind of make sense I guess?\" She looked at you. Now, her eyes was at the same level as yours. \"Wow! I'm tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniggered. \"You always will be a midget in my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smacked your head...with her new part metal hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww! Careful!\" You could feel some of your shell has been shipped off your head. \"You have a strength of a geth now! You can even punch a hole through my armor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry!\" She moved close to you, examining the damage that she had done to your head. \"It didn't even enter my mind. All my mind was on about...this skin. Oh wow, I don't even have to climb anything to look at your head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, you are tall. I get it.\" You were still holding your head from pain. Maybe you should have Chakwas check on you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Tali made sure that you were alright, she got back to her last part...Legion's head. The curve cylindal shape head with single camera lens was looking at her as if it was judging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathed in...then breathed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she put the head on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helmet shape under the skin started to shrink. The bloated shape transformed itself back to normal. Suddenly, everything seemed to be normal again. In Tali's room, there were two standing figures, one was Garrus, and the other was the geth of Normandy, Legion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal flab surround his eye camera was moving, it was the only thing that can be use to telling Legion's emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Tali?\" You said, unsure about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vakarian?\" Legion's voice still had the same robotic male tone to it. \"Why did you mention creator Tali'Zorah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your turian face paled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is this unit in creator Tali'Zorah room?\" The geth tilted his head in question. \"From this unit memory file, just 3.5 seconds ago this unit was moving along the hallway, 3.4 seconds ago, this unit suddenly had change location to creator Tali'Zorah's quarter. What is wrong with this unit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scary thought came to you. Maybe geth's mind worked too different from normal species. Maybe the skin work differently from yours....maybe Legion's mind had took over Tali's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Legion listen!\" You hold onto Legion's  shoulder. \"Search your program! Do you hear any sound resemble Tali's!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegion stood still for a moment. \"This unit contains 1,183 geth programs as it always has been. Vakarian's query is illogical. This unit does not unserstand the purpose of reevaluation of its program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs almost lost its strength. \"Legion, can you turn your back to me please? I have to inspect something,\" You asked, trying to lure the geth to show him his back, the opening of the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The request is illogical, this unit does not see any reason to comply to this request.\" The metal flab moved back, showing his annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Legion.\" You beg. \"It may answers your momentarily lapse in memory. I have to have a look at your back, it a matter of life and death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe single camera stared at you. \"This unit has already run self scan. All of this unit's hardware and software are operational with 100% capacity. There is 0 anomaly found on this unit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Legion, don't force me to pin you down, please.\" You readied your stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegion posture suddenly became alert. \"This unit will protect itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gritted your mandible. You have to get Tali back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ding sound was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood still, stupefy by the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A message from unknown sender to Garrus Vakarian.\" Legion suddenly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what to react. Legion walked close to you. His speakers lay near your ear pit and whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Wha\" You confusedly counfused by your confusion of Legion's confusingly words. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at your face!\" Legion laughed. It was so weird hearing a toneless robonic laigh of Legion's voice. \"You got so pale that I start to think turians may have a camouflage ability!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gawked at Legion. \"Tali!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegion raised his arms. \"In the flesh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped. You opened your mouth...you closed your mouth. You hit her/him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww!\" Again, it was so weird seeing Legion holding his head in a cutely manner. \"What was that for!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For scaring me to death you dumbass!\" You yelled. \"That was a stupid prank! I almost jump on you and force that skin out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worth it though.\" She muttered quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! I didn't say anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I feel like a geth?\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to control yourself not to smacking her again. \"You what I mean, so spill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is so...focused.\" She answered for real. \"It's like my mind work 100% with anything that came to. Everything I see is so smooth...I can see the damage that I had done to your head, it even has stats!...you might want to let Chalwas check on it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered. \"Anything else wrong with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" She said. \"Other than your injury, Your body matches healthy turian 100%.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt relieve. \"What about Legion? What about his mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with only metal flab to express herself, You could imagine Tali's face smirking at you.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was ready for a fight as you know...I was all hating on Geth just a moment ago. But Legion just wanted to talk so I listened.\u201d Her Legion\u2019s optic light dim down a bit. \u201cHe told me everything. The history of geth, society between us and them, first time one of them gain sentient and...how the war was really started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTali..\u201d From her tone, he knew how history was played out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe...Quarians started the war.\u201d She filled Legion\u2019s voice with her sadness. \u201cGeths didn\u2019t even fight back, they let thenself be killed while their mind didn\u2019t have any respite. They only had question just...why? Why did this happen when they only just want an answer? Why the question about their soul got response with an annihilation?.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus could only listen in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut two things pushed them to the limit. The fear of extinction and the last creator that protecting them was killed. All the time that Legion told me this, I could feel pain of each geths that were in the record. I felt their confusion, loneliness, pain...and loss. So I told him the answer that was long overdue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe geth raises optic to met with Garrus\u2019 eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat...he definitly has a soul.\u201d He could feel a smile through her male geth voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd he is okay with you using his body?\u201d The former female human asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali tilted her head. \u201cActually, he was asking for it. Legion want to create a program from my mind. This program will has the information about individuality, emotion, rationality of non-synthetic to let all geths understand how to others species thinking process. Let each of them gain true individuality...like me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight now, I am just one of many geth programs inside this shell.\u201d Tali answered. \u201cBut I am the one who steering the wheel, all Legion\u2019s programs just do as what I input them to do. I plus all of them become one individual, Legion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you are Tali! You are quarian!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean in this stage, yes. But I have to disconnect myself from other programs to truly think like myself, like Tali.\u201d Then like a switch, her body gesture became rigid. Her metal flab was moving again. \u201cBut current stage, when my programs are all connected and reached consensus, I am Legion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus looked at her...him in horror, this situation seemed really familiar. \u201cOkay I got the point, why don\u2019t you just get out of Legion\u2019s skin now. We have to prove that this process is reversible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegion shook his head. \u201cThat is illogical. Individuality program can only be working on when all programs are connected. That include creator Tali So\u2019rah\u2019s program.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen how long till the program can be completed?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetal flab moved back while the geth was calculating. \u201cApproximately 57 hours 45minutes and 20 seconds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost 3 days?!\u201d Garrus said in alarm and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiving being\u2019s mind is complicate. A translation is needed for each emotions for the code can be understandable by other geths. Please note that it was the time when consider all of this unit programs were given that as the only task.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean it will take more time while you are awake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c....\u201d Garrus could not bear himself to ask the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegion knowingly what the question was, gave an answer. \u201cAt least 1 week till the separation can be possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus could only stare blankly at the geth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you afraid of, Vakarian?\u201d Legion asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in a dazed, The turian didn\u2019t expect the question. \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, Legion ask of you, what are you afriad of?\u201d The geth got closer to him. \u201cI still am the part that you know and love, I am creator Tali So\u2019rah plus more. I contain the same emotions as my predecessor. I am still in love with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tone was so bold, like a declaration. If it was Tali she would\u2019ve act like a tsundere a little bit before finally confess the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd from where I see.\u201d Legion looked down. \u201cThe feeling that you have is the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus also looked down at his hard raging spear boner that came out of his sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It cannot be! Did the act of Tali assume Legion\u2019s identity just turn me on!?</i> But the truth was already in front of him. The evidence that he could not avoid was attached between hid legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegion used his three prongs hand to grab his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turian let out a gasp, the pleasure was different. With Tali, he could feel some semblance of heat from her hands, but with the geth, there was only a touch of cold with a hint of electricity, the sensation from those three prongs was so different from his lover\u2019s former hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, it was turning him on even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurious.\u201d Legion\u2019s male voice was soothing and calming. \u201cMy sensors show that your heart rates went up. Your pupils were dilate from normal range. This indicate that you like the current interaction with this unit. Is this the truth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand movement was slow, torturous even. Like it was calculated to bring out enough pleasure in him to want more...but never enough. Oh god, he would do anything to just let this pleasure to build up, to let him felt it more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand moved even slower. \u201cAwaiting for response.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Ye..Yes!\u201d He could even afford to think of any lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ghost of a grin could be felt from Legion\u2019s metal flab movement. \u201cThe answer is approved. This unit is proud of you, Vakarian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat voice, those touches, all of those combine to bring him at the brink of climax. \u201cTali...please\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand stopped just before he can reach that point.

The rhythm return to bring out most pleasure from his girth. He looked at the cylinder head of the geth and only felt love. His feeling didn\u2019t change even his lover was in different form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe surrendered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite liquid bursted out from the tip of his spear head cock. The new yet familiar sensation of pleasure blinded him for a moment. His knees almost gave up but Legion hug and hold him while let letting his cum stain over the geth metallic chest plate, some of it was even got into inner circuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them stay like that for awhile, a turian hugging a geth like a long lost lover, hiding what might transpired inside their hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So all thats left to do is go through with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard finished his monologue having, at least in his mind, justified continuing if not his actions as a whole. Peeling open the large gash on the back, Shepard stripped down to nothing at all and slowly stepped into the suit. His feet slid into place and as they did he felt the suit tightening around them. Looking down, he saw his usual great slabs of meat were now delicate and dainty, clad in Miranda's usual spandex catsuit. Seeing how well it worked, he continued to push on. Next was the legs which shrank down to a delicously curvy feminine form; a perfect mixture of strong muscles and attractive shapeliness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBit by bit, he edged it up his body in awe at the amazing sight before him. Suddenly he stopped as he realised what was next; his crotch. Slowly, he eased it up a little, feeling his member twitch a little in anticipation as he could not deny enjoying the sight so far and this certainly should be one of the highlights. It did not disappoint. He felt a sudden pressure, like a foot being pressed to his crotch, before it suddenly released and it felt as if his crotch were wrapped in a perfectly tight... something. Of course this was Miranda's suit and the reason why there was no discomfort or tightness was Shepard's usually decently endowed crotch was now as smooth as the carbon fibre desk before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet this fixation was cut short as Shepard thought he heard a door open behind him, slowly turning around he saw...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Under one of the latest skirmishes against a Cerberus base, Shepard and his/her team uncovered a treasure trove of experimental technology, ranging from gigantic plasma weaponry that could probably tear a hole through any imaginable alloy to tiny technological \"toys\" with odd but incredibly unique features. As it turns out, one of these small \"toys\" ended up on the Normandy, in the hands of one Commander Shepard. He/She wasn't quite sure how he/she had actually managed to carry it with them (the tech they actually barged was air-lifted, not touched by any existing extremities), but somehow a finicky piece of tech had practically attached itself to his/her armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she/he was completely alone in their cozy little room, she decided to play around with the thing by himself/herself. After a bit of looking for any kind of button or lock or anything at all to indicate the item was something on its own, she/he finally made the thing emit a faint buzzing sound, and what looked like a barely visible dot appeared on his/her wall, with no obvious effects whatsoever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying around with it some more opened up a hologram of the items instructions; apparently, the apparatus was the \"ultimate disguise tool\"; it transforms any living being into a hollow suit, that can be worn to transform the wearer into the creature or individual the suit originally was. Putting on and removing the suit would be enabled by a tiny zipper that appeared on the back and/or front of one's new body, depending on the anatomy of said creature. This zipper would only appear if the user wills it, making it incredibly easy to hide. One would also be able to get every single detail and powers the being inhibited; non-biotics could become biotics and vice versa, among other things. The device also had a unfinished feature, which would let the user partially explore most of the beings mind, allowing the user to pass off as the being much easier. The device also transforms the user completely into the being down to the DNA once the suit is sealed, but the user is able to return to their original form once the suit is removed. The user retains full control over themselves, even when tapping into the suits mind and personality. The user always stays in control, and never loses it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile completely shocked at first, Shepard soon started to realize the potential this thing had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you can see in the rather brief backstory, this is a interactive story about characters in the Mass Effect universe. First of all, <b>please expect spoilers! </b> While this story is placed in an alternative universe where every crewmember in the entire series are collected upon the Normandy, and everyone is alive (including both Virmire survivors). This is to make it much easier to just get into the story, rather than dwell on tiny decisions (like if you want to do ME3 or ME2). However for characters that are NOT part of the Normandys crew, all is fair game (these can be killed off or not depending on your choice, that is entirely up to you).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main idea of the interactive part is that the story always goes in two directions, following the spirit of the games: you either go the Paragon-route, or you go the Renegade-route (or Paragon-Renegade-Paragon or whatever, do what you want with it). The main concept is that the routes split into these two directions, and then things continue from there. Also important to note is that the Paragon-choice always starts with a capital P (P: Do this thing!), and Renegade-choice with a capital R (R: Do this thing but in a badass way!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules for this story:<br>\r\n* Paragon or Renegade-choice (explanation how that works above) only!<br>\r\n* Sex of all forms is okay! (Rape however, is out of the question) Descriptive sexual scenes are also a-okay, but try to keep it a bit classy!<br>\r\n* Anybody could romance whoever! (So yes, you can totally pair Jack and Grunt together by some miracle)<br>\r\n* PLEASE proofread your stuff before you post!<br>\r\n* On another note, please don't write one single sentence (or two-three) and pass it off as an entry. I know it's often a very arduous task to actually come up with a lengthy and good entry, but please try your best!<br>\r\n* Do not copy any other entry and pass it off as your own. Entries that are blatantly copied from other entries will be removed.<br>\r\n* Even if this story is limited to one fandom, please try to let your imagination flow! I'm very sure you can come up with some great entries that way!<br>\r\n</td>",
