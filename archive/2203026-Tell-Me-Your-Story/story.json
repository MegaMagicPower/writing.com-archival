Almost never seen by you, but they see you. <br>\r\nWhat do you think my brother has? <br>\r\nSome sort of psychic ability to see spirits?<br>\r\nI know he does.<br>\r\nHe can see them when no one else does.<br>\r\nThere\u2019s a special gene in my family, allowing some to possess strange powers.<br>\r\nIf my mom could see the future, then probably he has a power too, right?<br>\r\nLemme guess, you don\u2019t believe me.<br>\r\nBut it\u2019s true, I would have never survived the 2011 Japanese Tsunami if she couldn\u2019t.<br>\r\nAnd all it took was canceling a plane flight.<br>\r\nThat same plane I was about to take was destroyed by the tsunami.<br>\r\nI <i>know</i> that I wasn\u2019t dreaming.</span></div></div>",

I didn\u2019t go there...\u201d He paused and gave me a solemn glance.<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d They never mentioned this before, and 9 year old me couldn\u2019t quite comprehend this.<br>\r\n\u201cI went to an abandoned house,\u201d He continued, \u201ca walk around the block lead me there. I saw someone quite peculiar. He was my exact opposite, with snow white hair, pale blue eyes, and light skin. We eventually bet that if he won a chess match, my family could be killed-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cYou what?\u201d I looked at him, trying to keep my cool. Did he really be a total jerk and risk our lives? Doesn\u2019t he know we only get one life?<br>\r\n\u201c-and I would be banished to the spirit world for billions of years. If I won, he would be banished. If I could beat him with only two pawns, he would be banished forever.\u201d The look on his face had a calm smile.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you did?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPrecisely-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d I rolled my eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cWell I won and that is how you are alive right now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPromise me you will never try to find him...\u201d His voice grew thinner and thinner as his eyes closed. <br>\r\nAfter that, he continued to talk as if no time had passed. I shivered, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice.<br>\r\n\u201cI... I\u2019m just going to read in my room.\u201d I said quickly, as I shook with every step towards the door.</span></div></div>",

This room has no occupants, nothing that could breathe in the vibrant air and know it for what it was. However, there was a body of a man laying head down on the table as if merely sleeping.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Within the unmoving body, a soul struggled with its condition, being that its connection to its body was severed but the thing could not leave. The struggle rang like a bell through the aethyrs, calling, then, the Dark Angel himself to grace the room and quiet the soul. Death brought the calm that would separate the soul from the body for the final time.  He exuded a sense of belonging that should have felt wrong for a Reaper such as him, but in truth, He delivered rightness to the wronged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once the soul was removed, the Reaper released the soul up and onto the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some winds travel the universe, but some must feed the earth and its creatures\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
