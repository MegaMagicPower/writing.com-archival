She was 19, your older sister by only a year and a half, and had just completed her first year at college. You'd almost forgotten she was home, being that she just arrived yesterday. She sits across the table from you, pouring a bowl of cereal, and still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's got you so happy?\" you wonder out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... don't worry about it.\" she says, placing a spoon between her grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eat your cereal in silence for a little while longer, but she doesn't stop smiling. Eventually, you can't take it. \"Alright. Really.\" you say, the annoyance very easy to read, \"what're you so giddy 'bout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drops the spoon into the bowl and stands up, walking over to your side of the table. She pulls on your arm, saying \"Just stand up, you'll understand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see the-\" you begin to say, but she cuts you off, pulling your arm up harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it.\" she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan and stand up, looking at her face... then at her bare feet, then her face again. She was right, you did understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... You're... taller? How-\" you start, but she cuts you off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! Isn't it great!\" She grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister had always been short. All throughout childhood- even by the time she was 16 she only reached a tiny 4'8\". She always hated needing help reaching things off tall shelves, and wanted to be taller, but she hadn't grown since... at least until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious she had grown, but you weren't really aware by how much. You decide to ask. \"When did this happen?... How much taller-\" she once more speaks before you finish. You'd be annoyed if she didn't do it so frequently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just happened last night. When I got out of bed something felt off, so I measured. It ends up I grew almost...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once she finishes her cereal, she goes upstairs and gets into the shower. You decide to go downstairs and watch some TV before looking for something to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long until your sister comes downstairs from her shower. \"All my other clothes fit too... weird huh?\" she states, tugging on her shirt. You open your mouth to state how crazy this all is, but the doorbell rings as you do. \"Oh. She's here.\" Your sister grins, as she runs upstairs to get the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later of muffled voices and shuffling above, your sister comes downstairs with your mutual friend Sarah. You and your sister have known her since elementary school, and you largely consider her to be one of your best friends... alongside Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. What'd you think about her sudden change?\" you ask Sarah as she enters the room, motioning towards your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah laughs lightly saying...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have $20 so now that I think about it, the biggest bag of chips are only $2.14 after tax.\" \"Showoff!\" Replied Sarah. That comment was in the regards of you easily calculating the tax in your head so fast. You had always been really good in math.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You leave on your bike. By the time you realize that your idiot of yourself probably should have rode something bigger, you were already at the store. You could not believe that you made a stupid mistake during calculating tax. \"It is food tax for chips, you idiot!\" You say to yourself<br>\r\nSo instead of only being able to buy 9 bags of chips, you can get the 9 bags but with more cash left to spare. Right as you walk in you can't beleive your luck! Laying right there on the ground, is a $20 bill. You pick it up. So now you can buy 18 bags with $1.48 left over! So you get an 89 cent candy bar after the chips and candy bar were added, then the tax, the total was, $39.43. So 57 cents left over, so you grab gum for 50 cents (for you of course) out of a gumball machine than donate the 7 cents left to a charity box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back, Lilly tears the bags out of your hands and begins tearing them open and eating them. Then you realize maybe you shouldn't have bought so many. You see her litteraly getting bigger and bigger. Keep in mind the roof seperating floor 1 and floor 2, is only 20 feet. (Your parents bought a big house) But Lilly was gaining on that quickly as she hits the roof, (after about 5 bags of chips.) she crawls out the door, thankfully not damaging the house or its current occupents in anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was done with all the bags of chips and the candy bar, she capped out at about 28' 3'. You and Sarah gaze up at her, but the sun blinds you. So you shield your eyes and Sarah's jaw is somewhere in China now, so she will have to learn not only Mandrian, but other types of Chinese, as well. Lilly then says, (to your eardrums it sounds like thunder) \"Imagine what the reaction will be when Mom and Dad comes home from vacation!\" You had not thought about that and neither did Sarah. So you are now kicking yourself literally and metaphorically and you wonder if you can ever bring her down to her normal 4' 8\" again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly something happens.</span></div></div>",

These are waaaay tighter than when I took them off\" She says perplexed. Looking at the shoe you can see she's not joking. They look like they're going to burst off her feet. You can see the shape of her toes through the material at the front of the shoes. You're not surprised to see the grin return to her face as she wriggles her toes, straining the material even more.<br>\r\n\"I had to order these things online you know, they don't make these for women in my size. These are actually a men's size 13, AND I'M EVEN BURSTING OUT OF THEM HAHAHA!\" She laughs, rattling your ear-drums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the question is will she be able to get them off or does she need your help?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was huge now, the last spurt up in size had pushed her even closer to the ceiling and if you stared straight ahead you were staring straight into the tops of her breasts. Which wasn't a bad sight at all, her bra was struggling to hold her larger breasts in place despite having scaled proportionally with her. Wait had her breasts grown slightly faster than the rest of her? Now that you had noticed it, her hourglass silhouette seemed more exaggerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the amount of exercise she did her body had always had an hourglass shape that drew attention away from her equally impressive toned muscles, that had been forged with her endless need to compete with other people in sports.<br>\r\nNow that she had been scaled up so much her physique made her appear like some type of amazon, or Valkyrie. This coupled with her stern expression and stance was sending slight shivers down your spine. Perhaps you shouldn't have asked so abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been a great friend to me for a few years now,\" she slowly begins to reply. \"You know how competitive I get, and you know I love being tall. It gives me an edge physically and mentally in sports and as well as that I just love being that much... more than everyone else. So if I'm enjoying this, I'm sorry but you're gonna have to get used to it.\" Her eyes were still burning into yours, when suddenly her expression softened and her classic grin returned, \"You don't need to worry though. No matter how big I get you know I'd never hurt you\" She reaches down and ruffles your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief floods into you as you remember how much of a gentle giant Jessica is to you. \"Sorry for doubting you, Jess,\" you sigh \"Seriously though, you don't know what is causing these growth spurts?\" You ask again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into her face to see a mischievous expression... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A strange stretching sound filled the air, and Obsidia's expression turned to one of confusion, then even greater glee, as all six foot eight of the already extremely tall villain began to stretch larger, her butt slowly becoming almost too large for her throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out an echoing evil laugh, and with some slight difficulty, stood up from her throne, her proportionally larger butt and breasts jiggling slightly. She noted with delight that her supervillain outfit had stretched with her, the impenetrable black latex squeaking slightly as she walked her enhanced body over to the chained superheroines, several of whom were trembling. She was already far physically superior before she had started to gorge on their power, and her massive height meant for sure that she would be able to utterly dominate any of them in a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObsidia saunters past you as you salute, banging a fist to your chest as you held your rifle in your spare hand. You were completely devoted to the supervillain, and your unquestioning loyalty and marksmanship had gotten you promoted to being the bodyguard of the most powerful woman in existence. Obsidia turns, her long black hair trailing through the air, her piercing green eyes searing into your soul even through your helmet's visor. You offhandedly note that she was rather pale from her time spent inside her fortress. Perhaps going somewhere sunny would benefit her vitamin D production, if nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Escort these wretches to their cells. They are weakened now, so they will be unable to escape.\" You thump your fist on your chest again. \"Yes, mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something odd happens. For a brief moment, Obsidia's face changes expression from sheer powerlust to... Gratitude. She even smiles. \"Thank y-\" she catches herself midsentence, confusion now dominating her face. She shakes her head and resumes her normal demeanour. Out of the corner of your eye you can see one of the weakened heroines smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So, shall we continue Obsidia's storyline and watch the Shadow Mistress become more and more kind, or do you want a different storyline?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Firstly, you were rather tall - not the tallest, but still tall enough to be able to look down on pretty much everyone, at six foot six inches. You were also rather... proportionately large, for a demoness, with breasts the equivalent of the E-Cup sized bras the mortals used, and with a behind just as large!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another thing about you, though, one that was completely unheard of before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou... liked the humans. Not as toys, or slaves, or strange pets as other demonesses did. You simply liked humans. In fact, you thought they could be rather cute at times, and positively adorable in the right circumstances. This view was, of course, not one that many of your fellow demonesses shared. Most of them simply couldn't comprehend how you could feel such affection towards humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, you floating in midair, flapping your large wings to keep you in flight. Sweeping your long black hair out of your face, you push it to the left as far as you can, and think about what to do next. You suddenly feel a shudder running up your entire body, and look over your blood red skin, trying to find the source of the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, it must have been the patterns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince your first memory, you'd had a set of swirling black patterns covering a fair portion if your body. The patterns changed every now and then, sometimes cutting across your almost-flat stomach, at other times covering small sections of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body shudders again, and you feel yourself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly moan as your demonic form is flooded with a pleasant warmth, and you begin to stretch taller and larger. At first gaining centimetres, then slowly growing in terms of inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel hot pulses of warmth throughout your body, each one adding an inch to your height as you breathe heavily, not noticing your massive size of seven feet tall, before you slowly blow up even larger. All too quickly, however, your growth spurt stops, leaving you at a towering, commanding, intimidating, eight and a half feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have time to think about why your patterns caused these changes to you, you feel the space around you disappear-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you reappear inside a human's house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to crouch slightly to fit in the room, as you were almost half a foot too tall for the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, what are the human's room and the human who has just caught sight of you like?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And indeed, you find yourself standing in the center of a carefully laid out circle with another circle inside of it and summoning runes inscribed between them. And inside of the inner circle is the pentagram shape that completes the summoning seal and apparently brought you here. This human, shrouded in the shadows of the dark room and a cloak, seems to know his stuff. A quick glance above you informs you of the human's critical error: the seal on the ceiling, which your head brushes against, is roughly a sixteenth of an inch out of alignment with the one on the floor. The seal that was supposed to summon and bind you to this mortal's will was imperfect. A mistake that could doom the human world to an eternity of suffering - were it nearly any other demon but yourself. This human though doesn't seem to know his or her mistake yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling playful, you decide to play along with what the human was likely expecting of a demon. You open your wings, swish your spear-tipped tail back and forth behind you, clench your hands out, screw your face up into a terrifying snarl, and speak in your deepest, intimidating voice, \"Tremble, mortals, and despair! DOOM has come to your world!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your internal amusement, the human's eyes expressed just a hint of concern covered beneath the thin veil of confidence. He says, \"Y-yes. Right. Being a demon and all...Well you're under my control now, demon, and you will do exactly as I tell you!\" This serves to amuse you even further, and you decide to show him...the error of that thought by stepping out of the summoning seal. You say, still keeping up the evil demon act, \"You were saying, mortal? No one commands the great and terrible Maura, Defiler of Worlds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark robed summoner's scent changes slightly: he just wet himself in terror. You watch as he mumbles about what he's done and attempts to flee, but then trips and falls on his own robe. The identity is revealed to be a young male, roughly nineteen or so, and he's cowering in fear. You start giggling, and then outright laughing as you reveal your ruse. \"Pfft! Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh you should have seen the look on your face when I stepped out of the summoning circle! And you bought the 'tremble, mortals, and despair!' act hook line and sinker! That was priceless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man stops cowering once he clues in you're not about to claim his soul and questions, \"...H-huh? That was all just an act? But...you're a demon!\" You giggle some more and reply back, \"Very perceptive of you! Have a cookie!\" you snap your fingers and a sinfully delicious double chocolate chip cookie appears in the human's hand. He's reluctant to eat it, however, so you encourage him with, \"It's not gonna cost you your soul, just accept it! Besides, now I'm feeling a little bad for making you wet yourself, funny as it was.\" The human finally accepts the cookie and eats it, clearly enjoying it, and you explain, \"Your summoning seals were off by a sixteenth of an inch. If they're not exactly aligned, we get summoned, but aren't bound to the summoner's will. Luckily for you, I'm a rare breed of demon. One who hasn't any desire to destroy anything, really.\" You then ask, \"So...obviously, I'm Maura. What's your name? I can't keep calling you 'human' or 'mortal', you've obviously got a name... Also, why have I been summoned? You don't seem to be much of an expert at this summoning thing, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy tries to come up with some impressive name, but then a female voice calls from above, \"COREY, WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE?!\" Corey sighs and yells back, \"NOTHING, MOM! IT'S JUST THE TV!!!\" Looking to your left with the dying light of the summoner's seal, you spot a lamp. A gentle tap rewards you with it turning on and enlightening the room to a much improved degree as the seal's glow finally dies out. It's clear now that Corey had summoned you in his mother's basement. He then answers, \"Well, you just heard my mom call my name... As for why I summoned you...well, I never actually believed in this sort of thing to be honest. I got dared to do it by Emily. She's my friend, and is WAY into all this occult stuff... To be honest, when she said exact, I thought she meant exact to within a slight margin or error.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Has to be exact, no room for error. An angel might go with your will anyway, provided it isn't destructive. They're nice like that. Demons? We tend to buck our summoner first chance we get unless we really like the way they think.\" You say, and then ask nicely, \"So...I guess you can tell your friend you were successful then! Uh...can you send me back now? This space is kinda cramped...\" The look in Corey's face says it all even before he actually says, \"Uh...eheh...about that... I, uh...I can't. I...kinda accidentally ripped a page out of her book when she dared me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And that page was the one that instructs you on the unsummoning seal, which appears beneath the summoned being and sends them back from whence they came whether they want to go or not. Ho boy. You're in trouble now...\" You say with realization. Corey asks, \"Why? Y-you're not going to kill me, are you?\" You shake your head and point behind him, saying, \"No, but she might.\" You casually wave hello at Corey's mom as her face is nearly as red as yours with anger and she asks venomously, \"Who and what is that, Corey? She's a little more than 'just the TV'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you start to feel a warming sensation accompanying a familiar shudder. Hastily, you say, \"Look, as much as I'd like to let you two finish your conversation...I'm about to break your house. I really don't wanna do that, so...can we finish this conversation outside?\" Without waiting for an answer, you tap the lamp again to turn it off and then snap your fingers. In a flash, you, Corey, and his still furious mom are outside in the surprisingly nice, sunny weather.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Such a combination was like candy to most demons, but you're not one of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, your...rather alluring outfit of black is keeping up with your growth. Sure, it was doing that back in the demon plane, but you're nonetheless find relief that it keeps up with you in this world as well. There's only so many times one can snap their fingers just to replace and refit clothing before you really want to do something else. Still your body keeps growing as 15 feet soon bows to you, and then 17 feet is next. Finally, at 20 feet in height, things start slowing down and you stop at 25 feet tall. The two humans before you seem...utterly adorable at this size somehow, but you're glad nothing was harmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corey, who and what the hell is she?\" his mother demanded again, and you decide to answer her. \"Well I'm not from Hell if that's what you mean, even though I am a demon. That place is but one area my kind reside in. Don't worry though, I'm actually almost as gentle as an angel...well an angel with demon wings and tail. Horns and hooves never did suit me... As for who I am, I'm Maura!\" you reply kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey's mother takes these words into consideration, it seems, and then asks her son, \"So you mind telling me why...Maura is here in our world, Corey?\" The boy looked nervously to you and then back to his mom before finally fessing up, \"I-I got dared to try and summon something. I didn't think it would work, and I certainly didn't expect a hot demon girl to come out!\" You can't help but blush at the complement, though it's hard to tell on your always red face. You giggle slightly and say, \"Oh, stop! Flattery will get you no where!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey's mom then tells him, \"You SUMMONED A DEMON TO EARTH?! ARE YOU (yay)ING CRAZY?! CAN YOU EVEN CONTROL HER OR SEND HER BACK?!\" Clearly, she's...not happy. \"Uh...no, his seal was imperfect so my will is my own, and he doesn't know how to send me back. I'm...eheh...kind of stuck here.\" you say, poking your index fingers together with slight nervousness. A normal demon would have turned her inside out and consumed her soul, or some other gruesome act, by now. But again, you like humans in general. You then add, \"But didn't I just say I was about as gentle as could be? Your house is still perfectly intact, your yard is still perfectly intact, and your son is still perfectly intact! I don't know why I'm growing like this, but I intend to do my best not to harm anything along the way to...wherever this takes me.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe...maybe this Emily girl would know what to do? It was apparently her idea for the cute young man to summon you, (or at least summon something and you happened to be it. Maybe your markings had something to do with it?) perhaps she's versed in the seal that could send you back? It seems like a good idea to try...and Corey did promise the girl to show his result, did he not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, Corey. I don't think your mom likes me very much. And I need your help in finding where this Emily girl lives.\" you say in a non-commanding voice. You wanted his help, needed it even, but you aren't about to force him. So if he doesn't wish to help you find Emily, then...well, you're going to have to try to find her yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...s-sure! Wait, w-what do you plan on doing to her?\" Corey asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou respond, \"Why, introduce myself of course! She wanted you to summon something, right? So she's going to want proof of your success. Maybe she might know something about how to send me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Corey relents, out of breath from following after you. He's not overweight or anything, you just move especially quickly being 25 feet tall and all. \"But...you carry me. Can't...keep up with you...on foot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it, and ultimately say, \"Sure thing. Just a bit of word of warning; I'm hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can see that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head with a slight blush and explain, \"You're so flattering, but that's not what I meant. My body temperature is like putting your hand on black asphalt on a July afternoon after the sun's been beating down on it all morning, in human perspective. Demons don't get cold easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently pick him up around his middle and then open you hand palm up for Corey's comfort. As much as you're sure he'd enjoy being placed between your huge breasts that could earn a more perverted man a spot in the second circle of Hell, and you yourself might, you don't want to risk his life in the event you grow again and he falls out. In any event, you're soon on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey comments, \"Wow, you weren't kidding...but what you described is hotter than this. This is actually...almost relaxing. But then I'm in my clothes, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at the comment and continue wherever Corey directs you to head. While you're doing this, you keep your tail tucked up against your back to keep it from colliding with anything and use your leathery wings to lift you above the ground when it seems like something may be in the way that you don't wish to accidentally break. Your demonic (by nature) power is best reserved for the absolutely unavoidable, or for peace offerings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut do you make it to Emily's place without a growth incident?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A part of you is slightly disappointed in that fact, as growing felt quite pleasant, but that was outweighed by the relief of not causing further trouble because of it that would potentially need to be fixed after. You lower Corey to the ground gently so he can go speak to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should try to get Emily outside, shouldn't I?\" Corey asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, that would be nice...\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch Corey go over to the door and ring the doorbell. While he's there, you decide to silently experience things through his eyes and ears. You'd ask permission, but then that would probably lead to a lot of questions for something he's hardly going to notice. Through him, you see yourself as he waits for Emily to open the door, from your long and slender bare legs to your prodigious bust which your revealing top seems to only just contain. You smile and say, \"Shouldn't you be watching the door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey turns around and soon Emily opens the door. \"Hi, Corey! Come to admit that you can't summon anything?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Corey's eyes, you can see that Emily is a decently attractive girl...at least from the collar up. Below that point, she's skinny but sadly lacking in terms of curves. And she's kind of short, at what seems to be 5 feet tall exactly. You hate to do it, but you quietly dig into the girl's mind to see whether she knows the seal to send you back. Sadly, you can't find anything about that, but you do discover quite the interesting fantasy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...no, actually. I succeeded...\" Corey says and steps away from the door to let Emily get a good look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you summoned a demon?! And a female one, no less?! Please tell me you didn't screw up the alignment and she's completely under your control...\" Emily shouts with disbelief and then worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missed it by that much!\" you reply, holding your thumb and index finger to within a quarter of an inch (by your perspective) of each other, and subsequently seeing Emily's eyes almost pop out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. (yay)...\" Emily says finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tremble, mortals, and despair! DOOM has come to your world! For I am DIABLO, LORD of TERROR!\" you snarl out before returning to your normal voice and saying, \"...Yeah, if you're expecting that I'm going to have to disappoint. Maura's my name, chaos and destruction is not my game. Your friend Corey is one heck of a lucky guy for having summoned me rather than another demon, considering most who haven't full control of my kind tend to suffer...grotesque and gruesome fates, to put it mildly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily breathes a sigh of relief now that she knows you're actually a very nice and gentle demon, and then asks, \"So, um, are all demons as big as you? And why do I get the feeling you need something of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're a smart girl, Emily, that's why! No, while I'm normally somewhat intimidatingly tall for my kind, even I'm not supposed to be this big. I've been growing in spurts ever since just before I was summoned here, and, well...I don't think I'm going to stop. As far as these puppies are concerned, again I've always been incredibly well endowed but not quite like this.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey continues by saying, \"She was about 8 feet tall or so when she came here. But...we don't know the seal that's supposed to send her back to her plane. Maura and I were kind of hoping that you knew it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same one that you ripped out of my book? The same one I was studying at the time? I was hoping you had remembered it and could demonstrate it to me! Granted, I was also hoping you'd summon something definitely harmless like a fairy or something...\" Emily states, and your heart droops with your hopes. You're truly stuck in this plane after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the fairy comment, you say, \"Fairies and harmless don't go together, Emily. They may be tiny, but if you underestimate them you might find yourself being beaten up by a tree. Not an ent, a tree. Ents are normally mobile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you feel that warm and pleasant sensation again. The one that indicates that you're about to grow. Thinking quickly, you snap your fingers and everything within several miles is now invulnerable to you. But how much are you going to grow?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were gaining several feet a second as your body pulsated with pleasure, your black dress mysteriously growing with you.

You're huge! That house is like a doll house compared to you!

Do you think you could find the incantation to return me to my realm BEFORE this gets any worse?\" Suddenly, the tiny woman regains her senses and sprints inside.

Every single job application you sent to various restaurants sent not a single reply. You took this as a polite way to decline your attempt to make money over the summer. It's time for Plan B, one that you resented, and for good reason-- babysitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dug through the trash in your room and found the flyer that you quickly ignored at first, but now is the perfect time to use it. It read, \"Babysitter wanted, work 3-9 pm Monday through Sunday starting June 23, 15 Baker Way. Note: We are worried about Kimi. Call Tyson and Yuma Stevenson 555-7932 for more information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou called the number as instructed, and asked about why the Stevensons were worried about Kimi. \"There's an article in the news that we think correlates to something wrong with her. Could I get your email? I'll send it to you,\" came the reply. You obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you got the email, as promised. The headline read, \"EXTREME CASE OF GROWTH LEADS TO SIX-YEAR OLD'S DEATH\". It revealed the story of a girl in Saudi Arabia who started to grow taller and taller, far beyond natural growth, until the Arabian government labeled her a threat and had her killed by the Arabian army. On the day of her half-birthday, she started growing, and 2 days later, the colossal girl measured 38 feet 7 inches tall, and scientists say she would've grown taller had she lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does that have to do with Kimi? you thought. Sighing, assuming the parents were crazy, you called the Stevensons and took up the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived at the Stevensons' house and knocked on their door to be greeted by Kimi herself. \"Are you the babysitter?\" she asks with a smile on her face. \"Yeah, I'm supposed to be with you for the summer,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thomas!\" Tyson Stevenson appeared from the kitchen. \"Come on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute kid,\" you tell him as you walk inside. The 2-story house they resided in made yours look tiny. \"How old is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, she's tall.\" Kimi stood at 4'3\", several inches taller than the average six-year old. \"What did the newspaper article have to do with anything?\" you ask Tyson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, call us superstitious, but we think the same thing will happen to our daughter. We... wanted supervision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl in the article started growing on the day of her half-birthday, and was also tall for her age before her growth. I don't want to see Kimi ending up like her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't blame him, a parent needs to be safe sometimes. Still, you didn't think Kimi would be like the Arabian girl. It was too far-fetched. You talked about Kimi with Tyson, and half an hour later he was out the door with his bags and wife. Kimi turned out to be a sweet child, and you had a lot of fun. She liked her train set and dollhouse the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was June 28th, the day that was planned to be the day of Kimi's growth, but you weren't worried about it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Original Author: Detective Barricade</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you brought with you a small, pocket size globe of the world you had bought as a novelty at a science museum gift shop a year or so ago. You didn't know precisely why you brought it with you by the time you arrived at the Stevensons' house. Maybe you had thought to give Kimi a bit of a head start in stuff they'd be teaching her once September rolled around, if they hadn't started covering it already in her class before summer vacation? Or maybe...maybe it had to do with that article the Stevensons emailed you just before taking on the job of babysitting their now 6 1/2 year old daughter, about that girl in Saudi Arabia that had grown into a veritable giant before the Arabian government had her killed, and how scientists reported that she would have grown even larger had she been still alive. It was still crazy, but... If by some crazy fluke, Kimi were to grow like that other girl, and not be killed after 2 days, and thus be allowed to grow even bigger... Nah, that seemed preposterous! The article sounded like something out of the Tabloids like Elvis being an alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you kept the globe with you as you looked in the driveway and saw that the Stevensons had already left. Checking your watch, it wasn't even 3:00 yet. You shrugged and decided to start a little early anyway. Walking to the door, you didn't even have to ring the doorbell or touch the doorknob; Kimi swung it open gleefully for you as soon as you raised your hand. \"Hi, Thomas! Mommy and daddy had to leave me early, but they said you'd be here shortly!\" she said, and giggled at the word shortly. At least, you swore that was what she was giggling at. You entered the house and took off your shoes, placing them on the shoe tray by the door. Naturally, you wanted to set a good example for the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you glanced back at her, she seemed to have THE biggest grin you've ever seen in your life. You assumed it was just because she was happy to have someone to play with her...until you got back to her. Since when was she 4'6\" - no, 4'7\" tall? She DEFINITELY wasn't that tall yesterday. You knew because you had measured her yourself. Further more, if she had grown 4 - no, 6 inches overnight, how come her purple two piece swimsuit she had on currently didn't look too tight on her? (it was a scorcher outside and there was a swimming pool out there. She must have been waiting for you to arrive so you could supervise her while she played in it as Yuma told you she wasn't allowed in it without supervision)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you thought, you felt something warm press against your back and push upwards slowly. When you turned around, to your surprise and horror, you found it to be Kimi - easily 5 feet tall now. \"Um... W-what are you doing, Kimi?\" you asked, a bit fearful. She grinned and replied happily, \"What does it look like I'm doing, Thomas? I'm GROWING!!! I'm gonna grow up and up and UP!\" The black haired girl of bright brown eyes squeezed you happily in a hug that felt like it belonged coming from a polar bear than a child and then ran outside to play in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Perhaps that article...<i>wasn't</i> so silly after all. Well this was different that the Arabian girl... This was the United States of America. Leader of the free world and all that. The American government wouldn't order Kimi assassinated just because she would be big. So you hoped. Plus, Kimi was starting just now, a day late. And also...the article never mentioned the girl growing when with someone, though admittedly that fact might not have been covered or known about at the time. But now your curiosity was nagging at you to have her check out the globe you brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went outside as you thought about this, in part to show the globe to Kimi and in part because you were supposed to be watching her. To not do the latter would grant you a one-way ticket to being out of a summer job, and that would be unfortunate. You pulled out the globe and said, \"Kimi! I've got something to show - GYAAAH!!\" You were not prepared for what you saw. Kimi had grown to 6'6\" since you last saw her a few minutes ago. But the girl...no longer looked so much like a little girl and more like a young woman with the hourglass shape to match, though with her breasts tipping the scale in their favor slightly. Her hair had also grown out a bit more. You'd be turned on a little- if it weren't for the fact that you knew she was only 6 1/2 years old and as tall as that for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi however seemed to not be concerned. Especially not since she was hugging herself like she were delivering a bear hug to an imaginary friend. Looking down at you, she asked, \"Sorry! You've got something to show me, Thomas? Can I see it now, or are we playing a guessing game?\" Calming down, you presented her with the novelty pocket globe to see her reaction. \"It's a globe. A tiny model of the world. What do you think, Kimi?\" you explained. She looks at it carefully, and then pops the stand off to hold the slightly squished ball itself in her hand. The next words out of her mouth somehow made you shiver even as you were sweating like crazy from the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! And you know what, Thomas? One day soon, I'm gonna be BIG enough to hold the whooole world in my hands! Just like this, and for real! It's gonna be so awesome, just you wait!\" she said, and her words carried a tone of dead seriousness even through the sheer excitement. When she pops the little globe's stand back on, she offered it back but you told her she could keep it. Another boa-constrictor level squeeze later, (thankfully no broken bones) you decided to call her parents and give the bad news. What you hear over the phone next alarms you, but you respect Tyson and Yuma's decision.</span></div></div>",

I read that article, yes, but... Very well. I respect your decision, Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson. I'll try to break the bad news to Kimi. She's not going to like it, she seems to be getting rather attached to me. I appreciate the compensation. Okay. Bye.\" you said over the phone and then hung up. The Stevensons had been worried that this would happen, though surprised at how, and were relieving you of the job for both you and their daughter Kimi's safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was the time to break the bad news to the now easily 7 foot tall girl. When you turned around, you had to look up to see Kimi's less-than-pleased expression. \"I heard everything. So you're just gonna leave me because I happen to be growing and growing? Why? Are you scared of a growing girl?\" she asked with saddened confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply back, stuttering in slight fear, \"N-no, Kimi, that's not it. Y-your parents feel that if I'm somehow triggering this, i-its for both of our own good for me to be taken off the job. They don't want to see you or me killed, and neither do I for you. Y-you're a sweet kid, Kimi, b-but I've got to go...sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now 7'4\" tall amazonian child starts bawling, her cries almost equaling a jet plane in volume seemingly. \"WAAAAAAAAHHH!!! B-but I-I don't w-want you to l-leave!\" she cries loudly. You're now faced with effectively an amazonian sized temper tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempted to comfort her by patting her increasingly larger shoulder as you said, \"I-I don't want to leave either, but your mom and dad have made their decision. I can't change their minds after what they've learned...\" you jingled your keys before Kimi to try and calm her some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig mistake. Kimi giggled and immediately took them. \"Hehehe...yoink! I've got your keys, I've got your keys!\" she said in a sing-song voice as she ran up into her room faster and faster the bigger she grew as you chased her until her door almost slammed in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to open the door, but Kimi was sitting right behind it. You could tell because you met more and more resistance from the other side due to her growing, and from her giggling on the other side. After a while, you decided to try and charge at the door. But as you charged at it, before you could make contact with the door, Kimi opened it at the last second and you went charging straight into her bed, your face in the sheet covered mattress after. Kimi giggled and closed the door behind you, leaving you almost trapped in the room of an increasingly bigger girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goal!\" Kimi announced almost mockingly, and then tried to look innocent as she held you keys out and said, \"Oh. I supposed you'll want these back, won't you...?\" you looked up at her and tried to regain your resolve at the sight of the 8 foot tall girl who was somehow even bustier than before your chase. You reach to grab them, and after a few minutes of her holding them increasingly out of reach thanks to her continued growth, she finally relented and allowed you to retrieve them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly, you left, surprised at how Kimi didn't try to block your exit through her door. However, you soon found out why as soon as you tried to put your key in the ignition of your car only to find that it didn't fit. You hold it up to your house key and discovered the problem: your car key had been bent enough to not fit. Kimi was strong enough now to bend metal with just her bare hands, and as long as you were around...she was only going to get stronger as she grew bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your alarm, the...10 foot tall girl cheerfully bent over to peer into your car window. Apparently, Kimi had silently followed you to your car, if only to use your presence to grow more. \"What's wrong, Thomas? I thought you said you were leaving? Oh, but I bent your key... I guess you have no choice now but to stay and help me get bigger and bigger and BIGGER! Yay!\" she admitted and then cheered. You had to admit, she was clever for a 6 1/2 year old girl. Very clever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Almost too clever. She had learned that you were the cause of her growth, and had non-harmfully ensured you wouldn't be leaving anytime soon. Sure, you could walk home, but that was several blocks from here, and with her...12 foot tall and growing stature now, she could easily catch up to you and either make you come back or stick with you like a glue covered rare earth magnet. Buses didn't run out here outside of school buses, and if you had the money for a taxi you wouldn't have been desperate for a summer job in the first place. She had you at a figurative checkmate and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you not see the article about the Arabian girl who died because she went through a similar freak growing spree, Kimi? Your parents don't want the same thing happening to you, and neither do I.\" you tried to explain to the mini-giantess by your car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi nodded and said, \"Oh, I read it, alright. I discovered it! But there's some key differences between her and me. First, this is America, they don't kill people they think are a threat here! Second, and most importantly in case I'm wrong about the first, she didn't grow BIG enough!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could easily outrun you back when she was seven feet tall, and she had grown an entire five feet since then, and would continue to grow as long as you remained in her presence, which she could easily force you to do. You also didn't want to risk another tantrum. You knew now that Kimi had been putting it on to get to your keys, but if she had a real tantrum the results could be catastrophic, especially with her increasingly large body and superhuman strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like you didn't really have a choice, then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Kimi, I guess you win. I won't leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi instantly lifts herself off your car, still giggling as you exit the vehicle. As expected, she had grown again, to just over sixteen feet tall! Kimi stands still, allowing you to take her body in and compare yourself to her. Her black hair had lengthened again, now coming down to the middle of her back. Her boobs had magnified again, approaching G-cup sizes had she been normal sized. You step next to Kimi and compare yourself to her, finding that you only came up to her upper leg. From her perspective, you must look a couple of feet tall at the most!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi giggles again, attracting your attention towards her face, which was now that of a young adult. \"Don't you worry, Thomas! I'm going to grow even bigger and bigger and BIGGER, soon! I'll be holding the Earth in my hands in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kimi seems to shudder slightly... then more... and then a lot... She must be about to have a massive growth spurt! Kimi, meanwhile, lets her smile widen and widen, as her incoming growth spurt keeps making her feel better and better before it even arrives!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, an idea pops into Kimi's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat idea has Kimi had?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As awesome as her incoming growth spurt felt, she would feel terrible for destroying the place. But there was another idea in her head. What would happen if she held her growth spurt down until she couldn't any longer? Would she grow as quickly as if she hadn't held it down? Or, and the idea excited her, would it give her an extra BIG boost as a reward for holding it down? Letting it build up like an unopened soda bottle that's shaken until the cap blows off? She just had to try it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I don't wanna grow bigger...yet.\" Kimi said as she began holding the growth spurt in, but her shuddering wasn't going away. If anything, it was becoming more and more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Kimi? What are you doing?\" you asked, concerned for your safety around the already 17 foot tall (a bit of the spurt had leaked out) and bound to explode bigger any moment girl as her shuddering made her seem like a cartoon character. You tried to edge your way away from Kimi, if only to give yourself a head start once her 'growthsplosion' started to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...nothing...\" Kimi responded way too innocently to actually be innocent, but she noticed you trying to get away. \"Trying to sneak away, are we? Well I'm just gonna have to fix that in the best way I know how...\" you gulped as she grabbed you by the arm, firmly but not roughly, and then went wide-eyed as she squeezed you against her massive breasts. She was holding you tightly like one would a teddy bear. It was very warm and pleasant, but her grip on you was still like that of a bear trap. In other words, you weren't getting away at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resigned yourself to your fate, more or less. Kimi was smart enough to keep you from getting away, and thus depriving her of her continued growth, yet gentle enough that she wasn't actually hurting you. Just as her shuddering was starting to feel like the coin-operated stationary mall ride from Hell, Tyson and Yuma Stevenson's car pulld into the driveway. Then Kimi let her growth go in her excitement of her parents having come home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch me become BIGGER!!! YAY!!!\" Kimi shouted with utter joy as she head exploded past 20 feet, and then 30 feet! In just one day, Kimi had outgrown the Arabian girl from that article, and she wasn't done yet. 40 feet passed, then 50 feet was left behind and discarded like an old toy. Finally, her growth slowed by 60 feet and stopped at 65 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...I was hoping to get even bigger than this...\" Kimi said, not at all ashamed of how much she had grown, both up and out. You were effectively like a toy to her by comparison. Yet when she squeezed you against her giant breasts again, you noticed that her proportions...</span></div></div>",

Her breasts still felt to be somewhere in the high F/low G-cup range if she were normal sized, and you wagered a guess that the ginormous girl's butt and hips had stayed the same as well. Tyson and Yuma Stevenson were staring wide-eyed at the incredibly voluptuous young woman of a giantess that their 6 1/2 year old daughter had become upon exiting their car, before their gaze fell upon you in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mom! Hi dad!\" Kimi cheerfully greeted her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson and Yuma had read the article, and had heard your phone call to them, but they couldn't believe that their little girl had in just one day grown slightly more than twice the size of the Arabian girl when she was killed by the Arabian government. And the day wasn't over yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi, sweetie...\" Tyson nervously greeted his giant daughter back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thomas, I thought we told you we were relieving you of the job, and had asked you to leave immediately?\" Yuma asked, not of anger, but of worry for both you and her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I tried, but Kimi overheard. She stole my keys when I did something foolish, and by the time I was able to retrieve them...she had bent my car key so it wouldn't fit in the ignition. She was only 8 feet tall then. And now...she's making it very clear she doesn't want me leaving.\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi smiled wide with pride and confirmed with, \"Yep! Since Thomas seems to somehow be the key to me growing bigger and bigger, I don't wanna let him go! I wanna grow bigger and BIGGER and BIGGER!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson and Yuma were both understandably horrified of this news. They knew their daughter was very sweet, gentle, and kind. That was how they raised her. But she also liked playing with things smaller than herself, which naturally would encompass more and more things as she grew, and this could likely make her be considered a threat to the US military...if they didn't already consider her a threat and were planning on neutralizing her and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, soon Kimi picked up your car and started moving it back and forth just an inch off the ground, remembering that you couldn't put it in neutral for her to roll it across the driveway. Granted, if she fixed your key now you'd still stay; she had made her point quite clear that she wasn't going to let you escape her increasingly larger presence. She was big enough now that she could probably keep up with your car quite easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she played, Kimi's body shuddered, and you watched as your car became increasingly smaller in her hands. She expanded past 70 feet, and then 80 feet. Pretty soon she was looking down on 100 feet, and then 120 feet. After she grew 140 feet tall...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She thought about how fun it would be to play with real planes and trains, but she also realized that people may not enjoy her idea of fun. She didn't have to care about their opinions, of course, but she did anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for the moment, Kimi set your car down again as she climbed past 150 feet tall, and showed no signs of slowing down anytime soon. \"Grow, body! GROW!!!\" she cheerfully chanted to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she had first been described as tall for her age, Kimi had dreamed of growing bigger. Not just a little bigger. Not even bigger than a normal adult. MUCH bigger. The very idea of forever becoming the biggest girl ever just appealed to her so much. And now that it was actually happening, she was happier than a kid in a toy store that also happened to sell candy! 160 feet passed, and still Kimi almost lusted for more. It would have been full on lusting if her mind understood what it meant...maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kimi surpassed 170 feet, and then 180 feet in height, the black haired girl looked down at you with those still adorable eyes of hers. She seemed to be in thought over something... As she passed 190 feet, she brought you to her face with her hand and asked, \"You're not gonna try and run away again, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering the pointlessness of trying to outrun someone who could cover with their stride alone what you could cover in about a minute, (a marathon runner you weren't) you told Kimi, \"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi smiled wide and said, \"GOODY!!! That means I don't need to keep you pinned against me!\" she then added with a hint of that more mature knowing tone and look you'd expect from a teenager or young adult than a child, \"...Unless you're enjoying being against my wonderful big boobs, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson and Yuma Stevenson just looked at each other, confused as to where that comment came from. They certainly never said anything remotely like that in their lives, let alone in front of Kimi. Sure, their daughter could be a bit clever at times, but this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi looked down at her parents from her height of 200 feet and climbing, watching their confused looks. She was actually much more clever than she let on most of the time. Her parents had put a parental lock on the computers a little less than a year ago, but she had cracked the passwords that same day. She felt she could rival Carmen Sandiego if she wanted to. Fortunately, Kimi had no desire to steal anything, just bypass that annoying parental lock when her parents weren't watching. Through an online IQ test, she had found that she was actually smarter than her parents, and by a considerable margin. She just might be able to browbeat Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, all she had to do was maintain a childish attitude, and intentionally mess up on a few questions here and there, and no one suspected just how smart Kimi really was. If her parents knew earlier, they would have attempted to put up additional security features and watch her much more closely. And that would be annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you responded, a little flustered, \"I-I'm a guy! OF COURSE I'M FREAKING GOING TO ENJOY BEING AGAINST BOOBS!!! But for crying out loud, you're still just 6! Put me on your shoulder or something, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 220 foot tall girl giggled and hovered you over her miniature canyon of cleavage exposed by the open top of her strained purple swimsuit...and then plopped you onto her shoulder. She then got up and ran off through the streets to the...oddly empty park. Then again, given the choice, you probably wouldn't hang around where a 230 foot tall girl was heading for either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that you and Kimi were alone, you said, \"Alright, fess up. I wasn't born yesterday. You tricked me to get my keys so I wouldn't leave, and then you bent my car key just enough to ensure I wouldn't. Then you just said something no 6 year old would normally think to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi teased you by saying with a grin, \"6 1/2 years old. And a day. Or am I? It's so hard to tell when I look like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know damn well how old you are mentally. So are you going to tell me, or are you going to keep me guessing? Keep in mind, I'm being cooperative. It'd be nice if you did the same.\" you told her, and then waited for her to respond.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm just an ordinary 6 1/2 year old little girl. What ever would make you think otherwise?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, I don't know... Maybe the fact that you've got a body that most grown women would kill for? Or maybe the fact that you're 230 feet tall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"240 now.\" Kimi corrected you with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my mistake, 240 feet tall. But that's beside the point. My point is, what other 6 1/2 year old girl would have been able to figure out that I was the one causing them to grow in the first place? What other 6 1/2 year old girl would have come up with the elaborate plan that you did to ensure that I couldn't leave just so that they could keep growing? And most importantly, what other 6 1/2 year old girl would ever make that boob comment you made earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi just casually shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean to tell me that those aren't all things that any ordinary 6 1/2 year old girl would do? Come on, don't you think that you're giving me way too much credit? I'm really not all that special.\" she said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you just sighed and gave up. It was abundantly clear that you weren't going to be getting any information out of Kimi at this point. By now Kimi had reached 250 feet tall, and she was still growing bigger by the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi looked down at her feet and noticed her parents were still just standing there and staring up at her growing form in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, Daddy, do you want to come along and enjoy the ride with your growing girl? I've got a free shoulder open just for you.\" she said, tapping the shoulder opposite you with her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson and Yuma looked at eachother, as if considering their massive daughter's offer for a moment, before nodding to show that they had made a decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked left and right below her 240 foot tall body, as best as she could with her massive G-cup breasts in the way, and then said when she was certain no one else was listening, \"I'm still 6 1/2 years old, plus a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't buying it, and thought Kimi was still toying with you. So you attempted to get off her shoulder, despite having said you wouldn't try to flee, and said, \"Right. If you're not going to be cooperative-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could move, or even finish for that matter, Kimi replied, \"Hey! Let me finish, Thomas! Did I say I was done? No! So hear me out here! ...Besides, if you try to get off my shoulder, I'll either catch you and put you right back up here, or I won't and let you fall to almost certain death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught your attention quick. Satisfied about this, Kimi then continued, \"I'm not mentally any older, but I have almost always been incredibly bright and clever. Okay, granted I wouldn't normally be able to bend a car key with my bare hands unless I was growing bigger and bigger. Even adult hands can't do that. But you know how my daddy told you how he and mommy set up a parental lock on the computers in the house to block certain websites from me? They put that in a little less than a year ago, and I had cracked their passwords about the same day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you mean to tell me I've been babysitting the world's smartest 6 year old?\" you asked with slight awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I might be, but there might also be someone smarter out there. I guess I'd be one of the smartest.\" The 260 foot tall Kimi admitted, carefully shrugging her shoulders and added, \"Brains don't make me a mind-reader, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why the childish act all the time if you really are that smart, kid?\" you questioned, not knowing her motive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, because I still was just a kid until today? If mommy and daddy knew of this, I'd be watched a lot more closely and wouldn't get to visit some of the sites that I do. And that would get really annoying after awhile. Besides, I like the challenge of maintaining that childish cover. Though, heh, I think my body has decided I should look more...appropriate for how I can really act. Or what some guys would love to see in an ever-growing girl like myself, so long as you're with me.\" Kimi replied, as she cleared 280 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really serious about that holding the Earth in your hands thing, aren't you?\" you uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Why not? It sounds so cool and fun! Granted, I do hope I won't need you with me to keep on growing and growing and growing before that point... There's not a lot of air in space. As in none at all. I like you, Thomas, and I don't want to put your life at risk purely for my sake. The military had better not even think of harming you, or I'll have to play a little roughly with their toys. Same goes with my mommy and daddy.\" Kimi mentioned as her growth finally halted for the moment at 300 feet tall, and then sighed as she said, \"Oh poo. I'm done growing for the moment. I was hoping for a few miles at least...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Original Author: Detective Barricade</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are walking down the street after raiding a comic book store for your monthly fix of action packed, multicolored goodness and on the way to Wendy's for a burger, when you pass a playground and see something terrible going on. A small group of children are bullying and terrifying an 8 year old girl. Naturally, being a nice guy, you go over and scare the bullies off with your size and age - and a threat to find their mothers' numbers in the phone book and call them about what they were up to. Once the last of them are gone for now, you check up on the girl. She's about 3'9\" tall, nearly two-thirds your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright? Those bullies didn't hurt you did they? Say, my name is Sean. What's yours?\" you say, trying to be friendly. She murmurs a response which you don't catch, so you ask, \"I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Could you speak a little louder please?\" She complies, but only barely. \"Sar...\" It's clear that she makes Fluttershy seem incredibly brave and outgoing by comparison in sheer shyness, and you need a different approach to find out her name. You hand her a small piece of paper and a pen and say, \"If it helps, can you write it down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, she takes what you hand her and jots down a word, then hands the pen and paper back. Her thin, pale hands are trembling the whole time, as though afraid you'll lash out at her. You read her name aloud. \"Sarah. That's a pretty name, for a pretty girl.\" Normally you try that as a pick up line, but here... Poor Sarah looks as though she needs all the self-confidence she could get. At least the complement goes over well with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passes, and you start to learn more about Sarah. Her parents were divorced and felt responsible for it, thus had trouble saying much of anything. She was often teased and bullied for how utterly quiet she was. If she spoke up about how she disliked it, you figure perhaps they'd learn to leave her alone. But as it was, she was too scared of speaking up and putting her foot down as it were to even tell her own mother who had full custody of her. You decide there and then to ask, \"Sarah? Do you mind if I walk you home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah says softly, \"No, I-I don't mind.\" And with that settled, you and she are on your way. She seems to enjoy your company despite the 9 year difference in age, and you can't help but picture what she'd look like at your age. This image is helped by the time you reach Sarah's house, surprisingly just across the street. Her mother was in her mid 30's, had similar long blonde hair though with brown eyes instead of Sarah's jade colored ones, and...was a tall drink of glass. She was just in her socks and you still had to look up to meet her gaze. You guess around 6'4\", so you assume Sarah herself could end up being close when she was older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hi, I'm Sean. I live just across the street. I found your daughter, Sarah, being bullied, so I told the bullies off and walked her home.\" you say with honesty as Sarah gives her mom a hug as soon as she enters the doorway. Her mom says, \"Thank you, Sean, for you kindness. I'm afraid she's been like this all her life, but it has gotten worse when her father and I got separated. Most of the time the only way I find out about these things is if I see them happen myself... Though I'm amazed at how quickly she's bonded with you. I've never seen her become this open towards someone she hasn't met before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find that interesting. Perhaps it was because you didn't try to force her into anything, or because she was grateful for you scaring off the bullies? She seems like a nice little girl, so you don't think much of it. \"Well if you've got any favors to ask, don't hesitate to ask.\" you're about to head off when Sarah's mom says, \"Actually, I do have a favor to ask. \" I have this important business trip to attend to tomorrow, but I don't want to leave Sarah home alone. I haven't been able to find a babysitter for her anywhere. And since she seems to get along with you so well, Sean, I was wondering...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You were wondering if I would be willing to babysit her, is that correct? Sure, I don't mind. I'll be over as soon as I can tomorrow, or she can come over to my place if she wants. My folks do have a swimming pool she can play in.\" you suggest, and Sarah's mom says, relieved, \"Thank you Sean. You're a life saver. Sarah is a kind girl so she shouldn't be hard to watch over, but as her mother I worry when she's alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave goodbye to Sarah and her mother, and then head across the street to your place. Your parents happen to be out visiting your relatives out of state, so you're home alone, but you're responsible enough not to burn the place down. By nightfall, you're fast asleep. You have no idea what awaits you in the morning, or thereafter...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While you doubt she would get into anything she shouldn't, she's 8 after all, you make sure to tuck things that might be dangerous to her health or that you'd prefer not be seen by her away...including your stash of adult magazines. You shower up after, and then you feel ready for her to come over in about an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever...an hour comes and goes, and Sarah still hasn't come over. By 11:00 in the morning, you're worried. Maybe she wanted you to come over to her place to babysit? Or maybe she's in trouble? You check both the front and back doors to make sure she isn't standing there afraid to ask to come in, and when you still find no sign of her, you decide to go over to her place and investigate why she hasn't come over yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cross the street and reach for the lock box by the door where the spare key is located to punch in the code when something moves in one of the second floor windows. The drapes are drawn together...oddly tight, and you could swear that you saw an eye peeking out for a brief moment. You try the doorknob and find it to be unlocked, so you let yourself in. Immediately, you head upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, it's me, Sean. Is there something wrong?\" you say as you approach her room, notified by the colorful plaque on the door. You hear something along the lines of, \"Please don't open the door...\" yet you ignore it as you gently open the door anyway. The room itself is about what you expect, with bright colors and various little toys of the denizens of Ponyville among other typical girlish things. A diary was on a small desk in the corner, and you have the decency to not be tempted into reading it and shattering what trust you've built up with her. It doesn't take long to find where Sarah is hiding; a big curled up lump shaking in the covers is a dead giveaway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Although, is it just you, or is that lump a little big for a curled up 3'9\" tall girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah responds to your presence with, \"Please go away... I-I don't want to be seen like this... I-I must be sick...\" However, you aren't buying her excuse and pull the covers off of her. And what you saw surprises you. Somehow, she has grown to roughly 4'8\", nearly an entire foot taller overnight. \"I'm a freak!\" she cries surprisingly loudly. Calmly, you ask, \"How did this happen, Sarah? Did you grow this big overnight?\" Her reply floors you, said at a normal volume instead of her usual almost whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no... I woke up this morning, I had some Lucky Charms, and then I went and put on my swimsuit because you said you had a swimming pool. And...then after I put it on, I grew up to this height...\" Sarah says. Almost an entire foot taller in just a few minutes? That was definitely not normal...but it doesn't make her a freak either. You ask out of concern, \"Is your swimsuit hurting you at all?\" and she shakes her head and says, \"Uh-uh. It grew with me. ...Please don't be scared or hate me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look Sarah in the eye and say, \"Now why would I be scared or hate you? I don't think you're a freak, Sarah. You need to learn to stand up for yourself and be the brave girl I'm sure you can be. Now come on, it's much too nice outside to stay bundled up under the covers. Especially when there's a swimming pool ready and waiting!\" The girl smiles and wraps you in a surprisingly strong hug and then follows you to your pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you can't shake the feeling that this isn't the last of Sarah's mysterious growth spurts... If anything, it's but the first of many to come.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still baffled by her sudden growth spurt, you can\u2019t help yourself from inspecting how her body had changed along with her size. Though she was still only 8, her new height of 4.8 feet was something else. She was a pre-teen alright, but a tall and lean one of the kind. A myriad of jailbait jokes you learned from the internet pops into your mind, and you let an out a faint smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she may have seemed older, her childish nature comes to show once the two of you arrive at your pool. Amazed its sheer size she dashes to its edge to inspect its depth, which amazes her equally. \u201cOh my, this is so cool Sean!\u201d she yells, her jade eyes gleaming while she displays the biggest smile you\u00b4ve seen her with so far. \u201cCan I go in?\u201d she says while returning to her shy stance. You smile at her and give an approving nod. \u201cYou can bathe as long as you want. Just come up when we\u00b4re having lunch\u201d you say, an almost immediately she proceeds to bomb-dive from the edge, screaming \u201cBANZAI!\u201d loudly as she bounces into the water with a wave-making splash. You take a step back and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours go by, and the clock is reaching lunchtime. \u201cI\u2019m going inside to make lunch, Sarah\u201d you yell out over the pool. \u201cOk\u201d Sarah quickly replies, before continuing with diving and splashing about. Inside you fix up a pair of sandwiches which you place on two porcelain plates, on in each hand. You walk out to the pool, only to find Sarah underwater, in the middle of one of her dives. Looking into the water, you can\u2019t help but feel as if her figure seems somewhat\u2026. distorted. I fact her body seems elongated and curved to how you recalled it. You shake your head and convince yourself it\u00b4s just how she looks beneath the unruly water, but as she suddenly looks up at you from beneath, you become uncertain again. Sarah then dashes down to the other end of the pool, to the staircase leading up from it. As her body finally rises from the water, it becomes clear to you that it WASN\u2019T just the water. Sarah has changed again. She no longer looks like a tall pre-teen, but a (very) well-developed late teenager. At first you\u2019re unsure of the exact nature of the changes, but not for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the other end of the pool, Sarah picks up a towel you had placed there for her some 30 minutes ago. At first she shakes the worst wetness of with the towel, while her back is facing you. She then crosses the first corner of the pool, and begins to dry her long and very wet hair, making the towel cover her face. As she gets closer, her changes become clearer to you. Little shy Sarah\u00b4s body had matured, and her swimsuit had kept pace, though it left little to the imagination. Her former flat bosom had bulged into bulging and bouncing c-cups (the large kind). Her legs were long, with rich, full thighs to match. These were connected with a beautifully curvaceous butt. She had developed a womanly walk, and as she got closer it seemed as if time was in slow-motion to you, as baffled as you were over her new body. The most noticeable change however, was only clear to you when she was a few steps from you. For with the female form, she had not only grown bigger than her previous height, but had too surpassed you, by at least feet. When Sarah finally threw the towel, she had no sense of how long she had walked, and it culminated with the girl, roughly a heads height taller than you, bumping her soft breasts into you, Sarah letting out a small yelp as it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a second before Sarah becomes aware that she indeed is LOOKING DOWN at the adult that was supposed to babysit her, and the realization fills her face with dread. A second later she becomes aware of her new body, and an oddly distorted expression fills you\u2019re her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you can\u00b4t read how Sarah is taking her growth, but soon a full blown reaction occurs from her and it is\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her arms squeeze into her chest, and she curls into a ball like she had done earlier when you picked her up. You notice how she, in this curbed up position of hers, is as tall as the day you met her, making her 3.8 just by kneeling. \u201cNo no NO! Not again\u201d. She spits the words out like she is losing her breath. \u201cI\u00b4m such a freak! Oh this is so embarrassing!\u201d. You\u00b4re unable to find the right answer to Sarah\u2019s angst. Instead you get your mind working on what is important right now: Sarah\u2019s mental situation. For in spite of the fact that she had a body that would put most girls you knew to shame, along with a height which would put most GUYS you knew to shame, Sarah was still insecure. Her mind was still that of an 8-year old girl, whom had been a victim of bullying as early as yesterday. Such a sudden physical change were hard for her to swallow at once. This left her physically as a woman of enormous beauty, yet a scared and insecure girl-child in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted when Sarah finally gets a hold of herself. She lifts her sad face to you, still curbing together at your feet. \u201cWhat am I going to do now, Sean?\u201d she says with tears dripping from her eyes. You quickly think of an answer to calm her. \u201cWe just\u2026. We got to remain calm for now, Sarah\u201d you say. Sarah\u2019s eyes releases another set of tears and her face twists with sadness. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t normal! I\u2019m all bulging and growing, and what if it comes back and my mother comes home and\u2026\u201d she spits out, losing more air with every breath. You realize there is only one thing that can truly calm her. You grab her tightly by her shoulders and heave her from her up fetus-like stance. She stands up with a confused look on her face, and for a second you become shocked by her full height, when the difference between the two of you reappears. Nonetheless, you embrace her with a tight hug, rocking her in your arms. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay\u201d you say in a calm voice. As the 6.8 feet tall girl gets a hold of herself, she hugs you back with a tight grip, placing her head gently at your shoulder. As her voluptuous body presses into yours, you try your hardest not to let your hormones get the better of you down below, fearing it might scare her. You being a horndog is the last she needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later she has finally calmed still in embracing. \u201cWe need to remain calm for now. I\u00b4m not saying this is normal, but we can\u2019t let panic get the better of us\u201d you say to her. She lets herself go from your embrace, drying her tears away with her hands. When they are gone, she nods I agreement. \u201cOkay\u2026.\u201d She said with the weak voice, you could recognize from your first encounter yesterday. \u201cNow let me see a brave smile\u201d you say with a positive attitude. \u201cOkay!\u201d she replies, smiling in encouragement. \u201cGreat! Now let\u2019s go inside, so we can think this through shall we?\u201d. Sarah nods again, and the two of you start to walk towards your house. Suddenly a shiver runs through your body, starting from your left hand. You look to your side to find the still smiling Sarah holding your hand tightly. And though you knew that she meant it as a gesture of comfort from child to an adult, you can\u00b4t help but feel it as a woman\u00b4s gesture affection to a man. \u201cAnd one hell of a woman too\u201d you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside your house, Sarah\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your house is a pretty big for a. It\u2019s big and roomie, with an entire 9 feet to the ceiling, so it had room if Sarah\u00b4s growth should return (which you feared it would). You took peek at her. It was still hard to grasp how well-build she had become, and with a height to match. Her body had matured so well. And it was not just her figure. There was something mesmerizing over her face as well. It seemed so adult; yet still not that different from how she had looked when she was still the size of an 8-year old. Her blonde hair was still wet from swimming, adding a wild look to her seductive facial features, which allured you to stare at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d Sarah suddenly shouts. \u201cPlayStation!\u201d she yells in excitement. She then releases your hand, and dashes to the other end of the living room, where your flat screen is connected to your PS3. Once there Sarah studies it with a gleeful expression. She joyfully shuffles through your collection of games, impressed with every game that she studies. She picks out a game, and holds it up as she turns towards you. \u201cSean! I love this game\u201d she says, holding up a copy of Dragon\u2019s Crown, an RPG game. \u201cCan I play it? Pretty please!\u201d she begs in joy, jumping up and down, her luscious breasts bouncing with every jump. You get confused by the sight of her breast\u00b4s motions, but manage to get your head together and deliver an answer. \u201cYeah, sure. Go nuts\" you say and smile in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith immense excitement she proceeded with putting the game into the console, and when the screen finally turns on she sits down flat on the carpet floor, her eyes focused intensely on the game. You go over next to her, and marvel at the odd sight. A woman with her beauty, distracted so intensely by a game was an unusual but welcome sight. You let out a small laugh at the sight. \u201cI\u2019m going into the kitchen for a moment. Just entertain yourself, okay?\u201d you tell her. \u201cUh huh\u201d she replies; waving you away almost flippantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the kitchen you can see Sarah in profile, still hypnotized by game. You spend 2 hours surfing your laptop for some sort of answer to the odd situation you and Sarah somehow have ended up in. And though there\u00b4s a lot of information on \u201cfast growth\u201d, you find nothing but trivial fiction regarding the inhuman growth Sarah is experiencing. As the lack of help the internet provides, and the general confusion on what the hell to do start to stress you out, you slam the lid on the computer and walk back to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah is mashing buttons as if she was being paid, commanding the characters on the screen. You see that she\u00b4s in the middle of a boss fight, and that she is even more focused than before. As Sarah moves to a more upright position, her head slightly blocks the bottom of the screen. Initially this does not bother you, but you notice that her is actually slowly lifting itself higher. At first you believe that she is just being unruly because of her focus on the game, yet soon you discover that it\u2019s something completely different that\u2019s taking place. In fact she was sitting as still as a Buddha statue in the back of an antique-store. The motion that\u2019s making her block the screen is another growth spurt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Sarah who already had gotten so big began to grow again. Her figure slowly rose higher and higher. And to the growth came too more curves to her already magnificent body. It was also clear to you that as she got taller, her body matured further along with the height. Her breasts, hips and ass swelled to greater proportions. Her sitting posture spread her butt out flatly while it got bigger along with her other curves. From what you can perceive, Sarah in her sitting position raises more upwards by the second, and the height difference between the growing girl and you becomes smaller and smaller. In a few seconds, her sitting figure is as tall as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a wonder how Sarah isn\u2019t bothered by her growth at all by. Looking at her eyes you see her pupils are slowly sinking as her head is rising. So immersed was she in the game, that she didn\u2019t even notice her physical changes. Speaking of the game, you see that her health bar(s) are sinking as she is growing. Although the two things were completely unrelated they still seemed surprisingly coordinates. Sarah\u00b4s expression turns angrier the more the boss damages her characters, all while her body still grows. When it stops a \u201cGAME OVER\u201d appears on the screen and Sarah places the remote on the ground. \u201cBut that\u2019s a load of bullshi\u2026..\u201d she says while getting onto her feet. She doesn\u2019t get to say any more before she bumps her head on the 9 feet high ceiling making her height more prevalent than in her sitting position. \u201cOUCH!\u201d she roars as her head hits the ceiling. She rubs her head, as she looks down and realizes her new stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazonian\u201d was the best description for her at this point. With a slightly bended neck, her height had at least reached the 10 feet mark, making her almost twice as tall as you. Her body had gotten even curvier as well. Where her breasts and ass could have been compared to ripe grapes and soft handballs, vast melons and firm soccer-balls was a better comparison now. Meanwhile her hips had become like great logs of skin with. You scroll your eyes from her feet and upwards, inspecting her unbelievably hot body that now could put any woman you had ever seen to shame. When you reach past the bulging bosom, you find a Sarah\u00b4s face showcasing a distressed expression. \u201cSean?\u201d she says with in a scared tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus on the problem rather than the perks it brought to your eyes and manages to answer her: \u201cIt\u00b4s ok Sarah, we just need to stay calm\u201d\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes slowly wet and produced tears gently sliding from her eyesockets. She had her neck bent while standing as her height surpassed that of the ceilings. She was looking down at you from her 10 feet tall perspective with her dripping eyes, barely able to contain the urge to panic. \"But I can't stay calm, Sean! I've got to be at least twice as big as I was when I woke up this morning. And i just keep getting bigger. And who knows when it comes back! I could ruin your house any minute!\" her voice was hoarse with frustration. You had to calm her down, and quickly. \"Now listen here Sarah. It's completely normal for a girl at your age to experience growth. It's just part of growing up. It just seems to be going a little bit faster for you than for others\". A white lie you quickly assembled from fragments of information you had found on your computer, just prior to her latest growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's face twisted at your words. She may have been 8, but she wasn't dumb. \"AND A BIT BIGGER THAN FOR OTHERS AS WELL!?\" she shouted at you. Though she was a child, she was no dumb child. She knew her condition was more than just a small anomaly. She bit her lower lip as her frustration turned into rage. \"Whatever is going on isn't \"normal\" for anyone, Sean! It's weird and freaky and I want it to stop!\" her voice boomed with anger. She stomped the ground with her left foot in a fit of rage, and the weight from her body caused a minor but very clear tremor to rumble through the floor. Although you could feel this, you were unmoved by the vibration. Still, her sudden urge to rage came as a shock to you, and you feared what a otherwise shy and gentle girl like Sarah could do at that size in such a sudden fit of rage. \"No need to get violent Sarah, I'm just trying to help you!\" you tried to tell her. \"But you're not helping at all! I'm just getting bigger and bigger and now I can barely fit beneath the roof!\" she replied loudly, hammering a fist into the ceiling. The force of the blow caused 3 framed pictures, which hang on a wall just beside the TV to fall down and shatter with loud clatters echoing through the room. The loud sound of things breaking pulled Sarah out of her tantrum, and froze her in place with a shocked expression painted across her face. She looked at you in dread fear, like she was waiting for an unavoidable scolding from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she almost was twice your size, her fearful expression reminded you once more that she was only 8, no matter what her physique indicated. And you were still the one supervising her, giving you adult authority over her. You straightened your back and rebuked her: \"You will listen here young lady!\" Sarah quivered at your words. \"You are no freak, and you will be CALM until I can figure out what we do about this situation. Is that clear!\". Then Sarah's legs sank, and the giant girl sat down in your couch in shame. The sudden weight caused a loud creak to resound from the floor. For a second you thought it would break, but it held up to her weight. Sarah's reaction was that of silently huddling herself together, and a weak \"Yes sir....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your eyes and took a good look at her. Her swimsuit still fit as perfectly as ever, although it seemed more well-worn with her new bulging shapes. You considered this a strife of luck to her otherwise ridiculous growth, as you could hardly imagine she could have been feeling, had she been NAKED with that body and no option to clothe her again, given her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.... What will we do?\" she asked quietly. You crossed your arms and thought the situation through. Then you looked her in the eyes and she back at you. \" I guess I'll just have to search some more on the internet. Can't think of any other way to get some information on this\". Sarah nodded in agreement. \"I think that's a good plan too, yeah\" she said trying to sound as positive as she could. A few seconds of silence occurred. Then Sarah let out a wide yawn. You guess she had need for some sleep with her now being calm again. \"Getting tired?\". Sarah rubbed her face and nodded. You smiled at her, and she smiled back. \"Take a nap on the couch if you want to. I'll sit here while I do some research on this\". And with that Sarah moved her body across the couch and placed herself in the most comfortable position she could find. Then she closed her eyes, and quickly drifted into sleep.<br>\r\nYou walked back into the kitchen and picked up your computer. You sat down at a spot on the couch that Sarah's oversized body didn't fill up, and googled the first thing that came to mind. Later on.......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She seems to you to be quite the kind, energetic, and playful girl once she gets around her shyness and fear of what others think of her. And maybe now that she's at least as tall as some 10 year old kids, her bullies will leave her alone. ...Then again, maybe not if she's still frightened of what's happened. You can tell her it's okay all you like, but ultimately, it's up to Sarah herself to either let her shyness control her or get over it and let the universe see the true Sarah Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, evening comes and you prepare some mac and cheese, at her suggestion no less. While she wanted a soda for a drink, to your dismay you only have juice in your fridge. You bring up and unload a case of soda into your fridge, but sadly the cans and the soda inside are warm. Ice cubes can only do so much to alleviate the problem, so the two of you are stuck with juice. Sarah doesn't complain, though whether she's actually happy with juice or afraid to speak up and complain about the lack of cold soda is unknown to you. Finally, you return her home across the street and tuck her into bed, and then head home yourself to clean up the mess you made in the kitchen. Once the last dish was sitting on the drying rack clean as a whistle, you head for bed and quickly fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you wake up to the all too familiar beeping of your alarm clock. You shut it off, and then have some breakfast while Sarah is surely doing the same at her place. You start putting dishes away when you hear the faintest tap. You look around, but can't find the source so you go back to putting things away. By the time the last dish is put away, the tapping sound has gotten...oddly loud, yet still somewhat gentle. Now you realize it must be Sarah knocking on your door! Poor kid must have been waiting for at least a few minutes now. \"Coming!\" you say, and rush to the door to let her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Only, when you open the door, you're greeted by a pair of B or C-cup breasts in an all too familiar bright red two piece swimsuit. You take a few steps back to see the full image of...Sarah?! She looks like she could be a teenager now, easily 14 or 15! And you have to look up to see her face, almost as red as her swimsuit! \"W-wow... Sarah? Is that you? I-I can hardly recognize you!\" you manage to stammer out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's me, Sean. I...uh...did some more growing...\" Sarah says almost nervously, stating the obvious. You let the now 6'9\" tall girl in, amazed at both how tall and...well developed she's become, and how she didn't try to hide herself. What you aren't is scared. How could you be at this face of an angel? \"I-I take it you're still not scared of me?\" she says, and you again note how she's speaking at an easily audible level. You reply, \"No, just surprised at how much you've grown. I have to wonder though just what is in those Lucky Charms of yours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggles and takes the opportunity to be silly with you, saying, \"Oh that's easy! Hearts, stars, and horseshoes; clovers and blue moons! Hourglasses and rainbows; and tasty red balloons!\" You laugh with her on that. You certainly walked into that one, even if that wasn't what you meant. She may be a full 3 feet taller than when you met her, but for now she's still at least mentally Sarah. And not the shy Sarah you first met, the Sarah from yesterday. \"Well when they say they're magically delicious, they sure aren't kidding! I mean, most adult men aren't as tall as you now! Are you still scared of this, are we past that stage? I want to know how you feel, Sarah.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's response...</span></div></div>",

And might I ask what has brought this change of attitude about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah beams at you and says happily, \"You did, silly! You made me realize that I'm not a freak, I'm me.

Considering she's all too likely been too shy to make friends before, it's little surprise you want to keep that friendship with the girl right to the end if possible. \"Fair enough. As long as you don't intend on exacting revenge on bullies...\" Sarah looks up innocently and says, \"Well...I wouldn't hurt them... much, anyway. At least as hurtful as a wedgie could be.\" You raise an eyebrow as the two of you head to the pool, and she confesses, giggling like the young girl she is despite not looking it, \"Alright, a wedgie and being hung up a flagpole. Are you happy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and shake your head. Clearly she didn't have intentions to brutally get even with her bullies, and frankly they'd probably wet themselves in terror just seeing her dwarf them and most adults. \"So long as they're not atomic ones. Those things are killers...on both ends.\" You two share a laugh and Sarah jumps into the pool while you watch her...although at this point if she were in any danger of drowning all she'd have to do is stand and her head would be well above the water's surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later, Sarah seems to stop moving in the water. You look on with concern, and notice that the water around her seems to be rippling, as though her body is vibrating slightly. \"Sarah, is something wrong?\" you ask. She turns to look at you with a smile and says, \"No, something is incredibly right! It's happening!\" You're about to ask what that something and 'it' is when her body begins to rise further and further out of the water... She's growing! She surpasses 7 feet easily, and then 8 feet follows suit and she's still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she clears 9 feet in height, you notice that her body is becoming... a lot more voluptuous. By the time she stops growing at 10'9\", able to call the tallest person to have ever lived before her 'shorty', her breasts had to be somewhere in the D or E cup range, and her hips and ass gave her a gorgeous hourglass shape that put to shame every single girl in your adult magazines. But that wasn't all, for she physically looked like she was somewhere between 17-20 now. And those jade colored eyes...wow. Combined with her flowing blonde hair and complemented with her still well fitting bright red swimsuit, Sarah has become an embodiment of beauty. You resist your hormonal urges to mate with this amazon with everything you've got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet...L - Celestia...\" you correct yourself, not wanting to swear in front of her and be a bad influence, so instead using a name you and she are familiar with. (who knew that watching My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic with your last girlfriend would pay off like this?) Surprisingly, those new chest cannons don't seem to be bothering her in the least, as though her body's already adapted to handle it's new generous curves. She looks down at you and says, \"That's how I've been growing lately. Nice save with Celestia, by the way. You'd be surprised at what I've heard on the school yard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...thanks, I guess. But wow... I would never have imagined that you would grow up like this, Sarah. Pretty and nearly twice my height!\" you respond. She looks at you with slightly knowing eyes as she states, \"Oh, I'm not done growing yet. In fact, I might not ever be done growing. But I like it now! It's so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, there's two ways you guess she means by this. She could mean just her body is going to keep growing...or she could mean that her new already impressive assets will also keep growing even in proportion to her. This is soon answered by her next growth spurt, and this answer was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wonder what would happen if I tried to suppress you for awhile... Maybe the next one. Next stop: up!\" she says, with some pondering mixed with her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch with bated breath as her next growth spurt hits despite having just grown less than a couple of minutes ago. Perhaps her acceptance of it has sped up her growth intervals? Or maybe it's just random. Either way, she's already grown double your height and isn't slowing down. 14 feet passes her by, and then 16 soon after where she starts slowing down. When Sarah finishes growing for the time being, she's over triple your height at 18'9\". You're sensing a pattern now with her spurts. The first was about a foot. The second 2 feet gained. 4 feet for the third. And just now, 8 feet. It's about double her previous spurt. Good to know for keeping track of it for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, your answer seems to have been answered. The mini-giantess standing before you's...T&amp;A; have remained pretty much exactly the same impressive size in proportion to the rest of her body. Sarah has the looks to have any man she wanted with ease, though given her size you doubt any would possibly be big enough...downstairs to satisfy her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as far as you're aware, her mind is still that of an 8 year old girl. She probably has no sexual interest in boys yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! My eyes are WAAAAY up here! Or are you enjoying looking at my knee?\" Sarah asks, giggling with amusement. You realize you've been staring blankly and are staring at her kneecap, which is now practically a small dinner plate in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to look up, but naturally your eyes become fixated at the two large objects sticking out of her chest. Before it gets too awkward though you bring your gaze up to her eyes and say slyly, \"Better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much.\" Sarah replies with another giggle. She takes a look around herself and the pool that has become little more than a kiddie pool to her towering body, and then effortlessly steps out of it. She still reaches over and pushes the water back and forth with her hand. Surely she had to be at least partly aware of how strong she was now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're probably as strong as the Hulk, Sarah. What do you think?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer response is, \"The...Hulk? Big green guy that smacked Loki around like a rag doll? I've read some of the comics myself, and mom and I watched The Avengers in the theater for my birthday. Sean, I'm aware I've gotta be a lot stronger than any normal person, but the Hulk would smash me in a strength contest! How do you compete with a guy that gets stronger the angrier he gets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis answer actually intrigues you. Not so much her opinion on herself vs. The Incredible Hulk, but the fact that an 8 year old girl would have interest in comic book characters and have watched The Avengers movie. You're liking her more and more. But then a terrifying thought occurs to you: what about her mother? What was she going to think about her little girl having become...far less little when she comes home? Would she think you had something to do with it? ...Did you have something to do with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Sarah? I just thought of something. I'm perfectly okay with your growing and all, but what about your mom? She...might not take this well...\" you say with nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah goes wide-eyed for a moment, and you assume she's going to go right back into her frightened shy shell again. However, to your surprise she says calmly, \"Let her. Don't get me wrong. I love my mom as much as any daughter would! But I can't hide this, I don't want to, and if she can't take what's happening to me like a grown up and respect my feelings for it...that's her problem. Same goes to anyone else. They don't like it, it's their problem, because I'm only growing BIGGER from here. I'm not giving up the confidence I've gained from this experience. The shy Sarah has gone away. The real Sarah is here to stay! ...until I can't fit on the planet, anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's actually a well thought out decision, and she's decided that she's not going back to her old, shy ways again. You feel like her mother can at least respect that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, I'm tall enough to look into my bedroom window now with my feet on the ground. I'm a bit too big to even crawl through our front door without breaking it, and given how much bigger I get with each spurt... Grounding me would cost us our house as I'll outgrow it utterly. And as much as I'm enjoying this, I don't wanna break anything with it. Is it so wrong to want to be a nice giantess?\" Sarah comments, and again you can't help but admire her maturity for her mental age. Or perhaps she has mentally aged? It's hard to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think that's wonderful. I don't think I could be friends with a mean giantess. But a nice giantess? I'm cool with that!\" you tell her, and she blushes slightly in response.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You also grabbed her diary just in case she wants to try and write in it. She thanked you for her diary, and from what you could tell she manages to write small enough to still fit it in the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops! Sorry!\" Sarah giggles as she says the word and places one of your pieces back to your starting space as her own replaced it. She isn't really sorry, one just had to say it in the game of Sorry! whenever the circumstance happened. She is however still very gentle with the pieces even at nearly 19 feet tall, demonstrating incredible dexterity. Hopefully this would continue as she gets bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Well let's see what I get next. Ah-HA! Time to repay the favor, kiddo! Your red piece on my starting spot is going to be sent packing!\" you say as you show the card allowing you to move one piece out onto the board proper, bumping her piece back to her starting space in the process, and then drawing again. The next card allows you to move said piece four spaces back - behind the home row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes widen with false shock as she says in an overly dramatic fashion, \"What?! OH NO!!!\" and then giggles as her turn comes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, somehow the giant girl manages to win the game. You're hardly upset as you had fun. You note the time and ask, \"Wow. We've been at this for that long? No wonder my stomach's starting to growl. You want something to eat, Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah hesitates and then answers, \"I'm not really that hungry, which is odd 'cause my tummy rumbles right around this time, but I'll have something anyway. Got hot dogs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have such piddly things as hot dogs. I have Juicy Jumbos! And you look as though you can pack some of those away.\" you inform Sarah and head inside to begin cooking while she waits patiently outside, being much too big to fit inside now. Not that she minds any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before the hot dogs are ready, but you put a lid over them to keep them warm while you head outside to wash Sarah's hands with the garden hose and some dish detergent. \"Even a big girl such as yourself needs clean hands, am I right?\" you say. Sarah giggles and nods, then takes the bottle from you hands with just a few fingers of her own and gently squeezes a small amount out to use for soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she's done, you put the hose back and turn the tap off, then take the bottle of dish detergent back inside. With Sarah's instructions, you place the condiments she wants on her hot dogs, and then put what you want on yours. You take them outside, then go back inside and retrieve a couple of cans of soda. Cream soda for her, grape for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it takes you a little while to finish, it naturally takes almost no time for Sarah to. And while you're concerned at first as to where she's going to go to the bathroom as she gets larger, you eventually figure that she simply may not need to. Eventually, it was time for her to go to bed, and you helped her adjust to sleeping outside. Then you went home to get some shuteye yourself after cleaning up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you're awakened to loud, incessant tapping on your window. You look over to your alarm clock to check the time, only to find that you hadn't set it last night and had overslept considerably, it now being 11:00 in the morning. Now you have a bad feeling as to what the tapping is. You aren't prepared for what greets you. Sarah's beautiful face more than completely fills the window's view - and it seems like she's bent over almost double. She had to be 66 feet tall now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sleepyhead! You didn't come by when I was 34 feet tall, so I got bigger and came looking for you! ...I'm not scaring you or anything am I?\" she says, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you? Scare me? Nah! I'm sorry I didn't come over earlier, Sarah, I forgot to set my alarm. And then seeing you this big so soon has startled me just a bit. Let me get dressed. No peeking!\" you say sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nods and then stands up to her full height outside so that she can't see through your window. You get dressed, and then head outside. You give her a slight tap on the leg, and she bends down and sits next to you with a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Sarah? Do you feel mentally any older? You look about 17-20, but do you feel that old as well? Or just as old as you've always been?\" you ask. And her response is...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yesterday I felt like I was 8 years old, but today I feel like I'm 18. I mean, when you were getting dressed...I was having a hard time resisting the temptation to peek. Yesterday boys had next to no meaning to me, but today I can hardly think about much of anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're half surprised by this revelation. It probably was only a matter of time before her mind caught up with her apparent physical age. Most kids seemingly can't wait to grow up, and Sarah seems to have gotten that wish fulfilled whether or not she actually ever wished for it. As a follow up question, you ask, \"Uh, I'm sure there's someone you've got feelings for in particular... Er, how about knowledge? Do you know anything that you can't explain how you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah thinks on it for a second before saying, \"Well, I know the thing in your pants stiffens whenever you see me, and what its purpose is for. And that I should probably have slapped you when we first met for the pick up line. Oh, and math problems that yesterday would have left me scratching my head I find almost embarrassingly easy now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush a bit at her two nuggets of knowledge an 8 year old would definitely not know. Somehow Sarah has also gained the knowledge she'd be expected to know as an 18 year old...if not more. She then says, blushing, \"As for the first part...well...um...there is a particular boy I...find myself drawn to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it seems her shyness is coming back, but then you realize it's actually embarrassment. And then it hits you like a Mack truck carrying a load of bricks and you ask Sarah, \"Wait a minute... You can't possibly mean to say that...it's me you're referring to...are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect Sarah to stomp away crying at the possibility of being rejected, which wouldn't be good considering she's 66'9\" tall now and could easily grow to be 130'9\" tall at any time, but she simply says, \"Well, yeah I am. Then again, you're about the only boy I've ever been close to. All the others I've met have picked on me because I was shy, and I'm certainly not eager to go out with them even if they were at the age I feel myself to be now!\" she pauses and then continues, \"I know physically you'd love to get into my swimsuit bottom, but mentally you can't see past the fact that I was 8 just yesterday. I understand this, and I also understand that you'd never be able to please me in, uh, that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So before you outright reject me... Best friends forever. Can we at least be that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think on it and reply, \"I can accept you on that, Sarah. How many people can say that their best friend happens to be an ever-growing giantess? I can see past the sudden jump in age, it certainly makes me feel more comfortable, but I just don't want what we already have to be soured by an intimate relationship that's ultimately not going to work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah cheers and happily picks you up in a tight but gentle hug against her huge breasts. Just then, a shudder runs down her body indicating she's about to grow. \"Sean?\" she asks, \"I'm about to grow again. I've been curious as to what would happen if I were to try and hold it in for a bit, but I wanted to ask. Are you okay with that? I'm thinking the result will be huge, but I won't if you're not comfortable with me doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it sweet of Sarah to ask, you say...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her young woman's body is incredibly attractive in her red swimsuit, but it was kind of silly to expect her to have mentally aged to go with it. \"Oh, no reason. Just curious.\" you say in reassurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggles with delight, enjoying her size more and more as she compares herself to the things around her. She then states with a smile, \"If it helps any, I feel like a very mature 8 year old in a hot, giant 17-20 year old's body. I just have no real interest in boys still. Except for this boy named Sean. He's an awesome little friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize that she's referring to you and you say, \"But I'm 6 feet tall...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm 11 times bigger than you and can easily grow even bigger soon. Therefor little!\" Sarah replies and sticks her tongue out playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but laugh at the giant girl. It's truly hard to believe that just a few days ago Sarah was such a shy girl who couldn't make herself heard if she had a microphone strapped to her mouth plugged into the biggest, loudest set of speakers in the world. And everything else is dead quiet. But now she could be the life of the party if she wanted to, were she normal sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as she writes down some things in her tiny little diary and sighs a little. \"This is the last time I'll be able to write in my diary. I can barely hang onto the pencil! Ah well. Maybe I'll get some cool powers to go with my growing body at some point soon? That would be nice.\" Sarah says, and then asks, \"Don't you think? Like being able to keep getting bigger and bigger and not have to worry about wrecking anything, even being able to fix anything I accidentally break. ...Are you going to answer, or are ya just going to keep staring at my giant boobs all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just waiting for you to finish, Sarah. Although your boobs are almost all I can see from down here when I try to look you in the face. As long as you aren't using them to rule the world or something, sure, that could be cool!\" is your reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 66 foot tall girl gently grabs you in her hand and lifts you to her huge face. Her jade eyes continue to stare at you with a friendly demeanor behind them and she says, \"Rule the world? Well now there's a thought! I could rule the world - no, the universe and beyond if this growth keeps up! A ruler everyone loves, knowing she's kind... Nah. I don't think I'm cut out to be a ruler. Then people would be expecting stuff from me whether I wanna do it or not. I'd rather be free to just be myself I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach then rumbles and you say to Sarah, \"Oh boy. I should eat something... But I don't know if I've got anything enough to be even a mouthful for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and replies, \"No worries. I'm not hungry. Well, not for food or drink, anyway. I am hungry for more growth though. I'm still smaller than a blue whale and I'm eager to correct that - and then some!\" Sarah then sets you down by the door to your house so you can go inside for something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you've made something for yourself and are enjoying it in peace. However, soon a terrible rumble can be felt going through the house. You finish up and go back outside to see Sarah shuddering wildly, the rumbling clearly coming from her. \"Come on, Sarah... You can do this... Just hold it in as long as you can...and with any luck the reward will be HUGE!\" you hear her saying to herself. You guess that she's trying to hold her next growth spurt in as long as she can in the hopes of it being greatly boosted when she finally relents.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're just too intrigued to even bring yourself to do that to the 8 year old in a gargantuan teenager's body. But that does present another challenge. Where to head once she lets go? You probably can't run fast enough to get away in time if she suddenly explodes in growth, and most things will likely be bulldozed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you climb the one safe spot you can think of: Sarah herself. You get onto her long, smooth, slender leg. but realize this won't do if she decides to stand up or you lose your balance before she's done. Suddenly, you find yourself being lifted up in her hand. She smiles kindly, and holds you to her massive breasts gently in a protective manner. The trembling and shuddering continues to intensify, her body desperately wanting to grow like a spring under increasing pressure, but you feel perfectly safe against the bright red fabric of her swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't...hold it...in...much longer...\" Sarah informs you through tightly clenched teeth. Finally, after about 10 minutes of holding it in, Sarah lets herself go, unable to hold her growth back any longer. At first, the rumbling stops and she doesn't seem like she's going to expand at all. Then...she exploded in all directions. In a matter of moments, she nearly doubled her height. Then she did it again, unavoidably reducing where you and your neighbor's houses were into a parking lot in her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaster and bigger Sarah grows, clearing 1000 feet in a minute. She levels the rest of your small neighborhood with her lengthening legs and billowing ass, but she seems...weirdly unconcerned. Still, she exceeds a quarter of a mile in height, and then becomes 2000 feet tall. You're starting to wonder if her growth is ever going to end, or if she's just going to keep on expanding forever on this spurt. Half a mile passes, and her fingers are far thicker than you are twice over yet still slender and nimble for their owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's growth sends her rocketing past 3000 feet, yet the fabric of her swimsuit isn't hurting you despite all the expanding it has to be doing to keep its wearer covered up top. (and the same around her expanding pelvis for the bottom part) She stands up while still growing, and takes in the sight of everything shrinking around her, clearly getting a big thrill out of it. Sarah reaches 4000 feet in height, and her growth at last seems to be dying down. At 4098 feet (and 9 inches) tall, her growth comes to its end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy COW! I'm like nearly a mile tall! The tallest buildings in the world can scarcely scratch my knees! Isn't this just incredibly awesome, Sean?!\" She yells at the top of her lungs in excitement...yet her volume is actually tolerable somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, y-yeah...incredible...but the entire neighborhood is flattened because of you. Why aren't you upset about it, Sarah?\" you ask, worried that she's letting this go to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looks down beneath her and giggles. Not because of the carnage she's caused, but because of what she's about to do. The titanic blonde haired girl steps out into a more open area and says, \"Why? Watch this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, you look on as the entire area appears to be rewinding like footage, but with the cause of the mess edited out. The whole neighborhood pieces itself back together down to the last slime-covered toadstool...if there were any around. \"Ta-da! Now that's awesome to an entirely different degree! It came to me at around, oh...I wanna say 1234 feet? I can enjoy my growth, getting bigger and bigger, and fix back anything I break. I...don't think I can prevent the destruction of trees and non-living things, but I can at least restore 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I'm impressed, Sarah! But, um, how do you know what to restore and where?\" you remark and ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy, silly! I don't! I just ask for it to be put back the way it was. If I had to concentrate on the whereabouts of every little detail and every poor little caterpillar just minding its business munching on some leaves, I'd be bound to get it wrong somewhere.\" Sarah explains with a big grin plastered on her ginormous face. The bigger she gets, the more mesmerizing she becomes to you. If she were as old as she appears to be now when this all started, you would have likely asked her out by now. As it is, being best friends with a young, ever-growing giantess that also happens to be essentially a goddess is pretty cool!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slim and very curvy with C-cup breasts, white blonde hair that reaches down to her mid-back, blue eyes, and pale skin. She may be an albino, or merely confused for one. She is naturally kind, and is indifferent towards the idea of growing...until it actually starts happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinnie - 18 years old, 4'10\" tall. Skinny, but generally looks like a 9 or 10 year old. Dark red hair that extends to her shoulders, hazel eyes, tanned skin. Absolutely HATES the fact that puberty seemed to utterly ignore her, and would love to be able to be recognized for her actual age rather than being confused for a kid. While potentially playful and mischievous, she would never think to seriously hurt someone. Seems puberty may finally catch up to her - and more than make up for lost time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther girls/options - YOU come up with your own mystery girl.

Maybe a few other things. And for this endeavor, you had been granted the most precious privilege an 18 year old boy like you could imagine: getting to drive your dad's car. Granted, it wasn't the nicest car in the neighborhood, but still! The car! It beat having to ride your 15 year old sister's bicycle while your own was still in the bike shop being repaired after an accident you swear wasn't your fault, which was a bit uncomfortably small...and the pinkest, girliest thing you had ever laid eyes on. Considering your sister's room hardly contained any pink at all, you suspected she deliberately made it as utterly embarrassing for you to ride as humanly possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the store, you pick up a carton of milk, some bags of chips, and a few other things. Certain that you had everything, you proceed to the checkout only to get distracted as a pretty young woman passes you by. And because of said distraction, you bump into someone and cause both of your groceries to fly and land everywhere. Turning your head to see who you bumped into, and possibly yell at them to watch where they were going even though you hadn't been yourself, you lay eyes on a dark red haired...child?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, sorry little girl! I wasn't watching where I was going...where are your mommy and daddy?\" you ask, trying to be nice while also wondering what parent let their little girl dress like a teenager. You almost immediately found out how big of a mistake that was, as the girl glares at you and screams in your face, \"I AM NOT A LITTLE GIRL, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!! I'M 18 FREAKING YEARS OLD!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to believe her, but her severe lack of height and curves make it difficult. Still, you didn't want to make a big stink about it and have to explain to your parents why you got thrown out of the grocery store, so you play along. \"Okay, okay!! I'm sorry, alright? Jeez... It's just that...\" The girl softened her glare, but finished your explanation in a mix of anger and sadness, \"...I look like a child? Yeah. I get that a lot... I've been getting that for years now. Look, I'm sorry I exploded in your face. I just hate being constantly confused for a 10 year old if I'm lucky...and then you ran into me...and I was already pretty stressed...\" she joked, \"Gee, I sound like I should be admitted for anger management here, don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to feel sorry for the girl, which also makes you curious about her name as you and she tried to gather up the groceries that hadn't spilled their contents on the floor. Sadly, the milk carton you were about to buy didn't make it, and you had to get another. To be nice, you introduce yourself. \"Uh...I'm Quincy. What's your name? I'm going to assume it isn't 'Hey You'.\" The girl mumbles something in response and you ask, \"Uh, I didn't catch that... Could you speak a little louder?\" to which she sighs and finally says, \"My name is...Minnie. Before you start wisecracking about my name, shut up. I get WAY too much of that at school. My mom thought the name was cute.\" Minnie smiles and jokes, \"...Who knows, maybe if I had been named 'Giganta', I might actually fit that description. Minus the attitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat cracked a smile on your face. It seems that Minnie really wasn't a bad girl most of the time, just frustrated at her lack of...well...anything to be proud of. You consider making her your girlfriend...but then you'd get accused of being a pedophile or something even though she was about your age. Maybe in a year's time or so she would finally blossom and you wouldn't have to worry? For now, you see no reason why you and her couldn't just hang out... Oh. Right. Groceries. If your parents suspect that you were taking entirely too long to get milk and a few other things, you would be grounded. And you had agreed to a game of hoops with the guys tomorrow after school. If you were grounded, you'd kiss that game goodbye for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Minnie once again picked up the groceries you were after, that had to be replaced due to the accident that the clerks were already starting to clean up, and then proceeded to the checkout. You pay for your groceries, you see Minnie doing the same after you, and then you both exit to the parking lot. She looks up at you and says, \"So...I guess we'll see each other around? Or maybe we'll say that but never actually do so?\" You respond nonchalantly with, \"Sure, I guess. I do hope that you finally blossom the way you were meant to, Minnie. Though...stay away from any guys that go by the name Mickey.\" you wink, and she smiles and playfully slaps the side of your face. Your respond to it in a very overly dramatic manner, and then you and her part ways. You get home, put the groceries away, and then head into your room to finish your homework for school tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you and her, Minnie would soon start to become...less mini.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Original Author: Detective Barricade</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke in the morning from a very strange dream. One that had involved Minnie, the girl until yesterday you didn't even know existed. Of course, the only real indications that it was her was the hair and eye color, and that she had said, 'Not so small now, am I?'. And indeed, in your dream she was huge! And incredibly sexy! She could pick up a car and drive it around like it was a Hot Wheels toy car she had been so big. But...why would you dream about her of all girls? Why not Jasmine, or Penny, or Sakura? Or Dani, the captain of your school's cheer leading squad? But the humdrum of getting ready for school soon drowned the dream out and it was all but forgotten by the time you walked into the building and to your locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your locker and get out the books needed for first period - History. Not that you would be reading in them much, the History teacher seems to have the uncanny ability to cure insomnia just by listening to him drone on long enough. Somehow, you manage so far to not be failing his class despite being barely able to keep awake through it. You also pull out the books needed for English class in second period, as you'd hardly have time to go back to your locker, change books, and then run to English without being late. And late meant detention. However, today as you gather your books and head for History before the bell, someone runs into you as the two of you round the inconveniently placed corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH!\" You shout as your books and binder land around you, the History book landing dangerously close to your head. You then hear an way too oddly familiar, feminine voice cry out, \"HEY, WATCH IT YOU - Q-Quincy?\" Opening your eyes and looking forward, you saw Minnie looking back at you...in your school's girl's uniform. Your incredible super powers of common sense deduced that that meant she was a fellow student at your school. The white and blue with gold stripes and black skirt of the uniform look nice on her, but it certainly didn't help her look any older than half her actual age. Still, she seems...taller somehow, but you put it off as having hit your head on the floor when you fell and your brain was still trying to get itself back in order. You groan, \"M-Minnie?! Since when did you go to my school? Are you new or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinnie shakes her head and replies, \"Nope, not new. I've been going to this school since Grade 9. I'm guessing the same for you?\" You nod as the two of you pick up each others books. She notes the deadly weapon known as the History textbook and chuckles slightly, \"Ouch. History with Mr. Bore-talk right now? I think I'd have more fun watching paint dry in slow motion...\" You note that as she hands you back your textbooks, and you hers, she fidgets slightly. A minor tweak in the shoulder, a slight fiddling around there with her hand while trying to disguise it as fiddling with a bang. Maybe you weren't imagining things and she was a little taller than yesterday. You know from your younger sister when a girl's bra and/or bra strap is bugging her; she fiddled with hers all the time because your parents refused to buy her new clothes until there wasn't a shadow of a doubt that no more mileage could be gotten out of her old ones. Next year might be different once she went for her driver's license and could drive herself to the mall...but it wasn't next year yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, at least I can get some more winks in. Or maybe he's sick and we'll end up with a more interesting substitute teacher? Say... Are you alright? You're fiddling with your bra strap. And no, I'm not a pervert...okay, that's a bit of a lie, but I know about this sort of thing from experience.\" You say. Minnie raises an eyebrow and says almost coyly, \"Oh?\" You quickly dash that thought out of her head with, \"Not me... My 15 year old sister. At this point I'd personally buy her a set of new better fitting bras just to shut her up if I knew what she took!\" Minnie repeats her previous answer but with less intrigue. \"Oh. Yeah, it might be getting time for a new one of these things...in the child's training bra section. Woo... God I hate having to shop in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings signalling the warning to get to class, and you and Minnie part ways once again. First you encounter this girl at the store yesterday by chance. Then you have a dream about her. Then you find out she's been a student in your school for as long as you have. You wonder what sort of sick, twisted mind kept trying to bring you and Minnie together all of the sudden. If she had been a childhood friend that you just recently got back in touch with, sure. But up until yesterday, the only Minnie you knew of was the Disney character. It continued as you bumped into her again in the cafeteria at lunch, (thankfully not literally. Twice was more than enough) and the two of you sat together...earning you the stares of the guys in the worst possible way, but by now you decide to officially befriend her since you keep running into her. You find out that Minnie actually lived just a few houses down the street from you, easily walking distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, you mention that you had a game of hoops to play with the guys in the basketball court outside. \"Ooh, I love that game! You mind if I watch? Wouldn't want ya to have a seemingly 9 year old girl beat the pants off of you.\" Minnie says enthusiastically, though you had no idea if she was kidding or not about being that good at it...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After you finish and step out, you find that she's gone. Not one to turn your back on an arrangement, you decide to wait a few minutes for her. And indeed, a minute later, you hear a \"Finally!\" coming from the girl's washroom and Minnie exits. The exclamation is made clear; she had changed out of the uniform and back into the clothes she was wearing when you met her yesterday. A grey tank top with exposed midriff, a short blue skirt, and brown sandals. She has nothing to show off, but you had to slightly admire her efforts of trying...though maybe the front of her top poked out a little more than you remember. Or maybe your mind was playing tricks on you by making her be remembered as worse than she actually was. What you definitely know, however, is that she seems just a little bit taller than yesterday. She actually looks to be about 5 foot even if you wagered a guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally dropping it, you and she head for the basketball court where she sits in the front row bleacher which was rusty with age and weather. The boys show up and greet you, and you greet them in return. And the game was underway. You score a few times, but Jim scores more until the ball hit the hoop and bounces toward where Minnie was sitting, finally bringing his and the other boys' attention to her. This didn't look good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, what do we have here? You Quincy's little girlfriend? And I do mean little!\" Jim laughs, which Ty adds, \"Ha! My 8 year old sister has more curves than her!\" which gets all the other guys laughing. You could see Minnie already boiling with anger over the insults. And then Sid says something incredibly stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, little girlie! Why don't ya go back to your princess tea parties! I bet ya couldn't get the ball through the hoop if ya were right next to it!\" You see Minnie snap, but then gain a mischievous grin as she says. \"Alright, I'll take that challenge. If I can't get four shots in a row through the hoop without missing, then I'll come in tomorrow wearing a girly princess outfit. But, if I do get four shots in a row through the hoop, then not only do you guys have to shut up about my size and lack of anything, but you three have to come in tomorrow wearing the frilliest pink princess outfits you can possibly find. Do we have a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid seems to do the really hard thing of adding and says, \"Wait! There's four of us! You said three!\" Minnie nods, and replies, \"Very perceptive of you. But if you remember, Quincy here hasn't said anything bad to me. Thus, I don't count him among you three. Now, we have a deal, yes? Or are you boys too chicken to take a bet from a little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Chicken' and 'little girl' together in the same sentence seem to quickly coerce the boys into accepting the challenge. You decide to sit at the sideline as Minnie walks down to the court, ball in hands. She stands right at the slightly faded white shooting line (according to student council the lines for the outdoor basketball court were to be repainted this Summer but not word on the shabby bleachers) aims and...shoots the ball through the hoop. She goes to retrieve it for her next shot, with mumbles of, \"Lucky shot...\" and, \"She'll never do it again.\" and then she shoots...and it goes through the hoop cleanly again. The latter comment is repeated but with a worried, \"...Right?\" as Minnie...scores yet again. And her fourth and final throw finds its mark like a sniper taking the perfect shot. You, and the boys, are slack-jawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that was fun! Remember our agreement? That also counts behind my back, too, not just in front of me. But I'll be kind - I'll let you boys choose between a pointy hat and a tiara to wear with your princess outfits.\" Minnie joyfully announces and joins you on the walk back home while you remind yourself to not say anything that may be confused for a challenge around her, else potentially suffer the same fate as the boys. Still, you're awe-struck at just how good she was. \"That...how did you do that?!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinnie chuckles and answers, \"That? Practice. A girl can like skirts and sports, you know.\" You nod in acknowledgment, then ask, \"If you're that good, how come you haven't tried out for the girls basketball team? Or...are you already on it?\" Minnie's mood sours a little as she responds, \"I have been trying out for the team. Rejected every time. Care to guess why?\" You smartly shake your head as you already knew the answer. \"No no. It's their loss if it's any consolation. Anyway, my place is up ahead. Guess I'll see you tomorrow? Hopefully not as us playing human bumper cars.\" Minnie nods and says her goodbye as she turns down the other way to head for her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister catches up with you and says, \"Hiya, Quincy! Who's the little girl? She your girlfriend?\" Annoyed, you retort, \"That's Minnie, and she's 18 like I am despite her appearance. She even goes to our school, Jen. And we're just friends!\" Jen rolls her eyes and says, \"Right... Whatever you say, bro.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't make me have to come up there!\" Your mom's equivalent to a rooster in the morning. As much as you wanted to sleep in, you wanted to avoid one of your mom's rants about punctuality and being on time for things even more. You get up, prepare the clothes you'd wear today, and wait for what feels like an eternity for your sister to get out of the bathroom. Eventually she does and you enter to shower up for the day, putting your clothes on after. A bowl of Lucky Charms for breakfast later, you make a cup of coffee for yourself. You're about to drink it when the doorbell rings its usual first part to the Star Spangled Banner. Because your parents apparently thought a simple 'ding-dong' wasn't good enough to leave it at. And one lost game of rock-paper-scissors with Jen later, you go to answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the door, your first instinct is to ask, \"Who is it?\" since the shape in the door's frosted window wasn't recognizable at first. A familiar feminine voice answered back, \"The President of the United States of America. Or perhaps the candle-stick maker.\" Recognizing the voice as belonging to Minnie, you open up the door to let her in...only to half-choke on your coffee at the sight before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinnie was about eye level to you...and it was clear that her sandals were flat on the ground. As a matter of fact, you know that your own shoes boosted your height slightly, which means she was actually just slightly taller than you! Her figure had also improved dramatically as well. She's gone from a short, mostly flat rail of a girl to a tall, curvy hourglass dream of a girl with what you assume to be C- or D-cup breasts which her outfit accentuated perfectly. When you can finally peel your eyes away from the rest of her body, you notice that she's concerned. Finally, her concerns are revealed as she asks, \"Are...you okay, Quincy? You look like you've seen a ghost...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough to get the coffee out of your lungs and into your stomach where it belongs and then manage to reply back. \"I-I'm fine, Minnie. Just some coffee went down the wrong way. Uh...give...give me a minute and I'll join you in the walk to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinnie steps inside and mentions, \"Yeah...about that. School's out for at least the day. Apparently there's been some sort of bomb threat to the school last night and it's closed while the police investigate, in case the threat turns out to be real. Heard it on the radio. The lucky boys...\" you look at her quizzically and ask, \"Boys? Oh right! How could I forget that they were supposed to be wearing those frilly princess outfits today for losing that bet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go tell your mom that school's closed today and ask her to turn the radio on. Suspicious, she does exactly that only to find that it confirmed the story. Jen has already left, and you don't feel bothered to chase your sister down. She'd either figure something was up when she didn't see you running like a madman to catch up and get to school on time, or when she gets there and gets told to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading Minnie to your room, you close the door behind her gently and then sit in your desk chair while she sits on the side of your bed. \"So, uh...I don't mean to be rude or anything but... Just how the heck did you grow so big overnight?! You've grown over a foot in one night!\" you say, to which Minnie shrugs her shoulders and answers back, \"I...really don't know. I mean, I go to bed with my PJ's fitting fine. I wake up ending up having to tear them off me because I couldn't get them off. But you know the strangest thing? You see the clothes I have on now, right? These aren't new; they're the same ones that I wore when I first met you, and again after school yesterday. They've grown with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was really weird. A person growing over a foot taller and curvier overnight was one thing, but for their clothes to grow with them even when not wearing them? That didn't make sense in the least, and yet here it has apparently happened. \"Well I guess it's better than nothing at all fitting. But I guess you can shop for adult clothes now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinnie looks at you oddly and then says, \"I...I don't think so. I don't think I'm done growing. It's just a feeling I have, but...I...don't think I'll ever be done growing.\" You raise an eyebrow and remark, \"So you think you'll be the next 50 foot woman?\" She shakes her head and states, \"No, not even close. Bigger. Much, much bigger. Like even a galaxy would be smaller than a neutrino compared to me big, and even then just for a little while before I get even bigger and bigger. As in ever growing, Quincy.\" You feel your jaw drop onto the floor. Minnie giggles and adds, \"Scary thought, isn't it? Don't worry though, if it happens I promise to be a nice giantess...though if I get mad then something's still gonna get verbally chewed out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brings a smile to your face, mostly because you didn't like the idea of impending doom in the form of Minnie. As hot as a five-alarm blaze as she was now, you still find yourself preferring the role of friend than anything romantic. You and Minnie decide to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Provided Minnie didn't put her head minimum through the ceiling by growing, (or any other way for that matter else mom would bury you six feet under the ground with a tombstone if she's feeling generous) you see no harm in her being here. Besides, you remember what your sister Jen had said about Minnie yesterday when she was still about a foot shorter than you, and you feel as though Minnie should learn it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, my sister had called you a little girl yesterday after you left. Obviously, anyone who says that about you now has their head up their ass, or soon will, but...\" you say slyly. Minnie is unsurprisingly not nearly as troubled by it as yesterday, considering she more than looked like an 18 year old now and apparently the only thing she'll a mini anything any more is a mini-giantess, and even then not for long, but she catches on with what you're getting at. \"Did she really? I take it she's not Godzilla with boobs and butt wider than she is tall, as right now that's about the only thing that could genuinely call me 'small'. Hm...shall we...introduce her to me, then, make her have to learn Mandarin to retrieve her jaw from China?\" she says mischievously, and you reply smiling, \"Thought you'd never ask!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting for Jen to come home, you and Minnie plan out how you're going to go about giving her the spook of a lifetime. Soon enough, you hear the familiar opening and slam of the door from the kitchen indicating Jen was home and not in a good mood, and your mom's reminder to Jen not to slam the door. As you hear her stomping up the stairs, she was never gentle on them even when she was in a pleasant mood, you also hear her yelling at you, \"QUINCY! THE FREAKING SCHOOL'S CLOSED!!! WHY THE (yay) DID YOU NOT TELL ME, YOU (foul word) (donkey)HOLE!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought I had temper problems... I don't think there's enough soup in the world to clean out that potty-mouth!\" Minnie remarks with slight bemusement, and you do your best to stifle a laugh. When she was mad enough, Jen could and often did spew out enough swear words to make a sailor blush. And right now, she was moderately ticked. The curses really started flying when she went nuclear. \"Oh, I've heard worse. Catch her when she's just been dumped by her boyfriend, gotten a fail on several tests, mom's denied taking her to the mall again, and the piece de la resistance, she's just stepped in dog poo. Makes Hiroshima seem like a cherry bomb.\" Minnie's eyes quite understandably went wide, and you say as though reading her mind, \"True story. It has happened before, and she was grounded for oh...three, no, four months. Kept her quiet for fear of adding another month for every swear word out of her mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinnie hides out of sight while you open the door just as Jen was about to wrench on it. \"Careful,\" you warn, \"You break it dad will ground you for a year. You know he's getting tired of replacing it because you break it during your temper tantrums.\" Jen angrily responds with, \"Shut it, bro. Maybe if you hadn't been busy chatting it up with your little girlfriend you could have told me that school was closed today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnflinching, you say, \"Hey, by the time I found out about it you had already left. I figured you'd notice something was up when you didn't see me running down the street like a chicken with its head cut off!\" This was technically the truth, you just neglect to mention that you expected her to do precisely what she did. Mostly so you wouldn't be eating a sister-style knuckle sandwich. She punched quite hard when angry despite her slim body that lacks much of any indication of muscles that could power such a punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen, however, pushes at the events she saw yesterday. \"Really? And what, that little girl you claim to be 18 who's so obviously not told you it was? Never took you for a pedophile, Quincy! And what kind of lame name is Minnie, anyway?!\" And now time to spring the trap, as you reply simply, \"Her's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen turns around only to come face to...well, boob, with the now 6'7\" Minnie. While her growing wasn't part of the plan, you doubt she has any control over it. Besides that, it makes Jen's face all the more priceless as she stares up at the amazon with the now ironic name. \"Hi, I'm Minnie. You must be Jen. I hear you called me a little girl yesterday. Now, if you were, oh I don't know, the size of Godzilla and packing a T&amp;A; combo wider than you were tall, I guess you'd have every right to call me 'little'. Sadly, you aren't.\" Minnie leans down in front of your sister and says almost menacingly, \"I'm not little. I will never be little again. Do I make myself clear? Or do I need to help your mother clean out that potty-mouth of yours? I hear soap works really well. Perhaps I'll recommend it to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen's face, whiter than snow and paler than a ghost, is so priceless you're quick to take a few pictures. Your sister shakes her head quickly and stutters, \"N-no no... Y-you've made yourself p-perfectly clear! C-crystal clear, even! I-I gotta g-go...\" she bolts off faster than greased lightning and begins slamming her door, but then carefully closes it at the last second. You can imagine her curled up in the fetal position under the covers of her bed, and the thought brings a smile to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute, and pressing your ear to Jen's door to hear her whimpering, Minnie whispers to you, \"...You think I might have overdid it? I mean we agreed to it and all, but...\" you ease your now towering dark red haired friend with, \"Nah. You did fine. She'll be back to normal in a few days, though she's never gonna forget you now. By the way...was the growing really necessary? I mean, the look on Jen's face was priceless, but I don't recall agreeing to it...\" Minnie replied honestly, \"I know we didn't, but it's not like I can control these spurts. They just happen whenever the heck they feel like it, and my clothes and I are along for the ride. Though I gotta admit, I rather like towering over people now. It's nice compared to the other way around, y'know?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Original Author: Detective Barricade</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day went on, you and Minnie decide to head out and enjoy the nice weather and the lack of school. Plus by now it was nearing noon and you doubt your mom wants to have to make something for three teens, one of whom possibly able to eat like a pack of starving wolves to fuel her growing, already towering body. Not that you're exactly light on the food budget yourself. The two of you head for the park, and while you feel the need to bundle up slightly, Minnie doesn't seem bothered at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you cold? I mean today hasn't exactly warmed up much, and I'm bundled up in a light jacket. And yet you look as though you're perfectly comfortable!\" you say. Minnie looks down at you, apparently greatly enjoying being able to do so, and says, \"If you asked me a few days ago, I'd look like Kenny from South Park...only my jacket wouldn't be bright orange because clearly that asks for trouble. Usually I really don't like the cold. I hated winter unless it cancelled school as a kid. But lately...it's strange. I...don't really feel it. Seems to also apply for heat, too. Last night when I was cooking and I opened the oven...the heat from it only felt pleasantly warm rather than really hot. And yet, <i>body heat</i> I feel perfectly normally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guess that it's just as well, considering that only her current attire grows with her from what you had to go by. \"Well at least you won't freeze to death out in the vacuum of space when you outgrow Earth. Or get burned by the Sun.\" you say jokingly. Eventually the two of you reach the park, and the pizza shop nearby. The smell alone from outside gets your stomach rumbling, and you can see Minnie biting her lip slightly in anticipation of biting into a slice or so. \"I hope you brought your money with you, you look about ready to dive head-first into an entire pizza just by yourself!\" you mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinnie responds by pulling out her wallet, and then saying in an overly dramatic manner, \"Le sigh... Chivalry, why did you have to die?\" you pull out your own, and then you both place your orders. You note how while you simply go with a can of soda, Minnie goes with a small bottle to go with her larger order. And once money exchanges hands, and pizza slices come out of the pizza oven and onto disposable plates, you and Minnie sit down by the window to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odd thing, however, is that while you eat almost as if you've never seen food before... Minnie's taking her time. You half-expected her to be eating like Garfield the cat from the newspaper comics. And yet, she's eating very sensibly! \"What?\" she finally says as she takes a swig of her Dr. Pepper, thrusting her boobs forth unintentionally...not that you mind. \"I half-expected you to be stuffing your face like a certain fat orange cat...\" you admit. She swallows her mouthful of Dr. Pepper and then begins laughing her head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft - HA HA HA HA! Oh, that's a good one! I'm a growing girl, not a pig. Besides...It's not like I feel desperate for food as of late, you know? I mean, by every right with all the growing I've done, I should be eating like a human locust, and yet I haven't. Probably just as well. I don't think eating planets will win any favors, do you? I'm not Unicron.\" she says, the latter name catching your attention. Unicron was the name of a massive, fictional character from an '80's cartoon called Transformers, as you discovered when looking up stuff after having watched the first live action Transformers movie in 2007. He devoured worlds, if you remember the facts correctly, so you quickly agree with Minnie that it wouldn't go down well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that would be bad. But how did you-\" you begin asking, but she cuts you off with, \"I happen to have a thing for giant transforming robits. Give me Hot Shot over Barbie any day. I'm full of surprises, aren't - uh-oh. Oh yay, another...\" you wonder what this 'another' happens to be when you notice her head start creeping up towards the light. Her hand too starts covering more and more of the bottle she's holding. Of course during all this, her clothing keeps up with her. Not a hint of tightness to be found that wasn't there earlier when she was only 6'1\". Eventually, she stops growing and seems somewhat uncomfortable. You look under the table and discover the source: her legs are being forced to bend awkwardly for them to fit beneath the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...<i>conveniently </i>inconvenient. I've gotta be like 7 feet tall or something now. I hope I'm done for a little while at least, I'd like to be able to go to school to scare the crap outta the boys with how big I've become. And see them in those girly princess dresses from the bet.\" Minnie says, and then asks hopefully, \"So...wanna shoot some hoops with an amazon?\"</span></div></div>",

Once you had that, you're on your way back to the park and to the waiting basketball court. It consists of little more than a poured concrete pad and the raised net, but it does the job well enough for what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon your and Minnie's game is underway. No less than 10 minutes into it, you're panting and sweating, and perhaps just a bit tired. Minnie on the other hand seems as though she hasn't even broken a sweat yet, and is still raring to go. Then again, you're wearing a light jacket while she's dressed for warmer weather...and she's about 7 feet tall currently. Or maybe there's something more to it? You don't know, and likely neither does Minnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue your game, some all too familiar faces show up: the boys from yesterday. Interestingly, they seem to be admiring Minnie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that girl is on fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that? She sure knows how to show off, and not just in her skills with the ball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, they don't recognize her as the same kiddish looking girl that completely humiliated them yesterday and was expecting them to go to school wearing princess outfits. They do, however, notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Quincy! Who is <i>that</i> girl? She is <i>hot</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's like a princess...a princess of the court!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last words seem to get a reaction from Minnie, who had been mostly absorbed in the game up until now. After sending the ball through the hoop once again, she shot it to you and you caught it - barely. It had almost slipped out of your hands it had been thrown so hard. You wisely decide to take a few steps away, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I'm hot now, am I? A 'princess of the court', huh? Well...it's an improvement, at least.\" Minnie says as she turns around to face the boys, who by now are only just starting to clue in that they should know her from somewhere. She slowly walks over to them, and it's only when she's almost directly in front of them do they begin to recognize her...and notice not only how hot she's become, but how tall she is as she towers over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's funny. You boys seemed a lot bigger and confident yesterday when I beat you.\" Minnie says with icy calm, and then continues, \"But then, I've been doing some growing lately. I still expect you boys to dress up in those girly princess dresses for the next school day, just so you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the boys stutters out her name in fear and awe at the amazon she's become. \"M-Minnie?! I-is that really you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a little fun by mentioning, \"That was kind of my reaction just this morning. And while she was taller than me then, she wasn't nearly as towering as she is now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems to set the boys' minds firmly into the fear zone. Minnie grins and says, \"That's true! Were you looking for a rematch? I smoked you guys when I wasn't even 5 feet tall, I can <i>definitely</i> do so now at, oh, 7 feet tall at least. Oh! Check that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinnie seems to shudder slightly and then begins to grow quite visibly taller and taller. As she continues to grow, she tells them, \"Looks like I'm just going to keep getting BIGGER and BIGGER! Why, if this keeps up, I'll be too BIG to fit in school... But don't you worry, little ones, I still expect you in those girly princess dresses even if Quincy here needs to take a picture of it for me. And just so you don't get the thought in your heads... If he fails to show me the picture, and I think you're responsible or not living up to your end of the bet... I will come for you guys. I leave it up to your imaginations as to what a BIG girl like me will do to you. Jack and the Beanstalk might be a good read for some ideas...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys can't take anymore of this and flee from the now 7'6\" tall Minnie, who finishes growing for the time being just as they run away in terror. A full minute after they're gone, you and she begin to laugh at the looks on their faces. \"Leaving it up to their imagination also means I don't have to try and come up with anything to threaten to do to them! A good thing because then I'd probably let slip I was bluffing...\" Minnie admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her and ask curiously, \"And the whole having me take a picture to show you thing? Do you really think...\" you trail off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinnie sits down and says with a slight sigh, \"...That I'll get that big by tomorrow? These spurts are random, and so too is the intensity of each one. I might be done for the week or more, or I might find myself staring at a tiny dot that comprises the entire universe in the next hour at most. I really don't know, but it can't hurt to at least try and be prepared, right?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It still boggles your mind how she's grown from 4'10\" to 6'1\" overnight, about 15 inches, and then to 7'6\" tall over the course of today, which translates to 17 inches. A full 32 inches of growth since yesterday! It also boggles your mind just how attractive she had been this morning, and those proportions have stayed with her even up to since you parted ways with her today. You're happy for her to be now easily recognizable as an 18 year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And yet, you're also a little worried about Minnie. She has repeatedly stated that she believes her growth spurts may never stop, and so far they obviously haven't. She's also noted that they happen randomly, which again so far seems to be true, and that their intensity also appears to be random. She says that she might find herself staring at a tiny dot that is the universe potentially in the next hour at most, and that is what worries you. If she really grows that big that quickly...how is she going to handle that? All you really can do is hope that she at least doesn't grow that big that quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, you decide it's safe to silently breathe a sigh of relief. In your room, you prepare your camera for the next day and make sure you have a fresh set of batteries for it. Then you go downstairs for dinner, noting with silent delight how your sister Jen is still spooked over the scare you and Minnie gave her this morning. After dinner, as you and your sister return to your rooms, you offhandedly mention to her, \"Oh, yeah, remember Minnie from this morning? She's much bigger now than she was just this morning. Thought you'd like to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your amusement, Jen squeaks and then runs into her room as fast as her lean yet powerful legs can carry her. (you can attest to their power as she's kicked you on more than one occasion, and it hurt every time. Fortunately for you, she's never kicked you in the...sweet spot yet) You hear her actually gently close her door as opposed to slamming it. After that bit of fun, you eventually prepare yourself for bed and go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you prepare once again to go to school. As you leave the house, you note that Minnie isn't around waiting to join you on the walk. A little odd considering she was looking forward to the boys being all dressed up in the frilliest pink princess outfits in the history of mankind, but perhaps she's already gone ahead? Nevertheless, you head for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, Jen stops and surprisingly clings to you as if hoping to hide behind you for safety. She's almost never done this before. \"D-did you see that?\" she stammers with obvious fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, you ask, \"See what, Jen? And you realize how uncomfortable I am with my arm in your cleavage, right? You're my sister for crying out loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen realizes what she's doing and very quickly relinquishes your arm. She then replies fearfully, \"I-I saw something moving through the trees! S-something BIG!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and state, \"Uh-huh, sure. It's probably your imagination. Now let's get moving before we're late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you continue on your way. About a minute later, you get the odd feeling that you're being watched. Jen isn't looking at you, so you look towards the trees. There! It's only for a moment, but you see a dark shadow peering from the trees. Something...oddly feminine, and much larger than a normal human, but it's gone before you can get a good look at it. However you're more concerned about making it to school on time than trying to figure out what it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school, the boys are indeed in the most humiliating princess dresses they could possibly find, and most of the school is in a furious uproar of laughter over it. You take plenty of pictures, and record these events on your camera. Yet throughout the day, you see no sign of Minnie. Every class you share with her, she's marked down as absent. By the end of the school day, you're worried. Minnie would not have missed this day unless she had absolutely no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, Jen decides to go hang out with her friends a bit before heading home, leaving you to head there alone. Along the way, you get the same sensation from this morning, and turn to see that shadow from earlier in the trees. As your curiosity starts to get the better of you, you hear it say, \"Psst! Quincy! Over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the shadow and then quickly find yourself pulled in. The shadow reveals itself as Minnie, but she's now...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Guess that would explain why you weren't at school today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts not very often you are impressed, scared ,and aroused at the same time, but there are always firsts I suppose. Now that you are more acclimatized to Minnie's new-found height, you notice she on her hands and knees, keeping just under the tree line. To your surprise despite her age she seems to be on the verge of going into a bawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minne, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite being the size of a building, im fine, why do you ask anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that she is actually whispering, but you aren't complaining, maybe if she spoke in her full voice it might break you eardrums. Though its still very powerful.<br>\r\nYou realize that you fixated on Minne's volume and not her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you come up with \"oh nothing, just looked like you were about to cry is all.\"<br>\r\nAlmost instantly she responds \"the only tears i'll be crying are tears of joy! This is amazing! Im so tall, I can't wait until i see those boys again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There's a slight pause. \"Speaking of which,\" you say \"here are the pictures, although I don't even know if you can see them now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's visibly difficult for her to see it mostly because of the small screen compared to her, you know however that she seen them due to the giggle she let out afterwards. \"They looked so done with it there! Ha!\"<br>\r\n\"Serves them right thou-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops talking suddenly, and begins to grow once more! Slowly at first speeding up and slowing down after agian until Minnie stopped growing entirely. I appeared as if she had grown about 18 feet bringing her to about 83 feet in height! Well over the tree line now. It appaers as if her breasts had grown as well but if they had it was a negligible difference. But putting your thoughts behind you, Minnie was breathing heavily, with one eye closed and her arms around her chest, almost as if she was in pain. You doubt this to be the case however she had developed a lovely wide smile despite the breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im getting kinda big, aren't I? Oh my god this feels so good. I would say you should try it sometime, but this dosen't seem like the kinda thing you can just, well, do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be kind of cool to be big like that but you also kinda like the view from down here. She dosen't need to know that though. And you hope Minnie never does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Quincy, you're, uh, looking kind of, freaked out by this. Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhh...\" \"Yeah um fine just a little worried is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worried? About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you'll grow and I'll be crushed by accident or something, I dunno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while of silence, Minnie moves her had and picks you up, jolting you upwards leaving you a little jarred at the sudden movement. \"You can't be crushed if you're not under me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently dissagree. But its not like you can do anything to stop her, she is nearly a hundred feet tall, so theres not much anyone can do at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize what time it is. Jen is probably at home already, even after hanging out with her friends. So you say that you have to go to Minnie. With a slighty dissapionted face she puts you down and says her goodbyes. You say goodbye as well and you go off. You wonder how large Minnie would be by tommorow.</span></div></div>",

You only really woke up when you dad called you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still kinda asleep having breakfast in the morning but you remember Minnie for a moment and ponder at her new height. How large would she be now? 100 feet? 1000 feet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got an answer pretty fast as you felt strong tremors, causing you to choke o  your cereal. Your parent were panicking beliving it to be an earthquake (understandbly) but you knew far, far better. It was Minnie, without a doubt. Quickly you darted to the window in the living room while everyone else in your house, possibly in your neighbourhood was hiding under something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were starting to believe that it truly was just an earthquake, an enormous shoe crashed down and then turned towards you and stopped moving entirely.<br>\r\nClearly she was waiting for you but you really don't know why. Regardless it is abundantly clear that she is much larger than before. Knowing very well what Minnie could do and that she would if she were irritated, you head outside despite mom saying you shouldn't in case the tremors start again, not understanding what was really happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as Minnie saw you she picked you up. You were expecting a lot of pain, but it was surprisingly soft. She swiftly brought you up to her eye so she could see you clearer. You were only about the size of her pupil at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were expecting her to say something but she didn't, staying quiet for a small amount longer before hearing screams coming from Jen, and my dad yelling for her to let me down. Mom passed out almost instantly upon seeing Minnie. And at her new height which seemed to be about 150 feet, I don't blame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinnie, previously looking at my family, looked back at me and said as quietly as possible \"What do i do, Quincy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After you are out at what seems to look like a desert, you quickly are happy with your desicion. You notice Minnie say to here self \"Here we go again\" Then you dash to about 50 yards away from her and look up just in time to see her grow to double... no triple here size plus some! \"Minnie you are now like 500 feet tall!\" You say though you are quavering just slightly. Minnie notices the quavering and asks \"What's wrong, Quincy? Are you alright? You almost seem scared!\" You then say you are slightly scared. Minnie says \"But I have not hurt you yet and I have picked you up and held you tqice now, you have not been hurt in an accident and I have been causeing very minimal damge.\" You say \"But though you have said that, would ypu be afraid iny shoes if you were in the presence to a 500 foot tall woman and can grow at any intensity at any point?\" \"I see your point\" came the reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Minnie suddenly says \"What if you stayed on my shoulder so you couldn't get crushed or anything. And not just for a few minutes like next time?\" So you agree and and once again you are on her shoulder and with no pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask Minnie if she knows the source of her growth yet. Unsurprisingly, she doesn't.  Then you came out with \"How do you not hurt me at all, even accidentally, when you pick me up?\" Minnie answers your question woth \"I know how to gently pick things up and I could hurt you if I really wanted to. But you would have to murder innocent people and animals, and multiple of them for me to hurt you anyway.\" You feel relief, but not enough to cover your worries completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Minnie grows again to 750 feet. You sincerely get a sense of vertigo as you see the ground grow further and further away. You ask Minnie if she ever feels pain when she grows. \"No, all I feel is tingly and this weird almost satisfying sensation. So, no I feel no pain. Otherwise you might have heard some really loud screams.\" You smile and she laughs and then you wonder if it could be causing the growing. Other then from 4 feet 10 inches to 6 feet and 1 inch, 7 and a half feet to 65 feet, and 83 feet to 150 feet, you were in her presence ehen she grew. You teel Minie your sundden revelation, but she doesn't think that is the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realize that she might still wanna be recognized as a godess so uou ask her to let you down so you can bow to her. She then laughs so hard you think you might fall off because she is shaking so much. \"Just because I'm a giantess doesn't mean I am a godess or anything. I don't wanna rule, I'm not suddenly royal because I'm 750 feetbtall and still growing. You apologize and get assured you made a easy mistake. \"I'm going to be evergrowing, why not be a gentle giantess?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you then find out that she would not be b mean unless you were mean to her. You honestly don't know yow you didn't earlier so you shake your head. Minie asks if you are okay. You insist you are. \"Getting a slight sense of vertigo, though.\" You say. \"Do you want me to set you down?\" Minnie asks. You reply with \"No, no, I'm fine! It is just that I never thought there could be a giantess except in fiction books. And especially not one that is evergrowing you is nice and gentle, who began at 4' 10\" and is currently at the height of 750 feet and could increase that height at any time.\" So Minnie agrees. Not a mere 5 seconds after you agree does Minnie grow again. This time to the height of.... ?</span></div></div>",

You estimated her hight to be about 2 miles tall whuch is over 10,000 feet! You almost faint at the thought of that.

That many double shifts take their toll on you. You would be getting up at 3 AM, and getting ready for another double shift, but sense it was the first of your days off, you slept in until just past noon on this Friday. You're about 6'2\" and 245 pounds approximately, but even at that size you were still physically exhausted when you got up. You shrugged some of it off as you got ready for the day. You're hungry, but don't feel like cooking today, so you get ready and start walking out the door to Dave's Diner. You pass it every day to and from work weather you were walking, or driving. You lock up and head there on foot today. Your house is close to the diner, but the area of the city you live in is right next to woods that aren't developed so to prevent flooding. They are pretty large, but there is a beautiful late right in the middle. It'd probably be faster walking than driving, sense the shortcut through the woods saved you a couple miles of driving around even with the lake in the middle.<br>\r\nIt's warm enough out today to go swimming, but not quite hot enough to make you start sweating. The path you are taking is one you have walked so many times it is almost dirt all the way to the lake. From there, there are 3 or 4 paths that are much less worn in, and harder to spot. The sun is shining brightly, but the forest gives you plenty of shade, yet allowing in plenty of light. When you passed through open thatches, you couldn't see a single cloud in the clear, blue sky. It was an ideal walk through the woods until you get to the lake in the middle of the woods. Its waters are clear and blue as it gets deeper, but you see a woman who looks quite flustered, and on the edge of a full breakdown. She's facing away from you, but you can still tell she is a good looking woman.<br>\r\n\"Agh! She said this was supposed to be a shortcut, but I can't find that other path out! It's just one thing after another lately. First my family dies in that car accident, then I had to move out of my home, and just when my luck changed and I got this job, I get lost trying to take a shortcut in the first week.\" mumbled the woman just loud enough for you to hear, without noticing you were there. You approach her quietly unintentionally. You ask in a way where you're doing your best not to startle her \"Hey, are you ok?\" She turns around to face you, partially startled, but quickly calming down. \"Not really, I'm kind of lost in these woods and running late for work.\" You couldn't help but to check her out quickly, like any man. Her chest was almost busting out of her waitress uniform, and everything else compiled with that was perfect, even her deep emerald eyes, long brunette hair. \"Uh, well, I'm heading to Dave's Diner. I can show you the way there from here if you want.\" Her face perks up when you mention Dave's Diner. You had a feeling she worked there from the uniform. \"That's exactly where I am heading!\" she says with some excitement. You can't help but to blush slightly at her beautiful smile. \"Well it's this way if you will follow me.\" you say trying to get your thoughts back together, and start walking the correct way. \"By the way, my name's Jenna. What yours?\" she asks as she begins to follow you. \"My name's Wyatt. Pleasure to meet you Jenna.\" You say with a smile, only glancing back for a short moment, trying not to make too much eye contact with this beautiful woman.<br>\r\nYou both walk through the forest, and arrive at the Diner shortly there after. You take a window seat, by accident, in her section. You are the only one in the restaurant other than the staff today it seems. Jenna arrives at your table with a slight look of surprise at you sitting there, and another waitress standing behind, as if to make sure she didn't screw up. Jenna hands you a menu and asks \"What will you be having to drink today?\" You had the menu back, ordering out of memory \"I'll have a water to drink, and a Big Johns Burger, with fries.\" She seems a little shocked that you didn't need the menu, and continues \"How do you want your burger done, and what fixin's do you want on it?\" You reply happily at the question \"Medium rare please, and all the fixings.\" Jenna nods and reads back the order she wrote down to you. with your nod of approval, she walks away. It's not long before she comes back with your water. she sets it down on a coaster and then says to you slightly awkwardly \"Apparently you're the only one who has been in all day so far. They're letting me leave after I finish your service, and they show me some things in the back.\" You catch from her tone, and the way she said it, she is hinting at something, and telling you it for a reason. You respond with \"Well I'm free today, would you...\"</span></div></div>",

It'd give you some time to go home and put something better on. You were wearing your work clothes, you had put them on out of instinct at this point. \"Yeah that works for me.\" you say with a smile on your face as you see her face get more excited. You continue and finish your meal. You make glances at her, and look away when she looks back, and you managed to notice she was watching you too, but looks away in embarrassment when you catch her. You leave a 25% tip like you usually do, but leave before you can see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are laying on the grass, facing the bright sky with your eyes closed. The sun feels good on your skin. You are wearing your light grey swimming trunks, and a white tank top. You're notice the patch of grass you are in is pretty slippery. Suddenly everything goes dark as Jenna leans over you blocking the sun. You open your eyes as it takes a second to adjust to the difference in brightness. \"Did I wake you up?\" asked Jenna as she continued leaning over you. \"Yeah, I was having this great dream that I was waiting at this lake for this awesome girl named Jenna, who happens to look as good as you.\" You answer flirtatiously. It appears to have worked, because she blushed some before she responded with \"Well that sounds like quite a dream, well you're dream may be true.\" During her response you check out what she is wearing. She is wearing a red plad button up shirt (her breasts still trying to burst out, but it fit better than the waitress uniform), and a red bikini top under that. She's wearing cutoff jeans showing off her long beautiful legs and perfect ass, flip flops showing her nice feet (though you have never really had much of a foot fetish), and it seems she is wearing a red bikini bottom under her cutoff jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the real life version better\" you say as you quickly jump up, making sure not to hit her as you get up. You turn to face her, and take a step back. She goes to take a step forward and trips and falls on you. Her head lands on the top of your chest, accidentally pinning you both to the ground. \"Oaf. I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to!\" she says as she tries to get back up quickly, and now embarrassed. Her hand slips on the slick grass, and collapsed back onto you. Her face now beet red. She tried again, and slips, and tries one more time even quicker, and her own lack of thought and coordination causes her to fall this time. She is now more embarrassed than she has ever been. Before she can try a fourth time, you hug her and pull her back down and say to her \"I think something doesn't want you to get back up, so if it's ok, why don't you just stick around down here.\" She nods yes, then proceeded to half curl up, and hide her face into your chest, not thinking that she was still on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stay like that for a little while before you ask \"I take the fact that you chose to stay here for so long means you kind of like me. Can I tell you a secret?\" She looks up from hiding her face in your chest, and nods yes. You smile and look her in the eye when you go to say thing \"I kind of really like you.\" She started to smile, and asks you \"Can I tell you a secret in return?\" You nod yes. \"You're the first person to be nice to me sense I moved here last month,\" she says looking into your chest, \"I've had some pretty bad luck lately with just about everything lately, except getting a job and a place to stay. I've been pretty lonely sense my family passed away in a car wreck recently.\" Your hart goes out to her as you try to consul her \"Well you don't have to be alone as long as I'm around.\" She smiles and takes it all in for a moment. She looks you in the eyes, her deep, beautiful emerald eyes were almost lost, but very hart felt when she proceeded to say to you \"I've never technically had a boyfriend because no one was around where I lived, but will you be my boyfriend?\" You sigh slightly, and smirk as you say \"Only if you'll be my girlfriend.\" She un-hides and hugs you with quite full excitement and joy. \"Of course! I think that's a rule of being my boyfriend! Uh... do you mind if I...? Never mind.\" She says, and she just goes in and kisses you. You feel your hart skip a beat. In the kiss, you feel a spark of static electricity, but a strange feeling flowing from you to her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Imagine-real machine Mk. II is ready to begin testing. It had popped into your head one day at the bar, and while you normally don't do anything that pops into your head after a drink or two, especially when the room seems to be spinning, this one stuck in your head even after the hangover the day after relented its fury on your skull. (why you let your co-workers convince you to go there is beyond anyone's guess. Even a few glasses of wine are enough to make you regret it later) Not unlike...her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour best friend when you were growing up wasn't even real. She was imaginary. And while this made it a little difficult to play with her, she was always rather bubbly, cheery, and friendly towards you and anyone else around. To you, she was real...until you got to the age where having an imaginary friend was considered uncool and you were forced to stop believing in her. Eventually, you mostly forgot about her and started talking and playing with real people, but deep down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, the details of the machine are that it's supposed to make anything imagined real - to a certain extent. It couldn't be used for violent purposes, period. it wouldn't produce anything sharper than a plastic butter knife, and a terrible one at that. So something told you, anyway. A voice that is...suspiciously feminine, until you think about it too hard and it returns to being 'your' voice. But how would this prototype perform on its first test? You have no idea, but you intend to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the helmet on your head and tighten the strap. You check the cables leading from it to a computer, and then from the computer to a large box-like space that just barely avoids touching the ceiling opposite of where you have a seat for comfort and said computer next to. Again, you have no clue why you needed a box-like structure about your height, but something told you it was important. Along with the sitting part. You also keep a fire extinguisher close at hand in case things get nasty with this test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flick the switch and begin to imagine something. You imagine a dollar bill. The machine responds and a dollar bill appears in the floor of the box...although it's clearly fake. You figure it's because you don't know the full details of what goes into making money, but it's still something to point out if you're to sell people on this machine if you can get it past prototyping. \"Perhaps something a little bigger than a Washington? Why not?\" you subconsciously ask and answer yourself, as though repeating someone else's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou imagine an apple, all the ins and outs of what an apple should be and whatnot. Again, the Imagine-real Mk. II reacts and an apple appears inside the box. You get up and examine it, then bite into it. It is definitely an apple, indistinguishable from one you could find at a grocery store. You put the core in the garbage, unsure if the seeds would yield an apple tree as you've never seen one in your life to be able to put that detail in. \"I need another test. Just one more. Fine.\" you again say, as though repeating the words of someone else. It's almost like...no. That's just silly! You're just tired. You're alone. You like having an intelligent conversation, yes! You're not going crazy, no! ...Now you feel like something is silently giggling at your thought-impression of Megatron from Beast Wars, a show you watched reruns of growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus your thoughts away from the megalomaniac character that you most certainly do not want entering the real world and try to think of something else to imagine into reality. All this use of imagination though is making you tired, and you instead drift off into sleep before you can shut the machine off. To make matters worse, you had forgotten to install a safety in case the user falls asleep. It had never occurred to you to put it in...or perhaps something made sure you wouldn't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before you're dreaming. And in your dream, an all too familiar girl spies you and announces, \"Te-he-he! At last...Now's my chance! Be seeing you real soon!\" before running into the mists of your mind. Suddenly a loud alert jolts you awake - the computer is experiencing an error! Something's materializing in the box, but you don't recall imagining - the dream. Oh no. A fire breaks out and you grab the fire extinguisher. You blast the fire and put it out with the extinguisher, but it's too late. The Imagine-real machine Mk. II is wrecked. Strangely, unlike with the Mk. I's failure, you don't feel like rebuilding it. ...In fact, the idea of it has disappeared from your mind. You can't remember how to build it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention to the smoke clearing out of what remains of the machine, and you start to piece things together... \"The Imagine-real machine never was my idea, was it?\" you say aloud. But instead of answering yourself like before, a familiar feminine voice answers back from within the mist, \"Nope. It was mine. Made for a single main purpose: to bring me into your world.\" The smoke clears and inside the box is revealed to be your imaginary friend, only, she's no longer imaginary! She appears like...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her pose was seemingly stripped straight out of a Terminator movie, only she wasn't naked like you would have suspected. No, she's fully clothed, albeit in a rather revealing attire that serves to accentuate her...very generous curves. Her long, light brown hair is draped over her face until she looks up at you with her brilliant hazel eyes that could almost border on yellow. She appears everything you imagined her to be, only much older and fitting your age. She stands and...bumps her head on the roof of the box. You're about average height, roughly 6'1\" and a little lanky in body, and she's easily 7 feet tall if not taller. Rubbing her head, she steps out and wraps you in the biggest, most real bear hug she could ever deliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it worked brilliantly! It's me, Mimi! You wouldn't believe how hard it was to get you to go along with my idea...Oh wait. Yes you would!\" Mimi says cheerfully. You had named her Mimi because you thought the name was cute at the time. You were 5 or 6 back then; you're just glad you didn't call her Princess Poopypants or something else embarrassing. You poke her in her exposed bellybutton and she giggles as you note how real it felt. And how realistically warm she felt. But you know little about the human body, especially a female body, and she looks as real as any other girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come now. You know those Sex-Ed classes we sat through together gave you enough information for the machine to construct a human female body! And those sites online.\" Mimi states reassuringly and upon seeing your blank stare adds, \"I guess I have to explain. We started being BFF's when you were 5, right? But by 8 or so, you had abandoned me like an old toy, all because it was uncool to have an imaginary friend. But before you did, you promised me that you'd find a way to make me real. I think that if you had completely stopped believing in me, I would have ceased to exist. However, I was always real to you. Deep down, you never did stop and so I continued to exist alongside you quietly. It was so boring, and yet I kept quiet and kept my faith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then...how did we come up with this...thing?\" you ask, pointing to the ruined machine. \"I'm getting there, I'm getting there! As the years passed, I started noting and fearing that you...might not be able to come up with the means on your own. I had this idea for a little while, I'm not exactly sure when we came up with it or how we managed to get it to work, but I knew my chance came the other day after you got hammered at the bar. Your grip on your conscious mind slipped just enough for me in your subconscious mind to slip the idea in. A crack in your mind, if you will. And once your hangover had cleared, I was able to be in your conscious mind again albeit mostly quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember that feminine voice that kept encouraging you that would suddenly turn into your voice when you thought on it? That was me. I needed you to be encouraged to keep going so that you could make good on your promise to make me real, Marco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're surprised at the use of your name. You're also surprised at how much thought Mimi had put into making herself real. Her clothes felt very real to you, and you can pull at least part of her miniskirt away from her body and see more pale skin. As she was your best friend, now no longer imaginary, you dare not tempt sticking your hand further down there or pulling her clothes off. However, she giggles and says to you, \"I can assure you that I'm very real now, even under my clothes. You can stop pulling at them now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop and ask, \"Uh, how...how come you look...well, look like you do? Last I remember of our time together, you were still a kid and shorter than me!\" Mimi doesn't hesitate to say, \"Well if I'm going to be in the real world to be with you, I wanted to update myself based on what we wanted. Remember, I was imaginary still until just a few minutes ago. So I ended up being basically your dream girl and sharing your preferences. Of course now my preferences can't be influenced by you, but whopping G-cup breasts, a butt that rivals a certain celebrity's own posterior, three hoots and a holler hot, and being very tall all go very nicely with my hair and eye colors, as well as my wit and personality you gave me when you were 5.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's true. When puberty hit you, you had gone from 'girls have cooties' to liking girls almost overnight. But you found yourself especially drawn towards taller girls as well as particularly well endowed ones either up top or downstairs in the rear. It makes sense now for Mimi to have taken these preferences for herself to make her an extremely attractive amazon. And you even know girls that have worn such revealing outfits before, admittedly even feeling some of the outfits in the women's clothing section when you've had to shop for clothes. But now you want to go outside and let Mimi see the world through her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to think, this morning your imaginary friend was the last thing on your mind. Now that she's real, you feel like a kid again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Mimi looks around at the world around her with a huge grin plastered on her face. Clearly she's very much enjoying being with you for real. You're certainly enjoying her very real company yourself, and how she seems to almost hop with every barely contained energetic step. Yet she demonstrates a gentleness belying her imposing size, exactly as you imagined her years ago...minus the imposing size part, of course.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Granted there was no way she was going to want to intentionally hurt anybody, as you created her with a personality that would never do such a thing, and your preference for the gentle giantess stories ought to be imprinted in her mind. Still, you ask nervously, \"Are...are you going to stop growing anytime soon? You're kind of already 50 - no, 60 feet tall...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi bends down, hands on her hips, and says playfully, \"Are you kidding, Marco? I'm only just getting started here! Hm...but you know? I think I need to really show you something neat...in a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've no idea what your no-longer-imaginary friend has planned to show you, but the growing beauty that hails from your imagination continues her growth. 70 feet pass, then 80 feet. She grows to 100 feet tall, shakes her head, and then starts growing some more. You try to focus on her to make her stop somehow, but as she's no longer a part of your mind you have no influence on her any longer. She sticks her tongue out and replies with a giggle, \"Aw, were you trying to focus on me? Sorry, not gonna work, buddy! Don't worry, you're gonna love what I've got to show you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she's still very friendly with you. Everyone else in the street makes the wise decision to keep out of the way of the gorgeous, energetic, growing young woman. 110 feet goes by her, then 120 feet! In a few seconds, 130 feet is surpassed. \"Wait for it... Wait for it...\" Mimi says as she continues to grow bigger and bigger. She grows past 140 feet, and then finally stops at a full 150 feet tall. \"This will do quite nicely. And now for my next trick, I need something...a person? Nah, I wouldn't want to leave that burned into their memories for as long as they live. Ah-HA! I spy with my not-so-little eye something that is...yellow! With black stripes!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what could possibly be yellow with black stripes, but then your question is answered when Mimi picks up a parked Camaro that is yellow with a pair of black racing stripes running from the hood to the back, but not across the roof. If you remember right, there was a certain movie back in the summer of 2007 that had made that particular coloring and model of Chevy Camaro very popular. Recalling further, one of the main characters in the movie, a robot named Bumblebee, turned into a yellow Camaro with black stripes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi peers through the windshield of the car and asks, \"Hellooo... Anybody in there? If you are, now's a good time to let me know so I can let you out to safety. No one? Good!\" she lowers the car to the ground beside her feet once she's sure no people or pets are inside, and then says, \"Everyone, stand back! No, not out into the road...you'll get run over, and that's not good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a bad feeling now what Mimi is about to do, and you plead with her, \"Mimi... Insurance doesn't cover damages caused by a giantess, and that car isn't exactly cheap to buy... Please don't do it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi looks at you, smiles, and then says, \"Don't do what? Don't do this? Whoops!\" as she brings her foot over the Camaro and promptly stomps down hard onto it, putting every bit of her weight into it. You turn away the moment she does, and you assume the audience's collective gasps are of horror when she yells, \"Ta-da! One pancaked Camaro! ...Or, is it? Behold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly turn your gaze back to Mimi's enormous foot, clearly flat on the ground. There's no way the Camaro could have avoided being flattened beneath her sole! ...And yet, when she lifts her foot again...the Camaro looks completely untouched! Your very real friend is positively beaming at her act as she returns the car to its original location and takes a bow, much to most of the men in the audience's delight. \"Thank you! Thank you!\" she says with a huge grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later as the crowd thins out, seemingly much more at peace with Mimi as a giantess, you ask her, \"How the heck did you do that?! I felt your grip! I watched you pick up that car! How did you not flatten it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi picks you up in one massive hand and pats your head with a finger. She then answers, \"Simple. Being able to grow as big as I want wasn't my only specification into the machine. Who was in your head all these years watching and reading those gentle giantess stories with you? Me, of course! Who checked your preferences on her way out of your head? Me, of course! Let's see... A nuke would be a horrifying waste of time and ammunition against me, not to mention the lives lost in the detonation zone... I leave everything around me untouched unless I wanna make it touched... I needn't worry about human needs... And I can grow as big as I want and return to normal all without losing my clothes. Any of these sound familiar? What am I saying, of course they are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're familiar with those preferences. There's more, you're sure, but Mimi hasn't listed them at this time. You always imagined her to have a sharp wit, but now that she's real...her wit actually scares you with how far ahead she's planned. After a minute, you dare to ask, \"Um...any, uh, limit to that growing thing, Mimi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi looks at you knowingly and responds, \"Were there any limits to that one story where the girl outgrew at least a couple of universes? Or that other one where she's nearly twice the size of the solar system and has plans to grow even more? In short, when I said 'as big as I want', I really meant, 'as big as I want'!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was another 12 hour day at the factory. It's now 4 AM as you are walking home. You have a car, but sense you live close to work, you choose to walk to and from work while it's warm. The sky is clear. It's a warm May night, and the sky seems to be filled with more stars than you ever remember seeing. After more than a second at looking, it looked like there were too many starts. Though you had never really taken any time to memorize the stars, and couldn't really see any constellations other than the big dipper, there seemed to be stars out of place. You stop to look a little closer, and notice a star brighter than the rest, though it wasn't there a few seconds ago. It's growing brighter, and larger, and FAST! You jump out of the way, expecting to hear an impact.<br>\r\nAfter a quick moment, you realize there was no impact, and you realize you tackled someone to the ground by accident, diving to avoid the impact. You quickly scramble up before extending a hand to help up whoever you just knocked up. \"I'm so sorry. My eyes were playing a trick on me, and I thought a meteor was falling. Are you ok...\" You trailed off, noticing she was glowing.. and she had wings?! She was absolutely beautiful. She had long brown hair, hazel eyes, a rack you can't help but to notice her large breasts (possibly a DD cup), and that everything else was to your absolute desires. \"Well I'm fine, but you saw no meteor, you saw me being sent to you. Wyatt, I have been sent to you as a gift from the gods.\" She said calmly taking your hand up. Your naturally questioning mind is running at about a million miles per second, but one question stands out so you ask \"Why have the gods sent you to me?\" She calmly replied \"For nothing more than the their entertainment. I come with a warning though. I, like humans, wasn't built perfect. At any point before sun rise, you may send me back to the heavens if you do not choose to have me as your angel, but another will be sent instead, and I will be terminated.\" A part of your mind shuttered when she said terminated.<br>\r\n\"Well, can we head back to my place? I think it'll cause quite a commotion if people start seeing an angel, that looks like more than just a costume.\" you point out. She takes a moment to think, then responds \"I think you have a good point there.\" Your house is in sight. Its a large home, but it's quite old. you've done enough renovations to make the house look rather new. Not a whole lot of people visit you here. You look back to make sure she is following you without flying. She isn't flying, but you make brief eye contact with her. She quickly looked away, and started to blush. You arrive at your home, and go inside. she musters her words for a moment while you get settled in. \"Listen, I need you to answer this before I get attached. Am I the angel you want to stay with you, or shall I go and have another sent to you?\" you're stunned for a moment by the question. After you are no longer stunned you say...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You went to get them towels and some of your old shirts to wear so that you could dry their clothes. You introduced yourself to the girls as you got them dried off. The girls all appeared to be 8 years old. The first was brown-haired Molly, who was in front when you opened the door, and she seemed to be the unofficial leader of the group. She was joined by Kelly and Katie, who looked like twins. Kelly had her blonde hair cut to just above her shoulders while Katie had longer hair tied back in a ponytail. You were certain that you were going to get them mixed up in the future, but for now you could remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why were you out alone in the rain?\" you asked the girls after they were settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Molly began, \"we kind of, um. . . don't have anyone to stay with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No family or friends?\" you asked. They nodded. \"Like, you're orphans?\" The girls nodded again, and Kelly looked like she was about to cry. There was no way you could let them go now. Not without first doing everything in your power to help them. \"Tell you what: you girls can stay with me for as long as you need to. I'm going to do whatever I can to help you find a permanent place to stay. That sound good?\" By the sound of their cheers, you could tell that they were all for your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext order of business was to get the girls to bed. Unfortunately, you only had one spare bed in your guest room. Luckily, the girls assured you that they were fine sharing. You wished the girls a good night's sleep, and quietly shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your own room, you got out your computer and tried to find any information you could about missing children or orphans that might give you a lead on who the girls were and where they came from. Even after what must have been hours of searching through hundreds of articles, you couldn't find anything useful to you. Eventually, sleep overcame you, and you fell asleep at the keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you struggled awake, still slumped in front of your computer. Slowly, the details from the previous night that lead you to your unconventional rest came back to you. You went to check on the girls, and the three of them were still sound asleep where you left them. You decided to leave them be and went to your kitchen to make some breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you settled down with your cereal, you noticed a letter you'd left on the table. It was addressed from an orphanage called St. Lucretia's, which you hadn't found any mention of in your searching last night. Reading the letter, the orphanage's director was thanking you for agreeing to adopt the girls, and continued on about how much of a difference you were making in their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes glossed over the rest of the letter as you tried to process what you read. According to this letter from an orphanage that doesn't exist, you were now the adoptive father of the three girls that you had met the night before, a sequence of events you were absolutely certain had never happened. Could this be some kind of cruel prank the girls were playing on you? You had to get to the bottom of this, and went to wake up the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you got to the guest room, Katie and Molly had already woken up, with Kelly still sleeping on the bed. They greeted you with a quiet \"good morning Mr. Anthony,\" when you opened the door. \"Hey girls,\" you replied. \"I need to ask you something important. Do you remember when we first met?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls shared a confused look before Katie answered. \"It was like a month ago, I think. It was this really rainy night and you let us stay with you. Then the next day you talked to the orphanage and you adopted us and we've been here ever since.\" She tilted her head. \"Is something wrong? Are you gonna send us back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, nothing like that,\" you quickly assured them. \"I just was having trouble remembering exactly how long you've been here, is all. Sorry to make you worry like that,\" you said before leaving them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer response only raised more questions for you. Was this another part of the prank? Katie seemed sincere when you asked her, and Molly didn't react as if she was lying. Still, something strange was happening, and you couldn't find out what it was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girls came out of their room while you were lost in thought and began pouring themselves cereal. You didn't pay the girls much attention since you were still preoccupied with the revelation that you had somehow adopted girls without your knowledge from an orphanage that didn't exist. Sure you were tired last night, so it was possible that you could have a fuzzy memory of the previous night, but you had a good enough memory of the month before to know that you had never seen those girls before. More importantly, you had never agreed to adopt anyone. At only 24 years old, you didn't feel like you were ready to take care of a single child, much less three third grade aged girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were broken from your musings by Kelly's voice. \"Mr. Anthony, can you come sit with us?\" she asked in a soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need something?,\" you asked as you sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just wanted you to sit with us,\" she answered in between bites of cereal. These girls were so sweet, you didn't even want to see them go, even if you were having trouble understanding how they got here. Maybe it was some sort of destiny that you were supposed to adopt them. You figured there were much worse fates than this. As you began to space out again, you noticed Kelly shudder out of the corner of your eye, your concern for her bringing you back to reality. \"You alright there?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you blankly. \"I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I thought I saw you shake for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't shake earlier,\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Anthony's been acting kind of weird this morning,\" Molly chimed in. \"Maybe he's getting sick. Should we take you to the doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll be fine, I'm just still tired,\" you said, rubbing your eyes. This satisfied the curious girls, who went back to eating their cereal. Mere moments later you saw all three of them shudder at the same time. The strange shaking wasn't the only thing, however. You could have sworn that you saw the girls' heads rise an inch or two higher. You didn't want to say anything in case you were wrong, and you weren't sure they'd believe after all the other strangeness that they had ignored. You tried to keep a close eye on them without obviously staring, and soon enough you saw them shudder again and -- this time there was no mistaking it -- grow a couple inches. You couldn't believe it! These girls were somehow growing so fast it was actually visible, and yet they didn't seem to notice or care. As unlikely as it would have sounded minutes ago, your adoption of the girls wasn't the most unbelievable thing that had happened today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you girls just grow?\" you had to ask, even though you knew you probably weren't going to get a satisfactory answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow?\" Molly asked. \"Do you mean like growing up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I could've sworn I just saw you girls grow a couple inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be going crazy, Mr. Anthony,\" Katie said. \"I haven't grown a bit today.\" As if to prove herself wrong, you saw her lurch up another inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you suspected, they didn't find this unusual either. \"Maybe I am going crazy,\" you admitted.</span></div></div>",

All three girls are over 6 feet tall to start, but have always desired to become bigger. The three friends have role-played with toy cities more times than any of them can remember, and one day their wishes are granted...with one little oversight. One that their role-playing had never prepared them for... Not that they'll mind, of course. The three are generally very nice, and will be delighted to learn that their growing bodies won't cause any harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Molly, Patricia, Megumi<br>\r\nAll three are in their early 20's. Megumi has been the shortest of the three at 5 feet tall and with little curves to speak of. The other two are 5'6\" and 5'8\" respectively. Molly and Patricia are sisters while Megumi has been their friend since kindergarten when her family moved from Japan, thus speaks fluent English but may insist on honorifics. While the sisters will improve quite a bit as they grow, Megumi will soon become the biggest of all of them. They'll be confused at first, but will come to enjoy the endless growth even if they don't know what - or who is responsible for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: More groups of girls.<br>\r\nWhat it says.

Words describing small sizes will also work, such as in the case of someone describing one of the girls as 'small' or 'tiny' while within earshot. Of course, this has plenty of potential to be abused should one of the growing girls be your little or big sister, as both 'little' and 'big' will trigger the group's growth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, we have words relating to age - 'younger', 'older', and so forth will make the group grow. This also has plenty of potential to be abused, especially if the growing girls are children or teenagers - just try telling they're not old enough for something, or if one of the growing girls is a sibling, that they are the 'younger' sibling and should grow up - which they do rather promptly, and in a literal sense - or that they are your 'older' sister, and should be more responsible, or spend more time with you - and find your big sister only getting bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, do either of these ideas appeal to you? Or do you want a different word trigger for the growth?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perfect time to visit your best friend Jessica. It was an interesting friendship, because she stood at a tall 4'11\", while you were only 4'5\". Normally your parents would drive you to her house, but since they're on vacation, you resorted to riding your bike. Oh well, I could use the exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiking to Jessica's was usually a last resort, since you weren't as good at it. There weren't many bikes that suited you. Even with the one you own you can barely reach the pedals. At least the trip is easier than walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, though, was different. From the moment you got on your bike it seemed to better suit you. You can reach the pedals slightly easier, for whatever occasion. You decided to bolt to her house in record time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farther you went on the bicycle the easier it was to pedal. There were reasons still unknown why this is. It's almost as if the bike is shrinking the farther you go. You arrive at Jessica's in a little more than half an hour, the quickest ride yet. You knock, and Jessica entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still towered over you, standing four foot eleven with short, light brown hair. You greeted her, went inside, and the first thing she said to you was, \"You look taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyebrows narrowed. \"Do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. C'mon! I can measure you on the wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one of the walls in the living room, there were etchings marking inches and feet. You stood by it while Jessica examined you. She almost jumped back in shock. \"Y-y-you're... four foot five and three quarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost in shock too. \"But that's impossible! I measured myself yesterday and I was four five!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me try again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica measured you again, with no different results. You somehow grew a whole three quarters of an inch since last afternoon. Maybe that explains the shrinking bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that,\" says Jessica after a while. \"C'mon, let's...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You still enjoyed it, especially with the satisfaction of shooting a three-pointer under her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou played rock-paper-scissors to see who gets ball first. Your paper was cut by Jessica's scissors. She grabbed the ball and walked to the half court line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check,\" she says, passing the ball to you. You passed back, and the game began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica held still, then started dribbling the ball slowly to your right. She juked and made a quick break to your left. You anticipated the move and snatched the ball from her hand. \"Oh, nice move!\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the ball back to the half-court line, in possession.

Jessica jumped and accidentally tackled you, her aim outrageously off. The two of you crash to the ground.

The last things you remembered... the lay-up, the tackle, the fall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was staring down at you. \"You've seemed to have grown taller again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were weak, but you managed to slowly speak, \"What... happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I know, I accidentally knocked you to the ground,\" Jessica responded. \"You were out for...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Plains where the grass seems to have been cut short and apple trees as tall as you dot the ground. You picked and swallowed apples whole as you pleased. Even the apples seemed to shrink by the minute. They weren't filling you up enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of picking and eating apples for lunch, you felt full, finally.

Happy birthday dear Casandra! Happy birthday to yoooou!!!\" Although your brother, the annoying twit that he was sometimes, sang the last parts as, \"You look like a monkey! Aaaaand, you smell like one too!\" snickering as he did. He may be an annoying twit of a brother, but he was your annoying twit of a brother dang it. He was irreplaceable, and you still loved him. Even if he did drive you bonkers sometimes. Your name was Casandra. You were just turning 19. You were Caucasian with a slight tan, a solid 6 feet tall, very lean with a nice butt and C-cup breasts. You had been blessed with a metabolism that allowed you to eat like a pack of starving wolves over a fresh kill and never see a pound of it stick to your figure. You had long, shiny brown hair that looked like it came straight out of a shampoo commercial and hazel eyes. But you had a dream. A dream...for more. Yes, since you were a little girl, you dreamed of becoming a giantess. Not to dominate humanity and crush all those who would oppose your will, no. In fact, of the giantess fetish genres, the cruel, evil type that caused such incredible suffering and death purely because they could was your least favorite. No, you dreamed to be the nice kind. Maybe even a hero! Your younger brother Nathan though thought you were nuts. You had to admit though, he was almost kind of attractive if he weren't your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, blow out the candles and make a wish!\" Your mom says excitedly. She was awesome, in your opinion. She was about 40 years old now, but when you two went shopping together people swore that she was your older sister, surely no more than 25. The complements made her blush when the truth was revealed, with people asking her how she managed to stay looking so young, and mentioning that your father was lucky to have married a woman like her. Sadly, your dad was called into work at the last minute and couldn't be there for your birthday. He enjoyed his work most of the time, but he was not happy about having to work on the day he specifically booked off so he could enjoy being with his family on his daughter's special day. But apparently they were desperate, so he had agreed to go. At any rate, you knew exactly what to wish for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish...I wish to be able to control my size at will, and be able to render myself and everything around me safe, and also to have whatever I'm wearing at the time that I change size change with me. Please, let this wish come true...\" You wished silently in your head. You remembered hearing that saying one's wish out loud in such circumstances was guaranteed to get your wish not granted, and you didn't want to take any chances with your wish. You blew out the candles, but at the same time Nathan thought it to be funny to put a handheld fan on the other side and turn it on. The result was that the smoke from the blown out candles was blown back into your face and you inhaled it. You coughed a couple times, and while internally you were screaming things along the lines of, 'I'm going to kill you, you twit!!!', you quickly forced such destructive thoughts out of your mind and instead said half-sarcastically, \"Nice. Very funny, bro. By the way...you see the part with all the candle wax melted onto it? That's gonna be your slice of the cake. So the birthday girl wishes it, so shall it be.\" Nathan looked understandably less than enthused. Birthday candle wax wasn't exactly the tastiest thing in the world. But he still justified it as totally worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know that perhaps instead of cursing him internally and punishing him with a slightly soiled piece of cake, you should have offered him the best slice as a thank you...for potentially making your dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You held no hard feelings towards him, and hugged him tightly, saying, \"I can't forgive what isn't there to forgive, dad. What was the emergency, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad sated your curiosity with, \"They were severely understaffed. Apparently it's this flu that's circulating around. Same one that I came down with about a week ago or so.\" He then changed the subject to, \"Now I hope you made sure to leave me a slice of your birthday cake. Why, that would almost make me feel as though I was there with you guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and replied, smiling, \"Of course, dad! There's a couple of slices left, and even Nathan knows better than to deprive you of at least the second-hand experience. They're in the fridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really think all that much of your wish yesterday. After all, what you had asked for was effectively a miracle. Quite a bit more than, say, $100 or your brother to take you seriously even though you were 2 years older than him. If he got out of hand, a good grounding put him in his place at least for a while. But what you wished for? Wishful thinking for that to happen... At any rate, you went about your daily life normally until a week after your birthday. On this day, you decided to marathon watch The Lord of the Rings trilogy. After watching The Fellowship of the Ring, you dozed off before you could play The Two Towers. Maybe it was because you had been chatting on Skype until 2 in the morning with your BFF Aeriel. Regardless, you had the strangest dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an incessant knocking at the door, but when you yelled for Nathan to get it, you received no response. Apparently, you were hope alone. As you walked to the door, you discovered that the knocking sounded like wood on wood. Come to think of it, why didn't this person just ring the doorbell? Curiously, you opened the door to see...an old man with long grey hair and beard, with a pipe in his mouth. He was robed entirely in grey with a matching long, pointed hat, and carried a long, wooden staff. Wait. You knew this man, or wizard as it were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you're Gandalf! But...you're not real! How can you be here?\" To which the old wizard smiled as he puffed his pipe as he replied, \"Ah! Yes! And yet I stand before you as we speak. You are the wish maker, correct? How I know is not important. What is important is that the power you seek shall indeed be yours once our conversation is over. You needn't keep it secret, however it would be wise to use it too quickly.\" You asked, \"Why? Are you saying that if I use this power too quickly it'll corrupt me?\" The old wizard shook his head, \"No, if you use it too quickly you'll get vertigo and possibly motion sick. You will be unable to be harmed, this is true, but effects that are merely an inconvenience can still plague you. Oh, and before we end our time together...\" He leaned in close to you before he said, \"I would demonstrate this gift with your younger brother first if I were you. The young man could use to learn that there are still some things out there that cannot be explained. Farewell, young Casandra! May you prove to be a boon with your gift!\" And with that, the wizard turned and walked away. You were about to ask how he knew your name when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up with a start. Looking to the TV, you realized you hadn't even gotten past the main menu for The Two Towers. Deciding you had enough of Middle Earth for one day, you put the DVD away and turned the TV off. On the way back to the couch, you accidentally stubbed your pinky toe on the coffee table...and yet, it didn't hurt. Looking down, you noticed that your toenail didn't even have a mark on it. Whether or not that weird dream had anything to do with it, your wish had been granted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Oh... This is gonna be fun. Time to get back at Nathan for calling my dream stupid! Oh, Naaathaaan...\" You call out once you reached his room. He...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You groaned and groaned, not at all wanting to get up this morning, but the Sun didn't take 'no' for an answer and eventually you got up. Groggy, you tried to remember who you were. Your name was Mary, you were 19, a very decent body and dirty blonde hair. With eyes like water, and right now more than just your eye color, you proceed to your bathroom to shower and get cleaned up for the day ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finished in there, you got out and got dressed in your favorite outfit of a very revealing shirt and short shorts. You liked to leave little to the imagination of anyone. Such a lovely hourglass figure with very prominent breasts, you figured why hide what nature gave you? Still, there was one area in your otherwise dream body you felt brought it down a bit: your height. You were 5'3\", and you hated being so short. You wanted men to look at your chest without looking down - no, they would need to look up just to get a glimpse of what they would love to stare at. You headed into the kitchen for breakfast, pouring yourself some cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you did, you could have sworn your beloved clothes felt a tad tight for just a second or so, but the feeling quickly passed. Unknown to you, you had just grown 3 inches taller, now 5'6\". You were also unaware that this was far from the last of these growth spurts, that they were never going to stop. Granted, if you had known, you would probably be too giddy to finish breakfast. Much less get on with your day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness for Summer vacation! Those school uniforms are so drab...\" You said aloud, even though no one was around to hear you. Your parents worked long hours, and had gone off to work well before the...11:00 AM that you woke up at. If they hadn't, they probably wouldn't approve of such an outfit and you'd have been forced to put on something more modest. Now that you were up though, you wanted to go somewhere. You had two places in mind specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could go to the mall and shop, if only just window shop. Summer was in, and you wanted to check the latest fashions! Or, you could go over to your best friend Terri's to hang out. And maybe talk about boys. And stuff.

Hey, maybe you'd run into Teri while you were there? Actually, you rather liked that thought. So with just a bit of makeup put on, (your face hardly needed it, but why not?) you grabbed your keys and headed outside to take your car to the mall. It wasn't flashy or anything, but when your old beater broke down last year, your parents agreed with you that you needed a better car. One that wouldn't cost more just to keep it road-worthy than it did to buy it in the first place. Although the repair man, Drew, was cute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you tried to get comfortable in the seat, you unknowingly grew another 2 inches, making you 5'8\" now. This did however have the effect of making the seat and mirror positions feel off a bit and you readjusted. \"Huh. Maybe I grew just a bit last night. Would be nice to grow even bigger...and bigger.\" you thought aloud, unaware of just how right you were...or that your desire was going to be fulfilled to an endless degree. You turn the key in the ignition and the car started up. You remember to open the garage door and reverse the car out, closing the door remotely before setting the car into drive and headed off to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mall, you find a parking space close to the mall that wasn't a handicapped or expectant mother spot. You weren't a fan of those, but you also weren't a fan of handicapped people or women 7 or 8 months pregnant minimum having to suffer an extra distance. Why, your friend Charles was in a wheelchair and you thought nothing less of him. Sometimes you even called him Xavier or Professor X like the Marvel comics mutant character...though your friend maintained a full head of hair. You turn the car off and head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your delight, both your friends happen to be in the mall at the food court. You enthusiastically wave to them as you approach, and don't notice another 4 inches pile onto your height, making you 6 foot even now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, do your friends notice your growth, even though you do not quite just yet?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You ask with a curious tone, \"What? Why are you guys looking at me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeri is the first to say anything to you. \"Mary, either Starbucks slipped something really strong in their coffee...or I swear I just saw you get taller.\" she answers, personally leaning towards the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles confirms Teri's suspicions by saying, \"I haven't even sipped from my cup, and I swear she just suddenly grew taller. But hey, I'm not complaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you don't believe them at first. After all, they could just be pulling your leg for all you know. They're aware that you've always wanted to be bigger, so you assume they're just messing with you. \"Really? You guys think I'm gonna fall for that? Yeah right!\" you say dismissively. Your friends decide to just drop the subject for now. A girl with a body a cheerleader captain would kill for yet without the stereotypical attitude to go with it such as yourself is something they both consider much too rare to risk breaking their friendship with because she doesn't believe them, and you know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shop around with your friends for much of the day, mostly just to enjoy their company and see the latest fashions. You and Teri take it relatively slow so that Charles can keep up in his wheelchair. As the time passes, you mull over your friends' earlier claims. There was hardly anyone you passed that you needed to look up to see their face, and you need to look down slightly to meet Teri's gaze, so maybe...maybe they weren't trying to get your hopes up after all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having a meal at the food court late in the afternoon, you decide it's probably a good idea to start heading home right about now. You and your friends head outside, and it's when you get into your car and find the positions to be off again do you fully realize Teri and Charles may have been on to something. You step out of your car and ask them honestly, \"Guys...Do...do I look taller to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles and Teri unanimously answer back, \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis concerns and elates you at the same time. Your dream is coming true! ...but people don't usually suddenly grow noticeably taller with their clothes keeping up, do they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if this is what your body was waiting to hear, you begin to see and feel yourself grow. As soon as it stops, you note how much you now tower over Teri, who was about 5'11\", and realize you must be about 6'8\" tall! You say to your friends, \"Okay, I'm sorry I didn't believe you earlier... This is kind of cool, actually. But I wonder if that's it, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, this is FAR from it. For you were going to be growing...forever. Luckily for the sake of all of reality and whatnot, you're such a nice girl. But is this it for your growth spurts for now, or is there another one incoming almost immediately?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
