            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The world of Ger is separated into four continents, the largest of them all is known as Honger, and the second largest country is known as Gainger, at its center is the capital castle city, Castle Gaingerguard, or Castle Gain for short. The kingdom is ruled by the Gaingerguard family, the two curetnt leaders being Prince Bradley and Princess Fiona Gaingerguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBradley is the younger sibling but is much wiser and more responsible one, though if you insult his appearance he\u2019ll snap, especially his long hair that is always in a ponytail, or his all purple wardrobe, while Fiona's mood is almost always cheery, and she can sometimes even be a little childish. Bradley will also get over protective of his adopted daughter Amelia, who coincidentally has the same black hair as him and Fiona, as well as the same blue eyes, unlike Fiona's green ones. Along with being caring for his daughter, Bradley is also caring for his kingdom and fights alongside his trusted knights when needed, with weapons along with royal magic, and while he is adept in both fields, Fiona's magic far outshines Bradley's, and more than makes up for her lacking in combat skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Bradley's and Fiona's needs are taken care of by the royal servants and sisters, Jennifer and Rebecca. Jessica and Rebecca both have blond hair, but Jennifer has brown eyes and Rebbecca has blue, just like her prince's. Both servants are close to their respective royal, but each in different ways. Jennifer is very nervous, cautious and basically joined to Fiona at the hip, while Rebbecca is more independent and curious, and her relationship with Bradley has become one of very close friends, he even calls her Becky to be more friendly, and is even a little less \"prince-y\", as she likes to call it, when he is around her. They are so close, that it is rumored that they are having an affair, and another one says that Fiona and Jennifer are in love with each other, and are too afraid to tell the other of their feelings, but neither of those are right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir is another familiar pair of siblings known around the castle, the farm girl Shirley, and her twin brother the great knight Sir Lee. Shirley lives on the farm in one of the lower levels of the city, while Sir Lee lives in the castle barracks, and it's good that they live so far away, as they don't get along at all. Shirley hate's that he left her all alone on the, even though she has several farmhands that work for her, and that eventually they stopped speaking to each other, not that Sir Lee was very social to begin with. In fact, no one even knows or remembers what he looks like, as he always wears his full plate armor every where he goes, and Shirley hasn't seen him in years. Though, since they're twins, they probably look somewhat alike and have the same green eyes and brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, in the castle tower lives the grand wizard...Wizard, and his (great, great, great, great, great) granddaughter, the witch Crystal, who has a massive crush on Sir Lee, even though she's never seen what he looks like. Crystal isn't one of those wrinkly old hag witches with green skin and a big nose; instead she is a beautiful young woman with smooth skin, that's rather pale from spending so much time in her tower, black hair, hazel eyes, and a youthful body with a large pot belly, or \u201ccauldron\u201d belly as she prefers to call it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is Normal (Non-specific fattening)- Undead hordes and creatures of darkness working for the wizard-gone-Lich, as well as unstable relations with their neighboring countries are a constant threat to the Human Kingdom, but that\u2019s the way it\u2019s been for decades, maybe something new is due to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlumped up for Peace- In order to preserve peace between the Humans and the Amazons, all women of age in the Human kingdom must grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisfired Fattening- After a hundred years of planning, the Lich Ekafeman has perfected a spell that will allow it to take over the world, but even when the spell goes wrong, it still thinks its plan can work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elf-Queen Human- Amelia is all grown up and is getting married to a long time friend, and while her friends, family and kingdom are supportive, her soon-to-be-in-laws might not.</span></div></div>",

She than fussed with her skirt for a moment before she sat down on Fiona\u2019s freshly made bed, and stared out a window at the moon in the star filled sky, waiting for her friend to return. Though, Jessica didn\u2019t have to wait very long before the door to the room opened and the Princess-in-pink stormed into the room. \u201cI take it that the date did not go well?\u201d She asked as her eager smile changed into a disappointed frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo they ever?! Goddesses, what is wrong with me?!\u201d Fiona yelled taking a seat on the bed beside Jessica as her eyes began to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she hated to admit it, Jessica predicted this would be the outcome of Fiona\u2019s date with tonight\u2019s suitor. After all Fiona was right, they didn\u2019t ever go well. No one knew why, but the Princess was never able to connect with any of them, the whole experience just felt wrong to her. And though the suitors never paid it any mind, Fiona did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing a new, comforting smile to her face, Jessica wrapped one arm around Fiona\u2019s shoulders to pull he closer, and the wrapped her other arm around her waist, determined to make her royal friend feel better, no matter what. \u201cMilady, there is nothing wrong with you! It is not your fault! Just because you don\u2019t feel anything for these men doesn\u2019t mean something is wrong with you, it just means they aren\u2019t right for you. And if you were to line up a million women who aren\u2019t right for those men, they\u2019d feel the same as you do now, and just like you they would be wrong. So I assure you that you are as normal as a person can be, and there is nothing wrong with waiting for someone who can make you feel whatever the others can\u2019t.\u201d She said in a successful attempt to calm her Princess down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Jessica; I don\u2019t even know what came over me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just stress, Princess. It can get to the best of us if we aren\u2019t careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, down in the castle sparing grounds, Prince Bradley and Sir Lee were engaged in combat and had been since early in that morning. When it started they had many spectators, it wasn\u2019t often that the two most powerful warriors dueled after all, but now it had boiled down to Lady Amelia and Rebecca cheering for Bradley, and the witch Crystal cheering for Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026ready to\u2026call it\u2026a draw?\u201d Bradley offered while huffing a puffing from exhaustion, still tying to maintain his shaky fighting stance with his great sword becoming too heavy for him to hold up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say\u2026that sounds\u2026reasonable.\u201d While Bradley had very little armor and had to fight with a defensive style, Lee had leather armor layered over by chain mail layered over by scale mail and then covered by full plate armor and could fight without fear of anything but his armor being harmed, and in this case, it was very harmed. It was amazing the he never tired out from lugging around all that armor all hours of the day every day. In fact, no one had ever seen him out of armor since the day he arrived for training to be a night when he was ten and it seems like the only one who knows what he looks like is his sister. But despite never seeing an inch of his skin, that didn\u2019t stop Crystal from falling madly in love with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon Lee, don\u2019t give up, kick his royal butt!\u201d She yelled while floating in the sky above the arena, but being carful that no one could see up her black skirt\u2026well, maybe she angled herself at Lee once or twice or twelve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca rolled her eyes at the witch. \u201cDon\u2019t encourage them they\u2019ll start all over again!\u201d She called out from the stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s already too late for a bedtime story; I don\u2019t want to have to tuck myself in either!\u201d Amelia said in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee nodded his head as he sheathed his weapon, causing a peace of armor broke off and fall to the ground. \u201c\u2026I will need to repair my armor before I can risk another round with his majesty; I was rather surprised at his endurance, speed and over all power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can say the same of you; it\u2019s not often that a single opponent can tire me so quickly.\u201d Bradley admitted as he too sheathed his weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo-uh, Lee\u2026do you need any help repairing your armor? Maybe you could take it all off and have a rest in my chambers while I go at it with my-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you cover my ears?\u201d Asked Amelia, looking up at Rebecca who had her hands clamped firmly over the young girls ears. Rebecca looked down at Amelia and began to say something, but nothing got through. \u201cCan we go now I\u2019m getting cold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca nodded her head and moved her hands away. \u201cOf course Lady Amelia, go inside and I\u2019ll make sure your father will be there soon to tuck you in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, night-y night Auntie Becky,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being turned down by Lee to\u2026\u201dpolish his thrusting rapier\u201d, Crystal floated off to see her friend Shirley, who she used as a sounding board for her problems with Lee, and since she was his brother it worked out even better for her since Shirley could tell her more about Lee. Sure, sometimes Crystal had to work on her far to pay her back, but it wasn\u2019t all that hard thanks to her magic. While Lee himself returned to his barracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back, boss. Did you find what you were looking for?\u201d One of Shirley\u2019s farmhands asked as she came through the fields with a burlap sack slung over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure did.\u201d Shirley let the bag drop, causing purple seeds to spill out. \u201cStart planting those as soon as possible, they might grow fast but if they don\u2019t get some water soon they\u2019ll be useless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight away boss,\u201d The farmhand then bent over, took the sack and went off deeper into the fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley smiled and began to walk back to her ranch house. She couldn\u2019t wait to get inside, was up, and take a long rest after a longer day. Plus, with the knowledge that those miracle plants would soon come in and save her farm from going under, she had nothing to worry about tonight. That is, she didn\u2019t until she saw her witchy \u201cfriend\u201d flying towards her; and a little faster than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Shirley had a chance to get out of the way, Crystal had slammed into her, knocking them both to the ground, with Crystal laying top of Shirley. \u201cWoops, sorry, didn\u2019t mean for that to happen.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI SAW YOU TURN!!! Now get off of me, you weigh more than my some of my pigs you cow!\u201d Shirley yelled as she tried to wriggle her way out from under the weighty witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal giggled and then floated up off of her flattened farm girl friend. \u201cWell, which is it? Am I a cow or a sow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth,\u201d Shirley deadpanned while she got up out of the dirt. \u201cNow what do you want, as if I didn\u2019t already know.\u201d Crystal smiled and went over her entire day, one that Shirley could tell was a long one very early in, so she decided to walk while Crystal talked and by the time she finished, they had finally made inside the house. \u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to hear that Lee can still waist his whole day on something stupid while I\u2019m working my ass off.\u201d Shirley said with a mix of sarcasm and anger as she and Crystal went inside her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal pouted at Shirley. \u201cHe does a lot of productive stuff, too! Besides, I heard that you\u2019ve been gone for like, two weeks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was looking for a crop that could save my farm, which I wouldn\u2019t even need to do if Lee was here to help me!\u201d Crystal sighed and took a seat to prepare for the impending rant that Shirley was about to go on. \u201cI mean, do you think I wanted to run the farm? NO! I had my own dream, but because of him I can never live it since I have to keep this place from going under leaving me with no time to pursue it! Plus I\u2026and\u2026whatever, what do you want anyway!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised that the rant ended so soon Crystal asked her question, \u201cDo you two look alike?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean\u2026you\u2019re twins right, and twins usually look alike, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, we used to, but it\u2019s been over a decade since I\u2019ve seen him so I doubt he dose any more, and if he dose that makes him a very pretty man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr makes you a very ugly woman\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m going to bed. You can stay if you want, just don\u2019t eat all my food!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amelia shot up in fear. The castle was under attack by the undead! She could hear them moaning in the room next to hers through a crack in the wall. Yet it seemed no one else noticed the invasion, as the alarm had not been sounded! That meant only one thing. It was up to her to fight the monsters! She hopped out of bed quietly and made her way over to her toy box. She opened it and began to fish around for something. When she found them, she equipped herself with them quickly. On her head was a metal pail she had turned into a knight\u2019s helmet. Draped over her torso was a piece of leather from a horse\u2019s saddle and would serve as her body armor, and lastly she griped a wooden sword in her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter swallowing hard in an attempt to replace her fear with courage, Amelia stepped outside her room and looked down the torch lit hall. She saw no danger so she stepped out and made the short walk to the room next to hers. She pressed her ear against the door to try and hear more clearly, and she definitely heard moaning. Amelia raised her left hand shakily to the door knob, and when she had a firm grasp on it, she opened the door, charged inside without fear and yelled, \u201cI\u2019ll save you Auntie Fiona!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room froze. There were no monsters, no undead horde, just Amelia, Fiona, and Jessica; the latter two in the same bed, with Jessica on top of Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her face flushed a deep red, Jessica slowly moved off her Princess\u2019s back, allowing Fiona sit up as well. \u201cL-Lady Amelia, w-what are you doing up so late?\u201d Jessica asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard moaning through my wall and it woke me up! I thought there were monsters in here, but it looks like you were attacking my Auntie!\u201d Amelia shouted with her toy sword aimed at Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, that\u2019s not what I was doing! The Princess has been very stressed as of late, I was merely giving her a massage to help her relax!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia looked to Fiona for some kind of confirmation to Jessica\u2019s story, to which she got a frantic nod, and Amelia lowered her \u201cweapon\u201d to her side and look at them as though she was unsure. \u201cAlright, if you say so, I\u2019m going to go back to bed, then. Try to keep it down.\u201d She then turned back to the door and left Fiona\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was gone, Fiona let out a sigh of relief. \u201cI have to admit, I was a little worried there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, I was only giving you a massage, Milady\u2026\u201d Jessica pointed out, though it sounded as if she was unsure about it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right, I mean, I\u2019m still have my dress,\u201d Fiona paused to gesture at the pink frills of her evening gown. \u201cBut Amelia might have seen it another way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026what way would that be?\u201d She had a good idea, but once again she wasn\u2019t too sure, and wanted to hear it to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI mean in a\u2026\u201d  Fiona\u2019s face went flush as she tried to explain. \u201c\u2026sensual or\u2026intimate way\u2026however absurd that may be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica blushed back at Fiona. \u201cR-right, absolutely absurd\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026p-perhaps you should return to your own room now, Jessica. We\u2019ve both had a long day and should get some sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish, Milady,\u201d Jessica gave a curtsy to Fiona before turning to the door, but before she left she turned back and asked, \u201cWill we still be going to the market tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona smiled and nodded. \u201cOf course; now get out of my room and go to sleep.\u201d Fiona joked with mock seriousness, but Jessica left swiftly after, probably thinking that she was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jessica gone, Fiona got up and began to strip down so she could change into her sleepwear. Another blush came to her face when she was fully unclothed. Her dress and her underwear were neatly folded on her bed, including her girdle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, over the past few weeks, Fiona had found the need to use a <i>girdle</i> to hid her new found gut. It was nowhere near the size of Crystal\u2019s, but it was still big enough that Fiona felt that she should try her best to minimize its size, and the girdle did just that. Her new fleshy belly was invisible to the world when she wore it. Though, it was incredibly uncomfortable to wear, and she was glad to be out of it for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly placing her old clothes into aside on a dresser, Fiona then dressed herself for bed, and got into bed. She closed her eyes and let her mind wander to the events of the next day. Fiona imagined herself meeting Jessica outside the stables, talking a bit before mounting her horse and taking her on a nice relaxing ride into the market, where they would go shopping for anything they might need or that would catch their eyes. Then, they\u2019d find a nice place to eat before attending a show or two. After the shows, they mounted her horse once again and return to the castle with full bags and an empty purse, at which point she would need to start preparing for a date with yet another suitor, where they\u2019d sit at opposite ends of an impossibly long table, and talk about something dreadfully boring while eating some disgusting meal from his homeland, and ending several hours later in failure. \u2018At least the first part of the day will be good.\u201d Fiona thought as she drifted of to herself as she slowly drifted off.</span></div></div>",

In appearance, they were nearly identical, except being slightly taller and physically stronger than most humans. The humans outclassed the Amazons in terms of magic, but the Amazon's advantage was in their numbers and rigid military structure. Bradley and the knights fought hard, but had to surrender in the end, which began the negotiations for peace. the prince and princess met with Queen Zephoia of the Amazons. Zephoia would return all of humanity's land on one condition: every human female above the age of eighteen must gain weight and meet a monthly requirement of pounds gained. Fiona and Bradley had no choice but to accept, for if they refused, the Amazons would drive humanity to the brink of extinction. Fiona was sixteen then, meaning that she'd have two years of thinness left before she would have to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 years later,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona dressed in a black dress, for a woman's eighteenth birthday was no longer a happy occasion in the human kingdom. She looked at her thin body one last time before heading to her birthday dinner with Prince Bradley, who had a hardened stoic look about him. He had never forgiven himself for allowing this travesty to occur in his kingdom and hadn't made a public appearance in over a year. His hair was down to his shoulders and he had stubble on his face. He was even more unhappy that Queen Zephoia and her elite guard had decided to join them for dinner in order to \"celebrate\" Fiona's new lifestyle. The Amazons had a goal of humiliating the humans and they had done just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazons expected that the princess of the human kingdom would serve as an example for the rest of their female population, and if the terms of the treaty were to be kept, she would. Her birthday \"celebration\" lasted exactly seven days. That meant seven days of feasting for women, especially Fiona. On the eighth day, the Amazons weighed her with their advanced scale technology, a device that's able to measure a person's weight just by standing on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the day of the weighing, Fiona was more nervous than she had ever been in her life. She was wearing nothing but her bra and panties, which allowed her belly, however somewhat small, to stick out to its fullest capacity. Additionally, her boobs and butt protruded quite far from the base of her figure. Bradley and little Amelia stood backstage with her, comforting her and telling her that she was going to be fine. The weighing was at a platform in front of the royal residence and all of the townspeople were required to attend, a rule that was enforced by the Amazon elites. Queen Zephoia was absent that day, and her daughter, Princess Zaianna officiated the event in her place. She wore an Amazon military uniform that was adorned with golden plating and exotic jewels from around the globe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Citizens of Castle Gain,\" The princess began, \"Your esteemed Princess Fiona has come here today to weigh herself right here in front of all of you. We hope she serves as a great role model for all of the women here today.\" She paused for a moment while Fiona came onstage. \"Fiona's weight should meet or exceed 155 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona steps onto the scale and it reveals that her weight is...<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

The townspeople hope dropped as they saw their princess, ubiquitously known as a slender woman, dragged her self to the scale. Those up close could see her thighs wobble. Fiona wanted nothing more than to cover her embarrassing body. Her panties dug into her sides as her butt swallowed the garments. She had little control of her boobs which were spilling out of her now undersized bra. Her belly, that had always been flat, was now bulging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona wanted to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona wanted to cry but held it in. She knew that emotionally breaking down is exactly what the Amazons craved. More than anything else, Fiona wanted to deny them that satisfaction. Despite holding her tears, the Amazons reveled in the princess's humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Lookin good princess!\" \"How bout a little dance!\" \"Give us a show!\" \"Get a load of the Princess's figure!\"<br>\r\nshouted the boisterous Amazons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Bradley could only grit his teeth as he watched his sister's weigh in. Amelia could only whimper.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazonian princess Zaianna smiled as Fiona stepped up to the scale. \"Hop on princess.\" Zaianna snidely teased, giving Fiona a smack on the ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping on the scale, Fiona clenched, shutting her eyes. Her emotions were incoherent. She hated how much heavier she'd weigh, while fearing weighing below the 155 mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa Princess!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona opened her eyes, flustered by Zaianna's exclamation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"160! Damn Princess, if I'd have known you'd be so attuned to gaining, I would've raised the weight requirement.\" laughed Zaianna patting Fiona on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I gained 5 more pounds than I had to...\"Fiona muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy it Princess!\" Zaianna wrapped her arm around Fiona \"for this is just the beginning.\" Zaianna ominously teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! People of Gainger! Let Princess Fiona's new flesh serve as an example to you. From now on all women of age must meet a weight requirement which will increase every month until satisfaction. Within one week, every Gainger woman must weigh at least 160 pounds..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona flinched at the altered requirement knowing she was responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let us commence the weighings. Pay for your freedom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women of Gainger mourned as they began eating, while the women who were already fat stepped on the scale to meet their first monthly requirement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As of now all women on their 18th birthday will celebrate with a fattening feast. Furthermore a weight gain of 10 pounds is required of every woman every month from this day forth. Citizens of Castle Gain gaze upon your women's fat slow bodies and remember the superiority of Amazons. Thanks to a new magic a woman's weight can never plateau. I, Princess Zaianna wish all of you young women a long delicious life.\" Princess Zaianna walked off the platform and told the prince Bradley and Fiona that should any woman fail to meet the requirements, the Amazons would invade and force feed every last woman to immobility. Bradley disdainfully accepts and walks on the platform and declares \"All women must gain 10 pounds and will be weighed at the end of each month. Weight gain elixirs will be massed produced and food growth will be tripled.\" <br>\r\n  Meanwhile every woman is stuffing herself, salesmen are selling weight gain elixirs, and thin women stared at their soon to be fat, bodies. Jennifer went up to Fiona who was looking sullen as she ate a turkey leg to work on next month's requirements. \"My lady is there anything I can do\" the blonde servant girl said.  \"Join me in feasting Jennifer for you too must gain, but first let me see your thin body before you fill it with fat.\" Fiona said. Jennifer than posed and twirled her 110 pound body before digging into some cake. Meanwhile the other servant girl, Rebecca was clinging to Bradley \"My lord do I really have to do this too?\" \"Yes I'm afraid so you and Jennifer must gain, if the Amazons saw any skinny woman they would fatten her up to immobilty.\" Bradley gloomily said handing her a weight gain elixir and some turkey.<br>\r\n   Throughout the month all women of Castle Gain feasted and fattened. Clothing designers began to make only dresses for overweight women making skinny dresses only for teenage girls. Weight gain elixirs were flying off the shelves and women were beginning to look overall pudgier. At the end of the month the Amazon queen Zephoia and princess Zaianna came to fill their egos from the dismal of the fattening women. \"Let the weigh in begin!\" the queen joyfully shouted. One woman after the other was weighed each fulfilling the weight requirements. Some cried at their forced fattening some were relieved others were stuffing themselves for one lastminute weigh in. Others were eating right after the weighin to start for the next month. Some women however actually loved it, the freedom to eat whatever and whenever and not worry about their waistlines and they secretly thanked the Amazons for this blessing. One girl as such was Sasha a gorgeous woman who loved food but had to restrain herself to keep her socially acceptable thin body. Each woman met the requirements and the Amazons jiggled each fat ass with a shake of approval. The amazons left and the women continued to feed. </span></div></div>",

After repeatedly fattening and stuffing countless women, the feeder and inspector have lost any sympathy to women going through this.  The feeder and inspector continued with the force feeding as they were immune to the thin girl beseeching for her thinness as the feeder continued to cram sausages and cakes into the girl's mouth while the inspector monitored the feast and made sure the girl finished the mandatory feast. \"Are you done yet?\" Mary asked \"Just one more slice of cake annnnd there! all done\" Ursula stated wiping her forehead.<br>\r\n    The two women than went to eat as well at the new restaurant that opened in the kingdom right after the Amazon's law came to be.

Exposed bouncing bellies tore through the womens' dresses right at the seams jiggled and shook as the average woman walked through the town.  Huge breasts stretched clothing to its limits revealing generous cleavage. The streets of Gainger had a continuous flowing of curvacious women eating and going about their day bumping into each other in the more narrow streets, rubbing their jiggling bodies against each others. There were food stands all around, supplying free food to all women, courtesy of the Gaingerguard family. The women have become so accustomed to their fattening lifestyle that most women enjoyed it, after the first months there were few women who perfered thinness over the freedom of eating anything and thanks to prince Bradley's order of the grand wizard to create a weight gain elixir for women which also nullified all health problems related to female obesity, the women had little to complain about except their appearance, which however the overall public's opinion was changing the standards of beauty.  The average Gainger woman was 240 pounds wearing a tight tearing dress, huge boobs with a deep exposed cleavage, a fat, soft belly with a finger deep belly button that hung out from under her shirt and over her dress, wide fat, wobbling hips and ass, and flabby arms. The sight of fat women were so common in the country of Gainger that just the idea of a thin woman was baffling to all.  And due to the monthly requirements their weights would only rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Fiona now a 275 pound woman was cheerfully wolfing down some chocolates, clearly accustomed to the lifestyle, when Bradley came in. \"Eating I see\" he said \"Mmm hmm a girls got to meet her monthly gain doesn't she.\" Fiona said. \"It seems you've taken a liking to this constant feasting sister, like most of the women in the kingdom.\" Bradley said staring out the window on to the citizens. \"In a few days the Amazon queen will arrive for another weigh in.\" he said. Just than the servant girls, Jennifer and Rebecca waddled in with sweets for Fiona and themselves. \"Here you are my lady\" Jennifer said offering up one fattening pie to Fiona. \"Mmm yes I'm so hungry right now.\" Fiona said. \"You women eat all day and yet you're all always ravenous.\" said Bradley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

Inspecting the new recruitment of knights Hera notices a charming young man falling utterly hopelessly in love. \"You there whats your name?\" she asked \"Kragar your highness.\" the knight answered. \"Kragar how would you like to spend some personal time with your princess\" she seductively said however the man remained silent. \"Well don't you want to enjoy some time with a pretty lady?\" she said bouncing her large tits in his face. \"Uh sorry I'm just not... a-attracted to you\" he said.  \"What?! Am I not perfect?!\" she frantically asked.  \"Well you're just too skinny\" he answered. \"What? my slim figure disappoints you?\" she questioned. \"Well yeah I think a princess with extra weight shows how wealthy and powerful she is, plus a woman with curves is irresistable.\" Kragar stated.  Princess Hera than conjured up a plan to become the symbol of beauty for her crush. Hera initiated her plan to gain for her potential lover, gorging on delicacies that a poor woman couldn't even dream of eating. After days of intense consumption the princess successfully buried her tone body in soft curves. The once restrained thin woman of elegance was replaced with a lascivious plump maiden who than went to Kragar.  Kragar now stood in the presence of a voluptuous, lusty, and stunning 200 pound princess Hera who was scarfing down a chicken thigh drenched in gravy.  Hera flung herself on Kragar but he did not accept Hera as expected. \"Does my new fat not please you my handsome lover?\" the princess asked. \"You do look much prettier but...  But... But you're still too thin I mean you barely surpassed 200 pounds I mean with all your wealth you could easily be 400 pounds. A woman of royalty should have a body that represents her opulence.\" Kragar said. \"More eclairs!\" she said rushing to the kitchen totally enamored with the young man.  Hera's sisters than emulate their elder sister's lavishing feasting. Each sister developing a desire to grow.  It wasn't long before the news of the princess' newly formed fat reached the public. Men adoring the princesses and women envying them. The consequences of the princess's weight gain were swift and drastic as a sudden rise in obesity among the gluttopian women. Women roamed the streets gorging on delicacies and spending their time at home lounging and heavily feasting The once slim and trim ladies were now fat each part of their bodies had received a plentiful filling of fat. Boobs once large were now colossal and overfilling their now tight and tearing dresses. Bellies previously flat were now bulging out. Skinny arms and legs had been engulfed in flabby lard, jiggling and hanging from the limbs. Tone asses became gelatinous globes swaying from side to side with each heavy step. <br>\r\nAfter another week of hyper gorging the princess had amassed enough weight to weigh over 300 pounds finally arrousing her beloved Kragar. \"Come Kragar let us bathe together.\" Princess Hera said \"As you wish mylady\" said a somewhat arroused Kragar.  The Princess's bathing room was enormous with decorations, statues, perfumes, candles, and marble tiling everywhere, and just recently added golden bowls of fine chocolates for Hera to eat as she relaxed. At the bath Hera vigorously shoved handful after handful of the chocolates into her face to please her love interest.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Fattening Elements- In the Grand Land\u2019s, there is a wandering guild of the six most powerful mages in the land, each one commanding one of the six grand elements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is the somber wind walker who uses Sky Magic Ariel Skylark. Her eyes are as blue as the sky and hair as white as clouds. She is the youngest but also the most mature of the small guild and often serves as a mediator in any arguments or fights that might break out between the others. Arial is a passionate reader, which is about the only thing she shows passion for, or any other emotions for that matter, and brings a pack full of her personal collection of books where ever she goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra Steel the Terrain Mage is a curvy brunet with a great attitude and isn\u2019t afraid to show it. As far as appearance goes, Sandra is far from vain, but still tries to look her best. In their group of mages, Sandra is the oldest, but just like Ariel, she doesn\u2019t act her age; instead, she acts like an immature schoolgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lightning Mage Joel Tucker (or Jolt) is a mad man with extreme amounts of energy. The hazel eyed blond mage enjoys playing pranks that usually involving electric shock, running around at lighting speed, making loud noises, and just about anything that could, and most like would, get on his guild-mates nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosanna Thorn has sage green hair, true green eyes and is just as gentle and delicate as the plants her magic allows her to control; only her magic makes the plants much stronger, while the sage haired mage stays just as timid and weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Blaine and Flo Magus are brother and sister who are almost exact opposites. While Blaine is a joyful, talkative and enthusiastic Fire Mage with red hair and amber eyes, Flo is a Water Sprite Mage with blue eyes and cyan hair, who is very unpleasant to be around when she is being mean or is angry, which is most of the time. In fact, the only thing they have in common is a love for getting their eight hours. Normally, Flo would have an advantage against a Fire Mage, but to survive Blaine has come up with a few tricks that help even things out, unfortunately they only work for him and not his guild-mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic's.<br>\r\nAriel: Wind, Flying and Force Magic.<br>\r\nSandra: Terrain, Mineral, Strength and Golem Magic.<br>\r\nJoel: Lightning, Plasma, and Speed Magic.<br>\r\nRosanna: Plant, Healing and Regeneration Magic.<br>\r\nBlaine: Blazing, Freezing, Defusing and Nine Angel's Magic.<br>\r\nFlo: Flowing, Freezing, Reflecting, and Lunar Magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Fatten it- Weight gain of divine proportions happens here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfling Club- In the less safe regions of Honger there is a pair of bounty hunters: The Human Lucas, and the Human-Fairy hybrid Fliter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of his blood red eyes, long black hair and his over all 'creature of the night' appearance, people are often afraid of Lucas, even though he's one of the kindest men you could ever meet, while Fliter's blue eyes and white hair hide her mischievous nature that most Fairy's have. Because of her Human blood, Fliter stands much taller than any pureblood Fairies at four and a half feet tall, but is still dwarfed by the seven foot Lucas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs bounty hunters, Lucas and Fliter have run across two of the lands most infamous 'freelance workers', as they prefer to be called, named Woo and Mi. Woo is a gray haired half Human half Hobgoblin hybrid, Mi is a white haired Halfling Elf, and both of them are willing to do any job for the right amount of coin. Normally, Hobgoblins hate Elves, and when people see the petite Mi being followed by the muscular Woo they try to warn her of the danger, only to get a laugh in response as they continue on their way. Because most of their 'freelancing' involves illegal activates, Woo and Mi have had to deal with Lucas and Fliter on multiple occasions, though sometimes, when their interest don\u2019t contradict, they work together\u2026but that rarely happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShame on Fame- In the last few miles before the Human and Goblin countries connect, there is town called 'The Last Resort'. It is a collection of multiple shops, inns, pubs and spas that specializes in tending to the every need of the guest and is all owned by a single woman named Elizabeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth is an ill tempered woman with brown colored hair and eyes, who is often mistaken for a Dwarf because of her height and chubby body, and those who do make that mistake end up with a crossbow bolt to the knee, and a three night ban from the town (if she's in a good mood). Lately, things have begun to slow down and become boring Elizabeth, but that will change when the half Human, half Giant adventuress with violet hair and eyes Leona, along with her unwanted Ogre sidekick Jonk, comes to stay at The Last Resort, especially since she is a mage, and Elizabeth is amused by even the simplest of tricks.</span></div></div>",

She scanned the camp sight, looking for the culprit, when her eyes came to rest on the familiar glow of golden hair, reflecting the moon light. \u201cJ-Jolt, what are you doing? I could have been Flo!\u201d She half whispered half yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer guild mate Joel Tucker then slowly picked him self up off of the ground and whipped dirt off his clothes before responding in a light whisper, \u201cYeah, so could I, then who\u2019d be angry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026but really, why are you up so late, and\u2026what\u2019s that thing on your head?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThing, what thing,\u201d Joel reached for his head and took of a gold crown with several gems embedded in it. \u201cI BURIED YOU!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh, you\u2019re going to wake Flo up, and why are you yelling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s been following me for years,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026H-he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, he, and no matter what I do, I can never get rid of him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Jolt, please, just stop yelling and I\u2019ll help you deal with your problem later, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you two don\u2019t shut up and go to sleep I\u2019ll deal with both of you as problems later.\u201d Came a third voice, one that caused Rosanna to hide underneath her blanket, and Joel to fall flat on his face into the dirt, and stayed there motionlessly for the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5:15 AM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun slowly rose up on the horizon as the first rays of sunshine started the day, and Ariel was finishing her book. It was the third installment of her favorite saga, titled \u201cTime-walker: The Grand Dragon\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading the last page, she whipped a single tear from her eye and cursed the woman who wrote it for causing her to feel that way before slipping the book back into her pack. She looked down at the ground from the tree she spent the night in to see the others starting to wake up (again) and decided that she should join them in starting the day. She slung her pack around her should, took her lantern in her other hand, jumped off the branch she\u2019d been sitting on and slowly floated down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ariel got closer to the ground, she heard one of the guilds morning rituals, deciding who had to wake Flo up. \u201c...I don\u2019t care, she\u2019s already mad at us, there\u2019s no way either of us is doing it!\u201d Joel protested while patting down a patch of freshly dug up dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well\u2026me and Sandy shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near her <i>or</i> her pack, because <i>somebody</i> though it would be a good idea to go through it, and ended up stealing her diary!\u201d Blaine said, looking at Sandra as she whistled innocently with a look of ignorance on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has a diary? You know she\u2019s probably going to kill you just for telling us she even <i>has</i> a diary!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is why we read it, I mean, if she\u2019s already going to kill us, then what did we have to lose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>We</i>, <i>us</i>? No, <i>you</i> stole it from he pack, <i>you</i> read it to me while I was trying to sleep, and <i>you</i> are going to wake her up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou four can go ahead and get changed, I\u2019ll wake Ms. Magus.\u201d Ariel offered in her usual dry tone, smoothing out any creases in her long white skirt that may have formed after she landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, the four other mages ran of to change into there day clothes, while Ariel walked over to the still sleeping Flo. At some point in the night, she must have noticed Ariel wasn\u2019t going to be sleeping, since she had taken her mat and had placed it on top of hers, as well as wrapped herself in both Ariel\u2019s and her own blanket\u2026or she could have had no idea and just took them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel bent down and placed her hand on Flo and began to gently push her back and forth. \u201cMs. Magus, I apologize if you are still tiered, but you must wake up now and get changed, before the forest predators begin to wake; I would rather not have to fish Jolt out of the stomach of yet another ursus-araneus\u2026that reminds me, we will need to pick up more honey the next time we are in a town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney? Oh\u2026can I have five more minutes, Honey?\u201d The Cyan haired girl said before wrapping her arm around a clump of blanket and burying her face in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, did ya say somthin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6:13 AM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019m all done!\u201d Blaine said as he stepped out from behind a tree. He had changed out of his simple night clothes and into his Seraph armor; several golden armor plantings that are worn on the forearms, shoulders, the upper chest, upper back, lower legs, on top of his poofy white shirt and black pants, and had styled his red hair into spikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I am, too\u2026\u201d Rosanna had risen up out of a pile of leaves, now dressed in her green chemise with a vine like belt going around her waist and a leather breastplate that covered her front, while she tried to pick some leaves out of the braid in her long sage colored hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m all set, too!\u201d Sandra said after jumping out of a hole in the ground and landing with a thud. She now wore instead of a long brown nightgown, a waist length vest with buttons over a short sleeved shirt that was a few shades darker than the orange of the vest, as well as an even darker orange colored skirt, with all signs of her bed head combed away so that her brown, shoulder length hair framed her round face. \u201cDon\u2019t I look cute~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Bout time, you guys took almost an hour to change! It only took me and Ariel five minutes at most!\u201d Flo complained as she got up of the ground and dusted off her aqua blue sarong that wrapped around her waist. She also wore a deep blue bikini top that barley held her large breast in place and had pulled her cyan into a pony tail that hung over her left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, but dose anyone know where Mr. Tucker?\u201d Ariel asked, now clad in another one of her white dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I\u2019m up here\u2026but I\u2019m not sure how to get back down\u2026\u201d Every one looked up and saw Joel sitting on a branch of the tallest tree, still wearing the same clothes as before. The yellowed shirt he wore only had a right sleeve, while his left forearm was clothed by a separate sleeve held in place by two leather belts, one at his wrist and one at his elbow. Covering his lower half, were a pair of pants the same faded color as his shirt, with both legs stopping at the knees, with separate pant legs held in place the same way as the sleeve on his left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-Jolt, what are you doing up their? You didn\u2019t even need to change!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026I just got bored waiting and\u2026yeah\u2026can someone help me down? I forgot that I\u2019m afraid of heights\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get him down.\u201d Flo said before bending over to pick up a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7:05 AM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m just saying that if we didn\u2019t have to wait for Jolt\u2019s bones to be healed we could have been half way to the next town by now!\u201d Blaine complained as he and the others continued their way along a forest path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m just sayin\u2019, if he didn\u2019t climb up there in the first place, I wouldn\u2019t of had to knock his ass back down! So if you don\u2019 want to end up like him, you better shut up! GOT IT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps I should purchase a book on phobias to keep this from happening in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-we should get some more elixir too; I used it all up closing the wound left by the rock he landed on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeheh, yeah, I should have put a softer rock there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t feel my anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026does any one else here that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026sounds like\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Spider-Bears!\" After spending the rest of the day running from giant monster, the guild takes refuge in a mansion hidden in the woods that is home to some people Ariel is <i>very</i> familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-giant wings flapping!\u201d After slaying a massive dragon, the guild makes its cave their new base of operations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...thunder but\u2026not thunder.\u201d A massive magic storm is coming their way, and the guild takes cover in the nearest town until it blows over.</span></div></div>",

So no matter what we do it looks like we won\u2019t be having a permanent headquarters anytime soon, maybe we should just set up camp for the night and worry about it in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat may not be necessary.\u201d Ariel said as she drifted down and rejoined the group. As the others were running, she had taken to the skies, and while she was up there, she had spotted something interesting. \u201cWhen I was strategically evading the ursus-araneus, I spotted a very large mansion up ahead, it was very well hidden under the trees, but it was there. If we approach the owner of the home, we could ask to stay the night. Or at the very least send us in the direction of town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, *huff*, that sounds, *puff*, like a good plan, *huff*, can someone carry me there?\u201d Blaine begged, and when everyone began to follow Ariel he groaned even louder before limping after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a ten minute walk, they arrived at the large building. Based on window placement, it appeared to have three above ground floors, four if you counted the attic, and was so massive it was hard to tell how big it even was. The house wasn\u2019t in the best condition, but it was by no means uninhabitable, just some chipped paint here, some vines growing up the walls there and a few loose shingles on the roof. All in all, it didn\u2019t look like anything anyone would expect to find<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you really weren\u2019t kidding when you said this place was really big!\u201d Flo commented as she walked up the steps to the mansions front door. She raised her arm and began to whale on the door several times, before it was finally opened by a beautiful young woman with strawberry blond hair wearing a black suit\u2026though there wasn\u2019t much time to take in the woman\u2019s appearance, because she shut the door faster than she opened it. \u201cWhat the hell, that bitch didn\u2019t even ask what we want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re eating dinner; we always come knocking when we\u2019re eating dinner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJolt I\u2026you\u2026just go climb another tree. I\u2019m knocking again, maybe I\u2019ll get someone more polite this time, and if it\u2019s that last servant again I can punch that bitch in the face!\u201d Flo then knocked (more like punched) on the door three more times, this time it was opened by a man in a similar suit as the woman, only it ha sever overlapping white lines going all across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of his hair was short and black, but there was a long strand of white hair framing either side of his face, the left one being much thinner and reaching his shoulder, the right on only came down to his chin, and was much thicker. \u201cHello, how may I help you today-err\u2026tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Flo, me and my-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, no! I\u2019m not supposed to let you in! Please try again later!\u201d Once again, the door was slammed in Flo\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well, m-maybe we should just g-go and set up c-camp for the n-night\u2026and try to f-find the path on our own\u2026\u201d Rosanna suggested, only receiving an angry glare from Flo in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s keep trying; I wanna see a giant chicken open the door next!\u201d Joel said while flapping his arms like wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra laughed. \u201cAs much as I know that that\u2019s not going to happen, I still want to see that happen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as we\u2019re hoping, I kind of want to see a sexy maid open it next!\u201d Every one stared at Blaine. \u201cWhat? Those two were butlers\u2026sort of, so why can\u2019t a maid answer it next? That would be a lot more likely than a giant chicken!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, excuse me, may I help you?\u201d Every one changed their focus again to turn around and see a blond woman, arms over loaded with food supplies in bags, standing behind the group of mages, clad in a black and white maid\u2019s uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping past Blaine\u2019s victory dancing and wolf whistling (that latter of which got him pounded into the ground by Flo), Ariel approached the blond maid and explained their situation to her. \u201c\u2026and we would be gratefully appreciative if you would allow us to stay the night here, and then point us in the direction of the nearest town in the morning. We have our own food, so you won\u2019t have to feed us, if that makes you any more willing to let us stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be any problem, our chef loves to cook, the more the merrier. In fact, she was going to prepare a very large griffon for dinner tonight-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiant chicken!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026So we would have ended up with a lot of left over\u2019s had you not come along.\u201d The blond continued after Joel\u2019s outburst, her confused expression hidden behind the bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume your response means that you are welcoming us to stay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, our mistress loves it when we have guest\u2026though she is trying to recover from a rather nasty cold, so please try not to bother her too much or cause a lot of noise.\u201d The group exchanged nervous looks but followed the blond maid inside, though for Blaine it was more like following her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Edit: I made a mistake involving a character in this, and in another storyline, but they're gone now.)</span></div></div>",

How the hell can you tell where you\u2019re going?\u201d Flo asked as the maid led them down countless hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well\u2026it\u2019s hard to explain. We all just sort of find our way around; you\u2019d have to ask Maxus, I can introduce you to him later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, would you mind telling us what your name is?\u201d Ariel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout breaking her stride, the maid replied, \u201cMy name is Juliet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a lovely name!\u201d Said Blaine, his eyes still glued to Juliet\u2019s skirt as he imagined what it was hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Juliet stopped outside a door had Ariel open it, revealing an absolutely massive kitchen, with the strawberry blond inside holding a tray with a cup of tea and a bowl of soup. Thankfully, Flo still couldn\u2019t see anything past the bags and didn\u2019t lose her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she put the bags down that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU,\u201d She yelled, causing the suit wearing woman to raise an eyebrow in confusion. \u201cYou better apologize for slamming that door in my face you bitch!\u201d The woman opened her mouth to say something, but closed it back when Flo charged at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a moments hesitation the servant tossed the tray into the air, spun around Flo\u2019s attack causing her to lose balance and fall to the floor and stomped her foot onto Flo\u2019s chest, all before catching the falling tray without spilling a single drop of soup or tea. With Flo and the others left paralyzed by shock, the servant took the opportunity to cast a spell. \u201cWeaponry Magic: Ruby Rapier!\u201d In the servant\u2019s free hand, a long pointed sword with no edge and cup shaped hilt that appeared to be flawlessly cut from a single ruby that must have been massive in size began to form, and when it was fully materialized, the point was placed as close to Flo\u2019s chest as it could be without it piercing through her. \u201cJuliet, should I execute these intruders?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait what?!\u201d Juliet was the only one who had missed the attack thanks to the bags, but even when the other servant asked permission to kill their guest, she did not drop the bag. \u201cNo, Blake, they aren\u2019t intruders, they\u2019re our guest!\u201d She said as she began to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I see; my apologies then Ma\u2019am.\u201d The servant named Blake apologized after taking her foot off Flo, her rapier disappearing soon after. \u201cI should go take these to the Mistress before they begin to cool.\u201d Blake the turned and exited the kitchen, allowing the Guild Mages to recover from shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I didn\u2019t expect that bitch to be a Mage! I would never have let that happen if I had known!\u201d Flo said with what started out with shocked tone and expression, but both quickly turned to ones of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry for the way Blake acted,\u201d Juliet apologized as she finally set down the bags on a counter, still keeping her back to the others even as she unpacked them. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that Blake doesn\u2019t like reacts badly when around people he\u2019s not used to seeing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cThat was a guy? Damn, he was hotter than me, and I\u2019m pretty smoking!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra laughed. \u201cHa, smoking, fire, hot! I get it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a joke\u2026are you trying to say I\u2019m not attractive!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, are you getting steamed, hot head? Maybe you need to cool down, we all know how fired up you can--oop, shit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blaine started chasing Sandra around the kitchen with a sword made of fire, Ariel let out a sigh, and hoped that they wouldn\u2019t be kicked out. \u201cI guess that I am the only one who could actually tell that was a man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlo crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t have boobs, I noticed right away, I just like bitch better than bastard.\u201d Ariel gave Flo a confused stare but her attention was brought back to Juliet when she started talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, quite a few people make that mistake, which is one of the reasons for his attitude.\u201d Juliet said before taking one final jar out of a bag. \"Alright, I can show you guys to a room now-\u201d Juliet froze when she turned around and saw the Mages for the first time, and after scanning each one of them with her dark brown eyes, she continued with a deep red blush on her face. \u201cOh\u2026um I-I didn\u2019t realize that you were...so many in number.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that will be a problem then we can leave-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliet shook her head. \u201cN-no, I mean, that\u2019s not what I meant. We have plenty of room here for all of you\u2026\u201d She protested, cutting of Ariel mid sentence. \u201cUh\u2026I\u2019ll show you to s-some rooms now.\u201d She began to walk out of the kitchen the remaining bag on her arm, but stopped before reaching the door. \u201cUm, before I forget, which one of you was the one who helped me with the bags?\u201d Flo rolled her eyes and let one arm fall from its crossed position across her chest down to her side while she raised the other one. \u201cW-well, thank you very much\u2026um\u2026oh I\u2019m so sorry! I\u2019ve completely forgotten to ask any of your names!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay beautiful, it just didn\u2019t come up; my names Blaine Mages, and that\u2019s my sister Flo.\u201d Blaine said with a sweet tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m Sandra Steel, but you can call me Sandy.\u201d Sandra began as she picked herself up off a charred section of the floor, and once she was fully erect she proceeded to point to each of the other guild members as she introduced them, \u201cBlondie over there is Joel Tucker, but we call him Jolt, the girl in green is Rosanna Thorn, and the one in the pretty white dress is Ariel Skylark!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026those are all very\u2026unique names. Uh\u2026c-come with me, I\u2019ll show you to your rooms now\u2026again.\u201d Juliet then whipped around and hurried out of the kitchen and the others following soon after, but with Ariel and Blaine lagging a little bit behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it me, or is Ms. Juliet behaving more nervously now that she has seen us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe she\u2019s been dumbstruck by my handsomeness!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel gave Blaine a short glare before quickening her pace to catch up to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until they crossed though twelve hallways, gone up three flights of stairs and then down two that Juliet stopped outside another. \u201cThis should be it.\u201d She then opened the door to reveal a very large room, with three beds pushed up against the right wall, and two beds pressed up against the left with a gap between them where a sixth bed could be place, but instead, it was in the middle of the room, where the man in the strange suit laid unconscious. \u201cOh\u2026looks like he ran out of energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU,\u201d Flo yelled at the sleeping man. \u201cYou are defiantly going to get it! And I\u2019m not going to make the same mistake twice, either! Freezing Magic: Ice-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that was just dumb. Haven\u2019t you ever heard of letting sleeping dogs lie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what,\u201d Once again Flo found herself pinned to the floor by one of the servants, only this time she hadn\u2019t even seen him move or feel him attack. She was just instantly on her front\u2026with the odd man sitting cross legged on her bare back. \u201cGet the hell off of me!\u201d With a wrenching motion Flo sent the butler of her back and got to her feet. \u201cHow the fuck do you people keep doing that?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026Flo\u2026\u201d Flo whipped around to the others ready to bite someone\u2019s head off, when she noticed that they were either diverting there gaze, or staring at her frozen in place with slack jaw and flushed in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Interesting, to say the least,\u201d Ariel said, her being the only one with a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Oh my\u2026\u201d Juliet said with her head turned, but her eyes locked on Flo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the hell am I looking?!\u201d Blaine asked more to himself than to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, attitude or not how is she single?\u201d Sandra questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey look even bigger now\u2026\u201d Rosanna marveled, a hand resting subconsciously on her flat leather chest plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Boobs!\u201d Joel shouted as loud as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her left eye twitching, Flo quickly crossed her arms over her bare chest. \u201cWhere\u2026the hell\u2026IS MY TOP,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI took it, I noticed it looked a little too small for you, so I got you one that won\u2019t constrict their size as much,\u201d The butler said handing over a darker, admittedly much larger yet equally skimpy bikini top over to Flo and she quickly put it on. \u201cYou should replace the rest as well by the way; you are definitely not a D-cup.\u201d Flo threw a punch at the butler, but without even looking he caught it, and continued with her fist clenched tightly in his hand. \u201cNow as for beds, girls on right, guys on left. I was moving the bed to the other side but\u2026well\u2026yeah. Anyway, this will have to do until I can set up more permanent accommodations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPermanent? Maxus, these are guests.\u201d Juliet corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Alright, but tell me, did I let them in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! You slammed the door in my face!\u201d Flo said, still trying to get free of Maxus\u2019s grasp, and after a shrug of the shoulder, he let her go. Then, without saying another word, he walked to the door, picked Juliet up, slung her over his shoulder and left the guild in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, someone comes to the guilds room, but who is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cat with gray fur that takes a liking to Flo and Ariel,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef Catharine Cook, who has been sent to collect them for dinner, and she's almost as weird as Joel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Edit: I made a mistake involving a character in this, and in another storyline, but they're gone now.)</span></div></div>",

Currently all the goddesses are more or less equal. The goddesses are ageless and  unmatched in beauty. Each goddess has demigod minions who live in the human realm and can carry out their bidding. <br>\r\nThere are many goddesses but there are five main ones.<br>\r\nEcho, goddess of love. A very long (body length) silver haired, silver eyed, pure snow white skinned beauty very thin with large breasts with angel wings. Very sweet and caring. Dressed in a long flowing seethrough white dress with a viel.<br>\r\nAqua, goddess of water. Long blue hair, flows like water, deep blue eyes, curvy body fun personality. Wraps herself in a silk cloth in various ways, usually topless and wrapped around her hips.<br>\r\nFlora goddess of plants. Green hair with red streaks intertwined, yellow eyes, very thin. Spunky and energetic. Wears a tunic.<br>\r\nBeautifa goddess of beauty. Long blonde hair curvy huge boobs green eyes. Affectionate personality. Naked but wears jewelry.<br>\r\nVora goddess of gluttony. long brunette hair, hazel eyes, fat huge boobs belly limbs. extremely voracious and lustful. Wears a long red gown cut very low showing a deep cleavage. The gown has a protective aura around it that keeps it clean when Vora spills food on it Leaving Vora always sparkling clean even during her messiest feasts. <br>\r\nThere are also many other goddesses who reign along side these five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVora was gorging herself on food while watching over the human realm. Vora saw a fat queen feast with her princess daughter upon fattening delicacies and felt a pleasant sensation. \"Ah a fine royal woman who knows how to enjoy life. And a voracious daughter as well I will be sure to bless her throughout her life as she grows.\" Looking elsewhere Vora saw a village full of rail thin girls. \"hmmph! What a shame, women who can't enjoy themselves. Keeping their scrawny bodies hungry and wanting.\" Vora said as she bit into a massive ham. Vora then finished watching the humans by checking up on her temple. Vora saw her obese priestesses praying and stuffing themselves and offering up sacrifices of out grown garments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVora then heaved her massive body up and walked to the garden. There she saw Echo who was smiling. \"What are you so happy about Echo?\" asked Vora. \"Its wonderful more people are falling in love and I'm constantly gaining influence over the humans. Just this week 10 more temples were built in my honor and thousands of more people are my followers.\"said echo. \"Yes you have gained power Echo but not the only one\" said Beautifa as she entered the conversation. \"Women are paying more attention to their looks and appreciating beauty more, making me more influential.\" said Beautifa. Vora began craving power as well as she walked to her palace she began contemplating on how to gain followers. \"how do I get women to indulge themselves?\" she wondered.    <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Lady of Battle, send us an angel, Lady of War, send us a savior, Lady of Succor, send us a warrior,' Priestess Jostlin prayed again and again, voice rasping from her dry throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Priestess was short (5' even) and would have been mousey with her big brown eyes, freckles and soft brown hair if there'd been enough flesh to count as mousey. Instead she was bone thin, almost fleshlessly svelte with hollow cheeks and sunken eyes, her neck painfully thin and her fingers bony. Her brown robe had always been loose but now was hanging off her breastless, hipless frame like a tent. Sweet and shy, she was as far as could be imagined from a cleric of the Triune Goddesses, three divine siblings of war, love and wisdom who were depicted in mosaics and statues around her chapel. (in order) There was Vola, the voluptuous, black haired beauty of joy, love and sex, Hesta, the dark skinned, kinky haired patron of art, wisdom and learning and finally Fenra, the tall, muscularly curvacious bringer of victory and protector of the weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please Fenra, send us aid,' the little priestess begged as the castle walls shook from bombardment, 'the orcs have harried us so long, we're out of food, out of spells, out of time. My lover fights to hold the line but unless we have a miracle...please I will give anything...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJostlin felt her hair stand on end and for the first time in weeks, a warm strength filled her body. On the altar her last candles flared to painful, blinding light and when she could at last look back she was no longer alone. A woman stood on the sacred stone, or rather floated:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8 feet of divinely carved glory, from the tips of her armored boots up her powerful, chiseled thighs over narrow, girlish hips and an armored bulging with more muscles than all the castle guards had ever had put together on display, leading up to an armored bra cradling two huge, athletic, almost threatening bosoms and hard, bulging arms bigger than Jostlin's thighs had ever been. Her skin was glowing alabaster without a scar or blemish and her golden blonde hair glowed like the sunrise from where it fell over a winged headress. Two pairs of golden wings erupted from her back, out stretched and beating softly and her face was hard to look at it was so perfectly beautiful, while in her gloved hands was a jet black long sword, six feet tall from tip to tip and covered in divine runes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fenra!' Jostlin squeaked, falling to her face in supplication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No child, I am not the goddess, merely an angel,' the divinity smiled, showing dazzling white teeth that left after images, 'your request has been heard and I was sent to save you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...I thank you so much,' Jostlin sobbed, relief and the feeling of safety flowing over her, 'I was so afraid...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped down, putting the hundred pound sword over her shoulder and gently cupping Jostlin's chin with hands that could have easily juggled the biggest horse in the castle, back before they'd eaten all the horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Be not afraid, for you have proven devoted to the goddess, always making such small sacrifices even from your dismal rations,' the angels smiled at her, 'I wish I could have come sooner but there are so many evils in the worlds and so few of us great warrior angels. Come now, witness the victory I shall offer to the Goddess!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What...what is your name?' Jostlin asked, overcome with happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I am Kelara, Angel of Bountiful Victory,' the giant celestial smiled at her, 'and you little one are Jostlin, always a brave one despite your quietness the Goddess had noted. Always devout and kind and seeing to the needy, a warrior in your own way. Do not worry again though, soon you will be saved.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJostlin followed as Kelara walked out of the chapel, through the halls of desperate refugees who fell to their knees weeping at this divine servitor and into the court yard where the few hundred surviving men at arms (out of a ten thousand man garrison) led by her boyfriend Sir Hal prepared to sell their lives dearly. Kelara entered just as the orc horde broke down the gates, a tide of green insanity spilling into the castle. The carnage was horrific and entirely one sided, the orcs had all the chance against the arc angel that a field of wheat had against a scythe. So fast was she that a green mist appeared between where she first drew her sword and the castle gates and entire schools of swordsmanship would have been founded just to study the angle of her ankle if any mortal eye could have seen her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifty thousand orcs, all the monsters of the northern mountains, were felled in less than an hour, leaving their bodies stretched out over the winter fields. Kelara fluttered gently down into the castle square, wiping her great sword clean with the Orcs sacred banner. There was not a scratch or stain on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rejoice, for you are delivered,' Kelara beamed at the awestruck, weeping crowd, 'from the orcs!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTh angel looked them over, taking in their gaunt, stared appearances. Few civilians had actually died, it seemed the food had been well managed but all were near starved. Jostlin, a maid of 22 summers should have had full breasts, round hips and probably a belly beginning to round with child, such was the love between her and her boyfriend, palpable to Kelara's angelic sight. As was their starvation, in the high heavens all were athletic and perfect but here on the mortal realm things were so precarious, these people would likely die of starvation in a month if she didn't do something. It shouldn't be this way but the battle against the abyss' evil required the goddesses to spend so much divine energy...divine energy  like that laying around from the army of devil worshiping orcs she'd slaughtered. It had been born of malice but now stood neutral, able to be used by the first one with the will and skill to shape it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...and from hunger!' the warrior angel continued, pointing out her sword and gathering unused divine magic into it and making it rain down on the barren, unplanted fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc horde had cut down trees and dug up roots, creating two hundred square miles of desert in what should have been productive farm country. With a wave of her blade, Kelara turned it into something from the heavens: rolling hills of lush pasturage populating by mooing, house sized dairy cows with full udders and happy, baaing sheep the size of ponies, flocks of dog sized chickens and pig sized ducks that would lay a hundred eggs a day, winding orchards heavy with fruit the size of human heads, berry patches big enough to hold a carnival in and endless rows of wheat, barely, hops, corn, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, onions, radishes and all the other stuff humans should eat. Despite the winter chill everywhere else, it was a pleasant spring day in this new mega farm. Kelara wasn't exactly sure on what human farms looked like but she felt a strange joy at creating such fecundity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How...how can we repay you?' Jostlin begged, seeing the salvation of her people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Remember the goddesses who protect you, pray, be grateful, happy, brave and kind!' was what Kelara said, before she vanished in a puff of white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was the greatest feast in the kingdom's history. Scared, starving men and women ate and ate and ate, to their amazement finding that the trees and plants instantly regrew as soon as they were picked, yielding perfect fruit each time. In joy they ate and ate and ate, until they were pinned to the ground by their own groaning bellies. One goblin with a bread knife could have ended the kingdom there and then, everyone was so helpless, but Kelara had ended all threats with her blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal and Jostlin sat lazily in the great hall, his sword belt undone to accommodate his feasted paunch and Jostlin's tent like dress stretched tight over her monumental food baby. At the moment, neither of the two former starvlings had the energy for sex, but both new it would come in a day or two, once their salvation would sink in. Fierce love, burning hot at their desperate survival was fueling a life long fire of passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I suppose we should get married,' Hal said, running his finger over her immense food baby, 'I'm the last knight in the kingdom and will need a queen...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course I accept, even if you're an unromantic ass,' Jostlin giggled, punching his arm lightly, 'but first, I must sacrifice...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up was miserable but Jostlin made her way to the temple, bearing a forty pound tray of fruit and vegetables that her skinny arms could barely carry and had to rest on her tender belly. She sat it on the altar and bowed well as she could, smiling at where the angel had appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I give this back to you Kelara, who saved all of us. Know I will never forget you and I and my daughters will sacrifice to you forever!' the Priestess grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA world away, Kelara trade blows with a fire demon a hundred feet high. She heard the prayer of thanks, directed not at her patron Fenra and felt herself grow stronger, striking a hard blow that shattered the magma fiend and sent it spiraling apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActual worship? How odd...she hoped it didn't get out of hand...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHmm, so this is Last Resort huh? I have to admit I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be so\u2026much.\u201d Leona said as she walked down the dirt path that led to the gated entrance of the last resort. A very tall stone brick wall kept her from seeing the streets and most of the buildings, but there were quite a few buildings that rose up hire than the wall; very impressive for a town so far away from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it very much,\u201d Leona\u2019s Ogre companion Jonk agreed. He followed her where ever she went ever since she saved his life and no matter how hard she tried she couldn\u2019t shake the annoyingly grateful Ogre. So she made him carry her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Leona stopped in the middle of the street and turned to Jonk, who took a little longer to slow his giant stride to a stop. \u201cHand me my cloak and our papers, I\u2019m pretty sure there going to want to check them before letting us in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPromise you really gonna give mine this time?\u201d Jonk asked as he handed a bag to Leona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise\u2026\u201d Leona left off as she pulled a cloak out of the bag and draped it over herself, using the hood to hide her bright violet hair from view, which would help to keep her from being recognized. \u201c\u2026That I will do no such thing!\u201d She finished before taking off running for the gate, but as Leona approached it, she saw that people were passing right by the guards and into the town, and thus her hopes of losing her unwanted companion were once again dashed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason that Leona had came to Last Resort was because she was in need of some rest and relaxation, and she decided that it would be the ideal place for her to have it. Not only because Last Resort had a reputation as one of the greatest vacation destinations in the land, but because it was so far out of the way that even if someone spotted her violet hair and eyes, they probably wouldn\u2019t recognize her as the famous warrior who\u2019d saved the land countless times. And she could finally have some time to just be Leona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuses me, miss, could you please help us?\u201d A weak voice from behind her asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe not\u2026\u201d Leona muttered under her breath. She was going to say no to whomever it was who asked, but when she saw three little girls standing behind her, well, that wasn\u2019t an option any more. \u201cOf course, what do you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls were different ages, but all had ginger hair and wore a black bow. \u201cWell, we don\u2019t want to bother you, but Daisy just ran up that tree, and you and your friend look like the only ones tall enough to reach her.\u201d The middle girl replied, pointing up to orange cat lying on a tree branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019d get her our selves, but our big sis said we\u2019re not allowed to climb the trees...anymore\u2026\u201d The youngest added, glaring at the oldest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault I fell! You were throwing rocks at me!\u201d She defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll get her down for you.\u201d Leona said, giving the children a wide grin before walking over the tree. She reached up for the cat but ever at her height she was barely tall enough to reach. But eventually she had plucked the cat out of the tree and handed it to the middle child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much, Miss!\u201d They all said at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was nothing really. Now run along and don\u2019t let her out of your sight again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe won\u2019t!\u201d The youngest and middle called out as they ran off, taking the cat with them and leaving the oldest behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you again miss, our big sister would have been so mad if we lost Daisy again. Is there anything I can do to thank you?\u201d The oldest asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, there is one thing. Can you tell me if you know of any place I can stay while I\u2019m in town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the whole town is full of nice inns for you to stay the night, but if you want the best than you want Desire. It\u2019s like the whole town wrapped up into one place! The town owner lives there, too. It\u2019s sorta like the town hall or something\u2026I think\u2026me and my younger sisters aren\u2019t old enough to go there yet. But our older sister goes there all the time to meet her friend, and she always comes back with the biggest smile!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sounds nice, I think I\u2019ll stay there, thank you for telling me.\u201d The girl then smiled brightly and took off after her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeona and Jonk then continued on down the cobblestone roads looking for building called \u201cDesire\u201d, and it took a while of wandering around before she remembered the little girl didn\u2019t give her any directions. It was hard finding someone willing to stop what ever they were doing to actually talk to her. Then she had another embarrassing moment when they told her it was the tallest building in the center of town, which made sense seeing as how important that little girl made it sound, and not long after that Leona and Jonk found the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Leona figured out exactly why those girls weren\u2019t allowed in, it was an absolute mad house! What could be seen of the first floor was somewhat like a pub, with a bar, tables and booths to sit as well as several wenches and grooms serving food and drink to their three types of patrons. There were the drunks, who were absolutely out of it thanks to whatever it was they were being served. Then there were the brawlers, who threw punches and chairs at each other, only stopping to consume their order or flirt with their server. And finally there were the lovers, ranging from first date couples, all the way to do-me-right-here-on-the-table couples. Though all of them stopped what they were doing when they noticed Leona and Jonk walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeona and her ten foot ogre acquaintance were stared at intently by the patrons, causing her survival instincts to kick in\u2026or at least the first part of it, namely assessing whether fight or flight were her best options. There were about eighty patrons and twenty staff workers staring at her, with the bulk of them having\u2026well, bulk to them. Whether that \u201cbulk\u201d was muscle or fat seemed to depend on if they were a man or a woman. While men tended to have more muscle, the women tended to be a little chubby, though there were a few cases where it was swapped, and a few that were of more average weight. Actually, now that she thought about, the whole town seemed to be a little on the heavy side, even those girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking that thought from her head, Leona returned her focus to what she would do if things in the bar went sour, and quickly decided that she could definitely take on everyone in the bar. But she soon realized that wouldn\u2019t be necessary when anyone with a mug raised it, and everyone cheered, \u201cWelcome strangers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the pub area an awkward smile, Leona replied, \u201cUm, hello\u2026I\u2019d like to talk to someone about staying here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I can help you with that.\u201d A short, chubby woman with brown hair and brown eyes said as she approached Leona with a warm smile. \u201cJust follow me and I can get you and your friend here all settled in.\u201d Leona just nodded and followed the other woman, happily leaving Jonk behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman led Leona into a small office with a desk and a few desks and not much else. The woman sat down in chair behind the desk and opened the large book that sat on it. \u201cOkay, first I\u2019m gonna need your name as well as the name of the ogre.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name is Jonk and my name\u2026is Leona.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s a very pretty name, Leona~\u201d The woman cooed as she wrote their names down. \u201cMy name is Elizabeth, but you can call me Eliza, but <i>you</i> can call me whatever you want~\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thankfully, Elizabeth didn\u2019t seem to recognize her name, which meant she didn\u2019t have to worry about having to sign autographs or get herself sketched with anyone. \u201cI\u2019ll just call you Eliza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d She said with a defeated tone. \u201cSo, we have a few prices for staying here. The standard price is twenty silver coins for each night, and for an extra five a night you can have full use of the normal facilities like the spa or the hot springs. We can also get you a privet groom who\u2019ll take care of your every need during your stay\u2026\u201d Eliza paused and leaned over her desk to whisper, \u201cAnd I mean <i>every</i> need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeona couldn\u2019t help but blush at that. \u201cWell, if I understand your use of \u201cevery need,\u201d and I\u2019m pretty sure I do, I wouldn\u2019t want a <i>groom</i>, if you get my meaning. Not saying that I would even use her in that way\u2026I just\u2026you know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I do, more than you\u2019d think. But don\u2019t worry; I make sure that my town is a safe place for anyone and everyone. In case you didn\u2019t notice the couples in the main area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, do you mean-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, this whole town belongs to me. Don\u2019t bother asking me how I managed it though; I wouldn\u2019t want any of my trade secrets getting out. Anyways, back to the prices. We also have something called Platinum Services, and incase you haven\u2019t guessed it\u2019s very expensive, a full five platinum coins a night! But it\u2019s still the best deal, if you have the coin that is. You\u2019ll stay in the nicest room, next to mine of course, you can have as much food as you want, you\u2019ll have access the Platinum Facilities, and as many privet wenches as you like. But it\u2019s not the best thing for a figure,\u201d Elizabeth said as she leaned back and rested her hands on her chubby stomach. \u201cTrust me, I live a Platinum life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026alright, I\u2019ve decided\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll just pay for the standard and go from there. Maybe check the town out some.\u201d Elizabeth decides to become Leona\u2019s tour guide while she\u2019s in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026That having access to the normal facilities will be enough. Not too sure about the wench though\u2026\u201d Elizabeth offers to be Leona\u2019s privet wench to make sure she gets what she needs, without the sexual parts (for a while at least). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Platinum sounds perfect for what I want to experience. Besides, that extra weight doesn\u2019t look too bad on you *blush*.\u201d Love forms and grows between Leona and Elizabeth rather fast, but their stomachs do the same and just as fast.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A very long time ago, while hiding away from the military, ten year old Professor Aaron Clarkson built a functioning starship, out of the parts he found in a starship graveyard. He used the ship to escape his home planet and hid from the military by going from planet to planet, changing the appearance and upgrading the performance his ship while on them to improve his chances of not being caught. It was a full forty years before the stature of limitations ran out on his crime, and by then he had long since completed his old research project, so he started looking for a new one. He decided to research the ancient and advanced alien species known Kilocks, whose language known as \u201cKi\u201d were spread on almost every planet with life. The symbols that made up the Ki language, are \u201cKi words\u201d, and by using them in a specific order, they can cause effects very much like spells from old Earth fairytales, and he has written several of these Ki words on a cane that he calls \u201cThe Symbolic\u201d that has become his weapon of choice in all combat situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor centuries, the Silent Sword only had Aaron on it, but eventually, it got its first two crew members. Their was one super soldier, who had been ordered to be executed along with all others, by their squads, only the super soldier squads leader survived thanks to her one loyal subordinate, while the rest of her squad was murdered, and the two spent years alone and wanted before Aaron found them and brought them onto his ship. The subordinate was a member of the Plock race, a species of giant purple humanoids with no hair, and the super soldier was sixteen year old Karen Carlson, who was kidnapped from her parents only a few months after her birth. Unfortunately, the mother had died and Karen was left with nowhere to go, so both she and her subordinate Intor Ysk stayed aboard the Silent Sword with Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo years later, the ship got its next two additions, the twins Amy and Thomas Griffon. They were only thirteen years old,  trying to run away from their abusive parents and had been hiding in the ships hull, but before Aaron had a chance to send them back, he saw their exemplary skills as pilots he agreed to let them stay aboard so long as they would be his pilots'\u2026after he had reclaimed his stolen ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another two years passed before the ship got more crewmembers, and for the first time they were officially hired on. Ever since he made the ship, Aaron had to run both its defense system and the warp drive at the same time, so when he hired a young couple that could take care of that for him, he had a lot more time to do his \"professoring\u201d. The couple had known each other all their lives, and have been together ever since they were ten, and not wanting to ever be separated, joined the crew to work in their respective fields. The one who was in charge of keeping the ship moving (though technically its space that moves) is the warp drive engineer Melisa Weston, and the one in charge of making sure the ship wouldn\u2019t be blown to bits by asteroids or attackers is the defenses expert Danielle Valentine. One year later, on her eighteenth birthday, Melisa became engaged Danielle and the entire wedding was handled by Aaron, the bachelorette parties (or at least Danielle\u2019s was a party), the ceremony (which was held on the sunrise side of a tidally locked planet), the honeymoon (on an actual moon made of honey) and just about everything else that was needed...all because he got sick from the mussy moment that was Melisa and Daniele proposing at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree years after the wedding (and four after the Valentine\u2019s joined) the majority of the crew began to complain about their only source of nourishment being disgustingly sweet protein packs and to stop the complaining Aaron brought the chef Natalie Woods onto the ship so she could prepare \u201cnormal\u201d food for the rest of the ship, while he continued to consume the packs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last two additions were six years later, when Aaron added on an assistant named Alison Noble, who began to grow very close to him very quickly. It was also around this time when Danielle and Melisa had approached Aaron and Alison to ask him a favor, one that after many hours of the extraction, manipulation and implantation of cells resulted in Danielle being impregnated with her and Melisa\u2019s child, then nine months later, the birth of their son, Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\nCrew personnel files.<br>\r\nLast edited by Professor Aaron Clarkson on 4/28/81.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron Clarkson.<br>\r\nHeight: 7\u20196\u201d.<br>\r\nWeight: 180lbs.<br>\r\nAge: Really old.<br>\r\nHair color: Grayish-black.<br>\r\nHairstyle: Asymmetrical cut.<br>\r\nIris color: Orange.<br>\r\nSpecies: Human?<br>\r\nHealth/mental conditions and risks: Hearts conditions.<br>\r\nOther information: Extraordinarily intelligent, smoking hobby, tiny temper, high stress, superior to all other Humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntor Ysk.<br>\r\nHeight: 10\u20192\u201d<br>\r\nWeight: 200lbs.<br>\r\nAge: 91.<br>\r\nHair color: None.<br>\r\nHairstyle: None.<br>\r\nIris color: Blue.<br>\r\nSpecies: Plock.<br>\r\nHealth/mental conditions and risks: None.<br>\r\nOther information: Loyal, intelligent, antithetical, near emotionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren Carlson.<br>\r\nHeight: 6\u20198\u201d.<br>\r\nWeight: 200lbs.<br>\r\nAge: 29.<br>\r\nHair color: Black.<br>\r\nHairstyle: Ponytail.<br>\r\nIris color: Orange.<br>\r\nSpecies: Human?<br>\r\nHealth/mental conditions and risks: Survivors guilt, PTSD, severe depression, slowly being poisoned by super soldier serum.

She had been lying awake for four hours, half of that time she spent tossing and turning, but she gave up on that when she almost woke up her sleeping wife. This wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d been unable to get any sleep; it had been going on for months, ever since their son Eric was born. It wasn\u2019t from the stress of being a mother or anything at all to do with Eric or Danielle at all. No, her insomnia was caused by the doughy, ivory orb that rested atop her once flat stomach: her new gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started when Danielle first started to show, and began to worry that Melisa wouldn\u2019t find her attractive anymore, so to ease her wife\u2019s fears she began to put on weight with out Danielle knowing, and when their son was born, Melisa would lose the weight with her, but there was on thing that she had forgotten, something that in all those months had not once occurred to Melisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had forgotten that Danielle was going to lose most of the weight when she gave birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Danielle had nearly returned to her original lean self, with the only thing keeping her from being back at her old weight was the fat that hid away in her breast (not that she had any intent of losing it), but Melisa still had almost every pound she had gained from her plan. And while Danielle\u2019s job involved her move heavy creates full of hyper-dense ammunition, performing maintenance on extremely hot plasma batteries and various other machinery, causing her extra weight just melt away, the majority of Melisa\u2019s job was going from one consol to another to make sure that the whole of the ship went where it was supposed to (the stress of which didn\u2019t contribute to her lose either), leaving her total lose being three or four pounds at most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer added weight quickly began to make Melisa realize how Danielle must have felt: that she was no longer attractive in her wife\u2019s eyes, that she might not love her anymore, and just the thought of it was keeping Melisa up for weeks on end, but she was afraid to talk to Danielle about it, because it might only confirm her fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Melisa wrenched back when she heard Danielle groan and begin to shift her position in bed, stopping when she had her arms and legs wrapped around Melisa. \u201cMine\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Then again\u2026\u2019 Melisa thought as her eye lids began to grow heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, after convincing Aaron to let Melisa rest, Danielle was trying to enjoy her breakfast, but her mind kept wandering back to her wife alone in bed. Though Danielle didn\u2019t know what was troubling her, she knew something was, and hated leaving her alone when she was in pain, and while she would much rather be there to comfort her when she woke up, she still had obligations to attend to, like repairing a leaking plasma battery, then replacing the nano-field\u2019s software with an updated, and more efficient version with a much greater deflection rate, and finally, she had to repair one of the shuttle\u2019s rail guns before the option of being at Melisa\u2019s side even became an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am.\u201d Danielle\u2019s attention was brought away from her food that she had been playing with for the last ten minutes, and up to Karen\u2019s imposing figure standing over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes,\u201d She stammered out, not quite sure if she was going to be yelled at or hugged. She\u2019s always found Karen hard to read, not that anyone else had an easy time with that either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to the engineer, I will take over your responsibility\u2019s for the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle\u2019s face lit up at the offer, but dimmed back down to her dark frown when she realized that couldn\u2019t. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t ask you to do that, even if I really, really\u2026<i>really</i> want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither of us is asking, I\u2019m ordering you to go back your quarters and tend to the needs of the engineer. You wouldn\u2019t be able to accomplish any of your duties today anyways with her on your mind, so you may as well help in her recovery so the ship can operate at maximum capacity again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, aye, Commander,\u201d Danielle said, snapping off a phony salute and flashing a bight smile, before wrapping her arms around Karen in a tight hug. \u201cThank you so much, Karen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust go see your wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the Silent Sword\u2019s bridge Thomas watched the ships shields drop to zero, and the hull integrity beginning to deplete immediately after as he tried to navigate through an asteroid field. He tried desperately to keep the ship from being hit, but it was impossible to dodge them all and eventually one hit the engines, disabling them and sending the ship drifting towards a giant meteor. Though, before the ship crashed, Thomas was stuck by a different massive object, two to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYO! Gef yer foobs ow erf ma fas!\u201d Thomas muffled out, trying to push massive objects out of his face. Unfortunately, they had too much give for him to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boo, you\u2019re no fun!\u201d Natalie complained, backing up some from Thomas\u2019s pilot\u2019s seat so that her breasts were no longer smothering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas took deep breaths as he took his sim-helmet off, ending the imminent virtual danger to the virtual Silent Sword, got up from his seat, and then started yelling at Natalie when he caught his breath. \u201cYo! You could choke someone to death with those things! What if I had actually been flying the ship!? You could have killed us all with your big boobs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie laughed as she wrapped her arms around her breast and gave them as big a hug as she could; which wasn\u2019t much, and she didn\u2019t even have them wrapped around their apex! \u201cThanks for the complements. I make sure I get a lot of dairy in my diet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd silicone by the looks of them.\u201d Thomas said as he pressed his index finger into her left breast, and watched as the digit sank in until it was completely hidden from view. \u201c\u2026This just got weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she broke out of her hug with herself to place her and on her trim waist, Natalie\u2019s expression changed from giddy smile and into a devious smirk. \u201cAnd yet you haven\u2019t removed your finger yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s stuck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAy! Could you two please do\u2026whatever it is you\u2019re doing somewhere else? This is really making me sick and I\u2019d rather not have my own vomit all terminals!\u201d Amy yelled from her station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, they\u2019re all mine, so...\u201d Thomas, Amy and Natalie looked to the entry to the bridge and saw Aaron walk in, twirling his cane with right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yo, P-Pops, what-uh\u2026what the hell are you doing here?\u201d Thomas asked shakily after quickly removing his finger from Natalie\u2019s breast and hiding it along with the rest of his arm behind his back, causing the massive mammary to jiggle for a good ten seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan escaped Aaron\u2019s mouth as he sat down at one of the terminals and propped his feet up on it. \u201cI have no idea; I got bored and started wandering. Every one is busy or something and I can\u2019t work on anything until Alison comes back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell if I know, she ran off to do who knows what after my clothes got incinerated. I had just got that lab coat worn in, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy shuddered. \u201cIf I saw Pop\u2019s naked I would run the hell away, too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh c\u2019mon,\u201d Natalie said, wrapping an arm around Aaron\u2019s shoulder. \u201dHe doesn\u2019t even look old at all! The only thing that would even suggest he\u2019s old is his hair. And if sexually ignorant psychopaths are Alison\u2019s type she can\u2019t do better than him.\u201d She demonstrated by ruffling Aaron\u2019s hair with his free hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne, of course I don\u2019t look old! Two, my hair is only gray because of stress\u2026can you guess the fuck why? Three, the only thing I understand about that third thing was \u201cpsychopath\u201d, and four, remove all of your limbs and extremities from my person immediately, or I will remove them from yours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point almost every one had done a little something by now: Karen had taken on Danielle\u2019s duties while Danielle herself had gone back to her room to watch over her wife, Thomas and Natalie had sexually harassed each other, Amy had gone through Thomas\u2019s most recant logs for anything that could be used as blackmail, Aaron had managed to install a miniature plasma cannon in his cane, that when fired would move create a pressure wave that sounded like a  demon saying \u201cfuck you\u201d before he incinerated his clothes which made Alison feel the need to\u2026well\u2026she took care of that need to say the least, and Melisa had finally managed to overcome her insomnia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one who had not done anything was Intor and Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, the former <i>was</i> in charge of taking care of the latter when his mother\u2019s couldn\u2019t, but being reduced from a galactic war hero to a babysitter (a term that he was told was not literal) did not do much for the young Plock\u2019s self-esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle one, do you ever feel as though we do not matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a tiny hand Intor\u2019s nose and giving it a squeeze, Eric then replied, \u201cFyidm!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntor shook his head and sighed. \u201cDo your mothers know you swear like that\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, the ship was still moving aimlessly through space, and for once, it looks like a cycle might pass without something crazy happening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-So while Melisa sleeps, Danielle has a chance to think about what could be worrying her wife, and thinks it has something to Melisa's weight gain, and wonders if it's even that bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Until Karen's condition leaves her weak and wounded while moving crates, and most wait four months to recover before being able to work agian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-But when Aaron announces he wants to take the crew on a vacation...well, something has to go wrong then, right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Danielle arrived back at her room, she found Melisa still asleep on her side in their bed. Not wanting to disturb her much need rest, Danielle carefully suck over to Melisa\u2019s side of the bed, and sat down on the edge of the bed to watch her wife sleep. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, but I\u2019ve actually forgotten what you look like when you\u2019re asleep,\u201d She whispered. \u201cAnd it\u2019s pretty adorable\u2026I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re asleep, you\u2019d never let me live that down.\u201d Smiling to herself, Danielle got up off Melisa\u2019s side of the bed to lay down on hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Melisa started to have trouble sleeping, so did Danielle. It wouldn\u2019t be easy for anyone to get a good nights rest when someone you cared deeply for was upset, especially when they\u2019re lying right next to you. So sometimes in order to comfort both herself and Melisa, Danielle would basically drape herself over her wife. Which was never easy since neither of them could stay very still while they slept. Though, at that moment, Melisa was lying perfectly still, which meant Danielle could hold her however she liked. But she was also actually sleeping, so instead of risking waking her up in a death-grip-hug, she simply placed a hand on Melisa\u2019s stomach instead, and to her surprise, it was kind of squishy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook\u2019s like someone\u2019s getting a little chubby.\u201d She whispered again as she started to rub small circles on her wife\u2019s once flat stomach, the act reminding her of when Melisa would rub her stomach when she was pregnant. \u201cI wonder\u2026\u201d Danielle then allowed her hand to drift slightly upwards until it moved off the mound that was Melisa\u2019s stomach, and onto the mound that was her left breast. Once again Danielle\u2019s thoughts were brought back to Melisa rubbing her while she was pregnant. But after about thirty seconds of her hand mindlessly resting on the soft mass, Danielle began to guide her hand back down. Only instead of along Melisa\u2019s front, she took advantage of the fact she was sleeping on her side, and followed the curve of her wife\u2019s back down to the curve of her wife\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devious smile came to Danielle\u2019s face as she began to grope the slightly more malleable orb of flesh. Melisa definitely never did this to Danielle when she was pregnant. It was then that Danielle\u2019s thought went completely towards the time when she was pregnant. Not to when Melisa would \u201crub\u201d her, but to when she felt that her size would make her unattractive to her wife. Looking back now she couldn\u2019t believe how stupid that sounded. Then it clicked. \u2018That\u2019s probably why she\u2019s been so upset. She got a little chubby and now she\u2019s worried that I\u2019m not going to think she\u2019s attractive anymore\u2026if this is what she felt when I started complaining she must think I\u2019m a complete idiot.\u2019 Danielle thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she thought of something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God I\u2019m molesting my wife in her sleep!\u201d She said aloud as she reluctantly removed her hand from Melisa\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were talking to yourself, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle froze. \u201cUh\u2026g-good morning, babe, how\u2019d you sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty well actually,\u201d Melisa said as she sat up in bed. \u201cThough waking up was a lot better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle\u2019s checks flushed red as she too readjusted into a sitting position. \u201cHeheh, and-uh, how long ago was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, not that long...\u201d Melisa paused as she looked at her wife\u2019s expression, and then a smug smile came to her face. \u201c\u2026You know, I forgot what you look like when you\u2019re embarrassed, and it\u2019s pretty adorable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you heard that\u2026wait, does that mean you heard me say-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d Melisa apologized as she looked down at her stomach and placed her hands on it self-consciously. \u201cI promise I can lose the weight. I swear I\u2019ve been working very hard to lose it; it\u2019s just hasn\u2019t been enough, but I promise I\u2019ll work harder!\u201d Melisa was just on the brink of tears when she finished, and all over some extra weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, you don\u2019t have to kill yourself over a couple extra pounds-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this look like a couple of extra pounds, Danielle?\u201d Melisa lifted up her shirt to expose her stomach and took a hold of it with one hand and gave a tight squeeze and then a shake to demonstrate her point; and it was a point that left Danielle feeling a little tingly. \u201cIt\u2019s no where near a couple of pounds!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter swallowing hard Danielle asked, \u201cWell\u2026how much is it then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Sixty two pounds. I gained sixty two pounds in under a year\u2026and in the last three months I\u2019ve only managed to lose four at most, since I weigh about one fifty eight right now.\u201d Melisa said as a single tear started to roll down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling sensation in Danielle\u2019s stomach growing even stronger after Melisa told Danielle her weight. At least that\u2019s where she told herself that\u2019s where the feeling was coming from. \u201cHoney, that\u2019s not that much. When we got married you weighed at least ten pounds less than me, and you\u2019re a couple inches taller! So if anything it\u2019s more like forty. Besides\u2026I\u2019d rather you be a little overfed than malnourished. And the extra weight doesn\u2019t even bother me, you still look amazing! So stop worrying that your weight can change that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-do you mean all that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle smiled warmly at Melisa and gave her a tight hug. \u201cOf course I do!\u201d Danielle\u2019s hands then started to drift lower until they met with Melisa\u2019s ass. \u201cI love everything about you, Sweet Cheeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelisa gave an amused laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever stop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly when you need me to\u2026I love you, Melisa.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, too.\u201d Melisa said before returning her wife\u2019s hug.</span></div></div>",

Similarly, she had been forced to wear many cosmetics, to keep any imperfections from showing up on her face, only now she only wore what was necessary to keep bags or dark circles from forming under her eyes from the many hard hours, sometimes even days of work; like dealing with some of the companies more illegal dealings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t care how much money we\u2019ll lose, I want you to have those mines closed, and our workers and equipment out of Tollis space by the end of the month, but if you\u2019re not up to the task I can easily find someone who is, I\u2019ll check in on you Saturday to check your progress or lack there of.\u201d The hologram projection on Jennie\u2019s desk flashed out, and she sighed as she crossed out another one of her newly inherited company\u2019s many injustices; she could just feel her father rolling over in his grave at her poor business choice each time she corrected one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking the thought from her head, Jennie turned to look out the window of her home office, and observed as the systems blue sun crept its way up into the sky, watching it for a good minute before deciding that having some alcohol in her system might make the view better; it had a way of making everything feel a little better. In fact, ever since she inherited her fathers company at seventeen, she had been using alcohol to help with the stress, and two years later, still non of the servants had questioned why the liquor cabinet in what was once her fathers office was looking a little more depleted every day, when nobody could have taken anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, before she could even open the drawer she had hidden the cabinet key, she was interrupted by one of her servants. \u201cGood morning Mistress, I hope I\u2019m not intruding on anything.\u201d The servant said, bowing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, I was just enjoying the sunrise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, then may I fetch you something from the kitchen to enjoy while you watch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, something to drink would be nice, thank you. I have just finished with a long meeting that has left my throat rather dry.\u201d She lied, what she really wanted was something to buy her time while she could make a real drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight away, Mistress,\u201d The servant then gave another bow and left Jennie\u2019s office, closing the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennie let out a sigh. She didn\u2019t even need any of her servants, or her chefs, or even the groundskeepers, she could have sold the mansion she called home and let them all go, but she couldn\u2019t stand the thought of all those people left unemployed, so she kept them on, basically only taking care of each other. Yet another thought that depressed her. Jennie wished she had someone who would take care of her, one that she didn\u2019t have to pay to smile at her, but that wasn\u2019t the life she had, and she\u2019d just have to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least that\u2019s what she had convinced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you are, Mistress.\u201d The servant said, setting down a tray down on desk and snapping Jennie out of her trance. \u201cThe cooks insisted that I bring you something to eat as well, they say that they wish you would have them cook for you more often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennie looked down at the tray that was loaded with breakfast foods, along with two tall glasses; one filled with a blue liquid, and the other one was filled with water and had a single a rose in it. \u201cWell, give them my apologies; I\u2019ve not had much of an appetite lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as you\u2019re healthy and are not wasting away, Mistress, that\u2019s all that matters. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?\u201d The servant asked, giving Jennie a smile, which she had to admit, was one of the best fakes she\u2019d ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that will be all; you can come back in ten minute\u2019s to collect the tray I\u2019ll be done by then. I also might retire to my room soon; I have been up for a few days now after all.\u201d Jennie said, trying to justify her tiredness to herself more than to the servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand, enjoy your meal, Mistress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d Jennie called out just as the servant began to leave. \u201cCould you\u2026please not call me Mistress anymore?\u201d She asked, hoping that just one person would use her name, a name she\u2019s never heard anyone use in her whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you rather I call you Ms. Tyler instead? Would that be better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if that was her family\u2019s name, it wasn\u2019t her name, and she\u2019d rather be just a title than the family name. \u201c\u2026Yes\u2026yes it would.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t ask to be called that after asking not to, she\u2019d look like a fool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, Jennie tucked herself into her bed, pulling the blanket up to her chest. She ate as much as she could of her breakfast, but about a quarter of the way through she was starting to not feel hungry and stopped, just as she had been taught. When she got comfortable she closed her eyes tight, and tried to fight to hold back her lonely tears as she wept silently, so she would not concern any passing servants or housekeepers with her sobs, eventually falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dreamt the same dream she had been dreaming for as long as she could remember. She was alone, in darkness, curled up in the fetal position and in intense physical, mental and emotional pain; afraid that the rest of her life was going to be like this, and so far, it looked like it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, the dream ended as she was woken up, opening her eyes, she saw the one who saved from her nightmare. \u201cGood morning\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Mist-I mean\u2026Ms. Tyler, did you sleep well?\u201d The one who saved her from the nightmare is a maid named Marie, the one who served her breakfast the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Ms. Tyler, I hope you slept well.\u201d Her butler Rodger has woken her up, and he\u2019s brought her another tray of food for breakfast. (Meaning Marie didn\u2019t.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...it's time to rise and shine.\" A sizable portion of the staff has come to check up on her; they've been so worried about her lately!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Edit: I made a mistake involving a character in this, and in another storyline, but they're gone now.)</span></div></div>",

He was wearing the same suit he always did, comprise of a white undershirt, a red tie, white gloves, a black jacket and black pants, with several white arrows crisscrossed all over his the jacket and pants with no pattern to see what so ever. His hair was styled in the same strange way, while most of it was short and black, there was also a long strand of white hair framing either side of his face, the left one being much thinner and reaching his shoulder, and the right one only came down to his chin, and was much thicker. \u201cDon\u2019t you all agree?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Not really\u2026it\u2019s\u2026so boring. Normally we\u2019re in some kind of mortal danger, but this\u2026it so boring and calm.\u201d Shoji complained, a gentle breeze blowing by, as if nature itself was trying to agree with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxus had brought his Wonder Walkers to a forest of blue trees on an alien planet, with no intelligent life, only a few, harmless mammals, and even to someone normal, it was painfully boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the brightest smile imaginable, Maxus whirled around to face his fellow Time Walkers. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s so amazing, when does this ever happen to us? We\u2019ve all been exposed to so much crazy, that it\u2019s become normal. And now that I\u2019m showing you something normal, you think its crazy! I need to slow you all down so I can start suppressing you again! I mean really what\u2019s the point of being so\u2026so\u2026awetastic if there\u2019s no one to ooo and aw at me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora smirked. \u201cAwetastic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES, because I\u2019m so awesome and fantastic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re something alright.\u201d Alec grumbled. His voice was raspy and cool, quite fitting of his cool-cowboy appearance, especially as he was leaning up against a blue tree with a plant that resembled a blue piece of hay hanging out of his mouth, and his stenson titled to cover part of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and like you\u2019re not a piece work yourself Mr. Cool? You look ridicules with thing in you mouth and that thing on your head!\u201d Maxus said as he walked over to Alec. He then took the plant out of Alec\u2019s mouth as well as his hat of his head, and placed them in their respective places on his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you think you can pull it off, even in that suit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxus laughed and tossed his left white lock. \u201cOf course I can! Because on top of being awetastic, I\u2019m also fablicious and coosome; that\u2019s fabulous plus delicious, and cool plus handsome!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLucy always got a kick out of Maxus when he acted like that, and it was even more enjoyable when she mocked him for it. \u201cYou are the single most flamboyant man I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d Though, her mocking doesn\u2019t typically work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShowy and dashing in a self-satisfied way, brightly colored and striking, elaborate or richly decorated, unrestrained by prevailing standards of propriety; I AM THE VERY DEFINITION OF FLAMBOYANT!!!\u201d Maxus proclaimed with way to much enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely ignoring Maxus\u2019s display, Olivia wondered what exactly Maxus had planed for their \u201cVacation of Normality\u201d as Maxus had called it. She was probably the only one who enjoyed the idea. She really did love the adventures they went on, but at a certain point they could get overwhelming. The planet that he had brought them to was nice, but she was hoping for more of a resort type vacation, or maybe an island get away, or really anywhere that she could relax by the water, and maybe finally make a move on that special someone. Eventually, Olivia got tiered of wondering and just asked, \u201cSo what do you have in store for us Maxus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked!\u201d Maxus said with a smile as he took a rolled list out from his pocket and let it come undone, and watched as the impossibly long list rolled out onto and across the blue dirt. \u201cI\u2019ve planed out a string of stops on the best vacation spots in the whole of the universe; from the most posh resorts, to the most exotic of tropical planets, and so much more! I'll even let and each of you choose your own special mini-vacation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the back of the group, Victoria\u2019s face flushed red and she stepped forward a bit. \u201cO-on the mini-vacation\u2019s\u2026will we still be together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, but don\u2019t let that influence your choice, you can pick what ever you want, and I'll force every one tho participate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026well\u2026I want\u2026to go somewhere um\u2026roman-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t choose yet! We haven\u2019t finished our last adventure before we take a break! And after that we still need to do a few of the things I planed, then you can choose; hopefully by then, even the Colossal Cyan Chilipoda will scare you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora glared at Maxus, using her what-the-hell-did-you-do-now face. \u201c\u2026What the hell is a Colossal Cyan Chilipoda?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo put it simply, it\u2019s a giant blue centipede!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWW!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral weeks later, after defeating a mile long monster, Maxus had taken his Wonder Walkers to their first stop at\u2026</span></div></div>",

Oh, and in case you haven't guessed, this is a like a super fan fiction sorta thing, where you go from fictional world to fictional world, doing whatever you want to the women in them, and is a first person piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEons of Powers- This story focuses on a a team of superheros know as Fate's Advanced Team, who work to save Earth from danger throughout all of its history, and serve under the goddess of time known as Fate. They live on a world that exist out side of time, along with millions of others who have been removed from times main flow, and are even immortal like them, but their powers are to weak to be place on a teams, and simply live their lives as they would on Earth, only without end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir are twelve main characters in this story with a possibility for even more, so to give you a taste of their wide and varied personalities, here are the four most recent additions to the team's bio's, as well as a veteran, with even more inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Unknown.<br>\r\nNickname: Daydream (or just Day).<br>\r\nFrom: Unknown.<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20199\u201d.<br>\r\nWeight: 120lbs.<br>\r\nHair color: Strawberry blond.<br>\r\nHairstyle: Long.<br>\r\nIris color: Gray.<br>\r\nPower(s): Dream Manipulation.<br>\r\nPersonality and other info: Not much is known about Day\u2019s past; only that she loves her sleep and can be easily aggravated when she doesn\u2019t get it. Day is a great warrior as well, and loves the satisfaction of being a hero of time, but that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t enjoy taking a break every once in a while. (Day is the primary character of the story and it will mostly follow her.)<br>\r\nClothing: Normally something pulled out of a dream.<br>\r\nLove life: Love is the farthest thing on Day\u2019s mind, but in that farthest recess of her mind, she wishes she could have a nice, attractive and loving woman she could spend immortality with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Giovanni Lombardo.<br>\r\nNickname: None.<br>\r\nFrom: 15th century Italy.<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u201911\u201d.<br>\r\nWeight: 113lbs.<br>\r\nHair color: Blond.<br>\r\nHairstyle: Regular cut.<br>\r\nIris color: Blue.<br>\r\nPower(s): Innate Capability, Energy Blast, Temporary Power Mimicry.<br>\r\nPersonality and other info: Giovanni is a close personal friend and former apprentice of Leonardo Da Vinci, who somehow retained his memory of him after he was lifted. Giovanni is just about the nicest man you could ever meet. He is always helping people, always supportive, understanding, and kind, and he never stops smiling, some might even wonder if he can feel negative emotions. <br>\r\nClothing: He always wears something in baby blue because it has a calming effect on people.<br>\r\nLove life: Giovanni always puts the happiness of others before his own, it would be nice if someone did the same for him, or at least thanked him for once, but he doesn\u2019t mind if they don\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Imiri.<br>\r\nNickname: None.<br>\r\nFrom: Scythia during the Trojan War.<br>\r\nHeight: 6\u20199\u201d.<br>\r\nWeight: 137lbs.<br>\r\nHair color: Red.<br>\r\nHairstyle: Long hair.<br>\r\nIris color: Green.<br>\r\nPower(s): Empathy, Energy Blast, Shielding, Healing Factor, Invisibility.<br>\r\nPersonality and other info: Imiri may look like just another Amazon, but she is different. She has never been strong-willed, or a warrior, but a timid and shy woman, and she got worse when she was lifted. The team she worked with before joining Fate\u2019s Advanced Team abused her, they used her as a meat-shield when she ran out of energy to make barriers, forced her to use her own life energy to heal them, beat her whenever she didn\u2019t do what they said, and sexually harassed her. She had nearly died several times before Fate finally moved her to the Advanced Team, and now she\u2019s very weary of the people she\u2019s around, using her Empathy 24/7 to make sure she isn\u2019t the subject of any angry feelings, and disconnecting herself from most of her own.<br>\r\nClothing: Imiri has a beautiful face, a shapely body and massive double E breast that she hides beneath baggy hooded clothes so she can hide her body and face.<br>\r\nLove life: Despite her best efforts to keep herself from feeling like this, Imiri quickly developed a crush on a few members of the team, but won\u2019t say who, only that one acts sweet but a little weird and another one is really loud and scares her\u2026which doesn\u2019t really narrow it down much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Laura Tucker.<br>\r\nNickname: None.<br>\r\nFrom: 23nd century America.<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20195\u201d.<br>\r\nWeight: 128lbs. <br>\r\nHair color: Brown.<br>\r\nHairstyle: Pixie cut.<br>\r\nIris color: Brown.<br>\r\nPower(s): Area Detonation, Object Detonation, Self Detonation and Reforming.<br>\r\nPersonal: Laura was an Army Second Lieutenant before she was lifted, and it\u2019s a wonder how she obtained such a high rank, as she has always been a rather mean and sarcastic person with a short temper, and it only got worse when she was lifted, eventually shutting almost every one out\u2026and uses her ability to blow anything up to scare away anyone who get\u2019s too close.<br>\r\nClothing: Underneath all of her clothes Laura wears an extremely thin yet durable jumpsuit like armor known as bio-suit that adapt to any situation, and changes color from red to green when it activates.<br>\r\nLove life: While Laura is very attractive, she is also mean, loud, sarcastic and rude, with a strong likelihood of blasting anyone to bits if they so much look at her the wrong way\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Lang Fang.<br>\r\nNickname: Storm Dragon.<br>\r\nFrom: Second century China.<br>\r\nHeight: 4\u20197\u201d.<br>\r\nWeight: 95lbs.<br>\r\nHair color: Blond.<br>\r\nHairstyle: Shag cut.<br>\r\nIris color: Blue.<br>\r\nPower(s): Energy Manipulation, Transformation (Storm Dragon form), Wind Manipulation.<br>\r\nPersonality and other info: Lang is one of the stranger members of Fate\u2019s Advanced Team. She is obsessed with food and is always eating in her free time, calming that she needs the calories to sustain her dragon form, even though her body and its aren\u2019t connected, though she never seems to gain any weight so she must be burning it somehow. In fact, it doesn\u2019t seem like she has an ounce of fat on her, leaving her with a very flat body. Lang is very sensitive about her height and will beat down anyone who insults her about it, and perhaps her strangest habit is leaving out spoiled milk for a man who saved her life every Saturday night...but it is gone every Sunday morning...<br>\r\nClothing: Lang's friend and team mate Sayuri is her role model and she tries to emulate her in anyway she can, including how she dresses, only wearing \u2018modern clothes\u2019 like her favorite green jacket and gray skirt.<br>\r\nLove life: Lang is a sweet girl but very immature, and a romantic relationship with anything other than food may be beyond her comprehension, whether it\u2019s with a boy or a girl won\u2019t make the concept any less confusing, though, she is rather possessive of Sayuri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, pick the story you want!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Empty slot choices will be changed to the name of the story when updated, but the story should have its summery inside, that way the right person gets the credit for the idea.)</span></div></div>",

Since food was never readily available for her, she often just stuffs her face when she sees food, and burns it off immediately after\u2026she isn\u2019t allowed to eat with the rest of the team, but despite strangeness she is still number four on the power chart.<br>\r\nClothing: She doesn\u2019t really have a style when it comes to clothing, normally just putting on the first thing she grabs\u2026when she decides to wear any at all.<br>\r\nLove life: Kitty has never shown any sign of sexual desire for anyone before, though she does enjoy it when someone scratches her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Sayuri Hattori.<br>\r\nNickname: Shadow Kunoichi.<br>\r\nFrom: Feudal era Japan.<br>\r\nHeight: 6\u20192\u201d.<br>\r\nWeight: 115lbs.<br>\r\nHair color: Black.<br>\r\nHairstyle: Odango.<br>\r\nIris color: Blue.<br>\r\nPower(s): Invisibility, Kuji-kiri (powers triggered by combinations of hand seals), Shadow Manipulation, Teleportation.<br>\r\nPersonal: Sayuri and the teams strongest member came from the same time and were, and still are in some sense, mortal enemies, each responsible for the deaths of dozens of the others subordinates, but is a far cry from having the same level of power. Unlike most women, Sayuri hates having large breast, she finds that there size keeps her from moving as quiet or as fast as she would without them, so she wraps them in bandages to minimize the size\u2026it doesn\u2019t help much, but for their safety no-one brings them up.<br>\r\nClothing: Sayuri is very fond of darker colors when it comes to what she wears, whether it is her \u2018modern\u2019 clothes or the black shinobi shozoku that she wears in combat.<br>\r\nLove life: What time she doesn\u2019t spend training or on missions, she spends aggravating the teams strongest member\u2026or eating whatever wonderful chocolate confection her best friend has made for her, but she could probably squeeze time with a lover into her schedule if she had one\u2026she probably wouldn\u2019t but she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Kami-sama.<br>\r\nTitle: Shogun Kami.<br>\r\nFrom: Feudal era Japan.<br>\r\nHeight: 6\u20196\u201d.<br>\r\nWeight: 140lbs.<br>\r\nHair color: Gray.<br>\r\nHairstyle: A giant mess.<br>\r\nIris color: Whole eye is black.<br>\r\nPower(s): Light Manipulation, Superhuman Reflexes, Telepathy, Transformation (Demon God form).<br>\r\nPersonal: Shortly after being lifted, Kami-sama fell into a timeless void, and was trapped there for thousands of years and changed him drastically. It took his eyesight, but gave him his power of Light Manipulation and turned almost every part of his body gray aside from eyes, which were turned jet-black\u2026as well as drove him close to insanity. Thankfully though, Kami\u2019s telepathy allows him to see through others eyes, and dive into the deepest parts of their minds, allowing him to be able to see what both his allies and enemies are seeing and thinking, and is an even greater fighter than when he could see. He has also lost all sense of humility, and is now very arrogant. He believes himself to be the best fighter on the team--which he is--as well as the smartest and wisest member, with power that rivals a god. His largest display of arrogance is that he not only refers to himself as God, but he also attaches sama to the end of it when talking about himself. He also uses Japanese honorifics when addressing others as well, with the sole exception of Sayuri, his (im)mortal enemy.<br>\r\nClothing: The thing he wears the most is his gray Tosei-gusoku armor, but when he isn\u2019t he often wears a gray hakama. He also always has a pair of earphones on, so that he can listen to his favorite music at any time.<br>\r\nLove life: I did mention he\u2019s blind and extremely arrogant, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Something.<br>\r\nNickname: Snow White.<br>\r\nFrom: Some where and some when.<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u201911\u201d.<br>\r\nWeight: 118lbs.<br>\r\nHair color: White.<br>\r\nHairstyle: Long hair.<br>\r\nIris color: Whole eye is white.<br>\r\nPower(s): Ice and Heat Manipulation, Short Sight.<br>\r\nPersonal: Like Kami, Snow fell into a timeless void, gaining the ability to see certain future events several minutes before they happen, but took her ability to speak, of course it also drained her of color like Kami, but that\u2019s less important. Despite her inability to speak Snow has a smug air and a silent cockiness about her, as well as retaining her ability to express every emotion imaginable, though, sometimes she \u2018asks\u2019 Kami to read her mind and speak for her, and in return she acts as his eyes. Over all, Snow is the second strongest behind Kami, but even then there's a massive gap in power.<br>\r\nClothing: Snow only ever wears frilly white dresses.<br>\r\nLove life: She can\u2019t talk but it\u2019s still very clear what she\u2019s feeling, like when she\u2019s flustered, or flattered, or pleased when someone special is around\u2026or sorry\u2026she goes overboard on that one...and she\u2019s never discriminated her emotional body language to just on gender before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Forgotten.<br>\r\nNickname: Casanova.<br>\r\nFrom: Forgotten.<br>\r\nHeight: 6\u20197\u201d.<br>\r\nWeight: 132lbs. <br>\r\nHair color: Green.<br>\r\nHairstyle: Curtained hair.<br>\r\nIris color: Green.<br>\r\nPower(s): Plant Manipulation.<br>\r\nPersonal: Casanova is a Casanova, though, none of the women on the team seem to mind, and they always accept the roses he literally grows by hand, though, he has never slept with any of them, much to some of their dismay. On the team, Casanova ranks number five on the power chart, and often goes on missions alone, so that he doesn\u2019t \u201cendanger his precious roses\u201d.<br>\r\nClothing: Casanova only wears green suits made from his own special kind of cotton, and when questioned why he always says that his skin \"can only enjoy the softest of materials\" and \"that only something akin to a woman\u2019s touch will do\".<br>\r\nLove life: The definition of Casanova is: a charming seducer of women who moves quickly from one casual relationship to another or who constantly pesters women in his pursuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Fairly Young.<br>\r\nNickname: Half Knight (and Kid).<br>\r\nFrom: 21st century Britain.<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20199\u201d.<br>\r\nWeight: 117lbs.<br>\r\nHair color: Black.<br>\r\nHairstyle: Regular cut.<br>\r\nIris color: Brown.<br>\r\nPower(s): Energy Blast, Superhuman Endurance, Superhuman Strength.<br>\r\nPersonal: Fairly is nice, but some times his extreme paranoia and self-esteem issues get in the way of that. He never does anything alone to make sure nothing bad happens to just him, and he won\u2019t eat or drink anything that hasn\u2019t been sampled by someone else first, those duties and more are normally covered by Fairly\u2019 best and maybe his only friend: Frank Bastard. <br>\r\nClothing: Fairly has always viewed himself as painfully plain, and often dresses to stand out, even his knight armor is the extremely strange colors of blue and red.<br>\r\nLove life: Fairly isn\u2019t quick to trust he\u2019ll keep his distance at first, but when he feels he can trust someone he\u2019ll slowly, and literally, inch closer to them. He was married before he was lifted, but she left him and now he loses it when he sees strong displays of affection\u2026or when he\u2019s called plain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Frank Bastard. (Pronounced Bu-star\u2026just so we\u2019re clear.)<br>\r\nNickname: Dark Assassin.<br>\r\nFrom: 21st century France.<br>\r\nHeight: 6\u20194\u201d.<br>\r\nWeight: 118lbs.<br>\r\nHair color: Blond.<br>\r\nHairstyle: Fuaxhawk.<br>\r\nIris color: Grey.<br>\r\nPower(s): Energy Blast, Invisibility, Superhuman Agility, Superhuman Speed.<br>\r\nPersonal: Frank isn\u2019t a very pleasant person. He enjoys making problems where there aren\u2019t any, making rude jokes, and just being an over all unpleasant person. The only person that Frank is nice to is Fairly. Like Fairly, Frank has no connection to warriors of the past, only taking their personas based on their powers and equipping themselves with armor and weapons to go with them, though before being lifted Frank did love to sneak up on people.<br>\r\nClothing: Unlike Fairly, Frank wears clothes that allow him to blend in, and as for armor, he hides heavy metal plates under his clothes at all times.<br>\r\nLove life: Frank is like Casanova\u2026only much more lewd, blunt and sexual when it comes to picking up women, and seeing how he\u2019s hit on all the other women on the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Isabel Johnston.<br>\r\nNickname: Gung-ho Gunslinger.<br>\r\nFrom: 17th century America.<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20197\u201d.<br>\r\nWeight: 113lbs. <br>\r\nHair color: Brown.<br>\r\nHairstyle: French braid.<br>\r\nIris color: Blue.<br>\r\nPower(s): Fire and Heat Manipulation. <br>\r\nPersonal: Unlike Casanova and Frank, Isabel doesn\u2019t discriminate the people she hits on based on their gender, just on whether or not they scare her, like Snow and Kami\u2026and Fairly\u2026he doesn\u2019t scare her he just\u2026no. She also has an odd and sometimes mean sense of humor and a short temper.<br>\r\nClothing: She always wears a stenson hat, a cyan blouse, red handkerchief, blue jeans, vest, tan chaps that are the same color as her hat and vest, and brown boots with gold spurs\u2026except when she just wears a hat, unbuttoned vest, chaps and boots.<br>\r\nLove life: It isn\u2019t all too hard to get somewhere with Isabel, but in a very sex based relationship with a woman who can breathe fire at the most devastating moment, it\u2019s best to stay on her good side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's every one, now let's get started already! But where should we start?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>How about a mad scientist project that involves female test subjects that contain supernatural powers that are contagious called awakeners. The awakeners seek out a compatible \"mate\" to share her powers with. One \"mate\" can have multiple awakeners so he or she can obtain multiple powers and display a wide range of unique powers and benefits. Awakeners develop a strong attachment to their mate and strongly care for their mate and are willing to do anything for him. Awakeners are all females who look in their late teens whose genetics were designed from the most beautiful female traits. There hair and eye colors range from normal (blonde, red, etc.) to unnatural colors such as blue hair, purple eyes, eyes that are different colors, etc. Prior to finding a mate a awakener is very skinny, like bones wrapped in skin, but once she finds a mate she grows luscious curves and as you develop yours powers she grows fatter. A mate could also increase his power by fattening his awakener which can be done through a growing relationship or old fashioned feeding. The fatter an awakener is the stronger her and your power becomes. So a mate with a harem of obese awakeners is very powerful.<br>\r\nThere are an unknown number of awakeners but there are at least 200 in the city. In an attempt to subdue the project, the scientist created sleepers to try and destroy awakeners and their mates. Sleepers are faceless humanoid bodies that are pale purple with super strength. The mates decide to seek out other mates and can either befriend each other or fight each other. If a mate kills another mate the victor claims the vanquished's awakeners. The scientists plans on killing the mates and capturing the awakeners for experimentation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He rushed over to an extremely skinny girl wearing a hospital gown who fell into some trash cans. The girl was very pretty but particularly odd looking. Her hair was blue and her eyes were yellow and she was also freakishly skinny. She grabs Lucas and beseeches him to help her and asks a slightly odd favor. \"Help me  get away, I sense your potential and feel you to be compatible with me, take me somewhere safe, feed me and be my mate. Hurry before they find me, I'm too thin to give you strength to fight.\" the blue haired girl pleaded. \"Uh sure\" Lucas replied picking her up and running. As Lucas held the girl he felt very strong and ran faster than he ever had nor did he feel any fatigue.  <br>\r\n    Lucas took the girl to his apartment \"Here we are\" said Lucas. \"Thank you mate\" the blue haired girl said \"Do you have anything to eat I must gain.\" the girl asked \"Yeah theres the kitchen help yourself. Take as much as you want you look like you're starving.\" said Lucas. The girl opened up the fridge and grabbed leftover pizza and sticks of butter and began devouring them  \"mmmph nomph, do you have any more food this is not nearly enough to get fat on.\" the girl said licking butter off her lips and fingers. \"What you're trying to get fat and why do you keep calling me mate?\"Lucas asked bewildered. \"Oh okay i'll explain everything. You see I'm an awakener of strength. through my fat deposits I can spiritually transfer superhuman strength to you, my mate. I am actually apart of an experiment but the scientist was abusive so we all left.\" \"We?\"Lucas asked. \"Yes me and hundreds of other girls. We are all gifted with the ability to enhance people who we feel a connection with our mates. We need to find them and get them to join us the more girls you have serving you and the fatter you get them, the more power you'll have.  The closer you and me become the more weight I can create and with the more fat deposits the more power I can unleash in you. If our relationship becomes really close eating a stalk of celery will have the effects of a slice of cheesecake. Even though I'm skinny now I can only give you a slight increase in strength, but I'll need to fatten up to really get you strong so you can protect me and the other girls from sleepers which are monsters the scientists created after we all escaped to hunt us down. Now then... got anymore food and a bath with some new clothes would be great. \"Yeah you go take a bath and help yourself to my pantry while I'll go get some more food. Oh and what do I call you?\" Lucas asked. The girl responded \"Zana.\"<br>\r\n    Lucas returned with bags of fastfood and butter with a bikini top and and pair of shorts. \"Zana, I'm Back!\" Lucas shouted. \"Yay masters back!\" Zana gleefully said as she dried her blue hair with a towel and ran up to Lucas and gave him a hug. Zana's figure clearly had gained weight and assumed a more curvy figure. \"Oh what do we have here (sniff) mmm smells good.\" Zana said reaching in a grabbing the food. \"Yeah I told the employees that I was picking up food for a party, not that they would've believed it was for one girl who was devoted to fattening herself up while I got stronger from it.\" Lucas said.  Lucas looked at the girl who looked back at him with a cute smile.\"She sure is cute\" Lucas thought. After her feast they went to sleep together. In the morning Zana clearly gained weight her boobs were huge with a belly which slightly hung over her shorts and her butt was noticeably wider than the previous night. \"Come on Lets go out and get you some food.\" Lucas said as he held her hand. \"Yay\" Zana said as she grabbedLucas's arm wearing her bikini top and shorts \"And maybe some new clothes I don't think this will last too long.\" Zana said.  <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

People were staring not just because of a bluehaired girl but because of her skimpy little outfit on her growing body. Zana helped herself to every free sample as Lucas loaded up the cart with high calorie food from bacon to butter to cakes to beer for her beer gut. As they left the store they noticed a skinny purple haired girl sitting in a fetal position wearing a torn white dress who couldn't have weighed more than 80 pounds. \"Hey you okay\"Lucas asked while Zana helped herself to a stick of butter. The purple haired girl saw the butter and asked for some. Lucas took out a stick a gave it to her \"Say you wouldn't happen to be an awakener.?\" Lucas asked. The girl's purple eyes lit up and she   pleaded to join Lucas and fatten up alongside Zana. Zana's face lit up with enthusiasm and she pleaded\" Please please let her join us we can get fat together and we can all have so much fun.\" \"Yeah sure come with us.\"Lucas said. \"I'm Eva and I give your body the ability to self heal.\" the purple eye and haired girl said as she sucked on her butter meanwhile eyeing Zana's bouncing flab with envy.<br>\r\n    Suddenly a faceless grey man ran towards Lucas and the girls. Lucas than punched the creature \"Ekk its a sleeper!\" screamed Eva. Lucas with his increased strength due to Zana's recently formed fat, pummeled the sleeper into defeat. Lucas was bruised up but was slowly healing. \"Here eat up Eva\" Lucas said grabbing another stick of butter and feeding Eva with it, causing Lucas to heal faster. \"So that was a sleeper huh, looks like things WILL get interesting.\"     </span></div></div>",

The girls dive in to the buffet filling up their plates with piles of soon to be girl fat. Zana had developed some nice fat on her body which increased Lucas's strength, her boobs were really growing and putting a real strain on her bikini top. Eva had developed some pudge on her frame since the parking lot but now feasting on the buffet food was starting to fill out, Lucas will heal much faster now. As the girls ate Lucas overheard two girls in highschool outfits, one was a blonde highschool girl who was feeding bacon to a pink pigtailed haired pink eyed friend \"eat up Ceros You're gonna have to eat everything I feed you, understand?\" said the blonde. \"mmmph mmm yes my lady it will be a pleasure to grow for you.\" said the pink haired girl. Lucas walked up to the girls \"Let me guess an awakener?\" The blonde haired girl looked into your eyes and said \"Yes it is Lucas\" \"Wait how did you..\" Lucas asked. \"Thanks to Cero here I can telepathically communicate with other people and as a mate you can guess that the fatter Cero gets the farther range I can communicate.\" The blonde mentally said to Lucas. \"I'm Gwen by the way.\" Gwen then read Lucas's history of Zana and Eva and transmitted her history of Cero to him. Gwen found a very malnourished Cero in a bra and panties under a tree at the park. Cero telepathically communicated her story to Gwen and Gwen took her home dressed her in a highschool outfit and brought her here. Lucas waved over Zana and Eva who had gained quite a bit. Zana waddled with a fat arm covering her boobs since their massive growth snapped her top off several pounds ago, and with another arm holding a huge ice cream cone with some of it smeared on her face. Her belly, ridden with stretch marks, now hung well over her shorts which from behind now looked like a thong. Eva had fattened up nicely the purplehaired girl had melon tits a bulging belly and plump buttocks swaying with her step with jiggling limbs. Eva's dress already ripped was now barely covering her being held together by a few tenuous strains. Eva had a huge turkey leg she was feeding on. Cero gazed upon the mass of fat that Zana and Eva had accumulated and attained an invigourated determination to balloon up.<br>\r\n   RIPPPP! Eva's dress suddenly ripped to shreds leaving a fat naked eating woman standing in the middle of a restaurant. Lucas than grabbed a table cloth to cover Eva and lifted both his fat wobbling awakeners and proceeded to leave. \"Hey Gwen stay in touch and fatten Cero so you can reach me from anywhere in the city. \"will do\" Gwen said waving while Cero was face deep in a pasta improving Gwen's telepathy. Lucas than ran through the streets effortlesslly carrying his obese girls back to his apartment. They arrive back at Lucas's apartment. Zana ad Eva's clothes were now too small for them leaving them naked. \"Master what are we gonna do\"\"Shall we feast here now?\" the girls asked. Lucas responded by Saying \"I'll go into town and get some clothes, food, and maybe another awakener.\" .  </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This really should go with out saying but, here it is anyways: This is an FA (fat admirer) piece for the men and women who are lovers of large ladies. If any part of that doesn\u2019t appeal to you, whatever, just find something that does, no one is making you read this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHooray, it\u2019s my birthday (when I post this that is)! I\u2019ve been working on this for a while, and I was hoping on having more done but I have an excuse that you don\u2019t really care about. Anyways, Inside this story you will find all kinds of stories of fantasy and sci-fi weight gain as well as ones that are sort of both (though there aren\u2019t many of those yet), and you are welcome to add even more stories and add to existing ones, so long as you follow the rules that I put in no specific order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No male weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No female weight loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Death is...complicated. I'd prefer it if only non-main characters die, but if you really want to kill someone important, ask me first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No blueberry, inflation etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. No vore of any kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. The characters can only eat what is considered food, no terrain, furniture etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. No toilet stuff, scat, slob or the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Sound science and theoretical should be used the most often, but if you really want to do something that isn't feel free, just make sure you make it sound legit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. No endings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Sex is fine but don't go too far into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. Inter-species breeding is only allowed for intelligent species, no sex with alien dogs or whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. Magic and science can only be used for weight gain if it is to speed it up, no instant growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. Gaining on purpose is okay, just give a legitimate reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n14. Keep in mind this is a weight gain story, so while the occasional break from it is okay as long as it still somehow contributes to the story and doesn\u2019t last to long. I.e. someone plotting something, proclamation of love that doesn\u2019t involve weight gain or fat (yet), something awesome and hero-y, death (keep rule three in mind though), etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15. No having the characters acting too OOC, but adding new layers to a character is fine as long as you aren't completely rewriting who they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n16. Make sure that any chapters you post can be read clearly by others, and are a good size, if they aren\u2019t, they will be deleted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't think of anything else right now...but I might add more rules if I think of one or need to. If you break a rule I will have no choice but to remove/edit the chapter. If you see a chapter with a broken rule or is to short or has can not be read and should be deleted but hasn't yet, don't add to it, I might have to delete that one, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, go enjoy the story\u2026unless you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t like sort of thing and still haven\u2019t left. In that case\u2026really, why are you still here? LEAVE!</td>",
