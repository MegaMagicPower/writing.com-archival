Would you like to follow some original characters as they explore the world of Pokemon, and maybe run into faces from the games and show that we already know (along with them gaining weight along the way of course)? Or would you like to follow those faces from the beginning? Maybe you would like to see some anhtro/furry Pokemon (which are Pokemon that resemble Humans) gain weight? Perhaps you'd like the revers of that, Moemon (which are Humans that have the characteristics of Pokemon)? How about playing as a character (if that sounds good just pick the chapter that corresponds), but if none of those sound good feel free to add options of your own!</span></div></div>",

It's one in the after noon,\" Kate shouted. \"You missed breakfast and lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have seen it, she prepared them both perfectly, I almost regret eating it!\" Added Neven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk patted her stomach. \"I know I don't regret it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I was so excited I couldn't sleep last night.\" Cole apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been saying that all week, but you still haven't told us why you're so excited, or where we're going on that stupid boat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, well since we'll be leaving soon I should tell you. We are...\" Cole paused while he struck a heroic pose. \"Going legendary hunting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And?\" Kate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're not even surprised?!\" Cole asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that hunting legendarys isn't normally exciting but, when you do it as much as we do And fail...it loses it's edge.\" Neven said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but this time we have a lead! I've heard from a very reliable source, that there is a temple near Snowpoint city that is said to be home to a legendary Pokemon that created three other legendary Pokemon. One of rock, one of steal, and. One. Of. Ice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk let out a sigh. \"Oh Arceus, not this again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeven nodded his head. \"Hmm, I've heard of that Pokemon before, it is called Regigigas, and the three Pokemon it created are Regice, Regirock and Registeel. I would actually like to see Regigigas. I'm not a fan of Regirock but Regice and Registeel are two finely crafted Pokemon, so the one who made it must have a high level of perfectosity itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Neven finished, his Deino popped out of its pokeball to protest. \"Deino, Deino, Deino!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but nowhere near what your perfectosity will be when you evolve into Hydreigon,\" Neven said as he fished for Dieno's Pokeball in his bag. \"Now return.\" A red light came out of Deino's specially made pokeball and it was pulled inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, Neven is using that stupid made up word...again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh-hm, as I was saying, we are going to Snowpoint city to look for clues as to where I can find Regice, and I figured that since we're there-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go.\" Dusk moaned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could visit my beautiful Candice! It's been so long since I've seen her, did I ever tell you guy's how I met her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, like a million times, and frankly I'm sick of hearing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying to evolve my Eevee into a Glaceon when I slipped on some ice and knocked myself out. If she hadn't come along and saved me I would have frozen to death! Though that would have been a cool way to go, I'm glad I met her instead, Arceus I love her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, for such a 'cool guy' you sure do like to gush over your girlfriend a lot.\" Dusk pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Weav,\" Cole's Weavile cried with a quizzical look on its face. \"Weav, Weav Weav! Weav Weav Weav, Weav Weav, Weav!\" When Weavile finished defending its trainers honor, it crossed its arm and closed its eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks bro,\" Cole said as he bent down to Weavile's level and put up his hand. \"High five!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WEAV!\" He shouted before slapping Cole's hand, and its claws sunk into Cole's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaah! Kate! I need Chansey to...Kate?\" Cole looked up from his bleeding hand and saw that Kate was no long there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, she wandered off, again!\" Dusk yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk, Neven and Cole all began to look around the city for Kate, but after five minutes, much to Cole's protest, they took him to the Pokemon center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until after Cole was admitted that the others found Kate in the cafeteria. \"Mph, ffey ffuy's,\" She asked through a mouth full of food. \"*Gulp*, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cole tried to high five Weavile again, nurse Joy said she should have him patched up in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...he needs to start fist bumping, it's much cooler And he wouldn't get hurt as much.\" Kate said before taking another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thirty minutes Cole walked into the cafeteria and spotted the others. Neven was praising his Deino, Kate was loading her plate up with more food, and Dusk was waiting patiently.</span></div></div>",

How much do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four thousand, do you think Kate has that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, when I organized her purse I didn't check to she how much money she had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why were you-never-mind, let's just ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole, Dusk an Neven walked over to the table that Kate had just set her food on and sat down with her. \"Hey guy's, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm short by four thousand for the rooms on the ship, do you have that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I spent the rest of my money on my food here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate this is your third serving, don't you think you've had enough?\" Dusk asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they have a lot of good food her, and as chef it is my duty to test it so that I can understand why it taste so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it then, it's going to take weeks for me to earn that much...wait a minute, Candice!\" Cole shot up from his seat and ran to find a phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time, I was going to say something if he didn't ask soon.\" Dusk said with her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...hi Candice! Um, listen, I wanted to surprise you but, I'm coming to visit you...yeah I'm excited, too, but, listen I don't have enough money anymore. So-what happened? Um, I tried to high five Weavile...yeah, again...yes I know I'm an idiot. Anyways, my friend's offered to help pay but, after I got you a gift what they had wasn't enough...yes I know I'm the sweetest. So I was wondering if it would be okay if, um,\" Cole then started to whisper into the phone and waited for answer to his question. \"Thanks, you're the best!\" Cole yelled when he got his answer. He then hung up the phone and walked back to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is she going to wire you some money?\" Dusk asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No I could never borrow money from her, I just asked if would be okay if it was okay if I shared a room with you and Kate, since I didn't want her to think I tried anything later, and after she finished laughing she said it was fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...let's just get on the boat.\" Dusk said before walking off in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole got up to chase after her, since she didn't know which ship they were leaving on, with Neven and Kate following soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, which boat would have rooms for only five thousand?\" Dusk asked to her self as she looked down at the docked ships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, the rooms are twenty thousand each,\" Cole said when he caught up to Dusk. \"Only the best for My friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really...you idiot! For that much we could have each gotten our own, less nice rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but, it's the only ship bound for Snowpoint city, and I would have gotten four rooms that were not as nice but, they were all booked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which one is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The big one, all the way at the end.\" Cole said pointing at the very last dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, we caught up with you, we almost lost you in that crowd!\" Kate said as she and Neven jogged up to Cole and Dusk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now that we're all here...\" Cole paused again and took a pair of sunglasses out of his pocket, put them on, and then struck another pose. \"Let's set sail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What are those?\" Dusk asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole took the sunglasses off and held them loosely is his hand. \"They're sunglasses, sunglasses are cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did those cost you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven or eight I think, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk snatched the glasses out of Cole's hand and threw them as far out into the water as she could. \"I like the way you look with out them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh*, let's just get on the ship.\" Cole said as he slowly walked toward the ship with his head hung low.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOnce aboard the ship Cole learned that in honor of the ships first sailing to Snowpoint, they are having a tournament exclusive to ice type trainers, and without even thinking signed himself up. Once arriving in the cabin they all put their bags down and settled in, except for Neven, who diapered to somewhere on the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so there are two beds, a pull out sofa-bed, and another bed is being brought here, so now we need to decide who sleeps on what, and since I paid for the room I get one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take the one that's being brought.\" Kate offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since Neven's not here he doesn't get to pick and I get the bed...you know, speaking of choosing. Suppose that you do catch the Regi-whatever, which one of your Pokemon are you going to swap out for it?\" Dusk asked as she sat down on one of the beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn't thought of that, I don't really think I could pick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, give me your Vanilluxe! I can use it to mix Milktank's milk in her and make-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I have to tell you Kate, I'm not letting you use Vanilluxe to make ice-cream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you've got to get rid of one of them, this way you can still see her every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, that is a good point, hmm.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat dose Cole decide to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo give Kate Vinilluxe after the tournament? (Super Milktank Ice-cream becomes available later.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo give Kate Vinilluxe now? (Super Milktank ice-cream becomes available later.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr to give Dusk Weavile?

Even back then he was always trying to be cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he better at now than he was back then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, back then he was good at. Every girl in Sunnyshore loved the adventurous cool kid with white hair, but for some reason he took the most interest in me. He even gave me a Eevee he caught on one of his 'adventures'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have taken good care of it since she's a Umbreon now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, she was a very important gift. Eventualy when we got older he asked me if I wanted to start coming on adventures with him, and with out a moments hesitation I agreed. We desided that we would go to Snowpoint city since Cole has always wanted to go there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that when he met Candice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk shot up in the bed at the mention of Candice. \"The one time I leave his side, the one time I'm not there to pick him up when he falls, and she steals him away from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least she makes him happy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in one of the lower decks, the tournament had begun and Cole was up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Weavile, lets show these chumps what we can do!\" Cole shouted as he and Weavile walked into the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WEAV!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For Candice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you quite done,\" Asked Cole's opponent, who\u2019s outfit made him resemble a Empoleon. Cole responded by nodding his head. \"Very good then, now, great the stage!\" The well dressed trainer threw a Pokeball in the air, releasing his first Pokemon, a Froslass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, ready, set, BEGIN!\" Yelled the proctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Weavile, use Quick Attack!\" Weavile began to dart back and forth as it charged at the opponents Froslass, but it didn't even attempt to dodge. Weavile kept going faster and faster and faster, until it was in striking distance, and when it was, it trusted its claws at it, but the attack had no effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwahahaha! Silly boy, normal type moves have no effect on ghost types!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, just wanted to catch you off guard. Weavile, use Night Slash!\" Weavile's claws then grew dark and it slashed at Froslass, sending it flying when it made contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Froslass bounced across the ground five times before stopping when it hit a wall. It tried to float back up but fell back to the ground, unconscious. \"One-hit KO, Froslass is unable to battle, please swap it with your next Pokemon!\" Said the proctor before Cole's opponent returned Froslass to its Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwahahaha! Jolly good show my boy, but that was just the beginning,\" As the battle raged, Cole defeated another one of his opponents Pokemon, and he defeated two of his. Down to their last Pokemon it was a close battle, and after the dust settled, there was clearly a Glaceon left standing, but Cole's opponent had also used a Glaceon that round. The Glaceon looked at Cole, then the other trainer, then back at Cole, and then back again. After it looked back and forth a few more times it stuck its nose in the air and walked over to,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe well dressed trainer. Cole loses the tournament and heads topside, where Neven is frantically rearranging things and once they are in alignment, he fetches Dusk to cheer him up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole. He returns to the cabin victorious, beaming about how he was going to make Candice proud and Dusk walkes off in a huff again.</span></div></div>",

Now I need my tape-measure because no matter what I try I can't get it to line up again!\" Neven responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why was Cole on the top deck?\" Dusk asked worryingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He lost his battle and now he's really upset,\" Neven said as he pulled his hand out of his bag with the tape-measure in it. \"Did I forget that part?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...sorry...hmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?!\" Dusk shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeven walked over to Kate and stared closly at her hair. After a short while he extened the tape-measure and began to use it to check its length. When he was done he let it retract and a smile came to his face. \"Perfect as usual Kate, don't change a thing about yourself!\" Kate's cheeks went red at the complement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeven then turned and closely looked at Dusk. \"Don't. Even. Think about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, don't get angry, we all prefer it when your happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry it's just...this hasn't been the best day for me. Anyways, I'm going to go see if Cole is okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come, too. Just give me a minute to put the ice-cream away, don't want any of it to melt!\" Kate said probably thinking she was being helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk rolled her eyes and left the room with Neven following behind her. When they got to the top deck Neven pointed Dusk to Cole and then went back to trying to line the chairs back up. Dusk walked over to Cole and put her hand on his back, which startled him so bad he almost went sailing over the guard-rail he was leaning against. \"Be careful Dusk! You almost sent me into the freezing water...that would be a cool way to go though.\" He said after turning to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think any kind of death that has to due with cold is 'a cool way to go'!\" Dusk complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the point!\" Cole argued as he turned to look out over the water again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOT IT!!!\" Neven yelled in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...are you okay?\" Dusk asked before gently placing her hand back on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I just really wanted to impress Candice.\" He said solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you try so hard? If she really loved you she would be happy just be happy being with you, not always waiting for you to impress her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not like that,\" Cole protested turning back to Dusk. \"Why are you always saying bad things about her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she's jealous.\" Neven said as he walked up behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What why would she be jealous?\" Cole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeven rolled his eyes. \"Try actually thinking about it!\" He replied sounding very annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...wait, Dusk, do...do you like...\" Dusk blushed and started to nod her head. \"...Candice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk's body was unable to cope with the combination of anger, annoyance and embarrassment. Her eyes rolled to the back of her head, her legs went limp, she fell to the floor and fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dusk's eyes finally fluttered open, she saw that she was back in the cabin, laying down on her bed. \"Ugh...w-what happened?\" She asked as she sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good morning sleeping beauty. Did you enjoy your nap?\" Kate joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate? ...What happened, how long have I been out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple hours...don't you remember what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...and I know I'm going to regret asking but, what Did happen to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you went to the upper deck with Neven to talk to Cole, you said something about Candice that offended him and he asked why you would say that, then Neven said it was because you were jealous and after thinking about it, he asked-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I like Candice...right,\" Dusk groaned as she fell backwards onto the bed. \"I can't believe he thinks I like girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's...ridiculous...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk sat up again. \"...You thought so, too, didn't you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for a little while yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That changed just today, didn't it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate lowered her head. \"...Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus, if every one thought that...maybe that's why I could never get him to like me...which means all this time I've hated Candice for nothing...I feel like such a jerk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the word I would have used but, yeah. ...If it makes you feel any better, Neven never thought that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, only the weirdo thinks I'm normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That was kind of a bad way to put it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean it like that. I meant only that weirdo thinks I'm the normal me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you meant but that's not what I was talking about. Neven has his quirks but he's not weird! I mean, he's on the top deck trying to explain this whole thing to Cole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really...at least he's got a good heart. ...Ugh...even after being out for so long I'm starting to feel tiered...Kate, I think I'm going to go back to sleep. Maybe this whole thing will be over when I wake up.\" Dusk said before laying back down in her bed and closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long night for Cole and Neven, eventually the latter of which fell asleep, somehow in perfect alignment with the bow of the ship, leaving Cole alone in the early morning. 'Man, I can't believe I've been making such a wrong assumption about Dusk all these years, but she really never gave me a reason to think otherwise. I mean, she was literally the only girl in Sunnyshore who was my age, that didn't swarm all over me. Even when we left the only guy she ever hung out with was me and she didn't even care when Neven joined up with us...I really am slow, I should have figured out she liked me if I paid enough attention. I really have no idea what to do now, I wish I could talk to someone about this, but there's no-one I could talk to without them telling Dusk or Candice what I said...unless I pick someone who has no idea who I am or what I'm talking about.' Cole continued to walk around the ship aimlessly, thinking about what to do. Or at least he did, until he accidentally bumped into a red haired woman.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that morning(ish), in another cabin on the ship, a girl slowly opened her eyes. She sat up it in her bed and looked around her cabin. It was much nicer than any place she ever slept when traveling with her old friends, but one of her new traveling companions had many connections at their disposal and always had somewhere nice to stay the night. Whether it was in a very large tent, or in a luxury cabin of the cruise ship like the one she was in now. She looked to her left and saw the bed next to her was empty. \u201cLook's like I slept in.\u201d The girl said as she pulled the blanket off her body. When she was up on her feet the girl changed out of her pajamas and started to put on her normal clothes. First a pink skirt, then a white undershirt followed by a black vest and pink scarf, then finally a white hat and pink boots. When she was all dressed and she made sure everything was perfect, she grabbed her bag and walked towards the door, but couldn't help but feel she was forgetting something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to her bed and saw something moving underneath the blanket. Soon the 'something's', head popped up from under the blanket and yawned. \"Aw~, I can't believe I almost forgot about you,\" The girl said before scooping the penguin Pok\u00e9mon off the bed. It turned its head in confusion but soon figured out what his trainer meant and looked a little agitated. \"Come on; let's go see where every one is!\" The girl put the Pok\u00e9mon down, walked over to the door, opened it and the Pok\u00e9mon waddled after her into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay let\u2019s see, where would every one be? I know I couldn't have slept in too much, it's probably just about breakfast time,\" The girl\u2019s stomach growled at the thought of food. 'Oh no, you're not getting anything until I catch up with the others!' She thought with her hand on her stomach. When she was outside, she started to look around and soon spotted one of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and ran over to a tall, dressed in black, blond woman and said hello. \"Oh, hello Dawn, I was just on my way to your room to give you some breakfast,\" The woman said holding up a tray with all kinds of food on it. \"Which reminds me, how are you enjoying you room?\" The woman asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's wonderful, there's lots of room, the bed's soft and there's a giant mirror!\" Dawn answered excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman giggled. \"I knew you would like that part the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, yeah...you know, I should really try to find someway to thank-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to do that, it's just one of the perks of traveling with the champion!\" The blond said, giving Dawn another smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright,\" Dawn pouted. \"Anyways, have you seen Zoey? She wasn't in her bed when I woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd imagine so; you did sleep in quite a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, what time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About ten forty five-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! I almost slept through lunch, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm, so hurry up and eat your breakfast so you'll be ready for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Cynthia, is it really a good idea to have two meals so close together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see why not.\" Cynthia said before handing Dawn the tray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I think after I finish this I'll go try to track Zoey down. We're only a few hours from Snowpoint, she must be so happy to be this close to being home!\" Dawn said before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia looked down and saw that Dawn's Pok\u00e9mon was still there and was giving her an angry look and she gave it an awkward smile. \u201cI know Piplups don\u2019t have physic tendencies like the Psyduck back home\u2026so then why is it looking at me like that?' It cocked its head and then waddled off after Dawn.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dawn smiled and rested her hands on her bloated stomach after she finished the large \u2018breakfast\u2019 that Cynthia had gotten for her. She looked to her left and saw that her Pok\u00e9mon had finished their food, too. Dawn pulled out their Pokeballs from her bag and returned them all, but noticed that the one she left out was missing. \"Huh? Where did you go, Piplup?\" Dawn asked as she slowly brought herself up from her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after she started to look for Piplup, she heard some yelling. \"A PENGUIN POK\u00c9MON!!! So awesome! I hope you're a stowaway and no-one owns you, because I don't think I could give you...give you...you're a Piplup, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Peip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I knew it was too good to be true! What kind of penguin Pok\u00e9mon isn't an ice-type?! How could you live on ice, be a penguin and not be an ice-type?! That's just bad evolution!\" Dawn heard the yelling stop and then a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dawn found where the yelling had come from, she saw a white haired man on his knees, grabbing at a bump on his head. Piplup facing away from the man with its flippers crossed and the red haired woman with her hand over her mouth, obviously trying to hide her laughter. \"Piplup, what happened?\" Dawn asked concreted as she picked Piplup up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that <i>your</i> poor excuse for a penguin Pok\u00e9mon,\" Cole said as he got back up to his feet. He took a good look at the blue haired girl and then to the red haired one. \"Wait a minute, I thought I recognized you! You're that coordinator-uh...Zoey? Was that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, that's me! My friend behind you is a coordinator too, her name is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Dee-Dee, I know who she is-hi by the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me that Cole! You know I really hate that nickname!\" Dawn yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...you didn't even like me to call her that when we were dating-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait...you two dated?!\" Zoey asked with look of pure shock on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was a couple of years after I started adventuring that I met her. She was pretty upset about some guy leaving her. He must have really hurt her because she kept saying things like, \u2018I can't believe that ass left me\u2019!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that's not what I said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I apparently made her feel better and she really started to like me, it made me feel like a rebound boyfriend than anything else,\" Cole turned to face Dawn again. \"Not that I didn't enjoy being with you\u2026and it's great to see you again! You look fantastic.\" Cole said with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn smiled and blushed back at him. \"Thanks...you don't look too bad yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how'd you break up?\" Zoey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had this really big fight when I told her that I had to return home for a little while and she exploded! She went on and on about how guys were always leaving her. I think I even heard her swear off men altogether!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really...and you two aren't mad at each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, we talked again soon after and officially broke up...not going to tell you all the things I said about him during the middle part, but eventually we started talking about what exactly happened that day and we actually ended on great terms!\" Dawn said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, so\u2026did you really swear off men?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so...but if I did I got over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...hey, we should arrive at Snowpoint soon; it's going to start to get cold...maybe we should go get some warmer stuff on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I should, but this freak thrives in the cold! You could freeze him alive and it wouldn't even faze him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that good...hmm, but Dawn might be if she keeps insolating herself like this,\" Cole said before patting Dawn on her bloated stomach, earning Cole's stomach a pat from Dawn's fist. \"Sorry, I was just joking...you should really practice hitting harder if you want to hurt me,\" Cole looked at Dawn's hand and saw it was throbbing and red. \"Or at least hit me in a spot that won\u2019t break your hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! It's like punching a rock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No, it's like punching a block of ice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should hit you a little lower! See how well you can form a comeback then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will have a very similar conversation then as we are now, you should know, we did date and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I do not want to hear anymore!\" Zoey interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, yeah, didn't think <i>you</i> would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing I haven't been wrong about before...*sigh*.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, Cole, what's wrong?\" Dawn asked, sounding a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I just messed up really bad with a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well...I might have...impliedshelikesgirls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey and Dawn rolled their eyes. \"I'm sorry; I couldn't here you over that crap attempt to hide what you were saying!\" The former said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have implied that...she...likes other...she\u2019s.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called your friend gay?!\" Zoey and Dawn yelled at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that! I just thought...she might like...girls... Besides, it's not like I was trying to insult her, I don't care how people love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So, I take it she's not?\" Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026she\u2019s not. The reason I thought that was because she didn't hang out with many guys other than...well, me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She likes you...hold on, \u2018didn\u2019t think <i>you</i> would\u2019? What the hell were you trying to imply?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Zoey, why don\u2019t I talk to Cole somewhere else\u2026I\u2019m going to help him with his problem. We\u2019ll meet up just before we dock, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Fine, do what ever you want\u2026I\u2019m going to see what the champions are up to.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She was now running through route 7 trying to track the trainer down so she could award the trainer with the badge. She looked high and low, eventually spotting the trainer on the other side of a raised walkway. Skyla was very nimble on her feet could easily cross the narrow walkway. \"Hey! You forgot your badge!\" Skyla said as she started across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer turned around and saw Skyla running along the narrow planks. \"Be carful! Those are-\" Before the trainer could finish the warning, Skyla was in the air, feet above her head and feel to the ground. \"...Wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owtchy!\" Skyla moaned, buried in the tall grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, what happened to you?\" Nurse Joy asked as the trainer helped Skyla wobble into to Pokemon center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot it rained!\" Skyla cried as she was sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She slipped on a raised walkway.\" Clarified the trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, I knew those things would be trouble. Come with me and I'll get you checked out, you're friend can wait here.\" Nurse Joy helped Skyla up and took her into the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Skyla came out she was in a wheelchair with her left foot elevated and nurse Joy pushing her along. \"Oh man, is something broken?!\" The trainer asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she just has a sprained ankle, it should be healed in no time, but until then she'll have to stay off of it to keep from hurting herself.\" Nurse Joy said before letting go of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, does that mean no acrobatics?\" Skyla whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially no acrobatics, you could shater you heel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then who's going to play with my Pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still can, but may I suggest something a that doesn't require you to run around, maybe catch? A flying type should enjoy that.\" Nurse Joy suggested with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright...this going to be so boring!\" Skyla complained with her head leaning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry about this. If I wasn't so forgetful you wouldn't have fallen.\" The trainer apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkyla looked up at the trainer and smiled. \"Don't beat yourself up about it. I was heading to the Celestial tower today and I always run along those walkways, I would have fallen anyways. Haha, at least this way there was someone to see me fall. Otherwise I would still be in the grass! So don't worry about me, I'll be up and about in no time. You just continue on your adventure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if you're sure then I guess I should hurry up to Twist mountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Joy shook her head. \"I'm sorry but a section of twist mountain has collapsed, it's not safe to go through until the ruble has been cleared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? So I can't go any farther until it's cleared?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have missed the giant airport just outside my gym. I can have someone take you to Lentimas town and from there you can keep going to Opelucid city and get your next badge. Just go to the front desk of the cargo service center and show them this.\" Skyla wheeled herself over to the trainer and held out the jet badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That'd be awesome! Thank you so much!\" The trainer said before taking the badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, just make sure to visit me once you're champion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure will! See you then!\" The trainer said before running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, so much energy,\" Skyla laughed as she watched the trainer run before the sliding door of the Pokemon center closed. She then looked down at her ankle and sighed. \"What am I going to do for fun now...hmm.\" Skyla pulled her Xtansceiver out of the pouch she kept strapped to her thigh and looked through the numbers and decided to call,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalkner. Her fellow flying type gym leader should help to keep her spirits high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElesa. The shining beauty\u2019s company should help her feel energized.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To keep evolution stuff simple, Pokemon that evolve through high friendship, can only evolve by forging a great friendship, unlike any other they have ever had. Umbreon\u2019s are what happens when an Espeon loses that friendship. Pokemon that evolve through trading now evolve through leveling up or stones, but all other forms of evolution will stay the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the first set of characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex.<br>\r\nMoemon: Absol.<br>\r\nHeight: 5'11\".<br>\r\nWeight: 115 lbs.<br>\r\nHair: Short, white, blue streak on right side.<br>\r\nEye color: Red.<br>\r\nInfo: Alex prefers to be called Al instead of Alex, because it sounds 'too girly'. Alex likes to put up a tough act (well, it's not really an act), but isn't quite as rough around friends. Though not the leader of the group, Alex is defiantly one of the more important members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon.<br>\r\nMoemon: Umbreon.<br>\r\nHeight: 5'9\".<br>\r\nWeight: 114 lbs.<br>\r\nHair: Medium length, parted to the right, black.<br>\r\nEye color: Red.<br>\r\nInfo: Brandon is not fond of Alex, especially since his sister is. It\u2019s something about her being around dark types sends his \u2018older brother instincts\u2019, into overdrive, despite being one himself. Being true to his type and evolution, Brandon is rather dark around everyone except his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerra.<br>\r\nMoemon: Espeon.<br>\r\nHeight: 5'9\".<br>\r\nWeight: 114 lbs.<br>\r\nHair: Medium length, parted to the left, purplish pink.<br>\r\nEye color: Violet.<br>\r\nInfo: Serra is very bright, not in intelligence (though that doesn't mean she isn't), but in spirit, almost always in a good mood, she can also get a little cutesy at times. Even though they are twins, Serra is still considered to be the younger one (though only by a few minutes) and is treated that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois.<br>\r\nMoemon: Lucario.<br>\r\nHeight:5'7\".<br>\r\nWeight: 110 lbs.<br>\r\nHair: Long, blue with two black braids on each side.<br>\r\nEye color: Orange.<br>\r\nInfo: Lois is the high energy member of the group and is always ready for a fight, which Alex is always ready to give her. Lois is the leader of the group, though Alex thinks it should be someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStark.<br>\r\nMoemon: Zebstrika.<br>\r\nHeight: 5'11\".<br>\r\nWeight: 118 lbs.<br>\r\nHair: Long, spiky, white.<br>\r\nEye color: Blue.<br>\r\nInfo: Stark has tan skin that highlight the white, lightning shaped tattoos all over his body. Stark has a horrible temper and relies on his partner to keep him calm and from going on rampages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace.<br>\r\nMoemon: Arcanine.<br>\r\nHeight: 6\u20181\u201c.<br>\r\nWeight: 122 lbs.<br>\r\nHair: Long, unkempt, golden orange.<br>\r\nEye color: Black.<br>\r\nInfo: Candace is basically Stark\u2019s handler (or something along those line's), but skilled at it as she may be, she can't always stop him, especially when there is a storm going on. Though Candace is normally very well behaved, she can be a little bit of a handful herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you now a little about these characters, would you like to follow them?</span></div></div>",

I can't sleep it's so loud,\" Said a shadowy, cloaked figure as it trekked through the dark forest. For several minutes now the figure had been looking for the source of the noise that was keeping it from sleeping. After another couple of minutes the figure had given up on finding the source of the noise and started back on its way to its camp sight, when it spotted a girl hunched over with her back up against a tree. \"Hey, girl, are you the one who's making all that noise?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl lifted her head up at the figure and brushed her brown hair out of her face to reveal tears in her brown eyes. \"*Sniff*, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah damn, she's crying! Why did it have to be a crying girl, I can't stand a crying girl!' The figure thought to its-self as it walked over to the girl. \"Hey, girl, what's wrong? Your crying has been keeping me up!\" The figure asked rudely, especially to someone who\u2019s crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sniff*, I'm sorry, I thought I was alone...\" The girl said as she wiped the tears out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you aren't! Now what's wrong?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm lost, I was traveling with my big brother when I lost sight of him, now I'm lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, it had to be a lost and crying girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm just so scared!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell are you sorry for? You got lost, it happens. So...do you want me to help you find him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You'd help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it'll shut you up then yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shot up to hug the figure. \"Thank you, thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, I don't do hugs!\" The figure said with its arms up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...my name's Sara by the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, my name's Alex, but you will call me Al, got it,\" Sara nodded her head. \"Good, now do you have anything on you that your brother handles often?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara shook her head. \"No, he's got everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even your clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about this,\" Alex leaned close to Sara and inhaled through the nose and then let out a puff of air. \"Damn, that's going to be stuck in there for a while. Alright, let's see what I can pick up!\" Alex then began to sniff the air over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do...do you smell anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, I found a collection of your sent up ahead, along with another one...your brother needs to take a bath!\" Alex then began to walk forward and Sara followed close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both continued to walk through the forest in silence until Sara started to hear her name being called and the she saw a man standing in a clearing. \"Brother!\" She yelled as she ran fast towards him, leaving Alex behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SARA,\" The man yelled as he pulled her into a hug. \"I've been looking for you all over! How did you find me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara pulled away and pointed to the forest. \"I had help...but, where did Al go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked behind Sara but didn't see anyone. \"I don't know, but your safe with me now and that's all that matters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha-haooo! I wouldn\u2019t say that!\" Said a voice from nowhere. It was the voice of a female for sure, one with a very sultry voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara, get behind me,\" The man said as he motioned his sister behind him. \"Who are you? Where are you? What do you want?\" The man asked as he tried to find the source of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya both were foolish to come through Our forest! Now ya gotta pay the toll!\" Answered a different voice. This one was male, and he spoke with a deep voice a used a lot of slang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would that toll be?\" Asked the man, keeping his sister behind him as spun in circles in the middle of the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The toll is what ever you've got! Or, one the life of your traveling companion\u2019s! Hahaha-haooo!\" Replied the female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Than take me.\" Offered the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the disembodied voices And Sara cried out in a unison: \"WHAT!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, neither of us would survive very long without our supplies and as the older brother it is my job to offer myself to save my little sister. So take me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a awkward pause before the female voice spoke again. \"...Uh...haha-ho, y-you heard him S, g-go take him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! Ya crazy if ya think I'm gonna do it! This was yo idea C, so yo gotta take 'em...\" Replied the male voice, that would have to be S.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay...HEY WAIT A MINUTE!!! This is your fault, I was just making a joking suggestion, You're the one who took it seriously!\" Yelled the female voice, who\u2019s name (or nickname or code-name or whatever) was reviled to be C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the most organized mugger-murderers in the world, are you?\" Asked the brother, while he continued to spin, fully aware of the answer (or at least he thought he was).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ain't muggers o' murderers, and honestly I'm a little pissed you'd think we were!\" This was not the answer he was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down S, this doesn't need to go any farther than it already has!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, He called us murderers, an I ain't 'bout to make a liar out 'em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...please, calm down, you're getting worked up-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To late! I'm 'bout to make it rain the pain!\" A muscular figure then dashed out of a tree with blinding speed and with a single blow, knocked the brother to ground, before darting up into another tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brother laid there, he wasn't moving. That paired the death threat issued by S, Sara was convinced that her brother was dead. \"BRANDON,\" Sara screamed as she dropped to her knees. \"He was all I had...in the whole world there was only him...and now...he's gone *Sniff*...and now I have nothing...because you, KILLED HIM!\" Sara screamed again as tears began to role down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stand a crying girl!\" There was a loud rustling in the trees, then the muscular figure fell to the ground, followed by a thinner one, and then by Alex, who landed feet first, unlike the other two who landed face first. Alex held tightly in hand, a long, blue katana, which was quickly slid back into its sheath, then the sheath behind Alex's coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw Alex Sara quickly ran over and wrapped her arms around her savior. \"Al...*sniff*, my brother-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I already told you once, I don't do the hugging thing!\" Alex said, protesting the hug while trying to forcibly trying to remove the girl, but this only made her squeeze tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...my...my brother-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is fine, just unconscious. If you'd look you'd see he's still breathing,\" Sara loosened her grip as she looked at Brandon, which Alex used to violently break away from Sara. \"That's better, now you should get out of these woods before the real Toll-keeper gets here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean, 'the real Toll-keeper'? Those two seemed real to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're just two thugs who feel on hard time's, I've met them before. The girl is nice but the guy...well, you saw his temper for yourse-\" Alex was cut of when the ground started to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex took a braced stance, while Sara was caught off balance, and fell onto her butt. \"I awaken...to find not one, not two, not three or four, but Five trespassers who tread my land! All of them...have broken a law of this forest...and must pay the toll to leave it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's the toll?\" Serra asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two may not have been willing to go through with it,\" Alex said, looking at the two collapsed imposters. \"But this one is the real deal and will take a life as payment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct...normally, but you...have all broken laws, now if you wish to leave this place...you must go as a spirit!\" Yelled the toll-keeper before the ground started to shake again. Slowly, the ground in the middle of the clearing began to rise and fold over its-self as a large, rocky creature rose up out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that,\" Serra asked after she brought herself back up to her feet. \"I've never seen a creature like that before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because no-one who has seen it has lived long enough to talk about it...you should take your brother and go, this thing is a fighting type so you wont last very long against it.\" Alex warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know our types?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could smell it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what make's you think you'll do any better, that thing is huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...I'm a flying-psychic type...I...I have a advantage,\" Alex was lying, he was a dark type, and at just a disadvantage as Serra and her brother. \"Now pick your brother up and get out of here, before I change my mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerra picked Brandon up off of the ground, slung him over her shoulder and began to carry him out of the clearing, but stopped to look back at Alex one last time before running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...fast, I will chase after them...when I speed up...and after I deal with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex fight's the Toll-keeper and takes full advantage of its Slow Start to beat it with out getting hit once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex beats the Toll-keeper, but is badly hurt while trying to protect C and S.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex is getting beat bad and has no choice but to come up with another plan to defeat the Toll-keeper. </span></div></div>",

Having to *huff* protect those two from being *huff* smashed was exhausting,\" Alex stiffened up in pain and fell to the ground as well. \"And looks like that thing *huff* took a real toll on me...damn it that was lame! Really don't want those to be my last words...at least no-one was around to hear them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al! Are you okay?!\" Serra yelled as she came running back into to the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I can never *huff* have it my way, can I,\" Alex asked when Serra was in view. \"What are you doing? I told you to run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't leave you, so I got my brother to a safe spot and then I ran back here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, it had to be a girl who doesn't listen. Well I hope you remember where you put him, because I'm not going to be able to help you find him again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ever seen a corps sniffing through air for someones brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hurt that bad?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably...gahh!

You helped me find my brother when I was scared. You saved him when he was hurt, You put your life on the line so that we could get away safely. You've done for me in one night than anyone else has my whole life and I can't just leave you to die!\" Serra said as tears started to role down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, not again. Fine...do what ever you can...but be fast...I don't know... how much longer I...I...can stay conscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerra moved Alex's trench-coat away from the wound on Alex's stomach and began to spray it with a Max Potion took from Brandon's pack. While Serra treated the wound, she noticed several scars on all over Alex's body. They didn't look like combat wounds, more like something you'd get if you fell on jagged rocks. \"Do you feel any better yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still breathing, so that's something.\" Alex said before trying to sit up, only to be pushed back down by Serra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't! I only got your stomach, I still don't know if you're hurt anywhere else.\" Serra moved her hand to start unbuttoning Alex's trench-coat, but Alex grabbed her arm before she even touched a single button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*five months after the battle with the Toll-Keeper*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex walked away from the groups campsite to look for Serra. \"Damn it, where did she run off to now,\" Alex looked high and low for her, but just like when they first met, when Alex turned around to go back to the camp, Alex spotted Serra up against a tree crying. \"Geez, what's wrong with you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I feel so alone...even with every one I travel with now...I still don't have any friend's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have real self-esteem issues.\" Alex said before sitting down across from Serra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't...it's true. If any of them were my friend, I would have evolved by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This really seems like something you should be talking about with your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why bother. He never tells me anything when I do ask him, why would now be any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh*, fine. I'm no expert on evolution, but doesn't it have to be a extra special friendship or something stupid like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...but that will never happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you're not going to feel better until that happens, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, if that's what it will take for you to stop crying then I really don't have any choice,\" After a roll of the eyes Alex leaned over and kissed Serra on the cheek. \"Did that do it, because I'm not doing that again!\" Alex asked after their lips parted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerra blushed and started to glow. \"W-Why did you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stand a crying girl, especially you and I'll do what I need to do to stop it, at least this time I didn't have to risk my life to do it...but if I have to do it again I guess I'd have no choice!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerra started to grow brighter and brighter until there was a bright flash of light. When the light faded Serra had changed drastically. She saw a few stray hairs had fallen out of place, not only did they look longer than they were, but the color had also changed, from brown to a purplish color. When she looked at Alex, she noticed that they were now at eye level. She looked down and saw that not only gained an adults height, but she had also developed a woman's body. \"W-Wow...these are new,\" Serra said as she poked a finger one of her breast. She let her hands drift down and follow new curves of her stomach and waist. \"And so are these!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, that seems like a evolution to me, so I guess I'm done here. It's a good thing too, I'm starting to get hungry!\" Alex got up from the ground and started to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerra reached a hand out and grabbed onto Alex's sleeve. \"Not yet, you and I need to have a little talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*five months earlier.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see, you could be seriously hurt!\" Serra asked as she fought back Alex's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's breathing had become labored again. \"Damn it...why...do you...care...so much?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you've saved me three times today, the least I can do is save yours once, so please let me look, you can barely breath, you might have a punctured lung!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fine...but not a word about what you see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerra slowly opened Alex's coat and when she did,</span></div></div>",

I know if I don't you're going to ball your eyes out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't have to be...it can be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sure, whatever you say I guess. Alright, I'm really hungry now and since I can't go anywhere without you I guess you need to come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I'm actually still gitting used to this new form...I don't think I can stand yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't think I can wait any longer, so...\" Alex reached out and grabed Serra's arm, pulled her up, slung Serra over her shoulder and started to carry her back to the campsite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alex arived back at the campsite she was greated by one of her friends. \"Yo, Al, where'd ya go? I thought ya went off ta find Serra, but ya came back with this chick? Na that I'm comlainin', we could use a hotty on in the group!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it Stark!\" Alex said before setting Serra down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, this chick looks jus' like B!\" Stark yelled when he saw Serra's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what,\" Brandon asked as he came out of his tent. \"Oh Arceus, please no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi brother! I think we may need to stop by a town, I'm too...tall, for my clothes now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*One month after Serra evolved*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ariving in a nearby town, Serra was able to find some new clothes that fit her new form just right (a little too right in Brandons mind) and now that clothing and suplies had been purchesed, the female members of the group (minus Alex) had gone out for dinner before the left town. \"Hey, slow down Serra, I know I said it was my treat, but I didn't know you'd be eating me out of all my money!\" Complained a woman with golden orange hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, *munch*, I've just been so hungry since I evolved!\" Serra said, not bothering to stop eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well evolving takes a lot of energy, I know when I did I slept for a week straight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself Candace, I'm all energy!\" Said the blue haired leader of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Gulp*, I think I'm ready for thirds!\" Serra said after eating the last thing on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, maybe I should go get your boyfriend, make him pay fot you!\" Candace snaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Boyfriend? What boyfriend?\" Serra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't pretend, we all know about you and Al.\" Replied Candace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, Alex isn't...\" Serra paused. There was so much wrong with what Candace said, but she wasn't supposed to tell anyone that Alex was a girl. She made her sware not to when Serra first found out and secondly, she would never could never love Alex like that, even if she was a boy...could she? \"...That's impossibal, Alex could never be my boyfriend.\" Serra continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Two months after Serra evolved.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois stormed onto the campsite and slamed her fist into a tree. \"I take it that you lost again?\" Brandon asked before taking a sip from his thermis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I beat him this time, I just still really pumped!\" Lois said before flashing Brandon a badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon spit his drink out in shock. \"Really?! How'd you manage to pull that off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sucker Punch is a dark type move. I just kept swinging until the last one hit the ground. I would have been back sooner if I didn't hit the reff, too...so where is everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex and Serra went fishing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again? You'd think they would have cought enough by know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And Stark took Candace into town-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's just me and you,\" Brandon nodded his head and Lois sat down next to him. \"Have you ever noticed that you and I are the only ones in the group who aren't in a relationship?\" Lois asked with her chest puffed out while she moved her hand up and down the sleave of Bandon's black suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incase you haven't noticed, Stark isn't the camitmant type...and my sister is not in a relationship!\"</span></div></div>",

She was wearing a brand new two piece swimsuit that was purple in color. While Alex was wearing her trench-coat, a fishing hat on her head and was holding onto a fishing pole while another was propped up in a hole. \"I'm never going to catch anything with you splashing around in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerra brought her head up out of the water just enough to talk back to Alex. \"I know, I was hoping you'd get board and join me, maybe have a race?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first part of your plan worked, but I don't swim so now you've wasted your time and we have no fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you swim? Do you not know how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, I just don't do it for fun, only to get somewhere, to get away from something, or to help someone who needs it.\" Alex said to before reeling in the line just to cast it out in another spot, farther away from Serra in hopes there would be fish there that Serra hadn't scared away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So...if I went under...she'd have to come in to save me...' Serra thought. \"Hey...what was-ow! Al...somethings got my leg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, I'm not falling for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious! Somethin-\" Serra dived under the water but made it look like she was pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bravo, excellent performance but I'm not coming in...\" Alex tilted her head to the side to see if something really did pull her down, but the water was too dark for her to even see Serra, let alone if she was in danger. \"...Damn!\" Alex threw her hat and trench-coat along with the rest of her clothes. When she reached the water she was down to her underwear, which was a pair of boxers and vest that blocked-out her curves. She dived in and opened her eyes to look for Serra. It was surprisingly more visible under the water than above and she quickly spotted Serra. She was completely fine. She was waving back and forth with one hand while trying to stay under with the other and had a big stupid grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked at Serra for a good five seconds before swimming up to the top. When Serra came up Alex was almost halfway to the beach. \"Aww, come back. I just wanted to have a little fun with my bestest friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't do fun.\" Alex said, looking back to Serra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we can train! We race and try to get from one side of the lake to the other, that way we can compete and try to get faster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you always wear such formal suits? It isn't like you ever go anywhere fancy...maybe you'd be more...comfortable, without it?\" Lois said, continuing to run her hand up and down Brandon's sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon swallowed some of his drink. \"And what would you suggest I wear? There isn't exactly many forms of clothing that fit my style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I guess you're right...but who says you have to wear anything at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one...but the law does.\" Brandon said before taking another sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...then how about just for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon swallowed hard and almost chocked. \"That would be very inappropriate!\" He said, readjusting his red tie as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, keep up Slowpoke!\" Serra taunted form the far side of the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm *huff*, trying! ...Damn, I didn't think this would be so *huff* heavy,\" Alex said, trying to stay afloat. \"*Huff*, I can't *huff*, it's too heavy!\" She said before sinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AL!!!\" Serra screamed before diving under water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alex opened her eyes she coughed up water. \"Did you save me from-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU INSANE?!\" Serra yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you wear this in the water, why would you wear this at all?!\" Serra said, holding up Alex's heavy vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked down at her body. She blushed and quickly covered her bare chest. \"Damn it, Serra! Were you just waiting for me to wake up with my chest out?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerra's cheeks went red as well and a black light starting to form around her. \"N-No...well, yes, but I wasn't looking! I was too busy wondering why your vest is filled with weights!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for training!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you come in the water still wearing it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, as you can plainly see, I wasn't wearing anything under it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then maybe you should think twice next time before walking around without a bra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault, if you hadn't of pulled that stupid stunt, I would have been just fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sorry that I wanted to have a little fun with my best friend!\" The dark light started to envelop Serra even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that but did you have to do it such a mean way?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" The dark light stopped growing and even receded a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have come up on land and fished with me like we were supposed to, or we could have played one of your stupid games, but nooo, you had to go and pull that stupid trick and make worry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I made you worry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you did! I always have to make sure you're okay, or my only friend will hate me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only friend? What about the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only an asset to them, just like with every one else I've travailed with, but I thought you were different, though now I'm starting to wonder if you really are. I'm starting to think that you only keep me around is so that you don't end up like your brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I had no idea you felt that way...I...I've been a horrible friend!\" Serra cried before latching onto Alex with a hug and the black light faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex pushed away for Serra, keeping her chest covered. \"Damn it Serra! What's wrong with you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry! I hate myself for making you feel that way! I love you Alex, I don't want you to ever feel alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, don't call me Alex and two, you love me?! What is wrong with you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...of course I do! You're my best friend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Damn, give me my vest...I can't believe I'm about to do this,\" Alex snatched her vest out of Serra's hand and quickly put it on. When it covered her body Alex leaned forward and hugged Serra, but it only lasted a few seconds. \"I just died a little inside, so I hope you enjoyed that because it's never going to happen again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerra nodded her head violently. \"Y-Yeah...it was a nice hug...\" Serra stopped her head and looked at Alex's arms and legs. She leaned closer closer to her and made her hand follow the groove of one of the scars on her arm. \"...Al...is this one new?!\" Serra asked worryingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just...how did you get these? It looks like you fell on rocks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't Fall on any rocks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they're not from rocks-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I didn't fall on any, I didn't say they weren't from rocks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al...have people thrown rocks at you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible! Why would people do that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want to know,\" Serra nodded her head. \"It's because I'm an Absol...my kind show up to warn people of danger, but eventually, people started to think I cause it. So to keep me away...they threw rocks at to get me to leave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...I'm so sorry Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Alex didn't notice Serra used her full name, only that she had made Serra uncomfortable. \"...Are you still evolving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What? Why would you think that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember when you evolved, you kept marveling at how there were new things about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this is new.\" Alex said before reaching out to grab Serra growing middle.</span></div></div>",

Time...for me...to sleep.\" Drake said as he slowly shuffled into the bedroom on the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't ask for a more cooperative party.\" Ray said sarcastically before he walked into the left bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Yawn*, what, is it time for bed?\" Autumn said as she looked up from her magazine again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheh, three lovely ladies to play with, which one should I play with first?\" The shadowy figure asked its-self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho dose the figure 'play with' first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: This is a ghost type, him, her or it, wants to scare them, not the other thing you were probably thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a Jellicent Moemon and wants to pick on Becky since he has a great type advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a Shuppet Moemon who haunts Autumn and or Gina's dreams to make them miserable so she can become stronger, and they take up comfort eating to deal with it.</span></div></div>",
