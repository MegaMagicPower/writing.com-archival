I have subdivided the genre into five basic categories which I feel broadly represent what generally happens in weight-gain fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThemes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Devolution:</b>  These types of stories generally involve a moral/spiritual decay of the obese character(s).  Excessive greed or indifference may result in the obesity that comes to define these characters.  They suffer regression in independence and independent thinking as weight escalates.  Character flaws and rampant obesity (often beyond the character's control) harm them body and soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Somatic:</b>  These stories are concerned with the harmful effects of obesity on the body without moral or mental degradation.  Being fat is fine, but is typically a hassle to deal with.  When the problems mainly arise from a lack of mobility or else pressing health issues, the story belongs here.  More than a few of us know the hassles of dealing with sometimes quite a lot of excess flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Worship:</b>  In these stories, fattness is in its most sublime state.  No drawbacks!  Only beautiful, luscious curves, big waists and low hanging bellies.  Goddess worship finds a homes here as well as any story in which drawbacks to obesity are minor or a non-issue.  Just remember, if fatness is not an ongoing source of conflict, there must be other problems elsewhere to move the story along<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rapid-Gain:</b>  These stories may be more familiar.  In this section, weight gain happens through extraordinary circumstances, typically in the course of days, hours, even minutes!  The source or mechanism of the weight-gain is generally forms the core of the story, whether it is voluntary or otherwise.  Force-feeding/inflation will not be tolerated.  Unusual premisses are not an excuse to shirk our literary duties.  Our readers deserve more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Other:</b> For stories that don't quite belong in the above categories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Once again, if you wish have your story title and description appear in the next section, send me an e-mail at my writing.com account.

Only in the modern age do we find any real abundance.  But of course, the media's definition of \"obese\" hardly registers on the scales we proudly bend out of shape.  But what is the ultimate cost of such overindulgence?  The typical sin is greed, of course, but feel free to be original.  The lavish noble whose lust for excess - as well as their waistline - knows no bounds as well as a captive of a cruel sex fiend, forced eat and humiliate themselves at the same time belong here.  Any story where the weight is tied extricably to psychological or spiritual or moral hurt is this thread's domain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  <b><u>Daddy's Little Girl:</u></b>  Pricilla Blacklake is the youngest daughter of a wealthy man.  She is also a spoiled brat who has never had to work for anything in her life and has always gotten her way.  All of that changes when her father dies.  Suddenly, unwanted responsibility is thrust on her and she falls into a world of baffling, perhaps deadly politics.  She's smart, however, and feels like she can handle the change, however, there is one major difficulty.  As a result of misguided efforts to repel unwanted suitors in her childhood, Pricilla finds herself so fat she can barely walk at the time of her crisis.  How will our heroine prevail against nebulous, mysterious forces when she can barely shift her arse out of the couch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  <u><b>Decadence and Forthright</b></u>: Our heroine was once a lowly peasant in an indiscriminate European country, however, her willingness to revolt against the crown has landed her and her band of rebels at the door of Francois Marquis, a well known tyrant. He, however, is not present and is taking his enterprises to the Orient. A mysterious woman with equally mysterious persuasive powers accepts her into the castle, promising an audience with Marquis. Her murderous nature towards him persuades the mysterious Lady Montague otherwise. The rebel is given an assigned name by said woman and is taken cared of by strangely identical maids and servants who live to indulge her every whim... given that Montague doesn't have something for them to do. She indulges heartily in the castle's many frivolities and may find herself quite the different woman waddling out than she was when she stormed in... assuming that she can still leave by the time Francois Marquis arrives home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are currently 3 open story slots available.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wind blowing briskly inland from the west tasted lightly of salt from passing over the San Francisco Bay.  The patio built snuggly into the hills overlooking the city of Oakland below would become festooned with drifting leaves over the course of the coming night, but then it was hardly Pricilla's concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun warmed her face and shoulders while the rest of her floated languidly below the surface of the pool.  The afternoon heat was well welcome with the chilly wind blowing in off the ocean.  It was late in the year for swimming - her brown coat already fluffing off copiously to reveal her new, luxurious white coat underneath - but to Pricilla, the water was too much of a luxury to do without.  She breathed a sigh, relishing the salty tang in the air and stoking past memories of the beach she never visited anymore.  Then she tip-toed across the length of the pool.  Every step was easy, a precious gift nowadays with her landbound mobility what it was.  With the water supporting her bulk, it was the only time that she could <i>forget</i>.  In fact, as Pricilla moved lazily around the pool, she imagined herself some sort of marine mammal, graceful in her natural element of the sea; despite the fact that she was far too buoyant to dive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, however, the only resemblance to a marine mammal that Pricilla had was the thick layering of blubber coating her body.  She'd spent a lifetime growing it, and it showed.  Pricilla Ruthering Blacklake weighed many times over her proper weight; so much, in fact that it was difficult to walk on land without assistance.  In the water, her thighs still touched all the way down to the knee and glided smoothly over each other's roundness.  The vast belly which normally rested heavily below her knees floated freely below the water's surface, a vast dome projecting a fair distance in front of her.  The relief of having the massive weight of her paunch lifted free of her thighs, cool water flowing freely over normally cloistered skin, alone was worth entering the water.  Not only Pricilla's head and shoulders were supported above the water.  A massive pair of breasts, each larger and much heavier than her head, continually schemed to float before her, a loose red cloth top providing no support to the massive mammaries.  Every so often, Pricilla pushed them down under the water as the fur on her chest dried in the open, breezy air.  All over her body, creases and folds in her flesh normally stagnant and airless were aerated by the perfectly conditioned water.  Despite the chill in the air, it was not a pastime that Pricilla could see herself doing without.  Even in the dead of winter, she would be down here, floating to escape the weight of her own body.  She was out here more and more often it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla rested her broad, fatty back against the side of the pool.  She threw an arm over the side to rest; two would have been impossible given the depth of the fat padding behind her.  She took a few deep breaths and contemplated the fact that her physician told her repeatedly that she should exercise while she was in the pool.  And also that 'floating around' did not qualify as real exercise.  Of course, Pricilla had little but contempt for the family doctor and his now quarterly visits.  He'd done nothing but harangue her about her weight since she was a teenager.  It was annoying in the extreme, though it wasn't like she could exactly hide around the manor house each time he came around like she once did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she floated, her head at about knee-height about the ground, Pricilla took the opportunity to spy on a man who was currently tending to one of the many shrubs around the well landscaped backyard.  He was not one of her personal assistants, but that was exactly the point.  Pricilla found most of the people around the house who helped her with her day to day affairs (mostly just getting around the house nowadays) to be deathly <i>boring</i>.  The young man holding the shears did not seem boring at all just at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was coyote for one thing, shirtless for two.  The muscles in his back rippled under his scrabbly unkempt fur as he worked.  Pricilla could almost smell the tang of his sweat.  His young, well sculpted body was certainly appreciative, from the emphasize shoulder blades to the trim waist where a tattered set of blue jeans was held up by a worn leather belt.  Pricilla wasn't sure, but she didn't think he spoke english.  After a few minutes of staring at his back, however, Pricilla grew bored when he didn't turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the side of her bloated body pressing the wall of the pool, Pricilla stepped out with a foot and floated back towards the middle.  As good as it felt, floating in the pool inevitably grew boring as well, as it was now.  She yawned and backpedalled until her toes brushed against the bottom of the pool again.  Besides the fact that the water was not enough in itself to hold her scant, haughty interests, it also made her <i>hungry</i>.  And Pricilla found hunger, of all other urges to be nigh irresistible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla waded into the shallows, trying to keep the majority of her bulk under the water for as long as possible.  There used to be a time when she could walk with her knees near her chest all the way to the wide stairs leading out of the pool.  Now, however, the girth of her torso got in the way of many of her past contortions.  As a stoat, her torso was long, but weighing in excess of half a ton, it was now rendered little more flexible than a rhino's.  When her knees began pushing into the underside of her massively protruding gut, Pricilla lurched forward, her legs floating up behind her.  A wide back of molting brown fur was exposed like a rising island to the chilly air.  Her longish tail waved and dripped over her thighs, its base holding up her mostly invisible bottom whose long cords were buried in the crease under her love handles.  The elongated triangle of red fabric covered her extremely generous crack to an ambiguous point where ass became pressed-together thighs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drifted forward until her belly began to rub against the bottom of the pool.  Pricilla was still a fair distance away from the stairs and this point grew more distant year after year.  Now things got difficult.  The water was two feet deep at the base of the stairs, a design flaw that Pricilla criticized more and more over the last two years.  Her body had grown so thick that the length of her arms was just adequate to reach the bottom where her bare tummy was grinding against the rough floor of the pool.  She lifted herself a few inches and pushed herself forward.  The amount of belly in contact with the floor increased.  She did this several more times until her gut rested pretty heavily against the bottom of the pool; more back flesh was exposed to the increasing wind, much to the stoat's chagrin.  When her breasts pressed against the bottom of the pool, Pricilla had to call it quits.  Her upper arm strength was feeble at best, not nearly adequate for the punishing task of lifting even a portion of her bulk out of the water.  She rolled and floundered a bit until she was kneeling on the floor; the fact that her belly still touched the ground in front of her did not escape her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her objective was before her, a steel handrail coming out of the pool (more recently installed than the rest of the luxury pool, out of necessity).  Pricilla dawdled, disliking the prospect of effort.  She turned her head to a previously ignored figure who sat nearby reading a book and \"supervising\" her.  \"Denise. Get Lorenzo.  I'm getting out of the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla's body servant lifted her head, whiskers twitching.  She was a european Mountain Weasel by breed, though her stock was purely American (and watered down besides, as Pricilla's mother would oft mention).  She was also a licensed nurse and saw more of Pricilla than anyone else in the house; and probably more than she herself would want to, given half a choice.  She set her novel aside and briskly nodded her head.  \"I'll be back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to rush.\"  Pricilla half sighed, again measuring the distance up the stairs with loathsome eyes.  Reaching under the crease of her belly over her thighs, Pricilla hefted upward just enough to clear the heavy weight of the pool floor.  Then she began to walk forward laboriously on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was actually so heavy that out of the water, Pricilla could not lift the incredible weight of it.  As it was, it was still an awkward burden.  At the last step, her knees scuffing roughly against the floor with the increasing weight, she lurched forward to grab the rail, letting go of the mammoth tank of adipose affixed to her front.  It dropped to rest heavily on the ground two feet below the surface of the water.  Now an even greater challenge loomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHauling her massive frame out of the water was never pleasant.  It hadn't been pleasant when she weighed 350 lbs, nor when she weighed 500, 700 or 900 lbs.  It was trebly unpleasant now and, in fact, only possible because of the sturdy handrail.  She needed to transfer from knees to feet, lifting with her back and the strength in her stocky legs.  Her body flowed and rippled around her.  Her hand was tight on the smooth metal, at arm's length from her side because her torso was just so thick.  The loss of leverage was just as much of a hassle as the increased weight.  Finally she stood on locked knees, the only way her legs would take her incredible weight.  And even then, only for fleeting periods of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could begin the painful trek up the four steps, her assistants arrived, showing how long this ordeal was starting to take.  She looked up at strong Lorenzo, taking in his straight - though overlong - black mane, his long face and short chestnut fur.  He was a strong horse and he'd been a loyal employee to the Blacklake family for many years.  He was even willing to provide a brace for Pricilla to lean on as she trudged her way back into the comfort of the large house in front of her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared down so expectantly at her...  It grated on her short temper.  Pricilla had just begun to move her foot to the first step when Denise asked,  \"Would you like some help, Pricilla?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  said the stoat tersely.  She grunted as she leaned forward, pushing up against the increasing pull of gravity.  Her breasts collapsed down to sag heavily atop her broad shelf of white belly fur.  The red cloth maintaining a figment of modesty strained, the straps behind her tightened into her back flesh, making divots at her shoulders.  Her nipples were soon perked by the cold breeze despite her fur coat.  \"I'm fine, just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted again on the second step.  Creases at her sides were closing shut, the weight pulling down the skin on her shoulders as her skin was some sort of sodden, baggy coat.  Her gut fell more into place and the weight on her feet made the rough texture of the pool floor painful on soft paw pads.  \"Just gimme a sec, alright?\"  Pricilla's tone might be described by some as \"bitchy\" and \"ungrateful.\"  She preferred to think of herself as resigned cynic.  Waistdeep, then knee deep.  Merely standing had become difficult in the last year.  Pricilla was breathing hard with the effort which was almost - but not quite, thankfully - too much for her poor leg muscles to take. Her thick feet were turned outward, the result of thighs thicker around than most people's waists and a habit of sitting with a gut forcing her legs even further apart.  The last two steps out of the pool were always the hardest.  She gripped the handrail with a death grip and planted her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strained, but it almost seemed that she was going to stall, the weight simply too great for her leg to lift.  Life-threatening embarrassment loomed.  Then there was a hand in front of her.  Lorenzo, always faithful had put a hoof in the water and offered his hand.  Wordlessly, Pricilla took it.  With his great strength, he helped her up the last two steps as Pricilla pushed forcefully down on the rail with so much weight Pricilla sometimes imagined she felt the metal bending under her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks.\"  said Pricilla mechanically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo bowed his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse provided balence as Pricilla waddled her way back through the wide double doors of the manor her father owned.  The stoat had to walk with knees locked or her leg might literally give way under all the weight pressing down on it.  She had a bowlegged stance and her belly had a tendancy to sway as she moved.  All of this combined to make walking unsupported into something of pipe dream.  She needed someone strong to steady her as she slowly shifted her legs under her, or else a cane.  Pricilla refused to even consider using a cane.  Besides, there was <i>something</i> about the feel of tight, hard muscles under her flabby arm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was panting by the time she managed to shuffle into her abode.  Pricilla all but collapsed into a three person sofa in front of a huge, plasma television, filling it almost completely.  Her fur was still soaking wet from the pool, but the fabric of the sofa had been chosen to withstand moisture (the previous one having been ruined the first time this happened).  Besides, who would expect Pricilla to stand around long enough to towl off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you a towel.\"  said Lorenzo after having his arm freed, then disappeared up the stairs to a portion of the house Pricilla would only ever see again if someone installed an elevator (and perhaps reinforced the foundations).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise spoke as Pricilla panted, one arm resting on her more than generous chest, \"Is there anything you would care to eat for dinner, Pricilla?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, she knows me well.</i>  Thought Pricilla with a grin.  \"Yes, actually.\"  said Pricilla between puffs.  \"Tell Fredrick to fix some...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pricilla rattled off an easy, though long list of foods that might sate the hunger she'd worked up merely floating around in the pool for a few hours.  The stoat asked for Fredrick's fine pot roast which she adored, complete with vegetables and trimmings.   The carbo-haulic side of her nature demanded mashed potatoes, macaroni with cheese, and alfredo pasta as well.  She also wanted fresh butter rolls; and of course, the kind she preferred came out of the oven literally dripping.  Because Pricilla could not imagine an evening meal not ending with something sweet, she asked for the house chef to also thaw out a whole cheesecake while he was preparing her dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And make sure he also gets that raspberry sauce out as well.\" finished Pricilla without the slightest hint of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise catalogued away the order in her head to relay to the chef, showing no signs of her own personal thoughts nor her opinion of the huge order she was about to burden the plump labrador in the kitchen with.  \"Very well, I'll tell him.\"  she said with a slight bow and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla sat innertly until Lorenzo came down the stairs, carrying several towels.  Gingerly, he helped haul her ass out of the couch long enough to help dry off her back and posterior while the stoat herself pushed the plush fabric against her chest and belly.  Lifting a heavy arm into the air, she slid the towel under the sagging arm flesh which still sat atop the side of her breast.  She repeated with the other arm, then used a fresh towel to get under her expansive chest.  Lorenzo assisted her by handing her the corners of yet another towel so she could slide it up the underside of her massive paunch until the fabric rested against her crotch.  Then placed down several dry towels on the couch against which she would rest her more than considerable bulk.  By this time, the heavily fattened ermine was ready to sit again, this time until she was forced to make the trek back to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy flicking on the television, she signaled Lorenzo to leave.  Sharp clops of his hooves against the wood floor faded as he vacated the room to await the next time he would be needed.  As images flickered blandly before her, Pricilla wondered, not for the first time, where the strong, steadfast horse went when he wasn't serving as a pillar or a shunt for her to lean on.  <i>There's probably a staff room around here somewhere.</i>  she thought, not truly caring one way or another.  <i>Does he have a girlfriend, maybe?  I wonder what she would think if she knew the sort of woman he served and the things he had to do for her.</i>  That thought came with more canter, the corners of her eyes squinting a little in deviousness.  Trouble for the sake of trouble, pain for the sake of pain.  What else had Pricilla to do?  She decided she would ask Lorenzo about his personal life the next time she saw him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise returned then, taking a seat on a recliner, but perching lightly at the very tip of it, as it expecting to be quickly sent somewhere else.  \"Dinner will be ready in about an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical.\"  Pricilla grunted in mock dismay.  It would have been perfect for her distended stomach to let loose one of the outrageously loud growls it was known for just then, but it didn't feel like cooperating either.  She looked at the uninteresting weasel to her side.  There were no games to fathom with Denise, who had lasted longer on her staff - now going on three years - than anyone else.  The girl seemed to have no life outside her college work, and she spent all of her excess time <i>here</i>, with Pricilla herself.  That was what she was paid for, of course, but did she have to seem so... so <i>committed</i> all the time?  Her father had asked her why she seemed to delight in driving away the people she relied on for such basic tasks that she was increasingly unable to do for herself.  She'd mentioned specific faults in each employee and chalked up their resignations to overreactions, but the truth of the matter was that seeing what it would take to make someone resign was something of a game to her.  Like chess.  She found out a lot about people in that way.  What they were willing or not willing to do for money got right to the heart of their values.  Every-time she won, she learned something vital about their personality... then promptly never saw them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise though...  She had a personality like vanilla pudding as far as Pricilla Blacklake was concerned.  She was not motivated by something as petty as money, however; though the weasel needed it for her college bills.  She had kept on for something more obscure, something that Pricilla hadn't before experienced to any real degree.  She called it <i>friendship</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Denise relined, resting her long spine against the soft arm of the couch.  Pricilla's assistant weighed 150 lbs, which was just ten or fifteen pounds over her ideal.  Pricilla weighed over seven times that amount.  So while the long bodied weasel could still flex and contort in interesting ways, Pricilla could only recline back, feeling the weight of her mountainous breasts on her chest while rolls piled upon rolls to either side of her.  Seeing Denise move never ceased to fill her with no small amount of envy.  That envy, however, did not stop her from longing for the feast to come.  \"Did you hear about that scandal with Govenor Schwartz?\"  said Denise, breaking the silence.  \"I can't believe that he kept a secret family right over the border!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denise, Oregon is hardly 'over the border.'\"  Pricilla said knowingly, having watched three different news channels cover the story that morning both on television and the internet.  \"Besides, the real scandel is in the new sale's tax...\"  The morbidly obese stoat shifted slightly to face Denise, one arm hanging from the elbow to drape casually over the rolls at her flank, the other resting on the generous platform of her white belly beyond the red clothed mounds of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chat came easily and filled the next hour.  Talking with Denise was at least more stimulating than the TV or internet videos.  <i>Even if she does have a personality like vanilla pudding,</i>  Pricilla had to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the food came, it was laid before her on portable tables, however, these hardly helped since her gut flowed to such a length in front of her that she would not be able to reach it without knocking the flimsy things over.  As such, her meal was separated into large plates, each containing some of each of the items she had ordered.  In all, there were six of them, plus the cheese cake to come.  Fredrick was pretty sour-faced for a usually perky labrador.  <i>Maybe he is being kept late from something...</i>  Pricilla wondered absently as Denise handed her her first plate and a fork.  She couldn't say.  She and Fredrick did not speak much besides the constant food orders.  It was probably why he was the most senior member of the house staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fattened stoat, having been robbed of the capacity for normal eating experience due to the depth of her surging belly, rested the plate on her ample chest.  Half of the plate was supported against the twin curves of her female endowments, the other half steady by one hand, with the hot middle suspended above the plane of her belly.  She ate thusly with her free hand - quickly and with great gusto that she rarely showed for anything else.  There was no more talking, though Pricilla still watched the flashing images on the giant television screen.  It helped occupy her mind while she was busy giving into the demands made by her cavernous stomach.  The quantity of the food she ingested was always easy to forget when a good show was one though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she emptied her first plate, she passed it to Denise, who rose out of the recliner easily and quickly, as if she had a spring in her back, and traded it for another heavy full one.  Pricilla stuffed her face again until there was nothing left but grease and Alfredo and cheese stains on the porcelain.  The sensation of food passing down her gullet was primally satisfying for Pricilla.  It was pretty much the only thing that she felt she still excelled at after all these years of watching her waistline grow and grow past anything she could have expected back when she first started hounding the kitchen staff for snacks when she was at the tender age of seven.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr course, that was a different time in a different house with different people, none of whom she saw anymore.  The memory did not arise as Pricilla ate, but the old pleasure did, as it always did.  Something simple in its construction, but continuously enjoyable in its execution.  Pricilla polished off a third and then a fourth plate.  Then commercials interupted her train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy dull pain in her midsection alerted Pricilla to the fact that if she continued eating, she'd not have any room left for the muchly desired cheesecake.  Thus the last two plates were thrown out.  Denise left with the plates and was gone for sometime as Pricilla heard the sounds of washing float across from the other room.  Then more time passed.  The front door opened and closed with the usual automatic, opulant chime as Fredrick departed.  Denise returned shortly after, carrying the heavy weight of the cheese cake in one hand, a salmon salad for herself in the other.  The cake was passed up into greedy paws and both girls settled down to watch the end of \"Two and a Third Men.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pricilla needed help getting off of the sofa, but from there, she was able to hobble, one step at a time, to hallway, to rest a pink skinned hand on the wall to steady herself.  With her belly a 400 lb pendulum affixed to her front, it was important in the extreme not to lose her balance.  After quickly folding the towels on the couch left carelessly behind, Denise followed as Pricilla made her slow way into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the half ton stoat, there did not seem to be anything terribly unusual about her near lack of mobility or the effort it now took just to get from the couch to her bed.  The difficulty had been mounting slowly for the better part of two decades now.  The weight creeping into her lifestyle the way adipose slowly crept onto her burgeoning frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough things seemed to be reaching a head point, where the effort of merely moving about the house was nearly beyond her, the stout could not find any strong motivation for <i>change</i> within herself.  With a heavy sigh, she let go of the steel handrail affixed to the wall beside her bed and aimed her massive buttocks at the edge.  Springs creaked and the surface of the bed deformed like a physicist's model of a black hole as she lowered her weight onto it.  Her belly sank low, touching the insides of her thickened calves and she rested her arms on her more than ample breasts, wrists dangling to the roll just underneath.  If there was one thing she felt, glancing at all of the bulk contained within herself, it was contentment.  Pricilla was content with life and saw little need for change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise followed into her bedroom and shut the door behind her.  The mild expression on her face told that she was ready for the primary functions of her position here at the estate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Pricilla's weight had slowly nudged up and over the 1,000 lb mark, nothing ever seemed simple.  Oh sure, hiking and jogging had been beyond her since pretty much elementary school, but a certain ineptness just kept creeping into her life as her weight grew.  Beginning with an inability to tie the laces on her shoes and escalating to dozens of little tasks that one would normally take for granted.  That's why Denise had been hired by her father to be Pricilla's personal body servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from pulling on a loose t-shirt, Pricilla was unable to dress herself.  She couldn't reach behind her to undo her top, nor could she manage her bottom piece which had to be dredged forcefully out from the trench between her thighs.  The white bellied ermine slept in the nude.  \"Get this would you, Denise?\"  said Pricilla, offering a back broader than three of her thinner assitant's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"  said Denise, as if she had a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards Pricilla went through the annoying business of arranging her bulk on the wide bed.  She rested on her belly  - to help with her sleep apnea - but of course, she was still supported fairly high due to the sheer width of her torso.  Pricilla rested at the foot of the bed, her elbows on the very edge.  This was so she could use her laptop computer; a misnomer as far as Pricilla was concerned, her 'lap' having ceased to exist many years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chin resting on the swell of her breasts between her arms, Pricilla opened the lid of the suddenly brilliant screen.  As the stoat, her body spreading very widely over the surface of the bed, waited for the computer to warm up, Denise came in from the adjacent bathroom.  \"I'm just going to apply the moisturizer and powder now, Pricilla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoat grunted, impatient with her computer.  When it started, she was barely aware of Denise's slim hands sliding ointment and powder into her various creases.  With the skin folding into unnatural airless crevasses all over her long torso and over her limbs, Pricilla needed a lot more skin maintenance than the average person, and not only that, she needed someone else to do the task for her.  Other people might have quailed at the prospect, but for Pricilla it was merely 'normal.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was besides the issue anyway.  Pricilla was currently diving into an other world where she was free of the burden of her weight.  Her sausage-like fingers were clumsy in general, but the keyboard was no hindrance to them.  On paper, or in text files, Pricilla found an eloquence that escaped her tongue in real life.  Perhaps it was that she simply <i>cared</i> more about what went into the computer than what spilled out to those around her.  But at any rate, Pricilla's passions all lie behind the softly glowing screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn cyberspace, Pricilla was actually <i>popular</i>.  She had accounts on a dozen different art sites and e-mail poured in every day, eager for more stories, more poems, more of her recent dabbling into digital art.  Working under the assumed name of \"Alice White\" Pricilla shared her thoughts and feelings with a world that would surely feel betrayed should they ever learn the truth behind their beloved online personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis night, Pricilla was kept busy between answering e-mails and making forum posts and writing in her blog.  She announced that her current drawing (a raunchy affair between a fox and a young otter which had appeared in one of her short stories)  would have to be delayed another week.  But she did post a new poem she had thought of while drifting in the pool.  She called it, \"Scents of the City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Below ocean breeze is blowing<br>\r\nAcross the Darkening Sky I<br>\r\nSee lights below calling softly<br>\r\nI wish I were there...</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poem continued to describe the scents wafting up from the valley below to the isolated narrator.  Undoubtedly her audience would comment on the metaphysics of the human psyche, stranded alone in the universe, never having any idea of the very literal meaning of the poem.  Really, Pricilla hoped they never guessed the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pricilla grew drowsy, her gut churning the food she'd generously dumped into it, she had to close the screen.  By that time, Denise was long gone, but was never far away.  The buzzer she kept under her right breast along with her cell phone during the day would summon Denise in no more than a minute should she need her.  Lazily the ermine yawned widely against the pushed of fatty breast tissue under her jaw.  She rested her cheek against the generous swelling and mantled her elbows against the bed's edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just another boring day,</i> Pricilla reflected after she closed her eyes. <i> I wonder if anything will ever change around here...</i> She wondered idily.  Fat chance of that happening.  Her father was mortally embarressed of her and her half ton ass.  He even went out of the way to get her a house of her own, the place only serving as something of a bed and breakfast for him, his wife and Pricilla's other siblings when they were not away on their many travels or even at their own family's houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla touched her thumb to a finger for each absent family member.  Her father, Richard Blacklake:  away on business in Florida.  Her mother, Diana:  'accompanying' her father on his business trip, undoubtedly preparing their vacation home for their anniversary following the conclusion of her father's business.  Her older sister, Siera: married to a rich fox and inheritor of a vast wine and alcohol firm in France.  Her oldest brother, Bernard: stayed for two weeks last month, now gone in search of investors for his newest invention/scheme.  Her youngest brother, Warren: still in college and blissfully ignorant of the world around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the second oldest sibling of the bunch and, by all rights should have been married off by now like some medieval bride between competing merchants.  At least that had been her father's intention.  <i>I sure put a wrench in that plan, didn't I Daddy?</i>  She thought vilely before consciousness left her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, she dreamed of the sea and the smells floating to her from the mainland.  But the odors were not of foods or flowers or spices, but rather smoke.  She would wonder if the city were burning down, but she could see nothing beyond the horizon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pricilla floundered in the water.  The adipose filling her body which normally kept her aloft only now seemed to be dragging her down into the lightless depths.  Having never truely learned how to swim, Pricilla flailed her arms and legs, the thick folds of drooping flesh on her thighs rubbing, the heavy sacs of flesh hanging from her upper arms sliding across and hitting the expansive shelf of her side breasts to either side of her.  The effort was barely enough to keep her fat cheeks above the water and she soon tired.  Pricilla sank like a stone, unable to breathe.  She was drowning... dying...<br>\r\nSleep left her with a shuddering gasp.  The stoat could feel her overburdened heart pulsing rapidly in her neck.  Her head felt like it'd been caught in a vice and she put her palms against it, as if trying to keep her head from splitting open.  Breath rasping in the back of her fat congested throat, Pricilla reached for the plastic mask which covered her nose.  The tube reached up the length of her snout and over her head in a rather silly looking mask.  The tube was connected to a fan underneath the bed.  The mask combatted the stoat's rather severe sleep apnea with positive pressure forced into her nostrils to keep her airway open... except now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla tapped the mask and sucked air through her nose.  She listened for the quiet whine of the working fan, and heard nothing.  The battery must have died sometime during the night.  <i>\"Damnit..\"</i>  thought Pricilla wearily, her head pounding.  She took the small mask off from around her nose, her meaty upper arm fat brushing against her cheek as she moved her arm, and breathed deeply.  How many times had she stopped breathing in the night?  Her sleep apnea, caused by the tremendous weight on her chest from her sheer bulk had robbed her of most of the benefit of her nine hours of sleep.  As Pricilla lay there, panting like a dog and trying to calm her racing heart, it felt more like she'd gotten three or four hours of sleep instead.  Feeling miserable, Pricilla nonetheless needed to get up and out of bed.  She had more urgent matters to tend to, the call of nature being one, breaking her fast the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla proceeded to roll onto her side. The half ton ermine was secretly quite proud of her remaining ability to handle herself in bed. It seemed like a precious gift of independence where her weight was forcing itself ever deeper in her most private aspects of life. However as Pricilla pushed and pulled against her doughy ungainly body, she reflected that she was far from graceful in an act that most people took for granted.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPricilla's breasts were among the worst offenders. Starting on her belly, the half ton stout rolled onto her side, twisting her legs about so that she could get them over the side of the bed; since passing 800 lbs or so, she could no longer do this in one motion.  Her enourmous belly, breasts and ass dragged on the fabric of the bed as she moved.  The stoat preseed down with her arms to shift her upper body.  That in itself was a challenge because her chest was so wide around and her arms so thick as well.  Sometimes, she had to reach under one or both of the breast jutting out before her with her free arm to be able to reach the bed's surface.  Most of the work was resigned to her right arm, which was pinned under soft, fleshy flab.  Needless to say, with herself weighing well over 1000 lbs, it was a lot of work.  Nothing came easily or wanted to move easily and everything was rubbing against each other.  Her legs rubbed against her belly as well as themselves, her arms rubbed against ehr chest, her boobs and her face as well.  Her various creases opened, pinched or slapped together as she hussled her great weight the short distance to the side of the bed.  Both of her soft, heavy breasts were flat on the bed, so big were they.  Her right in the natural position, her left folding over it and touching the bottom of her thick, fleshy neck as well.  Pricilla had to push it up and away to get her left arm into a good position for a last push.  The skin of her belly and right breast pulled as she pushed away, bringing her legs over the side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came some more bending.  This time Pricilla had to bend at the waist.  The only problem was that she sported about 450 lbs of flesh where there should have been nothing.  Her gut got in the way, its heavy weight dragging over the comforter.  The stoat shoved against it with her hands until she felt it pressing against her thighs.  Now the hard part.  The ermine with the vast white tummy had to lift herself against the force of gravity into the sitting position.  She lacked the strength to do this directly.  Instead, Pricilla had to roll about, using her weight in a positive way as much as possible.  The weight of her ass helped imesely in the process.  Swinging herself around, folding her great belly tight ahead of her, Pricilla reached the sitting position.  She felt gravity's tug anew, pulling down on all of her creases as he bulk shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs were titanic in size and spread her legs apart like a man's for her.  However, her belly was still vast enough to touch the comforter to either side of her; quite heavily, in fact, several inches of pudge resting on the soft surface.  Her knees spread, though also covered by her apron of white fatty fur, the front of herself flowed down and out, so that the bottom rested below the halfway point on her calf.  Pricilla lifted and pulcked at her bellly and torso rolls where the flesh pinched uncomfortably.  Her arms hung from her elbows because of the girth of her chest.  She took several deep breaths and adjusted her left breast which had swung back into its usual position.  She was evenly porportioned, but those portions were quite large.  Both breast hung roundly to her third torso roll of the six she sported in total.  The sag was not so great - she was only twenty-four, remember - so much as they were just <i>big.</i>  The huge jugs were no small reason as to why she had to sleep on her stomach and why she needed a sleep apnea mask in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla planted her palms on the smooth, soft surface of her love handles, her widest point.  The furtermost reach of the flowing skin was actually just beyond her reach now as she sat there.  She shuffled her titanic caboose on the bed forward until her feet - appearing small and delicate in the scope of the rest of her, despite the fact that she wore a size 12 - touched the carpet.  She rubbed her soft pads against the carpet before adding more weight.  She shuffled forward a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer target lay ahead of her.  A stout metal bar as one would find in a hospital or a handicap stall of a public restroom, bolted into the wall and running along the length of it to a wide double door leading out of the dim bedroom.  Pricilla took several more deep breaths.  This year, more than previous years, she was aware of the danger.  Denise herself said that she should be present from the time she awoke to assist her, but Pricilla refused.  She wanted to hold onto this for herself alone... for as long as possible.  So, despite the fact that a fall now could very well seriously injure her, Pricilla pushed off from the bed, letting her great belly carry her forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe locked her knees as soon as possible.  As the legs straightened, she could feel her paunch slide across the furred surface of her thighs.  The bottom of her extensive belly lifted... slightly.  The bottom curve still dropped below her knees.  Her belly button transformed from a gaping hole in which someone could easily fit their closed fist into a long vertical slit.  The rolls lining her long weasel's torso shifted as well.  The whole of herself wobbled unsteadily as she rocked, supporting her own weight.  Her center of gravity was as tiny as a pea.  Pricilla tottered.  One step, then two.  She shuffled her feet like an infant.  It was actually scary how unbanlenced she felt.  The stout held her arms straight out at the sides and lurched forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a long breath when she grasped the handrail with a white knucled paw.  Safe.  Gripping it, she waddled slowly into her own bathroom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Step by step, Pricilla waddled towards the open doors.  She lurched, her shoulders tottering back and forth, because of the thickness of her thighs forcing her legs apart; she felt the rolls there rub against one another, more so around her knees than near her crotch.  Pricilla walked, or rather hobbled with a lot of weight on her left arm, which gripped the handrail tightly.  She needed to, it was all too easy to lose her grip with more than half a ton of flab wavering around a tiny center of gravity.  At her arm, her plump forarm creased at her wrist and the upper arm fat sagged down low over her elbow which was little more than a dimple on her thick, meaty arm at this point.  Her arm was so thick, she had a nice, deep \"Y\" crease at the joint, even when it was almost fully extended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla hardly thought about this, however.  Walking required her full attention.  She grunted and puffed as she moved her oh-so-heavy body.  At no time was any of this easy or taken for granted for her; not anymore.  She thought only of keeping balenced on her feet and where she would be sitting next.  The transition to cold tile floor hurt the molting ermine's soft pink pads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom was lavish and beautiful.  It sported a tile floor with a clean, elegant design and the rose pearl color of the walls leant the room a warm color.  Pricilla had an arsenal of lotions and skin creams and powders, most of which she kept on the counters for easy access.  This lent the counters around the sink a somewhat cluttered appearance.  The glass cubicle at the far end of the bathroom dominated the availible space.  Pricilla, however followed the handrail to the nearest sitting location, her comode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set her great cheeks down carefully and mostly by memory, seeing as she could not exactly turn and look to see what she was doing.  Two steel medical cabinets had been rolled in to either side of the large, expensive, though standard toilet.  Pricilla needed the extra seating width or else several hundred pounds of flab would hang over the sides of the toilet, leading to severe discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProper toilet hygeine was probably one of the biggest and most embarresing problems Pricilla had encountered since exiting mere \"moridly obese\" and finding herself a truly and unusually super-sized individual.  She had been on the verge of having her body servant wiping her ass for her.  But then, while surfing the internet one day, she'd come across the solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toilet was japanese and the fact that its water tank was low slung and allowed her rear end to flow slightly over it from behind, as well as out to the sides was the smallest conveniance.  The toilet had a control panel affixed to the wall at her right.  It would lift its seat on demand if she needed it to; not that she really needed that particular feature.  However, as much as Americans would like to believe otherwise, there were alternatives to such basic things as toilet paper which are ubiquitous in the States.  One of those alternatives is the bidet and the japanese toilet happened to not only have one built it, it was also robotic and could be controlled remotely.  Pricilla was freed from a singular humiliation by brilliant Japanese science and culture.  She was by now used to the tickle of the stream of water - which could be temperature controlled in this model - as well as the stream of air which dried her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was drying herself, Pricilla fumbled under her right breast for her cell phone.  She kept it high up and in the middle, fortunately and her breast was so massive that it rarely fell out of that crook.  She looked up Denise's number with a single press to the touch screen.  The stoat texted the lithe weasel with one hand.  \"Shower-time.\"  the message said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5-minutes\"  came the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla looked down at the thing in her hand, small compared to the scope of her body around it.  When she was done, she got up laboriously, using both handrails to either side of her.  She moved carefully to the sink and set her phone in its charger.  The half ton female opened the door to the large shower stall one handed, still gripping the hand rail.  She eyed the menacing distance for a moment.  Then, tail waving on her buttocks behind her, she managed the distance, holding onto the shower stall frame at the half way point before plopping her wide rear onto a tiled shelf which lined the opposite wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a few deep breaths to steady herself.  She still didn't feel 100% since her mask had failed some time during the night.  After turning on the hot water, the stoat let her eyelids droop for a few moments as steam began to fill the room.  She leaned her head back against the wall, the tile feeling chill against the hotdog rolls behind her head.  She cupped her breasts with both hands in a natural relaxed position and felt the hot water running down before her warm the air and dampen her calves and the front of her belly.  She reached down and scratched at her side, as rearward as she could reach.  Some brown fur came away under her claws.  A few weeks more and she'd turn completely white.  Pricilla sighed and closed her eyes.  The passage of time seemed tiresome sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally she'd get started before Denise arrived.  However, she was feeling out of it and did nothing but let the water run as the minutes ticked by.  Eventually, Pricilla heard the door to her room open and a few seconds later, Denise appeared in the bathroom doorway.  The thin, long bodied weasel was dressed in a two piece bathing suit; polka-dot in Denise's usually terrible fashion sense.  Her ears perked and she grinned at seeing Pricilla through the foggy glass.  The massive stoat deigned to open her eyes at the energetic intruder.  \"Good morning!\" said Denise in a perky voice as she stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla waited until the weasel had opened the door and slipped into the stall before speaking.  \"Can we skip it today?  My mask turned off last night and I'm feeling groggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise who, after all, was a trained nurse, flowed forward.  \"Your CPAP shut off?\"  she asked in a worried voice as she peered into Pricilla's bloodshot eyes and placed a hand under the fleshy folds of her neck to feel her pulse without so much as a whisper of permission.  \"Why didn't you call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just found out this morning.\"  waving the overreacting weasel off.  Now she was regretting even mentioning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise put a hand on her waist.  \"That's dangerous for you, Pricilla.  Do you understand what could happen if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla waved her paw again, opening and closing her palm in a \"yak-yak\" gesture.  \"Yeah, yeah.  I know.  I get the concept of not waking up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\"  Denise snorted and tilted her slender hips the other way.  \"Sometimes you make me wonder.\"  she chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!  I get it.  Can we please just get on with this so I can get my breakfast?\"  said Pricilla, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise eyed her after retriving the loofa on a stick from where it hung on the wall.  The weasel had entered the steaming spray and was already soaking, the water smoothing her brown fur along her long body.  She wapped the handle of the loofa a couple times against her opposite hand like a teacher's pointer as she stared down her charge who outmassed her eight times over.  \"Not until you promise you'll call me if this sort of thing happens again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla frowned at the weasel's insolence.  \"I'll have you know that my father-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise cut her off when she placed the loofa at the stoat's roundly hanging neck wattle.  \"You're father doesn't pay me to take unnecessary risks.  Do you have any idea what he'd do to me if you died under my care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise was older than Pricilla by five years and sometimes she felt like an older sister.  Now, however, Pricilla thought she was acting more like her mother.  \"You don't have anything to worry about, Denise.\" Pricilla drawled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loofa pressed a little harder into her copius neck meat.  \"Then you have nothing to lose by making me this promise.\"  Denise said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I promise, OK?  Jesus, let's just get this over with, I'm starving!\"  complained Pricilla, finally liting an arm to bat away the offending loofa.  She was too slow, however, as Denise pulled it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, my lady.\"  said Denise with a mock bow and pulled the shower spout from its socket.  She pointed it at Pricilla and promptly doused her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoat's expanding weight made for a downward spiral in personal hygeine.  The fat swaddling her torso and arms decreased her mobility and her ability to bend and reach.  At the same time, the fat expanding from her body generating numerous rolls and cavities in the skin all over the place as well as her simple girth ensured that there was more of her to clean than ever.  At this point, even with a loofa on a long stick, Pricilla could only hope to clean her head, breasts, the top of her belly and the six rolls lining her side; well technically, six on the right side, five on the left.  Everything else was out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise, having worked with Pricilla for the last three years, was now intimately familiar with her boss's daughter's body.  Soaping up the loofa, she bent her back to the task at hand.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Denise was brisk and businesslike with a task that might have made other people squeamish.  The other female weasel seemed not to think much of Pricilla's nakedness nor even the fact that over half a ton of excess flesh had expanded her body into a maze of creases and folds, all of which needed to be clean and pampered with skin treatments to prevent detrimental chafing, jock itch and yeast infections all of which Pricilla was very prone to without proper prevention.  She'd had to learn this the hard way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne would have thought that Pricilla's body would appear hideous what with her gratuitous width, lack of neck, the many rolls folding over her sides and back and that gut!  Not even mentioning her globular, sagging ass dimpled with so much cellulite that it was visble through the fur or the \"vaginas\" she had in place of elbows where the upper arm fat bulged out and sagged below the joint.  But apparently Denise didn't seem to see this.  All the slender weasel saw was a task to be performed and she did her task well, weilding her loofa and sponge with champion grace and a surprising amount of force from such a mild looking creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to say that Denise was delicate in the slightest.  For a weasel she had some meat on her and not all of it was chub.  She was 145 lbs though she didn't exactly share this with Pricilla often.  Usually specific weights were in catagory of things they simply didn't talk about.  Where Pricilla sat, Denise stood and then later crouched, shoving the loofa home into the - sometimes tight- rolls lining her side.  She stopped about 45 degrees facing her back which was a seperate job.  During this time, Denise handed Pricilla a soapy sponge as the water continued to fall down in the middle of the chamber, closer to Denise than Pricilla now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not getting out of it that easily.\"  said Denise<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla only grunted and took the sponge.  The overstuffed stoat used it on her boobs and under them; which in itself took up a lot of time considering their round breadth and heft.  Her father, when he was feeling cruel, said that they were going to hang to her waist when she was older if she didn't do something about her weight.  Pricilla could feel the stretch marks under the fur on the upper portions of her chest, but thankfully, the skin hadn't seemed to start a downward march... yet.  If they reached to her second torso roll, it was just because they were <i>really big</i>.  Pricilla's girls bulged roundly outwards from her chest, that wasn't saying that she didn't need support to help with the sagging that was there, but even without, the stoat sported an impressive cleavage that cleft her chest most of the way down their length.  It took Pricilla's entire arm length to reach the front of each massive mammary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that Denise had moved on to the rolls lining the other side of Pricilla's body, the lavish ermine had moved on to her arms, which were far easier than her breasts.  Even when Pricilla lifted her arms over her head, her thick upper arm flesh draped heavily over the pancake-flat surface of the side of her breast.  She needed to really shove the sponge home underneath the heavy curtain, but this was easier said than done given the width of her chest.  It was getting to the point where the stoat couldn't reach across the girth of her chest to her opposite armpit.  Somedays it seemed like she could get it in all the way... but not today.  With a sigh, she asked Denise to do it for her; the weasel happily obliged, shoving the soapy loofa into the dark crease under her arm.<br>\r\nPricilla moved onto her belly and her face as Denise worked on her back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoat had to shift herself on her solid tile shelf to allow Denise to climb behind, armed with the shower-head between her dainty canines.  She hummed as she worked.  Pricilla didn't know exactly how to feel about this.  Certainly not the average person had to be handled in such a private and base way and on a daily basis.  Denise did not complain and did her job happily, but it was this very impersonalness which irked her.  Pricilla, when Denise touched her with the loofa and rubbed the soap into her fur with her paws felt more like an <i>object</i> than a person, much less a woman.  Granted, it would be even more weird and undesirable if Denise were \"into\" it or something similar.  Pricilla shuddered at the thought; it'd be almost like getting raped everyday.  But still, sometimes Pricilla thought she was just being hosed down like a racehorse.  In the end, however, she just didn't know how to feel.  It was not as bad as it could have been, she supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise climbed down and got to her knees on the floor before Pricilla for the most difficult part.  \"Ready?\" she asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla grunted and leaned back until she felt the wet tile behind her head and shoulders.  Denise grabbed the lowermost part of Pricilla's apron and heaved it up against her shoulder.  She let out a feminine grunt and hefted it still higher.  Still the heavy paunch rested mostly on her thighs.  Denise walked on her knees a bit foward between Pricilla's legs and shoved her loofa into the airless folds under her paunch and between her legs.  The showerhead, on its long hose, followed after.  Pricilla sighed at the sensation of the water running between her legs while the rest of her slowly dried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard work for Denise and Pricilla had to help as well. Her live-in nurse told her to lift her up her tummy and the stoat complied, gripping her paunch with both hands and straining backward with Denise lifting from below. It probably would have taken a man's strength to lift the damn thing properly for the job, however the thought of a man here doing this was intolerable to Pricilla; and her father as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla had massive folds on her inner thighs that sagged diagonally and rubbed against each other.  Even when she spread her legs as far as she could, the innermost bulges still touched.  The lower most sagged below her knees, sometimes even hitting her calves when she walked.  Both knees were lost inside folds of molting soon-to-be white fur, with a huge belly stretching over them as well.  Everything needed to doused and cleaned out.  Denise paused to apply more soap to her loofa stick, the weight of Pricilla's paunch resting on her shoulders.  Steadily, the female weasel worked her way inward, the folds growing tighter and more congested as she moved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a large fat pad which rested on top of Pricilla's genitals.  At first, it had grown to form a \"Y\" fold with her touching thighs.  Apparently, it had kept growing long after the time had past when Pricilla could examine her crotch by lifting her paunch and long past the time when she could feel it with exploring fingertips.  Denise lifted up and the half ton stoat shivered with the contact to the region.  She hissed threw her teeth and stifled a whimper at the feel of the shower head brushing over regions lower still.  Now was the only time when the ermine felt any stimulation down there anymore.  It seemed intense, even though it was just water and the handler was female; embarrassingly intense because Denise was as platonic as they came.  Pricilla just held her breath and focused on lifting her paunch up a little higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling past as the Denise let down the fleshy pad and moved up and to the side, getting at the last crease where her paunch was attached to her abdomen.  Pricilla licked her chops, at once grateful that the unwanted passion had fled and yet also hungering for something which she had lost with her escalating weight.  It was not as if she could masturbate by herself anymore.  Asking anyone else was taboo, be they employee or family member. Pricilla had just resigned herself to living a celibate existence long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Denise crawled out from under her paunch, the shower was pretty much complete.  The more slender weasel shut of the water and handed the stoat a towel before proceeding to her back.  Pricilla pulled the towel under her breasts and rubbed it against the top of her belly while Denise used hers on the many folds of her back which was both long and very wide.  By the end of it, Pricilla was standing so Denise could dry her rear and they had gone through no less than seven towels which lay damp on the tile shelf for Denise to later take down to the laundry room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla sat down on a towel, moving her tail out of the way as her blubbery cheeks dropped like beef shanks.  Denise, attempting to stifle a small sigh of fatigue inexpertly, moved out of the shower stall.  Pricilla watched the weasel's curvacious hips sway with an easy grace; long-bodied and shorter legged than other species, Denise swaggered in an extra-feminine way, tail waving.  Pricilla might have matched the gait... if she were literally 1,000 pounds lighter.  She returned with bottles and ointments from the counter.  These she set on the shelf before wiping her still wet forehead.  She smiled and handed Pricilla the lotion, whiskers twitching.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pricilla managed a smile of her own.  While she was applying moisterizer to her arms and the areas she could reach, Denise once again went diving.  This time to apply powder inbetween Pricilla's now dry legs and under her prodigeous belly.  It seemed an odd time to speak, what with several hundred pounds of fatty gut over her, but Denise did so anyway.  \"So what are your plans for today, Pricilla?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beyond breakfast?\"  asked the single minded stoat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\"  said the weasel sarcastically, throwing a few extra syllables into the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I went swimming yesterday...\"  started the obese ermine as she buttered up her round, flabby cheeks and bilious neck roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Kaczar says you should go swimming everyday.\"  reminded the weasel who seemed to have a painfully perfect memory for these sorts of details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla decided to ignore the comment, because she could.  \"...So I guess I'll sit on the couch... and stuff.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel poked her head out from under the horizon of Pricilla's belly like a meerkat from its burrow.  The live-in nurse flashed the spoiled stoat a dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla laughed nervously, which caused her belly to wobble and forced Denise to adjust her grip on it from below.  \"Denise!  What do you expect me to say?  That I plan on going for a hike today?\"  Denise's round ear twitched and she cocked her head.  Pricilla spoke a little more firmly.  \"I plan on sitting my fat ass on that couch and catching up on some of my shows and then I'll probably finish that drawing like I was meaning to on my tablet, and then maybe some blogging...?\"  Denise opened her mouth to speak, but Pricilla blundered on,  \"I don't know!  I don't like planning my days.  You ought to know that by now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla waved a sausage fingered hand at her and Denise's ears fell just slightly.  She snorted a little through her nose and said.  \"I do know that.  I've been living here for three years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla crossed her arms, or rather, laid her forearms against each other.  \"Then I don't know why you bother asking.\"  said the stoat in a chiding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise let down her belly suddenly and it slapped against her calves and the tile she was sitting on.  All of that fatty connective tissue falling like that pulled on Pricilla's insides, causing her to gasp.  she glared at Denise, a hand on her chest and mouth open, suddenly breathing heavily.  Denise looked at her firmly and said.  \"Because I care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat rendered even the pompous ungracious stoat silent for a few moments as she recovered from the sudden belly drop.  Denise offered her a hand.  \"Come on.  Let's get you dressed and out to the living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Pricilla walked, one hand on the hand rail and one in Denise's paw back out of the steamy bathroom.  The air in the bedroom, dry and cold, chilled the lotion still drying in Pricilla's slightly damp fur.  When Pricilla left the safety of the handrail, she did so cautiously.  She couldn't lean on Denise like she could Lorenzo and his solid equine muscle.  Still, Denise was not a frail lilly and could help her with her balence as she shuffled across the carpet; she gripped her hand tightly.  It was still better than a cane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla set 1,100 pounds of fattened stoat down gratefully on a long, sturdy leather-bound ottoman at the foot of her bed.  It was almost long enough so that her belly didn't flow over its sides... almost.  Denise went into the stoat's closet.  Pricilla hadn't been in there in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rich ermine stroked her round, sagging collar of fat thoughtfully, the ceiling fan rotating above ruffling her mostly white fur.  \"What about the blue mumu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\"  cried Denise from the closet.  Pricilla could hear her ruffling through the various garments, most of which were too small for her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla put her fists against her fourth belly rolls.  \"Why not?  It's comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you look like my grandmother in that thing!\"  said Denise, she poked her head out the side of the door, grinning openmouthed so Pricilla could see all four canines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla huffed and turned her head away.  \"Well, what do you suggest, oh Queen of Fashion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise emerged, holding high billowing garments which for her could litterally have served as small tents.  \"How about these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla frowned.  \"No.\"  she said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise looked again at her selection.  \"What's the matter?  How about the green top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the weasel could turn, Pricilla said, \"It's too much trouble getting into and out of.\"  Denise now frowned, and put a hand on her hip.  Pricilla showed her teeth.  \"It's my house and I don't see why I can't walk around her nude if I wanted to!\"  And that was the truth.  At this point, Pricilla felt more comfortable in her own skin than she did with often ill-fitting cloth draped over her.  She was so huge that all of her clothing that still fit had to be custom made - usually in Germany - and still she thought that nobody could really design clothing that fit her well; mostly because hardly anyone was her size and could tell them what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise stuck her tongue out at her.  \"You'd frighten away half the staff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\"  cried Pricilla, waving an arm which wobbled greatly.  \"It's time we got some fresh meat in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise smirked and looked at the ground, shaking her head.  \"Don't be lazy, you'll look great in the green top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla sighed and relented, only because it was easier than continuing to fight.  \"Fine, fine.  Whatever you say, Denise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise let loose a little squeal and went back to fetch the other garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, she was kneeling on the bed and pulling back with all her strength on the back of Pricilla's bra.  The stoat held up her breasts, but the underwire was cutting into her.  The creamy tops of her breast spilled generously over the cups which were large enough to hold cannon balls.  \"Are you <i>trying</i> to gut me, Denise?\"  Pricilla complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise grunted and finally got the hooks in place with a final shove of effort.  \"You're the one who insists... on wearing these things so tightly.\"  she panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla gestured to her extended cleavage and said,  \"Well, as you can see, I need a lot of support.\"  When Denise let go, the cutting sensation eased, but she could still feel the pressure of it under her more than generous chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise waved her off.  \"Yeah, and you out grow them every two months, like you've out grown this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was an exaggeration.  One of these imported, reinforced bras was good for at least... four or five months.  \"I don't mind if it's a little tight.\"  insisted Pricilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise lifted her eyes to the seated stoat.  \"They aren't going to sag if you get something that actually fit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla snarled.  She'd cut right to the heart of the matter.  Her father's cruel words dug into her brain and refused to leave, his harsh criticisms of her and her extreme weight remaining with her long after she herself had thought them forgotten.  But wasn't there truth to what he said?  There stretchmarks on her chest were evidence and honestly, how could she expect her skin alone to support all of that weight?  Pricilla was horrified by the prospect of having grandma tits by the time she was 30.  \"Just give me the shirt.\"  she said roughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise tossed her it and zipped it up the back.  The top showed Pricilla's neck and shoulder's, but was fairly high cut.  The green fabric crossed in front of her, the left side over the right, just below her left shoulder.  The fabric was loose, light and billowy.  The long shirt came down nearly to her knees... which meant that her belly still showed generously under it when she stood.  denise helped her into khaki colored bottoms.  There were also loose and billowy, almost like a dress, though there were two seperate leggings.  The crotch on these was quite low, but still slid up between the lowermost touching thigh bulges.  The fabric there actually helped with the rubbing, however.  the bottoms thankfully had a totally elastic waistband.  Pricilla grunted when she had the thing in place.  \"Happy now?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise moved from her other side where she'd been helping to lift the bottoms into place.  \"Yes.\"  she said smugly, then added.  \"You look great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla snorted in amusement at the idea.  \"Sure.\"  she said noncomittaly. \"Now let me get some breakfast before I faint here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise tittered and helped Pricilla to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nPricilla walked with a hand against the wall down the hallway she mostly filled.  Her belly flowed out ahead of her where she walked and her ass jutted out behind.  Both shook and wobbled with each step as she walked down the hallway, forcing her knees and legs to support her more than half ton.  The clothes she wore flowed and billowed around her, which was good.  However, the stoat, having become contemptuous of clothing in general since passing the legendary 1,000 lb mark, could not help but feel that she would have been even less restricted nude, or nearly so, as she often was when she was wearing her bathing suit.<br>\r\nHer right paw ran smoothly along the wall, to steady herself as she walked.  the carpet kept her soft foot pads from hurting, but the hallway was definitely the longest distance that she moved nowadays.  It was honestly a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla did not move around enough anymore to actually get tired; the sole exception being perhaps in the pool.  But she did cramp easily.  It started in the knees.  By the time they both came to the end of the hallway, Pricilla was aching in her knees and lower back as well.  Dr. Kaczar had told her repeatedly when she complained of pain associated with standing and walking that her body was simply not designed to be carrying around an extra 1,000 lbs everywhere she went and that the only way to make it stop was to lose weight.  Pricilla, however found an alternate solution.  It was called ibuprofen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, once she reached the couch, she wouldn't need it anymore.  There was just that\u2026 rather large looking gap between the hallway and the long sofa where she could rest her extremely sizable ass for the next several hours.  Pricilla licked her chops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside her, Denise gripped her comanion's hand.  All told, Pricilla was only about five inches taller than the motley brown weasel despite their vast difference in size.  Her body servant stood to her side some distance away, although she was, in fact, almost touching her flank; being this large was odd in certain ways like that.  Pricilla hadn't told anyone yet that she was having increasing difficulty in crossing open spaces unsupported, but Denise was always there with her, and she noticed.  She squeezed her paw and asked.  \"Ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla sniffed and let her hand fall from the wall.  It was not like her knees or back were getting any less painful.  She lurched forward with her heavy right leg, feeling it rub against the left near the knee over the fabric.  A globular ass cheek which sagged over half a foot down the back of her thigh shifted behind her and her paunch stuttered across the front of her thighs.  She moved her shoulders as well to help balance herself.  A single step was a whole body experience for Pricilla.  Already moving and holding onto Denise as hard as she dared, the stoat said.  \"Yeah, just tell Fredrick that I'm in the mood for eggs\u2026 lots of eggs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise stood beside her, leaning away with her - relatively - scant weight to help with Pricilla's balance.  She grinned, though showed a few too many teeth.  \"Heh, Alright Pricilla, I'll tell him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when her bottom was safely deposited on the sofa could Pricilla relax.  She spent some amount of time shifting her butt on the couch, sorting out where the skin pinched uncomfortably.  Discomfort was not to be tolerated.  Pricilla did not plan on moving from this spot from some time; in fact, she'd spent whole days, and some nights, on the couch, more times than she really cared to remember.  As Denise left to tell the chef of Pricilla's order, the stoat use the remote that the weasel had handed to her and went straight to the DVR to watch her recorded programs.  When the first came on, \"Distressed Housewives,\" she slid the remote through the collar of her shirt and into her cleavage.  She'd sooner have hidden it under her right breast as was her habit, but then Denise had talked her into wearing clothes, hadn't she?  Pricilla sighed and felt her heart rate slow after the stress of walking the distance here from her bedroom on the other side of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsently, Pricilla fondled a belly roll at her side through the shirt as she watched the drama take place on screen.  It was soft, plump and squeezable and Pricilla just like the feeling of something in her primary hand.  Denise returned from the kitchen, not with omelets - which would be a while longer - but with a plate of pastries.  \"Fredrick baked these this morning.\"  said Denise, taking one of the flaky folded things from the plate and handing the rest to Pricilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they?\"  asked the stoat, but she had already lifted the plate and set it on the broad surface of her left breast.  She picked one up with her right paw and sniffed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apple turnovers.\"  said Denise.  She bit into hers.  \"Fredrick is a pretty good baker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's alright.\"  said Pricilla with about as much praise as she gave anything aloud.  Her first bite finished half of the first turnover.  Denise was nibbling by comparison.  Pricilla tasted the sweet and tart apple filling and closed her eyes, savoring it and feeling the familiar hunger take hold, seeming to flow up from her brain stem.  She finished the pastry with her second bite before she was even done chewing the fist.  Then she had a second in a meaty paw.  When Pricilla spoke a few crumbs flew out of her mouth and down onto the surface of her chest and tummy.  \"Fredrick has a knack for predicting my tastes before I know them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise frowned at Pricilla's messy manners and fetched a napkin out of a pocket of her blouse;  after three years she was prepared for her job.  As she dusted some of the crumbs off of Pricilla's nice shirt, she said, \"I would agree with you, but I have yet to see Fredrick make anything that you refused to eat!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a subtle prod in Denise's words, but Pricilla let it slide.  She accepted jabs from Denise that she would not have taken from anyone else, except her father.  Pricila snorted affronted, putting a paw to her meaty chest.  \"I just happen to think that Fredrick is that good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the weasel's eyes said that she'd like to say more, Denise relented, not wanting to push her luck.  \"I'll admit, that dog is good at what he does.\"  The weasel took her seat again to Pricilla's left where the couch bent at a 90 degree angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla grinned, showing a single slender canine and turned back to her show.  Soon Denise got up again to retrieve the omelets.  The stoat's keen nose had her swallowing her saliva before they even arrived.  Pricilla put two heaping plates on each breast.  Each plate had two omlettes simply stuffed with cheese, ham onions and mushrooms, just the way Pricilla liked.  The stoat felt the hunger inside of her like a dam giving way.  She might have even used her fingers to eat, except that the omelets were piping hot and also Denise would disapprove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla was able to calm her ravenous stuffing of her face after two of the plate filling omlettes were safely tucked away inside of her.  Only now that her hunger was sated was Pricilla now free to savor the remaining two omeletes.  This philosophy when it came to food was one of the reasons why Pricilla enjoyed large quantities of identical foodstuffs.  She pointed her fork at the television when she was halfway done through her third omelette.  \"These woman are all whores.\"  she commented and managed at least to not fleck food in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise, who had been silent this whole time brightened at the cue that they were now talking; Pricilla was very non-communicative when she was busy horking down food at the beginning of her meals.  The weasel tilted her head thoughtfully.  \"Well, I think that Gaby Solestra is definitely a whore, but Brea is just trying to hold her familiy together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla stuck another large chunk of buttery egg and cheese into her mouth and swallowed hugely, though the bulge was not so visible going down for the huge curved wattle she sported.  \"Are you kidding me?  She slept with that glasses guy. What a nerd!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was dark and she thought he was her husband because he was wearing his cologne...\"  contradicted Denise.  Smiling and laughing, the two shared a rather silly conversation that lasted all the way through the collected episodes.  In the same time, Pricilla ordered two more omeletes, this time with steak and hashbrowns and salsa (on the side), as well as a new batch of apple turnovers.  Denise cleared the plates as soon as they were produced.  She wasn't a maid - persay - so she didn't wash them, she just put them in the sink for her.  By the time the episodes ran out and the raunchy talking puttered off, it was time for...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Denise had to leave.  She was still in medical school, after all and took the job at the Blacklake house largely to pay for her college tuition; and live in California of course.  The last thing that Denise did before walking out the door and taking her little Saturn down to the university was grab Pricilla's laptop and tablet as well as her now charged cell phone from her room and bring them out to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  said Pricilla perfunctorily.  The cell phone went into her clevage along with the remote for the television.  The laptop and tablet went on top of her wide belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care, Pricilla.\"  said Denise as she grabbed her purse.  She headed towards the door.  \"If you need anything, don't hesitate to give Lorenzo or me a call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla smilled and nodded without turning her head.  Due to the thickness of her neck, she couldn't really look over her shoulder anymore.  She heaved a sigh when the heavy wooden front door closed with a loud thud.  The only noise in the house was the television and Fredrick in the kitchen loading the dishwasher.  The hours to come seemed to stretch before the half ton stoat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla scratched under her fourth belly roll at her right side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... better get to it.\"  she muttered to herself and opened her laptop, taking her tablet in her right hand.  She moved her left hand on the computer's touch pad with her left and opened her drawing program.  Typing was hard without a wireless keyboard because for Pricilla, getting both hands close enough together to type was inherantly uncomfortable.  Fortunately, she only needed one hand to work on the tablet and her left could use the mouse on the computer.  Her belly was so broad, she could actually move the macbook from the middle to the left side, right under her breast supported by her tight, straining bra and still have it sit flat.  As for the tablet, she wedged the bottom portion of it just under the edge of her right breast, she she could work the pen freely with her hand.  The end of the electronic pen glowed blue; full power.  Pricilla brought up the file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her laptop appeared a mostly completed image.  He was a Wild Painted Dog.  Pricilla had his head and shoulders in a classic portrait pose, however the way she'd drawn him, he appeared to be constructed from dozens of different magazine clippings moved close together and overlapping each other to form a single whole picture.  She'd spent a lot of time on his eyes, the right was blue in a yellow furred face, the left was brown on black.  He had slightly uneven ears, ears from two different dogs.  His thin muzzle was contructed of at least five different dogs, or at least that was what the picture seemed to suggest.  Surrounding his head were letters from the magazines they'd been ripped from, many \"R\"'s and \"L\"'s.  Some of the complete words included \"Instant Results\" and \"Guaranteed\" and \"Weight L-\" as well as a McDonald's logo.  His expression seemed somber... as though he were trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla frowned, not happy with the way his face was coming.  He was supposed to look smug, confident.  That was the point of this project.  He was supposed to be the \"Perfect Man\" and Pricilla's message as the artist was that there was no such thing.  No, his face was still not quite right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking on that picuture ate a couple hours as Pricilla sat there, her ass slowly sinking into the couch while the television blared daytime television.  She plugged the pen back into the side of the tablet.  She was sick of working on her drawing; her fans online were going to have to wait for another day to see it.  She was also sick of watching the television.  Pricilla was desperately bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gut rumbled deep inside her cavernous abdomen.  Pricilla remembered that she got hungry when she was bored.  Twisting her head against the thick neck and shoulder fat which seemed intent on cementing her face forward, Pricilla turned to look in the direction of the kitchen.  Her heavy neck wattle dragged on the surface of her chest.  She didn't hear anything.  \"Fredrick?!\"  she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nothing.  Pricilla eased her head forward again and took a heavy breath through her mouth.  She rested her right hand on the mound of her breast, feeling through the dress where the top of the reinforced cup was spilling over with fatty mammary with her fingertips.  She contemplated the worth of getting up and walking to the kitchen. It'd been a while since she'd last done that... months actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked again at the distance between there and the couch... it looked <i>long.</i>  For a brief moment, Pricilla was aware that she had labeled the distance between two ajacent rooms \"long\" and was astonished by it.  Then the moment passed and Pricilla remembered that she weighed 1,100 lbs and that her doctor was continueally amazed that she could walk at all.  Her stomach growled again and she put a hand on the curve of her tummy swelling below her breasts.  She rubbed the taut flat surface absently.  She really wanted a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could have simply called Fredrick, or failing that, Lorenzo.  That was the reason why she had her cell phone secured in the depths of her clevage after all; that and in case she had a heart attack or something.  But she didn't really want to bother with the hassle of waiting for them to show up, explaining what she wanted and having to talk to them.  Pricilla didn't really like talking with anyone, except maybe Denise, but she didn't really count.  \"I just want a snack...\"  Pricilla whined to the universe in general.  It was unfair.  She'd gotten very good at snacking between meals and as a result?  She couldn't even fetch her own snacks!  That was ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, all that distance.  All that distance and no wall or handrail to lean on; her father forbid there being handrails in the rest of the house.  Ocasionally he had company here and he didn't want it to look like an invalid's dwelling.  That, in spite of the fact that an invalid lived here 24/7 and could have really used some more simple features planted around the house at large.  Pricilla stared at the carpet between her and the kitchen like the Sahara spreading out before her.  Her gut growled again...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Against her better judgement, Pricilla decided to go for it.  She was not sure what had gotten into her.  Three weeks ago, she'd actually skipped lunch in favor of just sitting on the damn couch from 9:00 am to 7:00 pm.  Granted, then she'd been finishing her previous project in an enthralling blast of creativity while hopped up on Venti caramel frappuccino which Denise had to keep fetching from Starbucks and she'd made up the lost meal with an extra massive dinner.  But still, now she was willing to get up just to raid the cabinets and fridge for whatever crackers and shit she could find; maybe some cheese and deli meat as well.  What was up with that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla wasn't sure.  All she knew was that she wanted something from the kitchen... <i>now.</i>  And she didn't want to call Fredrick or Lorenzo either.  Even if it meant she was risking a fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up was probably the hardest part.  If Pricilla had been sitting on a solid surface, she could have just leaned forward and let her belly carry her forward onto her feet.  However, after years of abuse, the cushions under the stoat sank and Pricilla was actually leaning backwards not just a little bit.  The mostly white ermine rocked herself right and left.  However not all of her was cooperating.  It was still a little new just how wide she was.  It was a fact that Pricilla was actually so wide and blubbery that when she twisted, her outlying regions actually didn't move imediately.  As a result, when the stoat turned to the right, she could feel her fatty flank smush and crinkle at her side, away from the movement.  At the same time, her left side dragged, a massive dead weight.  It tired the out-of-shape stoat out quickly despite the fact she was only 24 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was a good thing she was so young.  It was probably only because of the advantages of youth that she was able to heave herself out of the blasted sofa before she gave up.  She wobbled a bit when she was on her feet at last and gulped air through her mouth.  It rasped a little in her throat nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoat's belly was a curving horizon visible just over the mounds of her breasts and stretched from far right to far left.  Her arms hung from her elbows because of the girth of her chest and her waist was even greater around.  Despite this, Pricilla slid her right foot over the carpet, her pads not quite leaving the fuzzy surface, and shifted her weight.  She took a deep breath and slowly turned, heading towards the portal leading to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt actually wasn't so bad... at first.  The distance across the big living room and to the kitchen was not as long as the hallway, after all.  Pricilla shuffled slowly, dragging her paws on the carpet and feeling soft round bulges of flesh roll across one another between her knees.  They dragged and shook with each step, similar to the way her paunch dragged and wobbled where it rocked over her thighs down to just below her knees.  Her love handles flowed as she shifted her weight side to side for each step; she honestly moved more from side to side in her very heavy waddle than she got forward motion.  Where her breasts were spilling over the large - though still too small - cups of her tight bra, the skin quivered more than enough to be seen through the dress.  Pricilla breathed heavily through her mouth.  Each step was a conscious effort and felt like weight training. She went slow and deliberately, arms out to the side for balence.  She grimaced slightly.  A year ago, she would have hardly given this a second thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't lift her paw enough on one step and nearly sumbled as her paw dragged across the fabric of the carpet. She let out a little yelp of fright.    Pricilla sometimes had nightmares of falling down weighing as much or more than she actually did.  Falling down was like literally being hit with a multi-hundred pound weight.  Dr. Kaczar told her she could break an arm or a leg, even her neck.\"  She went stiff and stopped moving.  Fortunately she managed to catch herself before her weight tipped too far.  She gulped some more air and it rasped a little louder in her throat; she could feel her fast pulse in her neck.  Suddenly a snack didn't seem as important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was already a longer distance back to the couch than the kitchen.  Pricilla decided to soldier on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGratefully, she reached out a paw and flowed forward to lean on the frame of the open portal which led to the kitchen;  her belly touched the wall almost as soon as her hand did.  She didn't rest long, though, the more she remained on her feet, the more she'd end up hurting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe open portal proved to be a bit of a problem.  After years of insistance, her father had had the thing widened, but that had been over four years ago and Pricilla had been almost 400 lbs lighter.  She found that now her ass was touching the opposite side before she could even slid her belly through as she waddled in sideways; she knew she was already too fat to walk through it straight.  The pressure mounted and it got harder to keep forcing her belly through.  Her green shirt creased and pulled across its vast surface.  There was some small reprieve when the wall behind her pressed in between her titanic cheeks, threatening to give her a monster wedgie.  Grunting, Pricilla slid the rest of her big self through.  She rested a palm on a clean counter, her thigh and love handle leanging against the cabinet surface below it.  She'd made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla found, to her chagrin that it was harder to reach the upper cabinets than she remembered.  She strained upward, her upper arm fat pressing into her face.  Things at the fore were easy enough to reach, but there was a box of Oreos just behind the dried basil pita bread crackers she'd already extracted.  It was not as though she could get a foot stool.  The bottom of the cabinet cut into the thick forarm fat as she tried to lever her hand deeper in; she hated how tatilizingly close the box of cookies was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a breath, she gave up.  Her ankles hurt on her digitigrade feet from stretching up and her knees were bothering her as well for supporting her weight all this time.  Letting her arm rest and hang from the elbow, Pricilla looked at the stuff she'd grabbed.  A wedge of Colby Jack cheese and half a roll of pepperoni covered with plastic wrap as well as a tub of cream-puffs from the freezer - these would have to thaw before she could eat them - amounted to what she'd taken from the fridge.  She'd found a bag of \"The Works\" Ruffles unopened in the cupboard next to a bag with her pita chips.  She'd also selected a plastic jug full of M&amp;M's.  She knew that Fredrick liked to use these for baking, but Pricilla decided she'd just save him the effort.  All that and a liter of Coke seemed like enough food to keep her occupied for the next several hours... if only she could get those Oreos as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla frowned.  She didn't understand why there was no one here to help her with this.  She didn't understand fully why she was here anyway.  She had to ram her gut into the cabinet below the counter to even begin to reach the cupboards above.  She couldn't bend over very much either and could only reach the top shelf of cabinets she opened with her fingertips.  The stoat licked her chops, her knees were telling her to get back to her couch.  she let a hand drape down and grab a belly roll on her left side.  Her eyes lit up then, and she shifted her weight with a soft grunt, swinging her belly around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned from the closet with a brush and dust pan that had been conveniantly hanging on the door.  She discarded the pan and reached up, brush in paw, back to the Oreos.  It took som figuring, but Pricilla was able to get the box out with the added length of the brush.  She didn't mind if it was dirty, the cookies were sealed in plastic after all.  The box dropped into her waiting left hand; which she had to stretch over the girth of her chest as she worked turned to the side with respect to the cabinet.  Her belly heaved with a soft ululation of triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla had to stuff a number of items into her dress or under her tits or the flabby rolls at her sides, but she managed to get away with everything.  She shoved her wide load back through the portal and had a much easier time managing to haul her half-ton ass back to the sofa.  This, in spite of the fact that both knees were bothering her.  Perhaps she was just anticipating the food that much.  The couch groaned and Pricilla thought she heard something snap under her when she plopped herself down heavily on it.  As she wiggled her butt for a better fit, however, everything seemed fine so she began dislodging food items from where she'd stashed them across her body.  The outfit she was wearing lacked pockets, but one conveniant thing about weighing as much as she did were the handy rolls and creases availible for stuffing small objects and snack into.  The chips were a little abused - the Ruffles more so than the pita bread - but Pricilla didn't mind crumbs.  The mostly-white ermine twisted the top off the cold liter with a hiss and lifted it to her waiting mouth with both hands.  The taste was sweet and sharp.  She flipped on the television and reached into the jar of M&amp;M's, stuffing a pawful into her waiting snout.  With the snacks all around her, even Jerry Springer seemed bearable.  She chuckled as she observed a man forced to choose between two identical twins who'd been impersonating each other and both worked at the same strip club....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Denise finally returned from school, it was to find a severely bloated stoat gorging herself on snacks pilfered from the kitchen. As for Pricilla, she'd felt so good about the success of her initial binge, she'd went back a second time and then a third. Pricilla could hear Fredric complaining to Denise because he couldnt complain to the pilfered directly<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDenise threw her book bag carelessly on the other sofa followed shortly by herself. She lounged lithely, twisting her back and putting her feet up. She sighed tiredly and let loose a wide toothy yawn. Pricilla said sarcastically, \"Someone looks beat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...  These next finals are going to kill me.\"  complained Denise as she threw up her leg on the padded arm of the sofa and stretched out along its length.  She stretched languidly in a way that Pricilla's was too bulked up with fat to do anymore.  \"How was your day?\"  she asked, not opening her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla rotated her right arm, feeling the flesh drag agains the side of her breast.  \"Oh, same as ever.  Same as ever...\"  she drawled.  Inside, she wanted to mention the triumph of fetching snacks for herself, but stopped herself, realizing how silly it would sound.  She didn't expect Denise - even though she spent more time around Pricilla than anyone else - to understand what that meant for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation trailed off, Denise too tired to carry it and Pricilla not usually much for idle talk in general.  Pricilla took up her tablet where she'd set it on her wide love handle to the side.  Taking a few more deep breaths, Pricilla took up working on her unfinished portrait.  As she worked she sighed from time to time, the picture as stubborn as ever.  The ennui began to snake its tendrils back up her thick neck and into her brain.  The excitement of fetching her own snacks was to be short lived it seemed.  With her body weighing more than half a ton, Pricilla supposed she just had to soldier on past the creeping listlessness.  <i>\"It's not as if I can go for a walk... or would even want to.\"</i>  thought Pricilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clucked her tongue while looking at the face depicted on the screen of her laptop where it rested by her left hand on the shelf of her gut past her breast.  She contemplated starting a new project entirely.  To her left, Denise had cracked open a text book and was silently cramming for another test the next day.  She was useless as well.  Pricilla sighed at the monotony of it all and reclined her head against the many rolls at the back of her neck.  She felt them squish under the weight of her cranium, but since attaining her current stature, they provided a better pillow surface than in years past; a small recompense for the inconvenience she suffered daily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla wished that <i>something</i> would happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs things turned out, later that evening, after a full and hearty dinner, someone came in through the front door that would change Pricilla's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was still on the couch when it happened.  Denise was still there, but Fredrick had gone home early.  Pricilla had developed a hankering for fried chicken and had sent Lorenzo to fetch several family buckets from the local KFC instead of having the chef prepare something.  The plump lab who cooked the food around here was miffed naturally, but he had a tendancy to complain in general, either for having to prepare especially large meals or else having his services dismissed early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bucket of gnawed bones was all the remained of the latest victim of Pricilla's exceptional appetite.  It was 9:00 in the evening and Pricilla sat on the same couch where she'd spent most of the day.  She was contemplating returning to bed for another evening when the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesise perked her ears up in alarm and lifted her face from her book.  \"Who's that at this hour?\"  she asked, wonderingly. As for Pricilla, she hardly cared.  Any visitor to this house undoubtedly had something to do with her father's business.  However a visitor did seem odd in the light that nobody was currently here, save for her and the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo answered the door from the foyer.  Pricilla hardly listened, though Denise got up to better eavesdrop from down the hallway.  The stoat licked her chops, tasting grease.  The only business she could have with any visitor to the manor was staying out of sight.  Her mere existence had become one of her father's \"dirty little secrets\"  since she had attained such impressive levels of morbid obesity.  Her father certainly never let her forget that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla was on the verge of asking Denise for a little assistance in getting to her bedroom when the weasel let out a little gasp.  The molting ermine turned her head with effort and saw Lorenzo clopping down the hallway.  He lead a much shorter man at his side.  The human wore an exceedingly plain and shabby grey suit and red tie.  Bespeckled, he walked with some trepidation next to the 6'10\" anthropomorphic horse.  When the newcomer saw Pricilla, his eyes lit in interest at her very full cheeks and broad shoulder, then widened in slow shock as he expanded his view and saw more and more of Pricilla's unconcealable vastness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoat frowned.  She was not particularly fond of her father's business compatriots on the odd occasions they had cause to visit this house.  She did not address the human and turned her head towards Lorenzo.  She shifted her bulk on the couch, swinging a leg up against her low hanging belly and resting her arm on the back of the sofa where her upper arm flab sagged hugely.  \"Lorenzo, why did you bring this man here?\"  The servant knew just as well as she that Pricilla, while not exactly classified was supposed to remain under of the radar.  The last thing anyone needed was the paparazzi storming the manor and trying to get a picture of her three foot cleavage or knee hanging gut for the cover of the local tabloid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Blacklake.\"  said the horse formally.  \"Mr. Rodriguez, here says that he has important information he has to convey to...\"  His basso faltered slightly, \"Mr. Blacklake's immediate family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frown relaxed out of Pricilla's face as she felt her full bloated stomach drop inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Blacklake.\"  said the human, removing his fedora, \"I'm afraid I have some bad news... about your father.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The news he delivered chilled Pricilla even through her many layers of fatty insulation.  \"Miss Blacklake.\" said the human, removing his fedora hat, \"I'm afraid I have some bad news... about your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla turned her head away back to the front and she put a hand on her chest. It almost felt like she couldn't breathe, like there was a snake constricting itself around her lungs deep inside the girth of her chest.  How many times had she seen this exact scene in movies and television crime dramas?  Never had she thought it would happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human stepped forward around the couch while the servants remained where they stood as if frozen.  Pricilla wish incoherently that the man would just leave.  As if the news he bore would somehow remain untrue if only it were not spoken aloud and brought into being.  But she could not run from this news, she couldn't run at all.  Mr. Rodriguez took a half seat on the couch on her left, facing her.  Gratefully he waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what happened to my father?\"  asked Pricilla with watery blue eyes.  She rubbed first one and then the other with a chubby fist.  The human lawyer told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that her father had suffered a heart attack in Florida and had died quite rapidly before he could receive urgent medical care.  Her mother was in deep throws of grief and was currently spending an involuntary term at a local psychiatric facility after assaulting a paramedic and having to be restrained following her husband's sudden death.  Messages were already underway to all of Pricilla's siblings and her aunt and her children.  The funeral was to be held in Florida five days from now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In Florida?!\"  Pricilla exclaimed, baring her smallish canines.  \"How the hell am I supposed to get to Florida?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grimaced.  \"That is another thing I am supposed to tell you.  You see we at your father's firm are aware of your... situation.  I'm afraid I have to tell you that it is in everyone's best interests if you don't attend the funeral.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the stoat felt anger stewing the slow juices of her system.  \"What are you talking about?  Are you telling me that I can't go to my own father's funeral?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Rodriguez crossed his legs.  \"I am telling you that it would be in everyone's interests, including yours if you stayed.  We're already arranging for live televised service to be broadcast here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ermine frowned and crossed her own arms, fat flooding under her chin.  \"That's not good enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, the human stood.  \"I'm afraid this is how things are going to happen, Miss Blacklake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla bared her teeth, enjoying the mild shock in the human's eyes.  She waved a fat paw, \"Well, I think I can make my own arrangements.\"  Flying might have been out of the question, but with five days, she could take the overland route; provided she could find a vehicle to accommodate her special requirements.  Fortunately copious quantities of cash opened most barriers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Rodriguez crossed his arms and looked across at the half-ton stoat.  He gave her a critical look.  \"And would those arrangements involve a flatbed truck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise unfroze as Pricilla sat there, too shocked and offended to say anything.  The weasel took the man's arm.  \"I think it's time for you to go, Mr. Rodgriguez.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the human was escorted out of the living room, he said.  \"Just be aware, Miss. Blacklake, that we at the company are willing to take certain measures if you choose to ignore our and your father's decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla growled.  \"Fine!  I'll be a good girl.\" she turned and put a flabby arm over the back of the couch again.  \"And don't let the door hit your ass on the way out!  Mr. Rodriguez!\"  As soon as the door closed behind the lawyer, Pricilla let out a soft cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise brought her a cloth handkerchief and Pricilla gratefully blew her nose.  She stared numbly out the glass door to the darkened backyard beyond.  \"My father's dead, Denise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel placed a hand on her soft, round shoulder.  \"I know...\"  she said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla honestly didn't know how to feel.  She'd never thought it possible that the man who'd been such a large presence in her life since she was born could suddenly be gone.  She wasn't surprised that her mother had gotten institutionalized.  Richard Blacklake was  a powerful strong-willed man.  Those closest to him grew to depend on him... and that's how he liked it.  But now he was gone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going to happen now?\"  asked the white furred ermine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise just smiled and gave the fattened stoat a hug around her neck, leaning over her breast to get close enough.  \"I'm sure everything is going to be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla wasn't so sure.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They brought in a small satellite dish.  They set it up outside by the pool chairs.  Pricilla watched from the living room sofa.  Nobody asked her any questions.  When they were done, a different human stepped in and handed the huge stoat a slip of paper.  \"They're gonna broadcast tomorrow at... noon, pacific-standard time.  Turn the television to channel five.  We'll be back to collect the dish on Monday.\"  That all the man said before turning and going.  Pricilla noticed that he was more at ease walking out than in.  She sniffed and looked down at the paper he'd handed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was folded and Pricilla was mildly surprised to see raised embroidery around the edges and feel the thickness of the high-quality paper.  Her eyes naturally skirted around the edges of the massive picture of her father which dominated the center of the card.  \"Richard Laimon Blacklake\" her mouth moved as she read the words, \"Born: April 8, 1963.  Passed: - \"  Pricilla set the card aside and raised a hand to rub at her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise looked up from her book.  She gave the fattened ermine a sympathetic look.  \"It's alright, Pricilla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoat rested her hand on her breast and said, \"I still can't believe that he's dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise close the book and walked fluidly over, sitting down beside Pricilla; though she still seemed to be at a distance, given the other female's tremendous girth.  The weasel reached over and grabbed Pricilla's free hand.  Squeezing it, she said, \"It's alright to feel bad.  He was your father...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not it.\" said Pricilla in a surprisingly dry tone.  She took a few moments and a couple heavy breaths before adding.  \"I don't feel sad that he died, Denise.  I just can't believe it... A man like my father doesn't just... go.\"  Pricilla's voice was heavy with hesitation and confusion, but eerily devoid of emotion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise loosened her hand from the white ermine's.  \"Mr. Blacklake was a great man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ph-shaw.\" huffed Pricilla. \"He was a pig and you know it, Denise.  He basically sold my sister to a business partner in Europe, you know.  And he would have done the same to me, if I wasn't...\"  Now Pricilla's voice got a little choked up.  The stoat had to pause and swallow.  She rubbed her eyes again and took a few more heavy breaths.  Denise said nothing, but Pricilla appreciated the feel of her slight weight against her love handle where it spilled over her thigh to the side of her.  Pricilla spoke again.  \"I feel... nothing when I try to imagine him dead.  But I feel bad that I don't feel anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise looked up at Pricilla and caught her eye.  She let out a depressed sigh.  \"It's hard to feel for someone you hardly know, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla grimaced, showing her small sharp teeth.  \"I thought I knew him...  But if he ended up letting a heart attack kill him... Well, maybe I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey let the matter rest at that.  As the television flickered in front of the two girls - one of which had stuck her nose back into her textbook - Pricilla took up her tablet again.  However it was not to finish her stubborn painting.  She shelved it in a folder and used a quick keyboard command on her laptop to start a new project.  The stoat, who was far too fat to use real paint and an easel properly, began to draw something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy it was time for the broadcast to begin, Pricilla had already eaten a dozen eggs worth of ham, bacon and cheddar omelette; a loaf of bread smothered slice by slice with butter and raspberry jam; a pound of hash browns; four cream-filled crepes and a short stack of maple pancakes with the syrup baked in (the idea came from the McGriddles they serve at McDonald's).  She belched contently as she polished off the last of it and cleaned her face with a moist towel Denise handed to her.  It was just another typical day in the life of Pricilla Blacklake; well... she might have splurged a bit with the crepes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach comfortably-uncomfortably overstuffed with food, Pricilla reclined her massive bulk into the sofa where she spent most of her time.  One arm dangled from the elbow, the other rested on her right breast.  She picked her teeth with a manicured claw and Denise flipped the television to the correct channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe din of static irked Pricilla and she turned her head against her thick neck to glare at the weasel who, with a sheepish grin, dialed down the volume as fast as it would go.  Pricilla sat there on the couch, her paunch resting heavily between her widespread legs so low that she could feel the front of the couch against the underside of it.  Perhaps it was the breakfast distending her stomach inside of her, but as Pricilla sat and watched the static on the television, waiting, she felt <i>heavy</i>; heavier than usual.  When she drew her next breath, she felt it rasp in the back of her throat, and she hated the sound and the feel of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe television screen came to life at 12:15 pm.  Long shadows spread across the green field of headstones displayed on the monitor.  The one with the deep rectangular hole dug in front of it was the largest of all.  Richard Blacklake was fond of the ostentatious in life and so, it would appear, he was in death.  Pricilla was actually prepared for the possibility that her father had constructed a mausoleum in his honor, so the two angels arching their wings and reaching to the heavens actually seemed almost quaint.  They held decanters in their right hands and poured frozen stone stream to wash down onto a bas relief of her father's strong, stout face and shoulders.  Huge gold leafed letters proclaimed his name and dates as well as the words: \"Reach for the stars.  Taste them, grasp them and then join them, forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla reclined heavily into the sofa, her love handles oozing over the sides of her wide, thick thighs which touched under her apron despite the width her legs were spread.  She scratched herself under her second belly roll and grabbed it a little to let the skin out.  The stoat was wearing nothing but her extremely large, thong-like underwear which went between the folds of her flesh, a too-tight bra and a shapeless black muumuu.  She watched a humanoid round eared rodent begin a sermon.  \"Heavenly Father, hallowed be thy name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla saw her mother sobbing and making a spectacle of herself on television.  Bernard had his strong arms around her while the great gathering around her did their best to ignore the outbursts.  Pricilla wondered if there was an ambulance waiting just behind the camera waiting to take her back to the asylum.  Warren was there as well.  The crowd around him almost swallowed the smaller quiet stoat and the young man looked at the coffin at the head of the crowd with a sort of dazed look.  It seemed like a fiasco even from here, but Pricilla still envied her siblings deeply not so much for being there in person, but for not having been expressly forbidden from attending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise sat nearby.  She'd even put away her book out of respect.  A simple black dress fell casually about her moderately fleshed figure.  She turned to look at Pricilla, crossing her legs as she did so.  \"Are you doing alright?\"  she asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image from the large television reflected in the stoat's eyes.  They were lowering down the coffin now, her brothers and mother waited to throw dirt down after it.  Her sister was probably too busy with her wifely duties to have been able to attend from Europe.  \"I'm fine.\" said the ermine, stressing the words more than a little.  She let out a sigh as her father's friends and associates, none of whom she knew very well - though she did recognize several faces - all moved in a line, throwing dirt onto the coffin of Richard Blacklake.  Clouds swirled in the distance of a bright, blue tropical sky.  \"I'm just wondering what happens next.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day after watching the funeral live on television, Pricilla occupied the long hours binging.  She knew it was a binge day when she finished breakfast and yet still had the strong urge to eat.  Less than an hour after Denise had cleared her plates, Pricilla dictated to the weasel to tell Fredrick the cook to start preparing several batches of the butter scones she liked.  Before the first of these came out of the oven, the half ton stoat sent for Lorenzo and had him go to Krispy Kremes for ten boxes of doughnuts; fifty glazed, 20 devil's food, 20 jelly filled, 10 custard filled, 10 chocolate glazed, 5 glazed crullers and 5 cinnamon twists.  To break up all the pastries, Pricilla had Fredrick put on a couple pots of Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf brand gourmet coffee which she liked.  The stoat drank it black, the better to spare her mouth over-sweetening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pastries were all knocked out faster than one would expect.  Two hours after they were gone, Pricilla sent Lorenzo to bring her back a variety of fast food, while at the same time having Fredrick start on some roast chicken for dinner and some pies for dessert...  Yeah, it was just one of those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending an ungodly amount of time on her japanese toilet the following morning, Pricilla found herself once again in her dent in the large sofa.  She had the television off because she couldn't stand its noise any longer.  Denise was useless for conversation because she still had her nose stuck in her book;  Pricilla was at least grateful that her time in \"college\" had been mostly a money-fueled farce perpetrated by her father just to occupy her time.  Her degree in business that her father had forced her to get was gathering dust in some drawer she couldn't get to anymore and likely would remain there until she died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe molting ermine - there was still a littler brown left in a strip on her wide back - instead contented herself with her tablet computer; the most expensive model available publicly.  It was almost as useful as her laptop and had the decisive advantage of being able to be used one handed.  It was also less hot for when the fat-filled stoat left it flat on her breast.  The only real reason she kept her laptop around was because her preferred drawing pad was not compatible with her tablet computer.  She slid her finger across the smooth surface of the touch screen to unlock it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And allowed her mind to enter a new world.  The miracle of the Internet allowed Pricilla to feel like she had a modicum of a normal life.  Her browser screen was her window to the world.  Chat sometimes came more easily than regular speech and people on the other side of the country or across the ocean knew her thoughts and feelings and even cared in a way about them.  And the best part was that on the internet, Pricilla was free from any stigma or comments or assumptions about her weight.  Anonymity was a mask which suited her perfectly and not a soul out there in the vast tangled Web knew that Prissy_Ermine666 was actually an heiress to a moderate fortune and also an 1100 pound woman who could barely walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla wrote comment on Stage-Katt's blog about a vacation he just took to Rio de Janeiro.  Seeing as the stoat's life consisted mostly of the distance between her bed and her sofa, Pricilla actually didn't blog much herself.  However she loved commenting on other people's blogs, live journals and profiles.  Pricilla was snidely asking if he saw any animated blue macaws there when her chat ringer buzzed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, this tablet supported the running of multiple apps at once so all Pricilla had to do was swipe three fingers to the side to see her chat program.  Her round ears perked slightly when she saw who it was online.  \"Hello Star_WolfX-69.\"  she typed using the fingers of her right hand against the virtual keyboard.  The tablet rested on the flat surface of her breast because the keyboard was too small for both of her hands to reach comfortably across the girth of her chest.  Another disadvantage of the tablet that the designers didn't foresee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her hand and lifted it slightly so she could better see his response (assuming this was even a man she was chatting with).  \"How are things going, Prissy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla sniffed and then typed one-handed, \"As well as ever, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis response came quickly as always. \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla frowned.  Star Wolf was unusually canny, though really what should she expect, she'd been talking with him since she was 18.  She mulled over her options for nearly two minutes and finally, she wrote with a sigh.  \"My father died last week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible.\"  wrote Star Wolf.  \"How are you holding up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty fine, I guess.  We weren't exactly close... I don't feel sad that he's gone, but since he died I...  I don't know how to describe it.  It's like I'm floating in my own life, if that makes any sense.\"  Pricilla sniffed again as she punched the letters out on the tablet, the flat unyielding surface less comfortable than a proper keyboard.  Only because she'd known Star wolf for so many years did she relate this information.  She thought that people might put things together if she gave the date of her father's death... she was a little paranoid about things like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it makes sense <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">  But you know it's OK to feel bad about your dad.\" read Star Wolf's chat balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Pricilla wrote, \"I hated my father.  He thought he could control my life ever since I was born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"  came the reply and then, \"It doesn't sound like he succeeded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla rubbed a thick roll at her side with her left hand and smirked.  Star Wolf was right on the money as always.  But this conversation was draining and Star Wolf could never understand the full extent of the influence her father had wielded in her life nor the lengths she gone to dodging his will.  \"I'd rather talk about something else now.\"  she wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, like getting a real profile picture <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">.  You've been a pumpkin now for what, three years now?  It's not even Thanksgiving anymore! =P\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  My pumpkin suits me just fine.  Don't knock it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ought to use your face.  I bet you have a pretty face...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla snorted and wrote.  \"And I think you're just pretty horny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"  typed Star Wolf.  \"Let's talk about something else. XD\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPricilla smiled and typed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoat's biggest contribution to the world so far were her art profiles on websites such as DeviantArt and Zhibit, but also her own website which she'd lovingly crafted and maintained.  She mostly drew and sometimes dabbled in poetry, less so in prose which she lacked the patience for.  She preferred a darker style and like rich shades of black in many of her pieces.  It was really almost the only way she had to express herself.  Because she spent so much time online and so much time on her drawings, she had a decent following.  Working with one hand on a drawing pad, she couldn't exactly turn out new drawings very often - and this one with the wild dog seemed to be dragging on forever - but what she had was good.  She commented a lot on other people's works and that in turn drew attention back to herself.  Pricialla used a couple of different e-mails, each box with a different purpose.  It was so easy to get lost in the tangle of writing and responding to correspondence.  And then there were the lucky few like Star Wolf whom she actually chatted with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white furred ermine had to stop in the middle of growing her Facebook village when he tablet's battery flashed red and she had to put it aside; meaning that she slid it into the belly roll right above her love handle where she could still reach it.  Looking up for the first time in hours, Pricilla saw that Denise had gone.  The stoat sat there, her body expanding huge and heavy across three cushions of the worn sofa.  She let a hand drape down the front of her, the huge dome of her belly jutting forward ahead of her round breasts under her blouse and then dropping steeply ahead of her knees to where she could feel it dangling between her calves.  The fact that she could feel the front of the sofa against the underside of her paunch reminded Pricilla of how extremely obese she was.  She took a few slightly rasping breaths, aware also of the weight of her ponderous breasts on her chest and diaphram.  Her stomach hit her with a strong hunger pang which ripped through her abdomen deep under the fatty layers.  Her body seemed intent on reminding Pricilla of her personal reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached between her breasts for her cell phone to call someone to fetch her some food before she passed out.  She didn't bother considering the tedious, arduous walk to the kitchen this time.  She was just feeling too heavy and lethargic to budge her great bulk off the couch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An indiscriminate country located somewhere in the continent of Europe is our setting, our time is the end of a fictional 18th century. For your approval, I submit to you that everything about this tale is entirely plausible, as are the events foretold within the tale, but they are entirely fictional. Well, almost. Most of them. Okay, a good 4:7 ratio of this story is fictional and entirely fallacious. So that's like, what, a little over half? Yes, a little more than half of the story is simply made up to make the tale itself somewhat more interesting. Okay, so we're clear; generic old-world European country, really long time ago in a fictional setting, most of it is total bologna. Alright, got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beginning of our tale begins with the looming castle of Francois Marquis, a stereotypically evil man with a stereotypical taste in ostentatious decoration and lavish lifestyle. He was a nobleman, and very much a family friend, to the royal family at the time and had sopped up enough of their wealth through wiliness, conning, and general kissassery to construct himself the gaudy eyesore that sat on a plateau next to the shore. He was not, as most villains seem to lack this trait, without charm and a certain attraction about him but he was far from a good and honest man willing to sweat and toil for his aspirations. The royals loved him for his quick wit, sharp tongue, and wonderful power of storytelling; so much so that he was offered a lady's hand in marriage almost on a bi-daily basis. It was presumed that Lord Marquis had preferred the company of, what they were known at the time as, \"fuck buddies\" to the humble beguiles of marriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was adored by the royals, Monsieur Marquis was absolutely despised by the public. Black and white, slave and master, poor and somehow even more poor; everyone outside castle walls hated Francois Marquis. Understandable; He was the one who convinced the King to allocate funds from the town treasury into the castle's decoration budget (proposing, \"Solid Gold Everything\" as its theme), the one to suggest taking a demolition crew to the orphanage in light of the strange \"diaper smell\" that somehow managed to waft through his windows even several miles from town (followed), and he was the one to fund for construction of the Captain's Daughter, a pub that was pleasant in all sense of the word except for the matching high base boards outside the exit so that drunk people managed to stub their big toes on every single time they walked out. \"A truly evil man without recompense\" was what they called him in the town newspaper. Those who couldn't read just called him a jerk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this, fueled by his strange absence in the public's revolution against the crown, that eventually led to the angry mob formed right outside his doorstep. Well, right outside his doorstep guarded by a rather deep mote. But whatever. And said mob had just the torture in mind for the despised nobleman once they managed to fish him out of that castle of his... that rather large, intimidating castle with turrets and armed watchmen on the other side of a rather deep mote. The public would not be intimidated, well at least not very much, as their shouts and hollers eventually cited a response from deep within the Marquis manor. At the top of the bridge between the foremost turrets, a figure came into view; a distinctly female voice rising from the sun-eclipsed shape before the mob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is noble territory and is strictly a no-trespassing area.\" her voice was stern and calm, yet somehow managed to overpower the vigorous roars from the crowd, \"Can't you read?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" someone shouted from the crowd, \"And the Crown don't mean Jack Sprat no more, this is a People's Revolution!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outburst cited lots of whooping and cheering towards the nameless man and his ideals, a clamored myriad of thoughts opinions and demands roared across the plateau. How droll. However powerful strong opinions and pretty words were, they were all silenced and left cowering in the single utterance of one command: \"Fire!\" Surprisingly, no one was shot with arrows. It was just a sadistic ribbing to get the locals shivering and quiet. \"Now, whatever the business of a People's Revolution, I sincerely could care less.\" the figure said blandly, \"I have no business with the King, nor his crowd of revolting peons.\" The eclipsed woman turned casually back out of view. Amidst the severely underpleased cries of the people, one voice rose over the crowd and exploded like a firework:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DEMAND TO SEE FRANCOIS MARQUIS AT THIS VERY INSTANT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mosh pit around her seemed only enthralled with the harsh words; taking it as incentive that they could act like hooligans until their demands were met. A lot of them started actually trying to swim past the mote. The ones who actually knew how to swim were the ones eaten by crocodiles and the remainder either drowned or were also eaten by said crocodiles. However most of the crowd remained on land acting like the fools that the Crown's poor educational system had left them. Only one of them looked skyward at the tower, to where that mysterious woman had last been seen; knowing that she was still there. Or at least still within earshot. There was silence from the Marquis side, not even the clamoring of what must have been at least a couple dozen, probably fifty, loading of crossbows and muskets at once. After a solid minute or so, the shadow re-emerged from behind the castle walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIRE!!\" she shouted again, much to the dismay of the refrightened peasants below her who cowered in fear once more. Again, no one was hurt. It worked every single time. \"Now, which one of you has the gall to demand anything from me?\" There was silence. \"Answer me or I'll just shoot you all.\" She scanned the still-painted audience, looking for indifference and hate. In all eyes but two, she found cowardice and idiocy. Those two strong eyes that, despite the great distance between hers, seemed to pierce the very air around them. Her gaze was melting, one that would have shaken any normal woman to her soul. Eyes that screamed, \"I hate you, I really really hate you and everything you stand for and I hate your mother and I hate your father for shipping such obviously defect product into the world.\" Thankfully, this girl wasn't quite dealing with a normal woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.\" she pointed directly into the crowd, \"Conveniently the only young woman in the crowd; Where is your better half?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unmarried!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sneer traveled up the castle walls and quickly attached itself to the mysterious woman above. \"Not surprising, what man would have such an outspoken wench by his side?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow, said woman's cheeks began to color slightly. \"What does that matter?!\" she hollered back, rage still burning brightly within her chest. Unphased by her seemingly one-sided chances, the young woman pushed the burlier, significantly stronger men to the side to escape the crowd and make herself known. She was revealed to be wearing men's clothing: tight leather stockings that made the belt around her waist all but useless, a white shirt obviously not tailored for her with pinned sleeves up onto her arms and ruffles of loose fabric puffing out and about from her leather vest, her hair tucked under a tricone that had seen far better days. The cross dresser stood defiantly from the flock, as if painting herself different from the other upstarts. With tensely straightened arms hanging parallel on her shoulders she stomped towards the mote, and began in demanding tone \"I am Kath-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name is irrelevant.\" the brooding face above her dismissed, \"Guards, escort this young woman into castle walls.\" Below their fellow armsmen, seemingly appearing as if from nowhere, several more of the red coated mounties arched into position as the drawbridge opened from the inside. The rebels, where credit was due, were at least intelligent enough to see this as an opportunity to storm the castle while the courteous offer was being offered. In one unanimous jerk, the crowd inched towards the still indrawn bridge before a universal cocking of muskets rifles and crossbows would stop them dead in their tracks. \"And only the young woman please; I'd rather not have these stinking Rebels dirtying up the decor.\" As the crowd roared in protest from their stilled position and the bridge was fully drawn, two eerily similar guards broke from the six collective ones that stood on the other side of the mote. They marched across in perfectly rhythmical fashion until reaching their guest, where they turned on a dime to face forward. They each offered an arm to the defiant girl; \"No thank you.\" she spat bitterly, \"You reek of Marquis.\" She started ahead of them, to which the twin guards obliged by following her from the rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the girl entered, her guards led an even train of their ilk back behind the walls of the castle and slowly, the drawbridge was raised again. The peasants below were none to happy about the unfair treatment, and the outright sexism of the events that unfolded before them. Many griped loudly about their own personal qualms with Marquis, but they fell onto deaf ears for the mysterious shadow above was gone. As few took a brave single step out of line towards the castle, they were immediately shot with ungodly precision...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The inside of the castle was just as gaudy and flashy as had been expected of the ostentatious aristocrat; all over the gray stone walls were fabulous paintings from across Europe, framed in nothing short a shade of gold and hung by the most elaborate chains. The entry to his monument of audacity filled with trophies (mostly the heads of game that he himself had not shot) and various other treasures that he had claimed for himself. The floor, even, was covered with a lavishly made rug woven by the blind seamstresses of Berber! From the middle, there were two heavy doors on each side along with one staircase that led up to the upper level, all in perfect symmetry with eachother and a centered door between them. Lord Marquis' guest was far from impressed, as would be if most informed of how he acquired said rarities for himself. She stood in the very center of the exotic rug, therefore in the center of the very room itself, and begrudgingly awaited the arrival of the messenger from before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix guards stood in about face around her, each strikingly identical countenance awaiting the arrival of said woman themselves. They didn't move, didn't blink, and didn't sneeze. The guards, either because they couldn't or wouldn't speak aloud, seemed to have a hive mind that bound them together- like puppets on the same string. Well, actually probably more graceful than that, puppets bumping into each other and all that. Either way, they were creepy and so eerily in synch with each other. Was it possible that they were all one person? The way they all moved together... it was almost like a trick with mirrors; but alas, no mirrors to be seen anywhere! As they all saluted in unison, the so-far nameless woman turned back around to see the strange woman from before, slowly coming into view as she approached the railing. \"Ah, the Outspoken Girl.\" her voice was thick yet shrewd, with a slight accent hinted now that she was close enough to be heard correctly, \"I trust that my guards gave you no trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None. They just sort of stood there.\" the 'outspoken one' said with detectable disdain present in her otherwise tamed tone, \"They're really quite disturbing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light chuckle escapes her painted lips as she slinks slowly down the stairs. The woman is noticeably slender, with small curves detectable in her tailored black empire-styled gown. To match her attire the woman's hair was also a dark shade of mahogany that was tied neatly into a bun, one loose strand of hair that hanging precociously over her right ear. Her skin was not quite as pale as the women that littered the countryside of Europe at this point, but she could certainly have benefited from a little sunning. It seemed that she was already a predisposed darker tone, possibly having Spanish parents. All in all, the mysterious woman looked very much the part of a reluctant muse for an artist, or a really expensive escort in the right light. \"Yes, I feel quite the same way.\" she said whimsically, now reaching the bottom of the steps and starting towards her begrudgingly summoned guest. Said guest could only remark to herself on how extraordinarily tall the exquisite beauty in front of her was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, I am Sofia Montague (pronounced: Mohn-tah-gew); Daughter of Lord Henry and Flourencia Montague from <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">hommina hommina</font>.\" she said with an elegant curtsey. \"Perhaps, you would be so kind as to remove your tricone so that we may begin dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith narrowed eyelids, the invited guest gave a small curtsey of her own. \"I am Kathe-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah.\" Lady Montague said with the utmost patience, almost like a nanny speaking to a small child picking his nose, \"Your hat, please.\" Grumbling slightly at the formality, the outspoken guest, still in mid curtsey, had her hat removed for her; allowing a thick head of long, lusciously robust hair to fall out from under it. It appeared to be burgundy, or some other red brown, the lovely Lady Sofia could only remark as she delicately touched the hair of her bowed guest, almost as if it were... \"Garnet.\" she said with a sense of wonder in her voice. She released her locks and stood slowly, a wide smile on her beautiful face, \"Sasha Garniet would be a lovely name for you dear, it so fits your hair color.\" she continued, much to the chagrin of 'Sasha', \"Its a lovely name, capturing your headstrong demeanor and that lovely head of hair you have; why would you ever want to mat it down underneath that dreadful hat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman snatched back her hat, causing little to no recoil in the ever-composed Lady Montague, \"Because strange women feel that they are entitled to fondle it at all times!\" she snapped, propping it atop the unfurled mass of lovely straight locks of red-brown. \"Where is Lord Marquis, I wish to speak with him about the terms of his surrender!\" her outburst was soothed not by the condescending cooing of the vertically generous lady, but by the unanimous arming of pairings muskets, pistols, and rifles alike. \"Now now, Miss Garniet, there's no need for a lady such as yourself to raise your voice.\" she said, tenderly removing the hat from her head once again and wrapping an arm around her shoulder, \"I'm sure you've had quite the long day, on top of all this rebelling and whatnot.\" she said sweetly, bringing herself closer to Sasha's form. \"I insist that you stay for dinner so that we may discuss this whole ugly business of surrender like proper ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am <b>not</b> a proper lady, at least what is left of me isn't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia cocked her head knowingly, with a slight pout to her lips as she treated 'Sasha' to the same stooping tone of voice, \"Well not in those clothes you're not, Dear. But in time we can remedy that.\" she said snobbishly, \"But for now, Gretchen has prepared for us a lovely feast that I'm sure will fill your belly, which has been rumbling since you stepped into the castle I'm sure; you poor thing.\" And while she detested the very spirit of haughtiness in Lady Montague's voice, the woman with garnet hair had to admit that living as a peasant didn't lend very much pride in turning up your nose to free food. And rich people food too, that stuff was good. \"Alright.\" she said in a manner that still sounded very oriented with her prior business, \"But during we'll be sure to discuss the terms and conditions of Lord Marquis' surrender?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, Sasha.\" Lady Montague said in her 'hush-now' tone. Before her guest could even retort for what seemed like the millionth time that her name was not Sasha Garniet, Lady Montague snapped her fingers and two female maids appeared in very much the same fashion as the guards before them, \"Ladies, would you please escort Miss Garniet to a guest room so that she may change into proper dinner attire? Preferably one of the under-used ones; Lord Francois does hate waste.\" At once, the mirrored pair of maids curtseyed and forcefully grabbed the one so incorrectly declared as 'Sasha' in very much the same way as the guards before them attempted. \"Hey!\" the red headed rebel cried before being all but dragged to the left of Lady Montague and slowly disappearing behind quickly closing oaken doors...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sasha\" was not at all a gruesome looking woman. That wasn't to say that she had the same visible sophistication of Lady Montague, nor the strange- almost sculpted -beauty of her pretty young servants. But of all the women that lived amongst the poorest of the poor, she wore it the best by far. It was god-given set of good looks; a thin diamond shaped face framed with a small but strong jaw, naturally smooth skin, petite ears and a prominent nose. Women of her caliber, in royalty, would often flit gracefully into age. However a life of hardships had not lent her a kind complexion: tough skin, rough calluses on her hands, and the faint lines of stress and worry creased her eyebrows and the corners of her lips prematurely marring an otherwise unspoiled seed of a very lucky man. Her eyes, once a piercing meadow green in her youth were now dulled with the hardships of life and growing up into poverty had malnourished what had potential to be a ripe, voluptuous shape into an almost sickly one. Her breasts, maybe in some other world generous and swollen, were little more than husks of their proper form and did little but sit there just barely peeking atop her scrawny midriff. Her body was thin, almost what one would consider gangly, but despite it all she did look rather stunning in the evening attire chosen for her by the accompanying maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe directoire chosen by one of the brunette maids was a sort faded grapevine color: a rich green that had been purposely faded in the sense of tastefulness. Along the bust and some midriff trim, the green yielded to gold that pleasantly contrasted against the girl's pale peasant skin. It was laced at the back, the shimmering fabric holding up the entire dress in a manner reminiscent of a corset, to compensate for her lacking female figure, it was tied at its tightest so as to make sure that it wouldn't slide off during dinner. Her exotic hair color contrasted the verdant gown brilliantly, making her natural beauty stand out all the more. And with a little splash, the day's dose of oil and dirt was washed from her face. She was now officially dressed for dinner after only an hour of preparation and getting manhandled by creepy identical maids. At home, it took her little less than five minutes to prepare. The upper class were such odd people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that their guest for the evening was finally ready for supper, the nameless servants curtseyed and offered their hands; to which she could only oblige after them treating her to such nice clothing. The once defiant girl was finding herself a little overwhelmed by the flattery that this place seemed to emanate, while not one word had been said in the castle if it hadn't been from either her or her mysterious host. In fact, since her arrival, she hadn't seen a single trace of the man she loathed so much; which was probably for the better. No matter, she'd see him at dinner, where she would promptly attempt to choke the aristocrat with whatever she might have handy. Or maybe a quick slice to his jugular with a steak knife. Oh, she did hope that steak was on the menu tonight! ...Not that she was actually looking forward to partaking in one of the many lavish meals that had helped send her country spiraling into an economic warzone from the underside of the upperclass. That would be purely hypocritical of her. Still, it had to best whatever that pulpy slop they served in Rebel Headquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long walk led by her escorts landed the three of them in the entryway once again, where Lady Montague awaited the arrival of her dinner guest amongst a circle of guards. She was busy shouting at one of them for something before her beloved Sasha had reentered the room. \"Oh Miss Garniet!\" she called her once again that dreadful name, \"You look absolutely stunning in green, however I would have preferred that the maids have dressed you in purple; it would be so much more your color.\" The other woman snorted distastefully, \"They're your clothes, and all you can think to do is gripe that I haven't been dressed in the right ones?\" she asked somewhat indignantly, \"I will never understand you upperclass women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman winced slightly, \"Oh, Dear, please refrain from using the word 'gripe',\" she sounded as if she had smelled something unpleasant, \"Its terribly unbecoming.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, unbecoming or not, the minor discrepancy was soon forgotten as Lady Montague escorted the lovely Sasha Garniet down the hall along with the seemingly favored sextuplet guards on either side of them. She insisted that they walk slowly and gracefully, which was made hard on her guest. Not because of her rather unsophisticated lifestyle, but because the delicious smells wafting out and about the dining hall made it rather hard to keep a steadily slow pace. She was so enthralled by the lovely aroma that she hadn't remembered the whole purpose of her infiltration before realizing that Lord Antoine Marquis was not seated at the table! She attempted to halt, but the burly soldiers kept her moving along by viciously prodding her with the butts of whichever respective weapon said guard might be holding whenever she fell out of line. As the two women separated, each was followed by three identical men that sat behind her at the head of the table. She was shown to the end opposite Lady Montague. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dining room, if at all possible, was even more disturbingly overdecorated than the other main rooms of the house. All over the walls were royal colors of the crown (now overthrown) and a large aclictic of game heads. Two boars, two hawks, two lions, and many other brave creatures were killed in twos and hung mirroring each other across the distance of the dining room. The table, long and elaborately decorated with a beautiful centerpiece that all but blocked the guest's view of Lady Montague, was draped in a fine cloth that hung over the horizontal edges- as the table was much longer than it was thick. Empty chairs were set evenly at either side of the table, the only two occupied being the ones that herself and Sophia Montague sat in themselves. Over the centerpiece, only Lady Montague's head and upper torso were visible, whereas her guest of the evening was all but overshadowed by the gaudy decoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were abnormally quiet for the first minute or so as the wine was brought out to the women seated at the table. Again, more cookie-cutter servants rushed to the women's sides as they each received a heavy goblet ornamented with precious stones and the like. The guest could only marvel how much sparkling red wine, the color of her hair, the cup could hold; after the butler left her side she found that it was far too heavy to lift with one hand! But the smell was divine, so much that she felt already a little influenced by the vapors alone. Her head splashed slightly, not quite swimming yet though, as she struggled to focus on the statuesque woman towering over the mass of flowers. \"Do you like the wine, Miss Garniet?\" came the whimsical pratter of her hostess, \"Lord Marquis had it brought over as a gift from Italy some years ago. He asked that we save it for only the most special occasions.\" The one so wrongly declared as Sasha snorted, \"One would hardly call surrender a special occasion where I'm from, but I do appreciate a good dip into consumption now and then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Montague chuckled slightly from the other end of the table, one that was obviously fae and somewhat condescending, but still a laugh. \"Yes, quite.\" she said breathlessly, \"Lord Marquis would most likely share the same opinion, Miss Garniet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Montague,\" she said with a sort of feigned social tolerance for the woman across from her (still purposely forgetting the Lady), \"Since we are spending so much time talking of Lord Marquis, sitting at his table, drinking his wine, and wearing his clothes and whatnot, I was wondering if it would be at all possible to expedite my meeting with him. I can't help but notice that he isn't at the table, which I find rather peculiar considering that, like I said before, this is his castle. Is he not feeling well? Shall I go put him out of his misery with a lashing of my silver tongue or the dagger I've strapped onto my ankle?\" she smiled wickedly, \"I've often dreamed of the day I get to rip out the throat of the man I've despised for so long; would you be terribly offended if I skipped dinner and just walked right up to his bedchambers and give him and whatever harlot he's so preoccupied with up there a good stabbing?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Again, there was another long awkward silence between the two women; the only thing that seemed to make any noise would be the clacking of dinnerplates being served. Roast duck, Pheasant, Quail, mounds of bread, There was fish and the most exquisitely prepared slab of pork that the young woman had ever seen in her entire life. It almost made her sorry she'd said such horrible things, but she was getting rather frustrated. The servants and guards around them seemed to take no stock in the slight that had just occurred, hadn't moved at all unless they were bringing out platters of meats, breads or desserts to put on the table. \"Miss Garniet, I would advise you to keep comments like that to yourself from now on.\" she said in a gravely serious tone, \"Lord Marquis, to the best of my knowledge, has done little to nothing directly to the people, these misconceptions that he's a cruel man who abuses an illgotten power are completely fallacious. Honestly, spreading rumors that he eats babies for dinner is entirely juvenile and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Montague, I'm sure that the food is lovely but I must be excused so that I may go gut out my enemy and make his whore watch. Thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards behind her chair stepped forward with the utmost robotic quickness and pinned their guest to her seat with lances; one dead across her throat. \"Please, Miss Garniet, sit down and have a glass of wine.\" Montague said with cold indifference to her predicament, \"Poor Gretchen spent all day slaving over several hot stoves and handling dead animals. The least you could do would be to give her the satisfaction of knowing that her sweat and toil will not have gone to waste.\" She seemed to glare at the guards, all thee of them lowering their lances slightly and allowing their target to breath. \"My name is not Sasha Garniet,\" she finally barked, having long grown tired of the silly game being played with her head, \"and I wish to speak with Lord Marquis!\" the woman across the table let out a slight chuckle, \"Now now Sasha,\" she said in the newly adopted tone, \"You're being awfully rude for such a beautiful girl. I can tell that you really just want a good meal, that's why you're so energetic. Well don't fret, as you can see we have quite the spread laid out here- and normally its just me, so all this delicious sustenance goes to the hounds...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoefully, Lady Montague brought the platter of hog closer to herself and cut off a moderately sized piece for herself. \"Such a shame, I'm fully aware that there are those in the kingdom who have gone without so much as a proper meal for so long, as I'm sure you are too.\" she smiled in Sasha Garniet's direction, \"It pains me to see such a pretty young thing starved into skeletalism such as yourself. The King should really have left more money for your people, shouldn't he?\" The statured woman rose from the head of the table with the fork still placed delicately between her thumb and index finger and slowly walked towards the more than uncomfortable woman, \"I can tell, Sasha, that you're just starving in your attempts to seem brave and strong. Just <i>starving</i>.\" She crouched down next to the Rebel girl and slowly eased the fork towards her mouth. Tired of sitting still and taking this crap, the bawdy young woman balled up her hand and delivered a mean left hook across her hostess' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light, almost staged moan that was disturbingly lacking in convincing pain was her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had rolled with the punch, her head recoiled to the right and her cheek was a bloodshot red. However she acted as if she had just stubbed her toe against a pebble, almost as if to say \"Oh, that was annoying\". In fact, she turned her head back to face the girl just as she would if it had been the pebble, \"Miss Garniet, what <i>have</i> they taught you in those rough streets?\" she asked quizzically as the three guards restrained her with their unnaturally strong hands. They held her tightly to the posh dining chair, her head restrained by the one centered behind her, while the right and left one each grabbed one of her arms and legs. She panicked and started squirming, only for their grips to grow tighter and tighter as she did so. \"A pretty girl like you should have the gentlemen settling disputes for you, Dear. Women are catty creatures, yes, but punching is rather brutish of you isn't it?\" She positioned the fork, which hadn't even left her hand after the hard slug to the cheek, parallel to her mouth and started pushing past her lips. Sasha bit off of the fork and pretended to swallow. \"Good girl.\" Lady Montague said, snapping her fingers as the servants brought the slab of pork closer to her; presumably so that more of this nonsensical spoonfeeding could continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer enthusiasm seemed to fade a bit when Sasha spat the chewed pork back at her and it stuck to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother silence as the masticated mush dripped from Montague's face- eyes closed and her lips pursed as she obviously fought some sort of violent knee-jerk reaction. She was brought a towel at her snap, had her face wiped off at a point, and dismissed her servants at a wave. \"Sasha, that was very uncouth,\" she sounded as if she were scolding her own pooch who had just bitten an esteemed guest, \"When someone gives you delicious food, you are supposed to eat it; not spit it back in their face like an ungrateful brat.\" She touched a finger to her chin, \"Hmm, I think its obvious that we need to liquor you up a little before you can be properly fed.\" she said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gloved hand reached over and grabbed the heavy goblet effortlessly between her middle and ring fingers. Sasha's eyes widened as the set of hands around her temples pulled her back with a jerk, then keeping her head in place with his forearms, the guards attached to them forced her mouth open with said hands. The Lady poured the sickeningly strong wine down Sasha's throat, a guard rubbing her throat forcing her to swallow as if she were some sort of mongrel. She coughed heavily, and when she stopped, more was immediately poured down her throat. \"There now, in a good couple of minutes you'll be more than happy to have some food in your belly.\" Lady Montague said with a light pat the her guest's withdrawn belly, \"Lord Marquis won't exactly be happy to hear that an entire bottle of his finest wine went into one girl in one night, but I have a feeling that he won't mind given the circumstances.\" she said with horribly disguised malevolence easily detectable in her tone as her own goblet was placed next to Sasha's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of Lord Marquis,\" she started as she waited for her dearest Sasha to stop coughing up a storm, \"He's really not such a horrible man. He saved me from the stakes quite some time ago, and he's quite generous towards those that catch his favor. Why, there are some girls who stay for months at a time in his care; some even longer. I remember one in particular who got to celebrate five years under his care. Poor thing died shortly after though, she had a very weak heart. It almost makes me sad to think that those who know so little about such a wonderful man would be foolish enough to try and storm his castle while he was away on his trip to the Orient, Sasha.\" the young woman's eyes widened at that, \"But don't fret my Dear, he should be back soon enough. And when he does, I'm sure he'll be more than willing to discuss the terms of his surrender and probable assassination. But for now, I implore you to stay here; it has to beat whatever hellhole it smells like you crawled out of. I have been so lonely since the last of his girls left... oh, is the wine beginning to kick in? You look a little flushed...\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some time later, the young woman awoke in a cold sweat on top of a bed. Not her matted down bed back in Rebel Headquarters, but one of the softest materials she'd ever slept on since the crib. Her scarlet locks were tossed about the goose-down pillow and her body covered sloppily in a heavy quilt. Of course, she could have been placed in there neatly, she was always a bit of a restless sleeper. As her eyes struggled to stay lifted and she slowly regained consciousness, she realized just how much piercing agony she was in between her breasts and privates. While the quilt was heavy, the padding inside was certainly not thick enough to justify the considerable lump jutting from her middle. A moan escaped her lips as she struggled to lift the blanket, only to find that she was too weak from fatigue to do so successfully. However, she did move it enough to see that she was neither in her old rebel attire nor the dress she had put on the night before. She was instead dressed in a nightgown that was a heavy shade of lavender, her stomach visibly protruding outwards in a round bubble of what felt like lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, she wasn't even in the same room she had dressed in the night before. While the other one was relatively simple (for a room in a castle, anyway) this one was rather... elaborate in decoration. The paneling was a pale yellow with blue trim, while the dresser, amoir, nightstand and other furniture of the like were a deep brown. Her bed, wrought iron, stood against the wall and a fireplace was clearly visible to her left, where two blue daybeds sat askew so that they were facing each other and the lit fire. A fainting couch was visible in the corner, and the window overlooking the shore was slightly drawn by lovely curtains. Of course this was all quite lost on her, as she didn't quite have the time to appreciate the fine arts of decor while her stomach felt like it was going to tear at the seams. She moaned again, feeling like a heavy weight held her down at all angles. She was so worn that she couldn't even muster the energy to turn her head, though every instinct told her to leave if at all possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe matching set of stag heads over the fireplace told her that she was still in Lord Marquis' territory; she hadn't been turned away by that mental woman from the dining hall. Rather, she hadn't been tossed back out to the public like she'd hoped. Apparently Lady Montague was serious about insisting that she stay at the Marquis abode until his Lordship had arrived. The only real question, other than how to get out of this gilded crackerbox, was why did she feel so bloated? Why <i>was</i> she so bloated? She didn't remember eating anything last night, not for real anyway. So why did it feel like she had devoured yesterday's entire feast herself? And why was there a distinct taste of pork in her mouth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing her questions aside for now, the captive young woman noticed the heavy door opposite the window. Rocking back and forth with great effort due to her engorged midsection, she finally found herself in a sitting position atop the comfortable bed. She uneasily stepped onto one leg and then the other, knees knocking like a newborn calf, and steadily waddled towards the door. She could only remark that this was what childbearing must feel like, the intense pressure on her stomach was much more bearable when it wasn't pressing directly on her internal organs, While not at all pleasant, especially not with the slight hobbling it made her do, the large bulge underneath her nightgown was certainly less obtrusive now that she was moving. She reached the doorway and, what a surprise, it was locked. With a load groan, she audibly voiced her displeasure. She would have kicked the door, but given her current top heavy situation, that might have sent her tumbling to the ground. She hurried to the windows but, on top of being several stories in the air looking over the shore with only sand rocks and water to break her fall should she decide to actually jump for it, it was also locked. Another groan escaped her before plopping down on one of the blue daybeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay there for a while, thinking over her curious predicament; surely she'd gotten out of worse. They'd stormed a factory in the name of revolution, where she'd fought off plenty of big burly men who worked for the King. She personally had camped out in the woods for months at a time when the base was under siege, having escaped arrest by her quickness and the skin of her teeth. What made this any different other than the strange lump grown inside of her stomach? Oh, right. The strange lump stuffed inside her stomach was what made this challenging. That and those guards were strong; way stronger than any of the guards allocated to the Crown. That was also a bit of a challenge. They seemed so lifeless, now that she could remember them. Almost as if they weren't human. With that kind of strength and deadly accuracy, they probably weren't. That was worrisome, she'd never fought the paranormal before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour of reflection later, still on the daybed, her thoughts were interrupted by the turning of the black doorknob. As she tried to jump to attention in hopes of busting some faces and getting out of here, she found that the noticeably smaller but still incredibly painful lump in her stomach was still too much to handle. She fell back down onto the sofa before she even got to her feet. \"Oh no, don't get up.\" a sickeningly familiar voice said from behind her, \"Though after last night I assumed you'd be out for another couple hours or so, let alone getting up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it much slower this time, the young captive eased her way off of the daybed and onto her feet. Instinctively as she felt the weight drop in her stomach, she brought her hand to its convex point. \"What is this?!\" she asked aloud, referring to her stomach. \"Hospitality, a brilliant room, an ocean view...\" Lady Montague said dreamily as she leaned on the fainting couch wistfully, \"Honestly dear, I don't know what you have to complain about, when I was your age-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" the captive shouted, now directly pointing at her distended belly, \"What. is. THIS?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of modest shock painted itself onto Lady Montague's face as she looked at the bulging tummy of her guest. \"I suppose that would be the remnants from your little dietary blunder of last night still struggling to digest.\" her answer was almost sarcastic, \"We get a little wine in you and all of the sudden you're shoveling food into yourself so quickly we'd all assumed you'd been starved at that Rebel Base.\" The captive girl waddled towards her, \"This is food?!\" she shouted, \"You expect me to believe that I actually ate enough food to feed an army of my own accord?!\" Montague was either telling the truth or had a wonderful poker face, \"Honestly Sasha, I don't see why you're so shocked. You looked as if you hadn't eaten in months by the way you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY NAME IS NOT SASHA!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever your name is, Miss Garniet, I assume that you'll be joining us downstairs for lunch.\" Montague seemed a little less patient with the girl than last night. Possibly because there was no way of getting out of the castle. \"Lunch?! You expect me to go to lunch?!\" the bloated young lass parroted, \"With this?! The belly stolen from a farmer's prized sow?!\" she shook her stomach for emphasis, the tight dome barely not even jiggling. In retrospect, she'd wished she hadn't, as it upset the delicate food baby inside. Montague touched her chin in thought, \"You're right, the stairs might be a little much for you.\" she said, much to the chagrin of her unwilling guest, \"I suppose we could have Gretchen bring the food to you, if that's what you desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't desire food at all; the least not with you!\" she spat bitterly, \"All I wish to do is speak with Lord Marquis and rip out his eyesockets!\" she fumed, \"And you're next if you don't cater to my demands!\" There was another silence between the two women and the four guards that Montague had been escorted by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't rip out eye sockets.\" she said at last, rising from the daybed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said you can't rip out eye-sockets.\" Montague continued, \"Now if you would have said eyes or retinas, that's perfectly possible. But eye-sockets are just that, sockets. They're in your skull.\" she lectured, brushing her untarnished dress off with black gloved hands, \"And, as for catering to your needs, I'm entirely sure that we, either myself or my guards, can cater to your every last beck and call with time. At least enough time for our lord to return to his castle, where he will most definitely find you blathering on about his surrender when he gets her. When. he. gets. here.\" the Lady said, her expression growing cold and callused, \"Patience is a virtue my dear, and so is humility. It would be very humble of you to accept the meals that Gretchen has worked so hard on just for you. It would also be very becoming of you to adopt the patience of a saint and stop demanding the presence of a man who isn't here. You and I may be spending a very long time together, Sasha Garniet, and I would very much like to enjoy it.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh Sasha, you must learn to hurry.\" Montague said in a breathy voice, always chiding her guest on how to better herself some way or another, \"I mean, I understand making an entrance, but honestly the food will have spoiled by the time you manage to clear all of those stairs.\" She turned, having only just recently changed into a luncheon outfit herself. Her new attire was dark in color, as it seemed to be her preference, and kept to her apparently regal tastes in fashion. Long and billowing, her dress touched the floor at least a good foot away from her feet. The middle, drawn tightly around her slender waist, was girdled in black leather that allowed her incredibly modest bust to be exposed ever so slightly. The sleeves, stopping at her shoulder, were slightly raised so as to give the impression of shoulders. Which she had. Obviously they just needed some showcasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming, I'm coming!\" the regally dressed guest said with utter disdain in her voice. She grunted heavily as she attempted to balance a still protruding middle and heeled shoes on a stair without falling over and busting her head open. Said middle was a great obstacle in Montague's choosing of attire tonight. Originally, the statuesque lady wished that her precious \"Sasha\" would be dressed as she was, only in a different pallet consisting of the regal color purple. But her bloated tummy would have none of the corset, and since it was just so necessary to have a corset with the dress that was already pretty much completely on Sasha, she forced the maids to undress her and start all over again. Several times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while there <i>were</i> larger dresses for guests who were a little more generous around the middle literally laying around the castle in the various unused bedrooms, Montague found it rather silly to send her maids rummaging about all the other rooms for a dress that was slightly more lenient on poor Sasha's digesting figure when she already had maids rummaging through the already overtaxed armoire. Those poor overworked twin maids (as well as Sasha, who had to stand completely still throughout the ordeal) went through at least five more dresses before they, or rather Montague, settled on a garment that wasn't too overtaxing. However all Montague could do was gripe about how unassuming it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so eventually our heroine came into view wearing a lovely evening gown that looked rather breathy and sporty. The hem came down to her shins and fluttered about listlessly like a purple petals with every step. Her shoes were uncomfortable, though not the worst she had tried on today, and bent the arch of her foot somewhat as the drastic angle between her heel and toes took its toll. Hoses that rolled up onto her thin legs seemed to compliment those accursed ruby shoes, so she could at least find solace in the fact that she looked decent. Not that she cared about something like that. No, never. No way... Anywho, changing the subject, her own shoulders were exposed due to the whimsical nature of this particular dress, fully exposed in that her long flowing locks of that unearthly reddish brown had been tied into a slight bun on the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling you must hurry, do I have to send a few strong hands to help coax you down here to me faster?\" Montague half-teased with a sharp look in her eyes. \"Never mind that now, hurry down so that we may begin lunch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, our heroine was at fault for assuming that Montague had lied to her; for rather than the expected leftovers, an entirely new course had been set for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night's meal, which incorporated the swine as its focal point, had been redone in a spirit of avian celebration. There was a large turkey, much larger and plumper than any bird that any young peasant's eyes had ever gazed upon, resting heavily upon a gaudy platter of silver- so moist and and supple that it was stewing in a small puddle of its own juices as it was served by a pair of strapping identical butlers. On either side of the over-fattened fowl, keeping in the overworked spirit of symmetry around here, two hens were also courted out along with their once-gobbling cousin by a pair of matching maids. The bread, hoisted in a large loaf that also required two sets of hands, was brought out behind the flock of defeathered fowls. It was cut in two and placed vertically on either side of the turkey, because apparently the man in charge of the decor and preparation around here was a loon for even-ness. And at last the wine was brought out, a different bottle, but no smaller nor probably any less expensive than the first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was done with an inhuman precision and speed by only a handful of staff members. They were nimble in their jobs, never missing a beat. These almost robotic (assuming that they knew what robots were back then. I'm going to.) servants and maids almost made it seem like they had rehearsed this elaborate display all night; you would think they were bearing the royal colors or something! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes of attempting not to fall and break her neck later, Sasha managed to meander her way clumsily down the stairs, catching the coat tails of this marvellous display. \"You really go all out for company, don't you?\" she asked flatly as she attempted to hobble to the table. \"Back where I'm from, we usually just say grace when company's over.\" she chuckled, hoping to catch some reaffirmance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was met, just with that same hollow laugh that Montague seemed to share in all of Sasha's little \"jokes\". \"Oh Sasha.\" Montague said in a feigned sense of breathless humor as she waltzed over to her seat at the head of the table. At first, Sasha had thought of making up an excuse that would lead her to some sort of half-baked escape plan. But the armed guards stationed around her end of the table (specifically) seemed to dissuade her. \"Go on, take your seat.\" Montague invited with a strange sense of warmth detectable in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned to her fate, the young redheaded lass made her way over to the other end of the table. Her chair, large and ornate, was pulled out for her by two of the three stationed guards so that she may place her rump down gently. She did so and was immediately scooted back towards the table. Once both women were seated, two of the many molded maids emerged from the kitchen, each armed with a plate and a complete set of silverware, and proceeded to make the plates for the \"esteemed\" women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a lot of food.\" Sasha said warily, still upset at herself for having eaten so much the night before, \"Are there... going to be guests dining with us tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMontague was brought the wine bottle and watched as a butler poured her a glass, \"No, I'm afraid not.\" she said wiltedly, \"It will just be you and me tonight, Sasha. Without Lord Marquis around, and in no small thanks to that hideous people's revolution going out and about this country, I'm afraid that we don't get any guests.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman at the other end was so frightened by the sheer amount of food being piled onto her platter that she didn't even take the time to correct her hostess' habit of calling her Sasha. She must have been an absolute animal last night, assuming that she really did eat all that food. Which, according to her admittedly fuzzy memory, was still quite a lot. It wasn't the simple fact that she had done it, but what really troubled her was why she had lost control like that. Granted, it had been a few good weeks since she had eaten moderately well, and even that was a stretch since it consisted of pig's feet and grog, but that was no excuse for indulging herself so fiercely! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so lost in her thoughts that she hadn't even noticed that Montague had been talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasha?\" she asked softly from across the table, \"Sasha, can you hear me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" the redheaded girl asked stupidly as her eyes suddenly focused on the dark-skinned woman across from her, \"I-I'm sorry, what did you say?\"</span></div></div>",

What can I possibly gain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cracked plane of compressed silt which stretched out endlessly around him baked like a griddle in the increasing heat of the day. After a while, Kovu had to find shelter, some place where he could nap away the worst of what the sun had to offer, hopefully not frying in the process. He found a hollow under a sunbleached log, displaced here likely during some long past flood from lands unknown. He dug with his paws to make the cool, slightly damp place bigger and slid his lean body into it. Kovu sighed with the small pleasure of getting out of the sun as well as being able to relax now without fear of being seen by anyone sent out to search for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and pressed his back into the crook of his narrow little cave, rolling nearly onto his back. Then he flopped over, agitated, followed by his opposite flank. This is wrong, some part seemed to say. She needs you back there, they all need you. Kovu sniffed. \"I don't care,\" he said into the dust before rolling over into an uneasy slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, Kovu felt a beetle crawling over his paw and snapped it up without thought. Even the beetles are dry here, he thought absently as he squeeze himself out of his shelter. Soon there was nothing left there but his paw prints, fading rapidly away on the hard surface of the dry place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoggedly Kovu continued, as long and as fast as he could. He'd eaten well of the small store the Outlanders were able to supply in the barren place and hopefully his last meal would last him until he could find better climes. He knew he could not go to the Pridelands. Simba had made that quite clear the last time he'd stumbled into the region as a cub. When he'd had a juvenile crush on a young lioness there, a princess... But by now she was a half remembered memory. Kovu only really remembered the life of training and hardship imposed on him not only by the surroundings but also by his mother, Zira. Last week she had visited upon him the last of a long list of greviences stretching back through the years of his young life. But no more, not if Kovu had anything to say about it. He'd rather be a clannless rogue male than a prince in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-phfaw! Prince of what? Prince of dust? Prince of wood mites? They can all rot!\" Kovu said callously to the disdainful desert. And he meant it too. He would have spit if he did not value precious moisture so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days wore heavily on Kovu. He'd have already died if he had not managed to successfully dig for water in a few places, sucking muddy water out of the ground, trying to filter it with his teeth. His last meal seemed like a distant memory and his belly growled as he walked. Nothing stirred in the desert save for the buzzards and their ever watchful eyes. They were not circling yet, he must still have too much energy in his gait, and Kovu felt relieved. He trusted the judgement of vultures when it came to matters of life and death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother three days passed and Kovu could no longer recognize the landmarks surrounding them. He took comfort in the unfamiliarity, it told him he was now far from his former life. However, now he had only the growling of his empty stomach for company. The occasional beetle was not nearly enough to sustain him. Kovu found himself resting more often on his never ending trek. He'd lost some substantial amount of weight, judging by the feel of his ribs against the ground where he slept. He needed food and soon. But the desert... It had swallowed lions greater than he without a trace. Kovu began to worry if his might soon be just another set of bleached bones projecting from the pan hard ground. He licked his dry, cracked lips and continued on<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the night, Kovu stumbled along. He began to wonder if he had already died, long ago behind him, it'd been so long since he'd seen another living creature. Constantly he looked for low patches of shaded ground where he might dig. His hunger was a dull ache in the back of his mind, but now his thirst was threatening to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCruelest of all, there was a patch of green before him. The moonlight shone down on the distant oasis, painfully tempting. And yet the last one he had seen had been nothing more than a mirage, remaining always in the distance, evaporating like vapor as he drew near. It would break his heart to be so deceived again with the prospect of hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu dragged his paws over the flat ground. It was hard to remember why he'd left. What had been so bad again about living with Zira and the rest of his family? At least there had been enough food to get them by and water besides...water. He could almost smell the delicious tang of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...he <i>could</i> smell it. And it was coming from ahead of him! From the mirage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no mirage,\" Kovu croaked lowly, trying to irritate his parched throat as little as possible. He gathered the last of his reserves and bounded across the desert, heading for the green and the promise of water it offered.</span></div></div>",

He came up gasping for breath, his immature mane hanging over his eyes. He paddled his front legs to keep his head above water. He'd drank so much he thought he was going to be sick. But it hardly mattered. Not now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu threw himself down on the grassy, reedy bank and sighed in relief. He listened to the morning chorus of tropical birds singing as the day lengthened. Trees surrounded him, reaching up to touch a sky of mottled green. The light reaching down to the ground was pleasantly dim, though the heat remained stupefying and humid to boot. Still it was a vast improvement over the desert, now behind him. Any hope Zira might have had of finding him was now gone. Kovu felt that he had a new home now. <i>\"For as long as I need it to be...\"</i> he thought critically. After all, if he made it here, why couldn't Zira or even Nuka? In fact, he wouldn't put it past his mother to know this place existed. \"Is there a reason why she never came here? Deciding to eke out an existence in the wastelands outside of the Pridelands?\" Kovu hoped it was only her intense hatred of Simba and his pride and the desire to reclaim what she saw as her 'birthright' which caused her to linger. He hoped there was not some hidden danger about this place beyond the obvious plenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the oasis was plentiful, Kovu could tell that at once, having passed several different kinds of animal droppings from monkey to warthogs on his dead-eye rush for water. Now that he was sated, he could get to the serious business of hunting. Kovu lifted himself and decided to press on through the rest of the day. He needed to get his bearings if he was to have any hope of stalking prey here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate in the afternoon, as Kovu was beginning to get a feel for the dimensions of the generous oasis, the smell of ripening meat left out in the warm jungle atmosphere caught the attention of his nose. This long since he'd last eaten, Kovu had no intention of passing up an easy meal, even if he had to play the role of scavenger. He let his nose lead the way through the thick crowding of brush and fern leaves. The interior of the oasis was a wet marsh surrounding a wide lake where birds and a couple hippos floated languidly. Water trickled down the rocky face of a jungle encrusted mountain which sheltered the haven for green and living life within its arms. It was up the slope of his precipice that the tantalizing scent of meat and spilled blood was leading the dark maned lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally made it to a place where the ground was not so steep nor so soggy. The grass parted here and there in the game trails of warthogs as they tore through the brush in their constant search for food. Kovu made a mental map of these along with the ones he had already observed. These were great places to settle down for an ambush. Kovu normally walked to the side of these trails, so as not to spread his scent and alert his prey to his presence, but now, the ground gave way in front of him. The water had carved the side of the mountain where it streamed into the marsh and the lake below. Kovu had to move to the side, into the trail in order to keep following the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had he stepped on the trail, however, before something snapped underfoot. Kovu yowled in surprise as his foot was lifted into the air by a bent sapling of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-yow!\" Kovu snapped as his head banged against the ground. After the initial pull, the sapling was bending back over. Whatever creature this snare was designed for, Kovu was too heavy for it. However, his paw remained high in the air and the blood was rushing to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of all the cursed...who the hell would put such a bloody inconvenient thing here?\" cursed Kovu soundly even as a couple of coconuts clicked and clacked together loudly, though not as loud as Kovu's continued cursing. As he reached up towards his trapped paw, which was held in the air by a loop of woven tree bark, Kovu remembered who it was that used these sort of devious devices. He felt a tingle of fear spread up his spine despite his face reddening under the fur. Zira had said the poachers set traps for lions! \"I've got to- uph! get out of here!\" he growled, straining his upper body to get up at the loop holding him uncomfortably half in the air. Every time he reach up, his back banged against the ground as the sapling gave a little more. All the time, the coconuts continued to bang and clatter together<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last he flopped backwards, puffing from his exertion. He was armed with sharp claws and teeth, but the cord was tight and fast against his paw, so tight his toes were turning purple. He couldn't get at it, his own fur and skin getting in the way of his efforts. He wondered if there was any chance he could break the sapling suspending him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could implement his plan, however, there was movement in the grass beyond. Kovu held his breath. His stomach muscles burned as he tried to lift himself up to get a better view. Something was coming...</span></div></div>",

But there it was, tall fronds of grass waving in the air as they approached...straight for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately Kovu went for the loop around his foot again, but it was useless. His head banged against the ground again for his trouble...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he found himself looking up into blue eyes that seemed as shocked to see him as he was them. Kovu thought that he was seeing some horrible fusion of animal and plant, but no, this was a lion and a female too by the smell of her. She was wearing a bizarre amalgamation of the native flora draped across her head and back. It was all weaved into some sort of cloak, it hung low over her blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blew up at the grass hanging over her face to clear her line of sight and then smirked down at the lion whose foot was caught high in the air. She clucked her tongue against the roof of her mouth, \"Well, well, what have I caught today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You?\" blustered Kovu, this was all making very little sense and the blood was pounding in his ears. \"Y-you made this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness looked at her claws, turning her paw this way and that nonchalantly. Her fur was darkly colored even darker than his. \"I did. And now I have to decide what to do with you, Outlander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word stung strangely despite the accuracy of the title. Kovu's mouth gaped, \"What do you mean decide? Get me down!\" His back flexed and the sapling lifted him a couple inches into the air, only to drop him back down onto the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, and have some rogue male lion running loose around here, marking every tree and bush in sight?\" the lioness said, as if affronted by the notion. She lowered her paw and shifted her weight. It was then that kovu saw that this lioness was really BIG. With none of the usual odors associated with pregnancy, this female sported a round belly that hung even with her chest and was wider at the waist than Kovu was at his shoulders. She traded her weight side to side often, as if standing were slightly uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kovu did not linger on the lioness's unusual appearance. \"What are you going to do then? Leave me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't test me.\" she growled, suddenly nose to nose with the snared lion. \"That option is still on the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu pulled with his foot, bending the sapling further and shaking a few leaves off its thin branches as a demonstration. \"You can't. I'll break out of this thing by myself in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness hissed in agitation, and perhaps more than a little fear. Despite her excess weight, Kovu could tell, even from this precarious position that he was bigger than her in stature and frame. Then she raised her claw, extending sharp claws above Kovu's neck. \"You raise a good point, Outlander. I just might have to kill you myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu winced, wondering what in Africa he had gotten himself into, but he saw that her paw was shaking, the look in her slit pupils uncertain. He took a deep breath and relaxed his body. \"Look, this got off to a bad start. I'm not here to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness kept her paw raised but some tension relaxed from the wrinkles on her snout. \"Why are you here, Outlander?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just came in search of water and food. I've been traveling the desert for a week.\" said Kovu. \"And would you stop calling me 'Outlander?' My name's Kovu.\" He reached out a paw towards hers, but she flinched, retracting it. He rested it back against his stomach, content just to not have claws hanging above his throat. \"What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby lioness shifted uncomfortably and blew again at the grass hanging over her eyes. \"Mipa.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear if immanent death poured out of Kovu's spine like a bad poison. \"See? That wasn't so hard, Mipa.\" said Kovu, looking up at her from the ground. She looked down, but seemed uncomfortable with direct eye contact. Her ear twitched when he said her name. \"Seriously, I'm not here to hurt you. In fact, I'll probably be on my way in a few days, I just need to get a few good meals in me before I go back out into the desert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa looked away, brown fur rippling over her thick neck. She drew a breath through clasped teeth, clearly uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu didn't like the way she refused to look at him. He tried again. \"Mipa.\" she looked down, \"Please let me go? You don't even have to see me again, the oasis is a big place. It'll be like I'm not even here, then I'll be gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grimaced in obvious distress, showing her gleaming white fangs. Her breath smelled of blood; she'd recently eaten. Kovu wondered if it was her kill he'd been scenting up this side of the mountain. \"I-I can't do that. I'm sorry, but I have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and left, her cloak of grass rasping softly as she made her way through the long stalks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mipa! Mipa wait! Come back!\" Kovu shouted after her, but she was already gone. There was no sign of disturbance through the grass she'd disappeared into besides her lingering odor, mild for a lioness and yet strangely spiced in a way with which he was unfamiliar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu slumped with his neck against the ground. His hip socket was starting to hurt from supporting the majority of his body weight. He shook his head, sparing a moment to bask in the sheer wonder of encountering such an odd member of his own species. With a sigh, he then turned his efforts back to trying to break free of the snare, hopefully before whoever she went to talk to comes back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eager not to face whatever person Mipa had gone to consult, Kovu renewed his efforts to break free of the snare, this time knowing that his life could very well depend on it and time was assuredly short. The dark maned lion twisted and turn, arching with all the strength in his back. Unwilling to go back to clawing at the death-grip the loop had on his poor constricted paw, Kovu worked on bending the sapling as much as he could. Eventually it would break, or so he hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the blasted tree was tall and springy, it couldn't be any older than himself. It had all the give in it bounce back after all of Kovu's desperate pulls. He took a deep breath, the back of his neck again landing on the ground, much to his chagrin. He needed to rest, but he also didn't have the time... \"Wait a minute...\" Kovu muttered and turned around. He rotated his body where it was supported in the air, until his forepaws gripped the ground. He then commenced to walk forward, his claws sinking into the grassy turf, gripping it by the roots. His leg stretched out into the air behind him as he pulled himself forward, inch by grueling inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on...you blasted...thing!\" grunted Kovu. He was now running out of space between him and a fallen log in front of him and also his leg felt like it was going to dislocate out of its socket. He closed his eyes and groaned, his claws sinking into the turf, he struggled just to hold on, and then pull himself just a few more inches... Sweet relief. There was a soft ripping sound behind him and Kovu found himself flowing forward, his haunches lowering to the ground. He slumped, panting as his belly came to rest against the ground. Looking behind him, he saw that the sapling had not broken, but rather he had lifted the damn thing out of the ground, its root ball protruding with black soil near the ground where it lay felled by brute strength alone. The lion sighed and heaved his breath, just happy that it was done. He rest a few moments then proceeded to loosen the coil around his foot with his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he was free, he was on his feet, trotting down the path Mipa had taken through the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure why he was going after her. She had thought about killing him after all. She wouldn't have killed me, thought Kovu, who had seen the nervousness in her eyes...but he couldn't quite be sure that she wouldn't have if she'd felt there was no choice, or else gotten someone else to do it for her. Other questions rose to mind. Where did she learn to make a snare like a human hunter? Why does she wear a grass covering? What is she doing out here? How did she get so fat? The last seemed most mysterious of all. Kovu had never see a fat lion before of either gender. Food was scarce at best in the Outlands just outside the lush Pridelands. He had difficulty imagining how much food it would take to swell a lioness to Mipa's proportions. To Kovu's eyes, she appeared prosperous and rich beyond imagining, almost as if he had stumbled onto a hidden cache of wealth; and for a lion, wealth meant food (and mates).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sure that there was a secret here, and selfishly, he wondered at the possibility of that secret possibly being his. So he followed her trail through the grass, pausing here and there to sniff for her fragrant spoor. His head turned when he heard a soft voice. He lowered his head and sneaked as quietly as he could to the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Jobie, what am I going to do?\" Mipa half asked and half wailed. Kovu paused in the long grass, listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a male here, a male lion! and he's big! I'm scared Jobie.\" Mipa cried. Kovu listened as best he could, but he could hear nothing of the voice of her companion. Cautiously, he crept closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have killed him! It's no different than a big antelope...\" Her voice quavered, \"I know he's a lion too! but his face and that beautiful mane... I couldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu stuck a paw in one ear, but still he could not hear Mipa's friend as they spoke. A few feet more and he reached a small parting in the grass. Glancing it aside part way, he finally saw why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa sat heavily on the ground, her back to him. Her tail twitched this way and that and her wide flanks showed through gaps in her grass coat. In front of her was not another lion as Kovu had been expecting, but in fact, a skull. The skull rested on a stick at head level in front of the plump lioness, empty sockets staring into space. It was cleaned of flesh and stark white, but Mipa talked to it as if it were alive. <i>So this is 'Jobie',</i> thought Kovu with amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jobie, how could I?\" Mipa responded to a silent question. \"It's been so long since I last spoke with another lion. Not since they cast me out!\" She spoke the word with obvious ire. \"He'll know, Jobie. He'll know I'm an outcast. He'll call me fat and lazy just like the rest of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu hid as she turned her head, but he saw she was only blowing her nose. The sides of her snout were slick with tears. \"Jobie, what if he fights? What if he drives me away from here? I can't go out into the desert again...I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu's heart pounded in his chest. He'd never seen a lioness so hurt and deprived of social contact that she'd resort to talking to a skull. And it was obvious that she was hurting as he watched her, suddenly feeling guilty for stumbling into such a private scene. But he could not unhear what he had head, and sickly he was still curious to listen and she pleaded and begged answers from the dead empty skull. He wanted so desperately to help her, to offer the aid that he'd been deprived when he'd been hurting and alone back with Zira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut might it be dangerous to interrupt? How would such an obviously unstable lioness react to his sudden appearance. It might be safer to wait until she was less emotional. But then, who said he was gaining anything by waiting, and it was dishonest besides now that he could not easily depart undetected. She might even respond better to honestly. Above all, however, he knew he couldn't make her feel cornered, she was stressed out and fearful enough.</span></div></div>",

He could not sit here and hide while while this female cried her heart out to a dried up old skull all about her fears and worries <i>about him!</i> He was determined to settle things, for one way or another. The uncertainty was clearly tearing Mipa apart. <i>Besides,</i> he reflected, <i>I've never been much for waiting...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu stood and did not care to conceal the sounds of his paws as he walked forward a few steps into the glade. He didn't want to get too close to Mipa, to avoid starling her, but she'd surely heard him walk through the tall grass, and then it would really look like he was sneaking around. He was half surprised when the lioness did not round on him immediately, but then clearly she was preoccupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mipa.\" said Kovu softly, sitting on the loam covered turf and curling his tail about his slight profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness's back, which had been arching outward slightly in her slouch suddenly went as straight as a board. Her ears perked at the top of her head and the hairs bristled up at the nape of her neck. She emitted a tiny \"Eeep!\" sound and then slowly turned her head, eyeing the seated lion with one eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu waited for her to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovu...?\" she asked with trepidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inclined his head slowly. He made no sudden movements, he wanted her to take the initiative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulder shook with a pent up flight or fight response. Her face contorted through a range of emotions, finally settling on anger. \"H-how did you get here?\" she asked accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu tilted his head slightly. \"I followed your scent...\" He cast his eyes wide and saw something else as well, behind the heavyset lioness, \"And there's that.\" He gestured with his nose to the exposed ribcage and fresh carrion just beyond the skull on the other side of the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa tossed her head in a curse and paused to look back at the empty eyed pig skull. \"I know you told me to clean up!\" she hissed at the skull before turning back to look now fully at Kovu. \"Y-you...you need to go.\" she stammered, looking at the larger male's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu looked at her face, but she wouldn't meet her eyes. \"Mipa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and said, \"Just leave, Kovu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young male puffed out his chest. He was not about to just turn around from the first lion he'd seen in a weeks travel from here. \"Mipa, I'm not going to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling, the chubby lioness got up unsteadily and squared her four feet in a wide stance, her tail waved high over her head. \"So you are here to drive me away, aren't you?!\" She snarled, \"Well...y-you won't find me easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu sucked in a breath. The lioness before him, although quite overweight was more than capable of killing him, he had no doubt about that; even with her waistline, he knew she was far from harmless. Still, he had no intention of fighting her, he'd run before he had to fight... still things looked like they could get messy. He stood, only to not be at a disadvantage should she pounce. \"Mipa, please! How many times do I have to say I'm not here to hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa's nose wrinkled in a bestial fashion as she continued to snarl. \"You're just saying that! You're just like the rest of them! You're all the same!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same as what? What are you talking about,\" cried Kovu, his voice now rising as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness it seemed, however was beyond reason, she was ready for a life or death brawl. Her coat of grass fronds rattled with the tension across her whole corpulent body. Her paw dug furrows in the moss under her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu back up a step as she came forward, shoulders pumping under the thick padding on her back. She didn't stop. \"Mipa. Please, just stop and think about this for a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closer she got, the larger her curved fangs seemed to gleam in the bright moonshine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow or never, the female didn't look like she was going to listen in her current state. Maybe Kovu could try to out run her, or else he was going to have to subdue her. Now was the time to decide.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mipa looked like she was serious. The lioness crouching and her tail aggressively high, she growled noisy stepping steadily closer, forcing Kovu to the edge of the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about then that he realized that he would be at a deadly disadvantage in any flight. Mipa knew the terrain and he didn't. Kovu hadn't wanted to, but he figured that he didn't have a choice; he had a better choice in avoiding injury in grappling with her straight up than getting ambushed by her later on. <i>She doesn't look too fast. Maybe if I can just get in an pin her\u2026</i> Kovu thought as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was obvious, Mipa hadn't been in a fight in a while. She advertised her pounce with a huge tell, nearly a whole second in advance of her initial attack. For once, Kovu had cause to be grateful for the constant bickering and infighting he and Nuka had shared growing up. His reflexes were still sharp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uph!\" Mipa grunted where she landed, her bulk quaking under her grass cloak. Kovu dodged easily, but was himself slow to counter. He still didn't want to hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mipa!\" Kovu called, but she charged again, this time slashing out with her claws. She growled in frustration as Kovu danced away, although she forced him into the tall grass which rose over both of their head. The black maned lion leapt high, using the trunk of a nearby tree as a spring board when he was unexpectedly cornered by an especially vicious assault by the chubby lioness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed on his flank, but had plenty of time to recover. Mipa, just beyond sight was puffing, already winded with her brief attacks. Kovu lowered his chest, preparing to spring on top of her when she came for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't. Showing a wily streak, Mipa quieted her breath and curved around Kovu out of sight. He listened intently, but obviously her hunting skills were not at all atrophied. Kovu grew worried, remembering the lioness's clever grass cloak. He lifted his head, looking around and scenting the air. However, it was clear that Mipa lived in this area. Whichever way he turned his head, he detected her odor. He listened and hear nothing but the wind rustling the grass under the sparse eves of the lightly wooded area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad\u2026\" Kovu whispered to himself, wondering if he ought to try outpacing her after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd barely taken a step before the option was taken from him, however. Something <i>big</i> came flying out of the grass; it didn't take a genius to figure out who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been aiming with the apparent intention of flattening him under her considerable bulk, but she came up short, hitting him just below the shoulder. Kovu also rolled with her blow, lessening the severity of the impact and also preventing her from getting her claws into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Mipa was remarkably <i>heavy</i>! Her weight was fully on him for a few moments as she rolled, and just then she seemed like two lions pressing down on his lean form. Kovu gasped for air as they came around still rolling and flattening the tall grass under them. He made sure that he came up on top. Mipa struggled like a wild thing, hissing and yowling, flailing her deadly claws in every direction heedless to her own safety. She was incensed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu gripped one wrist then another with his paws and forced them to her chest. He straddled her wide belly with his hind paws as she continued to kick with abandon, but Mipa lacked stamina. All Kovu had to do was hold her still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually her growls and snarls turned to moans and weeping. Her belly, surprisingly full and firm, filled the space under his rib cage and between his thighs where he held fast despite her bucking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFresh tears spilled down her full cheeks as she let her head fall to the ground with a weak thud. She offered her throat, \"Just kill me, I don't want to be raped, just kill me\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu sighed raggedly. He pulled on her paws so she'd looked up at him. She sniffed miserably. \"I'm going to say this one last time, I'm not here to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu shook her again, \"I followed you up here to make sure you were alright.\" he said, not quite truthfully, but at least it was indeed part of his reasons. \"I've been lost in the desert for a week since I left my pride. I haven't seen another lion in all that time.\" Kovu sighed and shook his head, exhausted both physically and mentally, \"I just wanted to talk, alright? That doesn't mean I want to kill you or chase you away from your home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa was silent for a long time, resting on her broad back with this large male lion straddling her, the forks of their legs uncomfortably close. She relaxed her face in thought. Without the fury wrinkling her brow, Kovu thought that Mipa was fairly older than himself, though still young. Perhaps four, maybe five. He wondered how long she'd been living here, alone. \"Talk?\" she muttered finally, as if it were a foreign word. She looked at the stars behind Kovu's broad shoulders. \"You\u2026want to talk\u2026to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu said nothing, instead staring pleadingly into the bright blue eyes of the foreign lioness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, she burst into laughter. She guffawed into the night, her great belly heaving with Kovu on top, making him feel he was riding wave crest after wave crest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, he hopped off of her, but Mipa kept laughed, eventually rolling over and striking the ground with her paws. It was a sight to bring a smile to the dark lion's face. Genuine mirth, so rare back home. Before he knew it, he had joined her, adding his voice into a bestial din which drove the night birds away for a mile around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, both lions were seated before the half eaten remains of a jungle boar. Kovu's mouth and throat were already stained red with generous helpings. There was little left now of the once meaty beast, although the bones and gristle could keep Kovu occupied easily through the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa remained guarded and socially awkward, but at least she seemed resigned to the fact that he was not going to attack her. Kovu insisted that he was just passing through and this seemed to comfort Mipa who slowly, through bits and pieces, related her own story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu gathered that Mipa had not left her former pride willingly but rather had been banished. All Mipa would say on the matter was that they thought she was \"Fat and lazy\" However, Kovu did not believe that was the entire issue. Mipa described wandering for a \"long\" time by herself, avoiding contact with rogue males and other lions in general. She spent time dwelling in the nebulous areas between rival prides out on the savanna, \"scurrying like a rat and always hiding. Lone females oughtn't be caught out in the open, my mother said.\" Mipa said. But apparently some time ago, this area had closed suddenly when both prides migrated near each other's borders at the same time. There was a war brewing and Mipa knew she wouldn't be welcome on either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you ever ask them?\" asked Kovu<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa chuffed, as if the question were ridiculous, \"Ask? Ask who? Everyone knew I was an outcast. They saw me on the borders, they hid their cubs from me, like I was some sort of f-freak! or a monster. Every adolescent male who saw me had exactly one thing on his mind...er, no offense.\" she said glancing at Kovu and rubbing her paws together. Kovu just cracked open a bone and began sucking out the marrow, bidding her continue. \"It was so hard to outrun young males...but then, I was considerably less...er, full figured back then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two prides began feuding, Mipa was left with nowhere to hide. She went to the only place she could go: The Desert. \"It was so hot and dry. I was dying, literally dying.\" she said. \"That's when I met Jobie for the first time...\" she said in a small voice, clearly still ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu glanced to the pig skull mounted on its stick, then back at Mipa, who'd grown quiet. \"Care to tell me about Jobie?\" asked Kovu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down, then settled onto her elbows, lowering her head to Kovu's level. She sighed, the only sound other than the cracking of bone in the lion's mouth. Finally, she said...</span></div></div>",

Kovu watched, a cracked bone hanging from his mouth, as Mipa approached the mounted skull, her \"Jobie.\" She took a deep breath and let it out. She looked up into the empty orbs of the dead skull and then slashed out at it with a paw, her claws streaking in the moonlight. She knocked down the skull and stick and then, with a small growl, proceeded to jump down on the skull where it had landed a few feet away on the moss. The brittle old skull sundered completely under her considerable weight, shattering like an egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Mipa was left panting, catching her breath, as if the affair had taken serious mental effort for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu waited, saying noting. Eventually Mipa returned to lounge in front of him, across the gristly pile of bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she seemed calm, Kovu asked, \"Why'd you do that to... erm, Jobie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at him. \"You don't have to use that name. I know you don't think he's real.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could Kovu refute what was true? Still he looked at her with sympathetic eyes. \"Well he's real to you isn't he?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa chuffed in wry humor. \"Jobie isn't real, at least not like you or I am real.\" she said, then more quietly added, \"He'd just be a distraction right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu cocked his head, letting the empty bone fall from his mouth, \"Aren't you going to miss him though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipe turn her face towards him and a grin made her seem younger, dimpling her large cheeks, \"Oh, I can always get another one. He's never more than a meal away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion's eyes widened in surprise and he spoke no more about the mysterious \"Jobie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that Mipa admitted to eating most of the pig before Kovu even arrived, he felt guilty about eating alone in front of her, especially since it was obviously her kill. He felt indebted to her, not only for the meal, but also - in a vague sort of way - for the whole oasis where she had lived alone for an unspecified period of time. This was her home. Kovu had a strong feeling for it, especially in this glade where she seemed to spend a lot of time. He glanced at the pale fragments of bone littering the ground, once a skull which had obviously meant a lot to the disturbed lioness. Kovu felt like the worst sort of house guest, one who moved in like he owned the place, carelessly shattering precious relics and artifacts in his clumsy gait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd tension still abounded between them Mipa seemed unwilling to get too physically close to Kovu and almost never turned her back to him. She seemed still instinctively terrified of him, but also terrified to be away from him. Kovu thought that she recognized how desperate she was for social contact with another lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling relaxed and somewhat sleepy after the generous meal, Kovu began to relate his own tale. It wasn't in perfect detail, of course, but neither was Mipa's either. Kovu told the lioness seated before him about Zira, his mother and her plans for revenge and ascension, gaining mastery of a wide domain called the Pridelands. \"She was a bitter, foul female.\" said Kovu. \"Her only reason for existence seemed to be revenge. But it wasn't my revenge, it never was, no matter what destiny my father foretold for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You father?\" Mipa asked, surprisingly acute despite her social awkwardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu sighed, \"Yes, his name was Scar... He killed his brother.\" It was at that time that Kovu realized this would take a long time to relate in full. So he gave her an abridged version, saying simply that at a later time, Scar was killed by his brother's son and the pride schismed. Those who supported Scar were banished to wastelands outside the Pridelands. \"And there we rotted, rooting in the dirt for grubs by day, scavenging by night.\" Kovu said. \"My mother favored me. I was to be Scar's heir, had things worked out differently for my family. I... mistook her favoritism for love... for my entire childhood. But I was never anything but a pawn to her.\" he failed to mention a certain cub he'd met on a specific misadventure when he'd been young; in fact, it slipped his mind altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so sad.\" said Mipa. When Kondo looked up he saw that the large lioness had edged closer. Her once gorgeous cloak of grass and fronds was now mostly tattered for rolling about, but she still had to blow at the strands hanging over her eyes. When Kovu saw them, they seemed intense, piercing. She looked down. \"At least I knew that my mother loved me very much... I'm so sorry Kovu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark maned lion stiffened. He hadn't meant to garner sympathy, rather just explain why he'd left. He hoped he hadn't come across as pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising a paw, Mipa scratched the underside of her thick, fleshy neck, the brown fur rippling where it sagged generously. Kovu still had no idea how in the world she could maintain such a high weight, living by herself. When she spoke, she looked just to the side of him. \"Kovu.\" a nervous tick passed through the corner of her mouth, \"If I ask you to do something right now, can you promise not to ask me about it later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu shrugged, \"Well sure.\" Though inside he felt a slight unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathed and Kovu tasted the smell of her breath, which itself seemed rich with frequent meals and plenty. \"Just... hold me for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu looked across at her where she lay on her belly on the thick moss of the glade. Her profile was so different than what he was used to. Exceptionally wide for one, bulging in areas where he was used to seeing dips. He could see nothing of her ribs, nor her hips or spine. Even her shoulder muscles were muted and diffuse under the thick blanket of fat. Suddenly, he did want to know what she felt like; in another context besides fighting each other. He scrabbled forward on his elbows and knees. He looked down and saw her gracefully rounded chest, protruding like a large fruit at her collarbone. He smiled and put his larger paws over hers. She flinched, but didn't flee this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa closed her eyes and Kovu lowered his head towards hers. He rested his neck against hers. Soft and thick. That was the first impression, Mipa was different than anything he'd ever felt before, soft and yet with a firm, underlying solidity. He pressed his neck against her and rested his chin on her back. Where there should have been a dip between the shoulder-blades, he felt only a curved plane of solid flesh. Again it astounded him just how <i>FAT</i> Mipa was. Every inch of her was saturated it seemed. <i>How could a lion get this way?</i> he wondered yet again and another stranger though intruded, <i>I wonder if she could get any bigger?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu just blinked the odd thought away, instead concentrating on holding this odd lioness who hadn't been touched by another lion without fear or anger in who knew how long. He breathed the scent of her coat. She bathed often and her skin exuded a surplus of the natural oils which kept it sleek and glossy. She smelled <i>healthy</i> and exceptionally feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa broke the contact abruptly, as if remembered where she was and who she was with. She coughed awkwardly and rose to her feet. \"Morning is coming.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu noticed the dawn breaking overhead, lightening the sky. \"It is.\" he observed, waiting for Mipa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I haven't slept.\" she muttered, then added, \"I'm going over there.\" She gestured with her nose to one side of the glade. Kovu could just barely make out evidence of woven grass nestled somewhere within the tall strands. \"W-w-would you mind sleeping over there.\" She pointed now to the opposite side of the glade, where they had had their little scuffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu looked and then peer in the direction he knew that the clifface was. \"If you like I can sleep down below. We can meet up again this eve-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Mipa cried turning abruptly. Her belly and flanks wobbled with her sharp movement. She breathed out a breath and let her hackles smooth. \"I-I'd just feel more comfortable knowing where you are. I'm sorry Kovu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem.\" said Kovu, who himself rose and began sauntering over to the opposite side of the glade. He let his tail hang merrily behind him despite having been told where to sleep by an overweight female. \"See you this evening, Mipa!\" he called over his shoulder. Then he yawned, he really was very tired. He had not rested in over 18 hours; a very long time for a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you earlier, so we can check my traps.\" Mipa said in a normal tone that Kovu had to struggle to hear. Again, he was confused by the word \"traps\" coming from a lion. But he didn't dwell on it. He was determined not to make more of a nuisance of himself than he already was. <i>This is her home.</i> He reminded himself. <i>I can put up with being told where to sleep, if it makes her feel more comfortable.</i> One thing Kovu desperately did not want was to head back out into the desert where there was no food or water and he had no idea where he was going. He really needed to regain the weight he'd lost out there before he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu nestled into the comfortable grass, folding it under his lean body. It felt good to have some padding between his ribs and boney hips and the ground. He wondered what it must be like to carry that padding around with you all the time like Mipa. \"Must be nice...\" He sighed and fell almost immediately to sleep</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kovu awoke from a deep slumber to an overweight female prodding him in the back with a paw. \"\u2026Kovu?\" she asked unsurely and jabbed him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu rolled over lazily, flattening more grass under him. He groaned burry eyed and looked up at Mipa who stood over him. His pupils narrowed to slits; the sun was still shining brightly. \"W-hy're we gettin' up now?\" he slurred. Normally he wasn't this groggy, but in the last night he'd run across a desert, tore through a jungle, broke free of a snare and had to subdue lioness who outweighed him by perhaps as much as 50%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see my traps as well at night.\" said Mipa, already turning. \"Now hurry up or I won't be able to check them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu was almost tempted to tell the lioness to go check her devil contraptions by herself, but he caught the hesitant glint in her eye as well as the twist in her words. She wasn't about to let him out of her sight. She still didn't trust him. So, with a grunt, Kovu lifted himself up and followed the rather chubby lioness as she lead the way back down the side of the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold this, Kovu.\" said Mipa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu rounded the trunk of a wide tree to see the rotund lion with her paws placed together on the ground before her. When he got closer he saw that she was holding down some sort of vine. Lifting an eyebrow, Kovu moved next to her, copying the gesture. \"Like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, other side. That's where the tension is.\" said Mipa in a businesslike tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefuddled, Kovu nevertheless did as she bid. With his paws down, Mipa got up and energetically trotted away to inspect something near the trunk of the tree he just past. \"Mipa, what is this f-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let go of that rope!\" shouted the lioness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Kovu had let up, the rope had begun to pull away past his paws. Overhead, he saw a large weight move, a concealed rock hoisted into the canopy and supported by more woven cord. Immediately, he put his weight back down and the rock stopped moving. It seemed fascinating that the large weight was somehow connected to the little rope he held in his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa was not amused by Kovu's lack of prescience. She tied something off quickly using a dexterity in her forepaws that was admirable. Growling softly, she trotted over and took the rope from Kovu. \"Normally I'd tie this off before making adjustments. I just thought that since you were tagging along, you'd make yourself useful\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu's eyes widened. Not so much from the scolding, but from seeing Mipa like this. All of a sudden she was quite knowledgeable and sure of herself, officious even. And he had no idea on Earth what she was doing with these vines and these knots and loops and twigs. \"This is another sort of trap I suppose\u2026\" he ventured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Mipa breathed. She held the rope in her mouth and tugged it down to another tree so that it bisected the game trail they were currently standing in. She grunted with the effort it took to lift the rock high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you with-\" started Kovu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go' i'\" Mipa mumbled, bringing the rope to the other tree. There she tied and adjusted it. Kovu observed how she made it so that the rope was strung tightly just a little above ankle level across the trail; about knee level for a warthog. She breathed a sigh of relief when it was done, sitting back on her haunches. She plucked the rope with a single claw; it went *twang*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one's all set again, although the stone cradle is starting to look rotted, I'll have to make a new one.\" Mipa explained, half to herself. Kovu got the feeling that she spoke aloud to herself often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark maned lion had had enough. He'd been polite so far, but Mipa acted as if he knew exactly what she was doing and why or that it was so obvious that it didn't need an explanation. He went to her and put a paw on her shoulder to keep her from getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flinched again, looking at him with wide eyes, her lips a tight line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu chuffed and took a seat beside her. Mipa, will you please tell me what's going on? What are we doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026 we're checking the traps.\" She said, obviously confused as to the nature of his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get that much, but why are there traps in the first place? Why do you build these things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snorted in amusement, \"Well, to hunt of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu's mouth hung slightly agape. Hunting was a very specific, sacrosanct aspect of a lion's life. It was a serious matter, literally taking life and death in your hands (both for yourself and your prey) and it was also a passion. Plus racing, blood roaring in your ears, paws darting lightly over the surface of the earth, the rich spray of blood, the last struggles of a living being in your jaws as you choke or bleed the life out of it\u2026 so it can be your own. That was hunting. This\u2026 This seemed more like homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumfounded as he was, Kovu stuttered, \"I-I still don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa sighed raggedly and rolled her eyes. She seemed in danger of piling Kovu again into the category of lions who'd tormented her in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke quickly, \"Maybe I'd understand better if you told me when you started doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa breathed out a sigh and looked at Kovu, her shoulder relaxing. \"Well, to be honest, it's hard to remember it seems like I've always been building traps and hunting this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, that word, \"hunting\" Didn't Mipa know the thrill of chasing down a breathing, snorting animal, snuffing it's life with your claws and teeth? Honoring it's sacrifice as death embraced it, you its usher? Kovu tried to be openminded, keeping his opinions to himself for now. \"Do you remember the first time you build a trap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she smiled. Kovu liked it when she smiled, he liked seeing her thick cheeks dimple. \"I was young, really young.\" she said. \"I must have been a little different right from the start. When my siblings and littermates were all out wrestling with each other and mock hunting, I was usually in the grass, looking at bugs and stacking rocks and twigs into little sculptures. I didn't like to play rough, you see and I cried whenever they knocked down what I was building.\" Mipa's eyes were glossy, distant. Her whiskered twitched and she continued, \"One day, I went out to see something that I'd piled together out of rocks and stick and saw that it'd fallen down. I was picking it apart, but as I did, I saw that a mouse was trapped inside those sticks and rocks. How it twisted and squirmed! It was marvelous.\" Mipa breathed another sigh. \"I ate the mouse and it was delicious. And better yet, I'd caught something before any of my brothers or sisters had managed to catch anything bigger than a grasshopper. I told my mother, but she didn't believe me. She just told me to go on and play with the other cubs like a normal girl.\" Mipa changed her pitch, her voice becoming sharp. \"But I didn't I tried to catch a mouse again. I tried and tried, so many different ways, but I finally figured out how to make a simple box trap. After that, I could have mice pretty much any time I wanted. But did anyone care? No, and by that time, my mom was showing me off to the Alpha male, trying to buy more status for herself with me. I didn't want anything to do with him. The lout couldn't even be bothered to remember my name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa closed her mouth with a click of teeth slamming together. Kovu guessed that she'd said more than she meant to. Kovu had been brought up with cuffs, scuffles and hunger. Respect was something that you had to take for yourself. Signs of awkwardness or weakness were preyed upon instantly back home. Kovu felt that Mipa was weak, she complained about how others were treating her, but she didn't talk much about what she did to change that! Still, Kovu felt that she deserved better than endless exile. The problem was that no one but her was capable of making a better future. There'd be time to address that later though... Kovu was determined to start out his new life helping people. And Mipa clearly needed help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a time of silence, Kovu rose and Mipa as well. The male lion could hear Mipa's spine creak a bit as she got up. Kovu let the lioness begin leading the way to the next trap. \"So, these trap things work well then? You're able to support yourself without chasing anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa chuckled. She paused and turned to the side a bit. Reaching up with a paw she stroked and then patted her curved, distended flank. \"If anything it works too well!\" She laughed. Then she frowned and let out a breath, her paw continued rubbing up and down her swollen tummy, \"I... I've put on a lot of weight since coming here; I can see that now.\" She shook her head and then started padding forward again. It was a few minutes before she spoke again. \"At first it seemed like a good thing, despite all the teasing back home. It meant that my way worked better... but... well...\" She hesitated, but seemed more comfortable talking with him following behind her. \"You can see I've gone all doughy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKondo shrugged to himself. \"Doughy\" was putting it mildly in his opinion. The lioness litterally waddled. With her woven cloak now in tatters, he could see the way her flanks bounced and wobbled with each step. He should say something.</span></div></div>",

The lion sped up to walk beside the female as she waddled, her overlarge tummy swinging side to side as she moved. There was a tiny rasping sound, the sound of the fur between her thighs rubbing as she walked. \"It's not a big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa suddenly rounded on him, frowning deeply. \"Not a big deal? Really Kovu? I got banished from my pride because I was fat! and I've only gotten fatter since then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mipa.\" said Kovu, his voice rising a little. He was indeed tired of the lioness's self-pity. \"That can't be the whole story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I forgot, they also didn't want me because I refused to run after stick-legged gazelle and work myself into exhaustion every night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant. I-\" started Kovu, but she interrupted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stop-\" cried Mipa, flustered, her tail lashing back and forth, \"I don't want to talk about this.\" She rushed forward and Kovu followed in her wake, silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey said little over the next few hours. They checked many traps; Mipa had littered the entire oasis with them. She followed a well practised trail, leading down the mountain, around the lake in the middle and back up the other side. Most of her devices needed little to no attention. Other ones she triggered and then left broken. Kovu could not help inquiring as to these. \"Old traps,\" Mipa would say. \"Leaving too many about is dangerous and also it discourages prey from forming set foraging patterns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few of Mipa's traps were baited, usually the larger, more elaborate ones. Mostly she set snares where she noticed a game path. She explained how she and the animals who shared the oasis with her went through regular patterns of change and development, she always had to keep on top of their habits, and they were always trying to keep her on her toes as well. The way Mipa described it, it was like a vast play with each player moving into the gaps of the other's steps. It was far more intellectual than the savage pleasure of the chase. But as Kovu tried wrapping his head around it, he thought he could at least appreciate her point of view. Her approach - and it was a valid approach, he saw now - seemed almost stately somehow. But it was not something that he could or would want to do. He needed the blood rush, he needed to stare death in the face. What Mipa was doing seemed too impersonal and it did not respect the creature being captured for its strengths and weaknesses, but rather sought to take advantage of them. In Mipa's game the winner was not the 'best' of hunter and prey, but who was the smartest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a cage made of twigs and grass, they found a small monkey trapped inside. Mipa grinned. \"At last a bit of good luck!\" she squealed and took off after it. The trapped animal was weak, but it revived when it saw Mipa. It shrieked and threw itself against the bars, but to no avail. As Mipa reached in, it still, seeming resigned to its fate. Mipa took the little creature in her mouth and shook it, breaking its neck. She reached behind her to her tattered cloak of grass, but became alarmed when she saw the state it was in. \"Oh no! My <i>isidwaba</i>! Ugh, it's ruined!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" said Kovu, \"I'm sorry about that Mipa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him then back at her cloak. \"It's... oh, it's fine, Kovu, really.\" She hopped on three feet, carrying the monkey in her paw. \"But I used to have a strap here I could tie my kills to. You can carry this right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu grinned at the chubby lioness. \"Sure.\" And he took it in his mouth and followed her as she twisted through the lush oasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way through the jungle they saw few other creatures, but that was normal, smaller creatures avoided large predators; it was a fact of life. But Kovu had to admit that Mipa made no pretence of her location. She stepped on twigs and shuffled rocks underfoot, making a relative racket as she passed through the jungle. Though Kovu guessed she figured that with traps to catch her food for her, she didn't have to be all that stealthy as she moved through her domain. Still, there were signs all about, some quite fresh. If Mipa had not been so intent on her traps and her procedure, he might have started on the trail of some warthogs or a forest antelope by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were getting to the end of the trail now. Kovu could tell that without Mipa's guidance because they were coming around to the other side of the mountain. The slope increased sharply as they began to climb. Mipa's traps often took advantage of the angle of the terrain. He had to admire the creativity and her adaptability when it came to devising this things. Each one seemed almost unique in its construction and the way it worked. But overall, most of them turned out to be empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's usually like that.\" said Mipa later on. It was dark now and the lioness had finished trying to repair traps; lion eyes lost color and a lot of detailed focus at night. She was now just checking to see which ones had food. \"I'll set 100 traps and maybe three or four of them will have something. But that's all I need, and really, it's enough to get fat on apparently.\" She said the last with a resigned shrug. She laughed, \"Some days I'll get nothing, and other's I'll find half a dozen monkeys and a hog to boot. But it evens out over time. Most days I get something to eat, and that's more than my sisters can say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu nodded, still carrying the limp monkey. Lions were opportunistic feeders. There was the sudden plenty of a kill, followed often by days or a week without food. One had eat to food while it was available and store fat for when it wasn't. He looked at at Mipa's plump, round rear as she walked ahead of him, a heavy saunter in her gait. Only with Mipa, it seemed there weren't any lean times. <i>And she doesn't have to run for her food,</i> Kovu added in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like it was going to be early evening by the time they arrived back at Mipa's private glade. It had taken only about a fifth of a day to traverse around the entire oasis. It was a decent amount of land, but now Kovu thought that it was actually rather small to be an entire world. They still had a few more traps to check. Mipa remained hopeful. \"You never know what you're going to find. Sometimes the big catch is in the very last one.\" She grinned back at him, \"Really, there's nothing truer than that I've learned. You never know what you're going to find.\" She finished with a wink at the tailing lion and turned to make her way through the grass and ferns.</span></div></div>",

It sounded like... coconuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way, Kovu, hurry!\" said Mipa as she garnered a spry step in her gait and bounced off into the jungle. Kovu followed without too much effort. Glacing ahead, he noticed Mipa's big belly heaving to and fro, her flesh jiggling and quaking at her hips, flanks and shoulders each time her paws hit the ground. Her tongue lolled out the side of her mouth with obvious effort as she lolloped along; her gait was efficient for her frame, but not what Kovu would have called 'graceful.' Mipa was definitely out of shape. He would have hardly called this running, let alone sprinting and females were supposed to be lighter and faster than males; Vitani and Zira could certainly have outrun him any time they pleased. Of course, she was carrying a lot more weight than he and on a smaller frame besides. Perhaps he ought to be more generous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to let her lead the way, carrying the limp simian in his mouth as he followed in her footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stopped suddenly, Kovu almost bowled into her broad back. She plopped her round bottom on the ground and panted briskly, her tongue hot and wavering in the warm jungle night. \"Would... you look... at that...\" she said between deep gulps of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu hoped she was not overexerting herself on his account. But he rounded the wide lioness and the monkey fell from his mouth when he saw what Mipa had caught. Initially, it looked like nothing so much as a jumbled heap of feathers and twine. But as he stepped forward while Mipa was still catching her breath. The thing writhed and let out a low crooning. A large soft feathered wing, black and white in color (or at least light and dark as far as he could tell), flapped uselessly in the air. Kovo turned back to Mipa, \"It's an ostrich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa grinned with a mouth full of fangs. \"Looks like we are going to eat well for the next couple days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu didn't dare take the privilege of ushering Mipa's catch into the next phase of the Circle. Thus, it surprised him immensely when she asked him to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" asked Kovu, raising his eyebrows, \"Don't you want to do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa hissed through her teeth. \"I don't really mind when they're small. All you have to do is shake them a bit. But the larger ones... There's all the blood everywhere... uck.\" The big female shuddered. \"It's such a mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu cocked his head. He really didn't understand a lot of Mipa's priorities and odd manners. He shrugged. \"There really isn't that much blood when you grab them by the throat.\" Of course, the amount of blood never seemed an issue before, in fact the more there was usually the better; it meant the animal would be dead faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine! Just let me...\" Mipa started, but Kovu reached out to touch her elbow with his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she seemed surprised by physical contact. She settled back onto her thick haunches, her generous belly resting on the ground under her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can do it, if you prefer.\" said Kovu, \"I was just wanted to know why you didn't. The ostrich is yours by right, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was her turn to look dumbfounded. But she just shook her head. \"Just go kill the thing already. Can't you tell it's suffering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was. The ostrich was not caught in the original snare so much as bound up into the entire mechanism. Apparently it had tried to break free only to wind up making itself even more hopelessly trapped. Kovu was even more duty bound to make this quick. Fortunatly, the large flightless bird's neck was accessible and its hollow bones snapped quite readily. Mipa stared at him as he muttered a small prayer he and Vitani would say after catching something fresh, but she said nothing. They both worked for the better part of an hour untangling the large bird from the ruins of the traps without further mangling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey might have eaten it there, but Mipa insisted on taking it back to her glade and Kovu saw the sense in this. It was not far, after all, and it offered more comfortable sleeping than the rocky, wooded area where they had found the bird. Lions liked to keep their kills close, especially if if would take a day or more to eat in full. If Mipa had not claimed her right to kill the ostrich, she definitely enforced her priority as the provider of this meal by making Kovu do the heavy work of dragging the beast back to her lair. She took the puny monkey in her teeth and left Kovu to struggle with the 200 lb creature up the rest of the mountain. Kovu might have complained, but even as an adolescent, he was already used to females asking him to do things for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnencumbered by a large dead animal, Mipa made her way back much quicker than Kovu. When he finally stumbled into the glade, holding the ostrich by the base of its long neck, he spied Mipa sitting in the grass doing something. Kovu smirked, imagining her to already be eating the monkey, an appetizer for the feast to come. He dropped the large and very dead bird on the moss of the glade and sauntered over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wore a smirk on his face, expecting to find her off guard and guiltily stuffing her face. However as he approached he saw he had stereotyped her incorrectly. Mipa wasn't horking down the monkey before he could arrive. Rather, she was busy manipulating the long grass with her forepaws. She was <i>weaving</i>. Feeling a bit ashamed for his assumptions, Kovu lowered himself down onto his belly and looked up at her. She paused. \"How do you do that?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Mipa, not sure what he was talking about, \"Oh you mean this.\" She looked down at the new cord she was making out of the long dry grass. \"I'm just making some twine to start fixing my isidwaba... my camouflage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... but how?\" asked Kovu, his tail wavering in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I bend this part down, wrap this around, and then come back. See it's easy.\" said Mipa, but Kovu stared in mild awe, seeing the lioness work her paws with seemingly impossible dexterity. Given the physical limitations, Mipa had stretched the ligaments and tendons in her paws in a way Kovu had never seen another lion do. She was capable of moving her first two digits of each paw independently of each other. She would grip things with the last two and even demonstrated increased flexibility in her dew claw. She moved them with a quick and easy grace that came with years of practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu snorted happily. \"No Mipa, it's not easy. I couldn't do anything like that. I never met a lion that could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa glanced at Kovu and dared a small half smile. \"Really? It just seems so... obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu chuffed and tossed his mane a little. \"It's because you're really smart, Mipa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Mipa looked down at her partial cord and frowned. She wiggled the toes of her forepaws in a way that looked extremely strange to Kondo. \"Nobody's ever said that to me before...\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeizing the opportunity, Kovu crawled forward over the grass. He pressed his shoulder against her softer one. \"Well now they have.\" Kovu said, \"And I wouldn't say it if it weren't true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa sniffed and wiped something from her eye. The moment lasted a few seconds longer, and then she coughed, rising and letter her cord fall away. \"Come on, let's eat, I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first time that Kovu saw Mipa eat reminded him not so much of large meals with Nuka and Zira and Vitani in which there was always a lot of bickering and propriety. But rather of a monkey alone in a tree full of fruit. Mipa and Kovu both had a lot of fun tearing feathers away from the ostrich and watching them drift away in the slight breeze. She then settled herself at its breast while Kovu waited at the opposite side. After she'd open up the bird, she began to eat with a single minded abandon. She obviously took a lot of pleasure in her food, closing her eyes and even moaning at times under her breath. She tore meat away from the carcass and gulped it down at a steady, though quick pace. She wasn't frenzied as Kovu remembered his family being, everyone trying to eat as much as they could as fast as possible, but rather she ate with a clear passion for dinner while at the same time pacing herself to maximize the experience. Kovu watched her for a couple mintues without her noticing before starting on the other side of the great bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later they both rested full and lazy in the grass surrounding the glade. Their paws intermingled, Mipa too turgid to care about the contact or perhaps even growing accustomed to Kovu's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again.\" said Kovu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa opened her mouth, but belched quite loudly instead of talking. After a short laugh she tried again, \"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For sharing. If I weren't here, you would've had the whole thing to yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa rubbed her vast tummy with a paw absently. With each lion able to pack away up to 70 lbs of meat in a sitting, there was actually little left of the once proud ostrich (although, in reality it was more like 50 for Kovu and 75 for Mipa, he was still a little full from the warthog the previous day, although the female showed no signs of waning appetite). \"Well, if you weren't here, I'd have nobody to talk to either... Nobody real.\" she amended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu smiled awkwardly, then, on impulse he reach out and touched his nose to hers...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She seemed shocked by the sudden intrusion. Her tongue reached up to lick the place where he'd touched her, her eyes wide with surprise. For a moment, Kovu thought he'd gone too far. Then she smiled. \"Thank you Kovu.\" she said. Then she looked away, her eyes taking in the bloody carcass of the mostly devoured ostrich, the tall wavering grass and the green of the trees surrounding them. \"You're different than any lion I've met, Kovu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned back at her. \"I could say the same about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her face back around and hesitated, unsure. Then, on an adventurous streak, she nipped out with her snout and licked Kovu across the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and wiped his eye with a paw. \"What was that for?\" he asked jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her eyes down slyly. \"I think I like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked into each other's eyes for several long moments. But it was clear that each was too full of meat to keep sleep at bay any longer. Kovu broke the contact with a massive yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovu...\" said Mipa shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I just... roll over next you you a bit?\" asked the heavy female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu snorted, his tail wavering in mild excitement. \"Of course not, Mipa.\" She giggled and chuffed as she began to shift her weight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when the wide female began to roll over towards him, Kovu thought at the last instant that he might have gotten more than he bargained for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa's belly bulged roundly, sagging below her rib cage. It was an impressive sight to see on a grown lioness; though to be fair, Kovu was bulging roundly now as well, though his stomach was almost a sphere while Mipa's was much more massive and saggy. She got her paws against the ground and shoved, having to fight against her own fatty torso. She was even more clumsy that usual, her belly literally brimming with a heavy burden of meat. She grunted as she moved over her stomach, bringing her back to belly with Kovu. Over that hurdle, she almost threw herself down on her side, bringing her back to Kovu... Too close! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu clenched his teeth as her flabby flank and thick bat fat buried his paws. He didn't dare make a sound. \"Kovu, you OK, back there? Am I too close?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath and extricated his legs one by one, pulling against the heavy bulk of Mipa's body. She was much wider than him, especially at the waist, her flank rising over the ground higher than his own lean profile even though he was still longer and thicker of chest than she. \"I'm fine...\" he managed and let out a quiet breath as he pulled his last leg free. \"You're alright, Mipa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good... Thanks again, Kovu...\" she said sleepily, her breath already starting to even out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu smiled wryly and snuggled up against Mipa, her back against his belly. She was soft all over, softer than the woven grass mat under them; her bed, he remembered. He rested his forepaws against her shoulders and his thighs against the thick shelf of fat at her tail head. With his toes, he could feel the cute little roll that spilled over her tail, right at the base. She wrapped her tail around his foot silently, letting him know that she knew what he was doing. Kovu would have laughed, but he was too tired. His last thought was that he still couldn't believe that he was sleeping with such a bizarre lioness, but also, that he was glad for the company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was daylight when Kovu came partially awake. His belly still filled to bursting with ostrich meat, he only cracked open his eyes, sleep pulling at him strongly. He had planning on sleeping the entire rest of the night away as well as the following day. He wondered what could have woken him from his food-induced coma. He blinked in the fierce sunlight and flexed his paws. They stretched out across the grass. That was his first clue. <i>Where is Mipa?</i> he wondered, his mind in a haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the sound of the soft tearing of flesh and Kovu looked out across the glade. There he saw the chocolate brown furred female. She had discarded her cloak and stood in her unobscured natural beauty, although this was washed out slightly by the oppressive glare of the sun. Kovu squinted. She had her head down to the still bloody remains of the ostrich. Her big belly quaked and emitted small churning groans of complaint that took sharp ears to hear. The male lion looked at her perplexed. The meal that he had gotten out of the ostrich would keep him sated for the next two or three nights without hunger. He figured that this sort of gorging made sense if you were worried about hyenas or buzzards or other lions stealing your prey, but they were alone out here. There honestly wasn't any need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as Kovu's eye sight became more adjusted, his pupil squeezing tight to filter the sunlight, he saw the look of abject pleasure on her face. Her eyes shut as her chin and throat dripped with blood. \"Mmmm...\" she moaned under her breath and went down to tear the remaining meat away from the nooks and crannies of the bony ostrich. Kovu thought that this was different from last night. Whereas they had been sharing a meal together to continue living as predators did, now Mipa just seemed to be eating for the sake of eating. <i>\"Or was it any different last night?\"</i> thought Kovu. <i>\"She made the same noises and she ate a lot more than me...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu thought that the cause of her weight problem was pretty obvious. It even had to be obvious to her. He wondered why she'd lied to him. He didn't feel hurt so much as confused. though he could understand if she was embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing an impressive display of intestinal fortitude, Mipa polish off the remaining meat on the carcass, leaving nothing but clean bone and gristle exposed to the air. She belched loudly before waddling back over towards Kovu. He hadn't moved during the entire time. He could pretend he'd been sleeping this whole time and not make a big deal out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, how was Mipa going to change her habits if no one confronted her? Kovu was undecided. Who was he to tell her how to live her life after all? She seemed to get by well enough even with all the extra weight. It was she who was responsible for dinner afterall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis indecision decided for him as Mipa came over, waddling heavily with the heavy load in her abdomen. Her belly was bloated so much that it rounded out much of its normally sagging surface, taking up the give in her hide. Her flanks stuck out at her sides so that she almost could pass for pregnant and her gut hung down lower than her chest, in fact, almost to her knees. She sighed and let herself down as gently as possible her back to the \"sleeping\" male lion. She shuffled her blubber on the ground backward until her back was against Kovu's belly again. Then she let out another sigh of absolute contentment. In the time it took Kovu to register that she knew nothing of his farce, she was fast asleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu frowned, slowly stroking Mipa's soft shoulders as she slept. Her warm back felt good against his tummy, currently rounded like a ball as well. Her dark brown coat, darker than his own, rasped softly under his rough paw pads. <i>\"Is it so wrong to carry a little extra weight?\"</i> he wondered as he stroked her. <i>\"That's not a little extra weight.\"</i> he corrected himself, <i>\"It's not a <b>little</b> anything!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu grimaced with conflicting feelings. Mipa was certainly a different sort of lioness, brilliant, independent, but also crippled socially and distrusting of others. She seemed to have a lot of baggage she wouldn't mention either. A day ago, he hadn't even considered the possibility of staying here more than a few days, two weeks at the most. But, as his paw moved across her back, pushing deeply into the fat and feeling nothing below the thick padding, he knew that he liked her as a friend... and perhaps as more than a friends. <i>\"But she's so fat!\"</i> Kovu scolded himself. And he recognized the fact. Mipa was very fat and she still seemed to be gaining weight, if this current binge was any indicator of her regular diet. But her fattness did not imediately repel him... it just looked <i>different</i>, and also interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he find her attractive? It was a possibility, as Kovu tried to organize his warring emotions.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kovu pushed his forepaws into Mipa's thick back. His claws extended just enough to make her shiver in her sleep. She sighed softly and stretched, pushing harder into his paws. Kovu sighed as well, this time with pent-up desire. He did find Mipa attractive as a female, fat thick body and all! The extra bulk swaddling her body was soft and supple, a marvel to caress and to touch. And Kovu found himself wanting to touch her, to press his body against hers as he was doing now. Mipa was the first fat lion that he'd ever seen and she seemed to possess an exotic form of beauty that he hadn't even realized was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, females were expected to be a little soft. They needed some extra weight on their bodies to raise healthy cubs. Mipa, however was well beyond that level, passing from overweight into the clearly obese category. Still, as Kovu traced his paws down her back and over her bulging flank, he saw artistry in her exaggerated curves and in the folds of flesh at her neck and the base of her tail. She smelled exquisite, her coat rich with natural oils secreted by her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something about her that wormed its way into his head and refused to let go of his thoughts. Mipa was different from any other lioness he'd met and it was those very differences - the difference in her shape and in her personality - that attracted him. He let his paws rest and rested against her back, sleep again pulling him back into its lightless depths. He found himself trying to imagine Mipa with even more weight on her... how she would look in a few months if she kept up her display of gluttony. He dreamed of her by his side, flanks bowed out and belly hanging low, a special mate, a unique lioness in all of Africa. He was eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her last binge, Mipa slept for 25 hours straight. She got up twice to relieve herself off in the trees, but the rest of that time, she slept heavily in the shade of her bed, favoring her back or her flank for sleeping. She snored quite loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu himself was hardly less guilty. He slept for 14 more hours after waking to see the lioness polish off the last of the ostrich, Mipa snoring in his arms most of that time. It was the middle of the night, a half moon illuminating the glade when restlessness forced Kovu to get up from the relaxing warmth of the fat cat lying next to him. He stretched fluidly and made off into the trees for some pressing personal business. He returned to find Mipa sleeping like a rock. He sniffed her and decided that she would get up when she was ready. It would turn out to be a long wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu whiled away some time chewing absently on and licking clean ostrich bones. Mipa had been in too much of a hurry to clean them well. It took hours to really clean a carcass well, as Kovu knew from first hand experience during lean times. bits of meat clung to the bone and had to be scraped off with the rough part of his tongue. Gristle and chewy tendons held the skeleton together even when the meat was all torn away. And inside the bones was the prize of succulent marrow, good for storing during the lean times. Kovu was half hoping that Mipa would awak after a couple hours, but the night deepened and she showed no signs of restlessness. In fact she seemed intent to sleep away another whole day. Probably a wise move, considering that she'd consumed, in two meals, almost 100 lbs of raw meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime past midnight, Kovu tired of worrying the pathetic skeleton and stood. With a last glance at a lioness whose round, bloated form he found unique and attractive in its exoticness, he turned and strode off down the mountain for a walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to be cautious, he knew. The last thing he wanted was to be caught in another of Mipa's traps. He kept off the game trails and smelled for bait of fruit and aromatic nuts she used to attract monkeys and birds. Away through the mountain opposite the lake, the land quickly dried up and died. There was some long grass growing between the rocks and boulders, but the hills rose much higher than the prominence where Mipa made her abode. They were dusty and dry, but Kovu hiked up their sides, content at least that Mipa would not have booby-trapped this far out of the forest. Showing the same stamina that had gotten him across the desert relatively intact, he made his way to the top of a tall cliff fairly easily, though he doubted that Mipa could have followed him. This high up, he saw the other side of the oasis for the first time, and his heart sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the mountains, in the direction in which he had been heading, more dry desert stretched for as far as he could see by moon and starlight. He could not judge the distance well for the terrain remained rocky, unlike the flat plain which he had traversed from the wastelands just outside the Pridelands. He wondered if that was the waste that Mipa had had to cross in order to find this place. He also wondered about \"Jobie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping from boulder to boulder nimbly, Kovu made his way back down into the moister depths of the oasis. It seemed an island of life amidst a vast ocean of dry death in every direction. Mipa had managed to make a life here and Kovu was now content to spend time here if only for Mipa's sake, but he could not imagine himself circling this same few dozen acres of land, like a fish in a bowl, for the rest of his life. Eventually, they would have to leave. Mipa would surely understand... in time.... he hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu wandered down into the true jungle, the marsh and the edge of the lake, sometimes walking and sometimes swimming. By his stance and the way he walked, he advertised to the other animals that he was not hunting. By common law, he was allowed free passage and the other animals did not so readily retreat from him; though most remained guardedly cautious, as well they should, being in the presence of a King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree old aligators - two female and one male - and a mated pair of hippos made their abode in the lake. The hippos were fast asleep and the gators floated languidly in the dark, even more turgid than usual because of the waning heat. Still he managed to snag one's attention with his splashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kovu jumped back from a half-hearted charge. He looked to the large reptile who sat in a few inches of water waving its tail back and forth. \"Better luck next time, scaly-water-brother.\" said Kovu in terms of ancient respect for each other's skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gator hissed its reply as it slid a little more out into the water. \"Come for another drink and we'll sssee whose fastest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu grinned, \"Maybe another time...\" The alligator blinked in appreciation. \"Say, I'm new here. Can you tell me anything about the lioness who lives here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alligator clucked a guttural hiss, \"I th-think you already know much about her, new-comer land-brother. You have her ssscent all over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu cocked his head, \"I'd just like an outside opinion. What do the gators have to say about her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big gator clapped her fanged snout in the water, splashing Kovu's feet. \"She is a disrespectful heathen! She has no ressspect for the way things are sssupposed to work! She sssets traps for anything that moves, nothing is too big or too small to fill her greedy gullet. She even tried to trap me! I made her think twice. I nearly got her foot last time she came down here, playing with her rocks and vines... Crass youth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that she'd do that...\" said Kovu, feigning sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big old aligator swarmed forward then, resting its jaw on the moist ground. \"Don't you associate with her, young King. She is cursssed, an outcast. She darkens everything she touches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu frowned in anger, but he kept his voice calm for now. \"Why do you say that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big gator hissed emphatically, \"This oasisss, this place of life. It should be a peaceful quite place. But the animals here live in fear. The lioness's shadow lurksss in every corner and the animals here live in fear of twigs and vines Because of her, death can spring up out of the ground, rather than rightfully by another's teeth. It isssn't natural, I say. You'd do well to distance yourself from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu let his teeth show with a small frown. \"I can handle myself and my own business, thank you very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wisssh, Lion Cub.\" said the aligator as it slithered back into the lake. Kovu batted its thick tail with his paw as a parting gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was fairly uneventul as Kovu traced the borders of the oasis. He didn't care to traverse the jungle's interior without Mipa's guidance, but he was able to create a map of landmarks visible in the distance from the edges of the small pocket of life in the desert. <i>The best time to leave will be in the wet season, a few months from now... </i>thought Kovu. <i>I have until then to figure out which is the best way to go.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way back to the glade. He found Mipa lying heavily on her side in her bed, only a few feet from where he'd last seen her. The morning was advancing and so was the day's heat. With a small sigh he settled down near her in the shade of the trees overhead. He wondered if she'd wake by this evening and what she would want to do. He closed his eyes and nodded off into a light doze.</span></div></div>",

Somehow she looked even wider without it concealing her natural body shape. Her belly still swelled below the level of her chest. Both of them were still filled with digesting meat; some more than others. \"Come on, Kovu, I need your help with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa needing something brought him more awake than the prospect of chewing on ostrich bones would have. He followed her into another area of tall grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shade of the trees, the heat was tolerable. Mipa sat down on her plump backside and Kovu sat across from her. \"Alright, what d'you- Oh.\" he said, then saw what Mipa was holding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked initially like a small bundle of grass, but Kovu quickly saw that it was bunched together at one end...woven at one end. \"I'm going to teach you how to make cord.\" said Mipa with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu looked at the larger female wide-eyed. \"Mipa...I can't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovu!\" Mipa pressured, \"Come on, it's easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe for you, but I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed the bundle into his forepaws. \"This time, I mean it. You can do this Kovu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mipa\u2026\" said the lion, plucking up the little bundle and rolling it clumsily around in his paws. He felt like he was going to accidentally crush the thing. \"I don't know the first thing about doing anything like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" she said, lying down in the tall grass. She extricated another small bundle. \"I'll show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeing any other choice, Kovu settled down facing her. \"Why do you need to make rope exactly?\" he asked somewhat dubiously, a last ditch effort to escape the lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroping the thick flesh of her neck, Mipa rolled her eyes. \"Well...I need cord so I can fix my cloak and also some of the traps down in the oasis.\" She turned her eyes on him. \"You aren't afraid of earning your keep are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu chuffed. Given half a chance, he'd mention a dozen other ways he could earn his keep. But right now, however, he was held fixated by her piercing blue eyes. \"Ok, show me how its done,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out to be a simple, but repetitive task. The crude cord was woven of four strands of grass. It was fairly simple to manipulate the long grass blades at the ends of their waving stalks. Mipa showed him how to bring the correct strand down, fold another around it, then bring the side of his paw down the blades to crease it into place. The process was then repeated. There were four different folds to make, repeating endlessly in the same order, as well as a fifth when it came time to add in a new blade of grass. Mipa's clever, yet simple design allowed new strands of long grass to be woven continuously into the same length of cord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu was really amazed, although his paws were clumsy and not nearly as fast as Mipa's. Although he kept making mistakes, the fact remained that he was <i>crafting</i>. Humans were the craft makers, everyone knew that. And yet, here Mipa was, dabbling in forbidden arts. It seemed magical, and yet Mipa was so pragmatic about the affair, as it it utterly lacked any supernatural significance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kovu tried to work through the process of learning Mipa's rote method, he kept thinking about her last binge, now a full day past and yet still fresh in his mind. That look of pleasure on her face as she wolfed down those scraps despite having eaten so heavily just hours before. He wanted to know why she felt compelled to stuff herself to the brim. Not so much to stop her, not any more, but rather to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let me watch you for a while,\" said Mipa, \"I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the larger feline's constant guidance, Kovu worked slowly and ponderously, trying to remember the steps in the right order, to keep the cord growing. He almost forgot to add a new blade of grass at the right time and had to undo two creases to fix it. It surprised him just a little that he could do that much. Like Mipa had said, it wasn't really that hard, not when someone had showed him what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa returned and settled down heavily in front of him, flattening the grass under her heavy body. Kovu's nostrils widened when he scented blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the monkey. It was a little ripe now that it had sat for the better part of two days, but not really the worse for wear. No one had thought of touching it in the wake of the ostrich boon. Mipa sat her paws on it and proceeded to tear off a strip of flesh from its scrawny flank. \"Go ahead.\" she mumbled, her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu stared at her a moment and then looked down at his cord. He strongly wanted to remark on the fact that she was eating yet again, that she was, in fact, overeating...a lot. Some powerful impulse, almost sexual in nature kept making his eyes rise to see her chewing and swallowing, obviously enjoying the snack of the monkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to work. His rhythm steadied with her around, so he felt comfortable enough not to talk as he worked. Unable to withstand the urge any longer, he asked, casually, \"Hungry again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him with a critical eye. She chewed thoroughly and then swallowed, the lump bulging in her thick, fleshy neck, before responding. \"Not really, but I saw this lying around and...I don't like to waste food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see...\" Kovu hummed, still working on the cord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another bite, chewed and swallowed; followed by another. She looked suspiciously at Kovu who seemed intent on his work. \"I know I'm fat, Kovu. You can ask what's on your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu turned his head and smirked at her, \"Are you sure that I'm not like those other lions?\" It was a bit of a stretch, but he felt that he had earned that much by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa frowned, \"Please don't joke about that, Kovu.\" She released a breath and reclined on an elbow. \"But seriously, you can ask, Kovu. It...it isn't right of me to get mad at you just for asking a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu was actually surprised at this bit of understanding. But Kovu was not about to test this extension of her trust, but he felt like he needed to get something out in the open. \"Alright.\" he said, and set aside his cord for the moment. He turned on his elbows to face her. \"Mipa, you... <i>like</i> to eat, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned and looked at him harshly, but seemed to get a hold of herself. There was a slight edge to her voice when she spoke though, \"What do you mean by that? Doesn't everyone like to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but...\" Kovu waved his paw, \"I think you know what I mean. I mean you eat just because the food is there, not necessarily because you're hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small grimace crossed the corner of her mouth. The evidence was right there between her paws. \"I...I just don't like to waste food. It would be rotten in a day or two. You can have the rest if you're hungry\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu stared at her. \"Mipa, it's alright. I don't want it.\" She seemed to relax, but not fully. \"I just want to know why you choose to eat...when you don't have to.\" she gave him another look, \"I'm not criticizing you!\" he said hurriedly, \"I'd just like to understand is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa sighed raggedly and tossed her head. Her sleek brown coat glistened in the late afternoon sun. \"I...I don't know. I just see food lying around and I want to eat it, that's all.\" Kovu raised his eyebrows. \"Well, sometimes I get bored or I can't sleep.\" Mipa amended, \"Eating usually makes me feel better...\" Then she added, in almost a whisper, \"...but sometimes I don't even know why I'm eating while I'm doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both quiet for a few moments. Then Mipa looked guiltily down at the remains of the carcass, a certain longing in her eyes. If it wasn't hunger, it was definitely a compulsion of equal strength. Kovu made a shooing motion with his paw. \"Go ahead, Mipa. If you want it, eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she cocked her head. \"You don't think I'm an absolute pig, do you? For eating this so soon after the ostrich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, Kovu thought that she was a weak-willed glutton. But of course, he kept this to himself. He had a certain compulsion of his own, a notion of seeing if she would, in fact, grow even larger than she was now and what that might possibly look like. \"Of course not Mipa.\" he said. He reached out and put a broad paw on hers. \"If you want it, then take it. It's just going to rot anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was being unfair, he knew, but something in him seemed to enjoy the sight of Mipa eating. He was barely scraping the surface of the impulse, but clearly he liked the idea of the tubby lioness gobbling down tidbits after stuffing herself with ostrich just the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled a half smile and worried the small mammal with her teeth some more. Before she commenced eating again, she gestured back to the cord. \"I think you still have work to do, Kovu.\" she said. He smiled and turned, happy to work to the sound of her crunching small bones in her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was literally nothing left of the small monkey when she finished. Afterwards, she left Kovu alone to go check her traps before nightfall. She returned with several small animals. Kovu forced himself to take at least one, so she'd feel more comfortable eating the rest...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mipa's dressing of grass and fronds was probably the most complex thing that she made. Kovu had certainly never seen the like. She often commented, usually during the times she set him to binding cord, how long it had taken her to make it as well as how long it would have taken to fix it on her own. Cord wasn't all that the dress needed, but it was something that it needed a great quantity of and was the most time consuming to make. She could also use it to repair some, but not all of her traps. \"For stronger cord, I use tree bark.\" she would say and continue to explain that the grass cord was usually only suitable for some internal mechanisms in the trap or binding a twig cage together for a bird or a small monkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while Kovu was perfectly willing to help Mipa with repairing the cloak he'd ruined, he did not sit around all day weaking cord in the grass. He went off on long walks through the jungle, puzzling over things; usually Mipa's condition and his part in them as well as his plans for the months ahead. While he was thinking, he would release his pent up energy with some good old fashioned traditional tracking and hunting. Warthogs were worthy prey, both elusive and fierce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three days of catching only small prey and scant quantities of that, both lions were beginning to feel the familiar pangs of hunger. Kovu mostly because he'd let Mipa have most everything she brought in and Mipa because... well, her appetite was what it was. She never questioned the food differential. Kovu said that anything she caught was rightfully hers, anything she gave him was thus, actually a gift. While it was perfectly true, Kovu had the notion that she was also looking for an excuse not to share. He didn't think that Mipa was very comfortable with being hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an odd mentality to be sure. Lions should be used to the boom and bust mode of their lifestyle by the time they've grown, but Mipa... she moped about after as little as 18 hours without food, checking and double checking her traps, clearly in distress, though she didn't much complain aloud. Kovu had never seen another lion with such an odd relationship with food. He wondered what she would be like in a real famine. He wondered how he was going to get across the desert with her in tow. One thing was perfectly clear, it was all in her head. Her belly - and his as well - still bulged with the ostrich meat they'd gorged on, working slowly through their system. Kovu accepted small animals as snacks, but really didn't feel hungry until the third day. Mipa, on the other hand, simply did not seem happy unless she was chewing on something fresh... constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the fourth day, Kovu came to the rescue, dragging a heavy sow up the side of the mountain for them to share. Mipa was ecstatic and the male lion as well. He finally validated his presence here by providing sustenance. He made a show of picking the choice organs from the beast, a display of machismo that Mipa only generally appreciated. But Kovu just wasn't hungry enough to make much of a dent in the carcass after picking his winning spoils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa on the other hand, went at it with the same gusto she used to tear up the ostrich, the last of which had surely yet to pass through her system. She glutted herself with abandon. She ate so much, in fact that she gave herself a belly ache. She groaned and closed her eyes, saying she'd never eat like that again. All the time Kovu was there with her, comforting her, all the while harboring the fact that he'd deliberately egged her on while they were eating, just to see how much she was willing to eat so soon after the ostrich binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu also discovered then that Mipa was simply helpless around food that was just lying around. Oh, she'd feign disinterest, of course, but there was no time when she was conscious that she was unaware of that available meat; he could see it in her eyes. Kovu simply needed to make himself scarce for an hour or so. When he returned for his \"walk\" the carrion was undeniably smaller. Mipa never said anything about the shrinkage and Kovu never brought it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gorging, Mipa slept a lot, which was natural, but she also worked on her cloak of grass, her <i>isidwaba</i>. She hummed a little song while she worked nimbly with her paws, resting on her belly. Kovu didn't recognize it or even the language it was in. Even with Mipa's appetite and her constant nibbling, the warthog took three days to be reduced to bones. Kovu found a small pastime in breaking open the bones for their marrow and casting off the fragments over the clifface and down to the lake below, if only to keep glade from becoming a graveyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa was so turgid and lazy with the availible warthog that she hardly left the glade during that time. Aside from sleeping, she really did get a lot of work done with her cloak project while she was cloistered there. She seemed happy when she finally dawned it, however that came with a small surprise from both cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was two days after the hog had been thoroughly cleaned of meat, however with two big kills in so short a time, even Mipa was not yet complaining for food. She instead had devoted her time to the finishing touches on her article of grass and reeds, her which would hide her large body in the abundant grass. Indeed, it seemed none the worse for wear despite its previous shredding. Kovu was happy for her as she cinched it around her neck and she beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as good as-\" She cut herself off. Kovu saw why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa was looking around the side of her. Where before the cloak had generously covered her thick barrel torso down to her chest, now it seemed spread thin. The grass fell short of the bottom of her chest, and also, it appeared that her belly had decided to widen the distance further. It now hung below her well padded breast. She hissed through her teeth as she stared at the evidence of her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu was surprised, but for a different reason. He'd known she was putting on weight. It was only surprising how quickly she showed visible results of his subtle prompting. \"Looks like it needs a little more adjustment.\" he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mipa refused to be bought off with a quick joke. \"Ugh, I can't believe what a fatass I am!\" The lioness, in a fit, undid the knot holding her constuct to her and threw it carelessly aside. She plopped down fuming, staring at her beloved cloak with hurt pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu settled beside her and leaned lightly against her. He looked at the too-small cloak with her for a while. Eventually he said, \"It's not a big deal, just let it out at the sides some more. You can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa frowned, \"I know I can, but I don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because then I'll have to let it out again and then again. Eventually I won't even need my cloak anymore. The animals will mistake me for a hillside.\" said Mipa<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu forced down a snigger into the darkest place of his soul. \"Mipa.\" he said seriously. \"It's not a big deal. We've eaten well and we show it. You do and I do. It's natural.\" And he did speak the truth. After consuming his fair share of two large food beasts, Kovu had reclaimed some of his former sleekness, particularly over his ribs and shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I show it a hell of a lot more than you, Kovu.\" she scoffed in reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ventured to put a paw against her flank, stroking her and finishing with a light pinch of her fat. \"It doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is is how you feel about yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" Mipa grunted, rising away from him. Kovu stared at her wide eyed. She rounded on him and said loudly, \"Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kovu, I do, but stop pretending that you have all the answers, because you don't!\" Her tail lashed side to side, occasionally striking her wide flank and sending ripples across her body. \"You can't just say a few words and make feel better about myself and I can't just wave a stick and drop all this extra weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot tears slid down both sides of her snout. \"So stop pretending, already would you Kovu? Just stop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa screwed up her face and then trotted away, her wide flanks wobbling with her passage and her heaving breaths. She didn't go far; Kovu could hear her sobbing in the trees beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion licked his lips and smooth his black mane away from his face. Looking at the discard grass cloak, he sighed and went over to it. He carefully folded it and carried it over to her bed where she usually kept it when she wasn't wearing it. Despite how he wanted to go and comfort her, to tell her that it really was alright, to tell her the <i>truth</i> about how he felt about her body, he also knew when a lioness just needed time to herself. He buckled down to wait for when she needed him. It really was the least he could do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mipa sobbed quietly for half an hour. Then Kovu heard her get up and move. His pulse quickened, but was let down when he heard her moving farther away. Kovu settled onto his belly and grabbed a nearby bone, deciding to settle in for a longer wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gone over an hour. Frequently Kovu imagined her seeking her \"Jobie\" for comfort and consul. He frowned. He wanted to perform that function for her. He still puzzled over what had happened. \"Maybe I'm being too comforting...\" he muttered to himself. \"Maybe I'm not being real enough\u2026 coming on too strong with the encouragement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know. He'd never tried to manipulate another lion like this before. Oh, Nuka had been pretty easy to trick back home, but both Zira and Vitani were smarter than him and he knew it. He'd always been too busy falling for their tricks to learn much more than to divert an idiot's wrath from himself. Absently, he wondered what they were doing. Was Zira heartbroken with his disappearance, or had she found another stooge to worm her way into the Pridelands with? Did Vitani care? She had seemed a callous and spiteful lioness, but she was never crazy, not like their mother. And Nuka\u2026 well, he'd always be Nuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu set his bone aside when he heard movement in the grass beyond the glade. Mipa had returned, and her expression was calm, maybe a little tired. Kovu rose himself up on his haunches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness came to him and sat down heavily. Kovu could not help but notice the sprawl of her tummy on the ground under her. It'd been two days since they'd last eaten anything - Mipa being too busy with her cloak to check her traps - so very little of that gut could be blamed on a full stomach. She wouldn't look Kovu in the eyes as she spoke. \"Kovu, I'm sorry I acted the way I did. I was angry at myself and I took it out on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand Mipa.\" said the black-maned lion. He took a deep breath before he plunged on with the words he'd thought of. \"But you have to understand something as well.\" Her eyebrows raised in surprise and her tail tossed and turned on the ground. He continued, \"You shouldn't keep your feelings bottled up inside like that. It's not good for you and I don't like how you keep shutting me out either. I want you to tell me how you feel about your weight, about food and about what happened to you before you came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa jaw dropped. \"Kovu! That's none of your b-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is my business, Mipa!\" said Kovu, standing. \"It's my business because I really like you...I think I love you.\" The words flew out of his mouth with surprising ease despite the fact that he'd just derailed his original train of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa's tail went still in shock and her eyes rose to meet Kovu's burning ones. She breathed shallowly for a minute, both lions afraid to make a sound. Mipa spoke, \"Kovu...I...\" She took another breath. \"I don't know what to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion moved forward, pressing his chest against hers. His paw rose to touch her back in a close embrace. \"Just say yes.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey held each other for a long time. It was a while before Kovu felt small drops wet his back. \"I...I think I l-love you too.\" she said at last and he squeezed her soft body to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me why you're so concerned about your weight, Mipa?\" Kovu asked much later, as they lay together in her bed, the sky burning in twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me why you're not concerned with my weight?\" she slapped her paunch where it spread out on the ground for emphasis; even lying on her side, it was bulging lower than her rib cage now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu tried not to smile at the display, but rather took in her generous form. Mipa's already deep coat of fat had deepened visibly over the last week, not just at her belly, although that was the most visible. The little roll over the base of her tail had enlarged and thickened and one could also see her new-found weight in her full cheeks and thick, slightly-hanging, neck fat as well as the width of her soft rounded shoulders. She was a big girl, more than half as heavy again as him now despite his bigger frame. He wanted to see how she would look when she was twice as heavy as he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't voice that side of his nature though, not now. \"Mipa, I'd be concerned if you couldn't catch food for yourself or couldn't be self sufficient. As it is, however, you catch more food than I do and you can do these incredible things with your paws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu couldn't see it under her chocolate brown fur, but he did smell when she blushed. \"You have it the other way around, Kovu. I'm fat because I make traps. I couldn't run down an antelope to save my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark maned lion shrugged. \"Do you have to? Would you ever try to run down an antelope when you could bait and trap it instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit him with her paw. He showed his teeth, she was surprisingly forceful. \"Kovu! Doesn't it bother you that I can't run down prey? That I'm literally too fat to run in general?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out and put his forepaws on her broad shoulders. Their faces were close. \"I already said what I thought counts. You can do what you need to do to get food for yourself and live in the wild.\" He shook his head, his thick mane waving, \"That's enough for the Circle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa said nothing, glancing away shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, aren't you the one always telling me about how your way is better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that you were more clever than your sisters who had to run all day to sometimes catch an antelope when you could have half a dozen small animals just spending the morning setting traps.\" Kovu said, pushing a little harder into her pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant...well, I just...just think that its a more efficient way to spend one's time...\" said Mipa bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tapped her on the shoulder and let himself down. \"There you go. If setting traps works for you and you don't have a problem setting traps, then I don't think there is an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovu, you're just avoiding the bigger issue.\" said Mipa, sticking her snout at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu turned his nose to the side and looked at her sidelong. \"Like you're avoiding my original question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I, er...\" blustered Mipa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want to talk about it yet, I understand.\" said Kovu. \"But we are going to talk about it. And I'm going to keep bringing it up until you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa frowned, \"Why?\" she asked insolently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe faced her, \"Because it's important to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed raggedly. \"Fine! Kovu. I'll bite. What was it you were asking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you feel so bad about your weight? Especially since it doesn't affect your day to day life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled softly, \"But it does affect my day to day life! You don't know what it's like to wake up everyday and have to see all of this.\" she pawed at her lumpy frame, pulling up quite a large fold of skin and fat and letting it drop back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's about appearances for you.\" said Kovu softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growling intensified, \"It is not. Whose around here to see me anyway, aside from you? And you don't seem to mind if I blow up to the size of an elephant!\" Kovu's eye twitched, if only she knew how close to the mark she was. \"It's not that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what is it?\" insisted the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it's just that...if I don't care then who else will?\" Kovu cocked his head, waiting for her to continue. \"My mom used to badger me constantly about my weight growing up. She wanted me to be pretty, so the pride leader would be interested in me...but I was always too round at the middle, my haunches were too thick. 'Go run in the savanna.' she'd say, 'And don't come back until dawn.'\" Mipa sniffed. \"And then I got banished after I refused the Pride leader. My mother disowned me.\" she drew a long shuttering breath. \"Then after that, the lions I met all called me a fatass, even the rogue males would jeer even as they chased after me when I was in heat. I had to keep setting traps to support myself, I was already too out of shape to catch anything the old way. And it just kept working, I never lost weight, but I never gained much either... until I came here, and I was alone.\" she hissed through her teeth and looked with ire at her tummy, \"And when I left them, I wound up growing this huge belly! I doubt even the rouge males would touch me now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu stood and went over to the fat lioness. She looked up at him as he drew his rough paw down her back. \"What they said doesn't matter any more, Mipa.\" he said as he stroked her, the skin shivering under the contact. \"You don't have to keep repeating their words to yourself.\" He bent down over her, his breath brushing her fur at the nape of her neck. \"Besides...I'll touch you...if you like.\" With his rough tongue he licked her lovingly, up the side of her neck and onto her cheek. She fluttered her eyes in surprise when he put a paw on her chest and forcefully rolled her over onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovu!\" she said with a quick in-draw of breath. She stammered as he moved his paw in circles, pushing into the fat over her breastbone. Then, with the suddenness of a twig snapping, she relaxed into his touch. \"...I...I'm not even in heat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu grinned down at her. \"It's alright. I just want you to know that you're beautiful.\" He moved his head over her abdomen. \"And that I care.\" Kovu drew his tongue up her tummy from belly button to breast bone. She shivered and sighed under him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kovu was filled with excited energy when he looked down at Mipa's prone form. Electricity seemed to send sparks coursing along his spine. He wanted to touch her\u2026 and more he thought. The black maned lion had to reign in most of his passion as he stood over Mipa, lying there on the grass on her broad back. It's just not time yet\u2026 he thought resignedly. Still, there were still ways that he could show her that he cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Kovu embraced the opportunity to openly caress Mipa's body, lavishly petting her, stroking her, licking her and making her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tummy was wide and smooth. Her belly fur was an off shade of grey and sparse over her dark skin. Twin rows of nipples lined a ligament which supported and bifurcated her tummy, she had gotten so big that they were curving outwards, the lines of nipples bowed out at her waist. They were small and red, hardly bigger than his own...she'd never nursed before. That was odd for a lioness her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kovu hardly cared, he pawed the smooth surface of her belly. From her solar plexus, her tummy dropped less than the thickness of his paw to a broad, smooth, especially soft plain. When Kovu tickled her wiry coat here, she laughed and kicked her feet fussily, like a cub. The surface of her belly shook and jiggled like a gelatin mold when she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, she grinned up at him, looking with those blue eyes. \"Kovu! stop! ...I'm ticklish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu smirked. \"Really? Does that mean you're ticklish here too?\" With a deep laugh, he bent down and took hold of her two fatty flanks at her waist. He pressed his claw pricks into her and scratched up and down madly. The limp flesh in his paws squished nicely as he squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa squealed and tossed left and right, trying to escape him. He jumped off of her and rolled heavily onto her flank, but he wasn't done with her yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu pounced, planting his elbows and forelegs on her thick flank. She batted weakly at his face as he ground his forelegs into her plump hide. He pushed his knees into her curving back as well. Lowering himself down, he stretched his arms around her chest and up her back. Again, her girth surprised him. He couldn't reach all the way around her! Her back was thick and soft, the skin piling up at the ground where he left with his left paw. Her chest, though not as deep as his, was also rounded and smoothed with layers of flesh. She shrieked again when he reached under her arm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmushing his face with her paw, she forced him to retreat and she flopped over again, panting now. He strolled over to her other side. \"Not much for wrestling are you?\" he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuffed, \"I told you I never liked to play rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed a paw against her lumpy shoulder. \"It's never too late to change your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled up at him, but knocked his paw away. \"Eh...I still don't think its my thing...although, it did feel kinda nice when you were on my back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu walked around her then mounted her again from the side, putting his elbows on her flank. \"What, like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me...stay there, Kovu.\" said Mipa who then rolled onto her belly. Kovu took a few steps with his hindfeet so he stayed on top. \"Ah...\" sighed Mipa. \"That's it. Move your elbows around some more, Kovu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kovu complied, putting his weight on his joints. It wasn't hard to figure out what she wanted. Kovu moved up and down her spin, pushing down hard on her shoulders as she flexed muscles deep below the skin surface. The dense padding was a challenge, but Kovu was a 400 lb cat after all, he had weight and muscle he could use and he did, until Mipa relaxed like pudding under him. He wasn't satisfied until she was satisfied, and even when he settled down to rest, he wanted to rest his paws against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a silence so long, Kovu thought that they were going to nap until later this evening, Mipa said. \"No one's ever done anything like that for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu snorted, \"Well, I'm glad I could be the first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really, Kovu... No one's ever made me feel attractive, or at all wanted...\" She took a deep breath. \"I don't...I don't know why you're doing this. But it feels good, and I appreciate you trying to make me feel better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu frowned to himself, even after all that she didn't believe he found her attractive! \"Mipa.\" he said firmly, gripping her shoulder with his paw, \"I'm not doing this as a favor to you. I really like the way you feel...\" his brought his paw down over the curving surface of her back, \"the way you smell. I'm not lying to you to make you feel better, I...\" He let out a pent up breath and then pressed the fork of his legs against her, so she could feel him against the padding at her tail head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a little gasp and went stiff. Kovu kept pressing himself against her, waiting for her to speak. She took several deep breaths, as if shocked to feel his excitement behind her. \"...I believe you, Kovu.\" she said. She let out a shuddering sigh and said again, her voice quavering slightly, \"I believe you.\"  Kovu almost thought that she was impressed, but then noticed her quivering, the way her hairs raised on the back of her neck.  The subtle tang of her scent forwarded her emotions to him.  She was far from impressed by his maleness, rather she was <i>afraid</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu relented, breathing hard himself and forcing himself to calm down. He hoped he hadn't gone too far. He rolled over and faced away from her for some time. When that wasn't enough, he got up to go take a long walk in the woods. Part of him kept wanted to turn around and return to the glade. Kovu didn't return until he had remastered that part of himself. He knew he was too much like his father.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kovu walked alone through the dark overhanging boughs of the forest. He was sexually frustrated and frustrated at Mipa as well for clinging to her old rationales and phobias. He was frustrated at himself for being unable to woo her. \"I thought I could just ride in here and swoop her off her paws,\" Kondo scoffed at himself. \"I thought I could be a hero...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered desperately what Mipa thought of him. What had his last desperate, impulsive, self-gratifying ploy bought him? She had relented at last, saying she believed that he was really attracted to her, but the tone of her voice...had she sounded frightened? He shook his head as he tore heedlessly through the brush, even scratching himself on thorns - he wanted, no, needed the pain - she'd told him often enough about the lusty rogue males who had dogged her back home. Now had he proven himself to be no better?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest was lively at night. The smells were welling up from the ground as the turf shed moisture. Most of the birds were sleeping but the trees were alive with monkeys foraging high in the branches along with the things that hunted them. The earthy loam and the living creatures surrounding him calmed the lion currently frazzled with issues deeper than the air, the soil and the tall trees that grew in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescending into his instincts was one way Kovu knew to leave more complicated problems and worries behind. However, soon he found himself deep in the oasis, treading through ankle deep slime and not at all sure where exactly he was. Becoming more lucid, Kovu was relieved to find the tension had left his body - for now - however, he did not relish finding his way back through the marsh. Especially since it was dark and he did not remember where very many of Mipa's traps were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so busy looking above and around him that he didn't look straight down. His paw struck something solid and heavy and he tripped, landing in the muck face first. \"Phaw!\" he spat and cough out the fould tasting slime, but soon had greater worries than a bad taste in his mouth. The thing that he had tripped over began to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoils rose out of the water with surprising speed, great scaly muscular coils. Kovu jumped with all of the speed and strength that he could muster. The water thrashed all around. It seemed everywhere he looked, he saw more snake. \"Everywhere but up!\" He thought desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaped onto the ripped trunk of a large tree and clawed himself up. It'd been almost a year since he last climbed a tree... throwing a paw over a low branch, he struggled to pull himself up. Below the large snake let out a reptilian hiss. It struck out with its heavy tail and whacked Kovu good on the flank, but it was already too late, his grip was secure. On his perch, Kovu looked down at the snake trying to rise out of the water and flexed his jaw before letting loose a deafening roar at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending its relatively slender neck in at least seven places, the snake withdrew from Kovu's outrage. The lion sniffed and rubbed his snout with a paw, his tail waving below him. \"Better luck next time.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And swift speed to you.\" said the massive constrictor in the traditional reply to lost prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu watched the large snake shift its heavy coils in the shallow water, rearanging itself section by section to sink just below the surface of the water. It was fascinating to watch... until Kovu realized that it was settling down at the base of his tree!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey, snake!\" Kovu called down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake lazily lifted its head, small in proportion to its extremely large body, but still nearly as large as Kovu's. \"Yesss, young warm-blood?\" It asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're not gonna go look for food somewhere else?\" Kovu asked, hoping the convince the snake to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came an irregular hiss from the snake who may have weighed half a ton or more. It took Kovu a moment to realize the old reptile was laughing. \"Ssssss, I don't think so, furry one. There is food right here, after all. I've learned to be patient in my years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu shifted his weight on his branch, his claws extending into the bark. \"It hasn't been decided yet who will be who's dinner. I might just decide to make a meal out of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, there came that choked hissing laughter, slightly more spiteful this time, \"Arrogent lion cub! I am much too big a meal for you, methinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu shrugged, \"Maybe, but I know someone who I could share you with. And she has a plenty big appetite!\" the lion waved his tail in the air for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake slifted its head higher out of the water, its green neck emerging like a scaled water plant. \"Are you speaking of Her by any chance? She who puts herself above all other creatures here? The Fat One?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKove flexed his shoulders ambivalently. \"Perhaps... What do you know of her, Mighty Scaled One?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlattery usually worked with reptiles, but this one was cannier than most and didn't lose its head. \"Ah, a question for a question, young King.\" said the snake. \"And as your senior, I claim right of first question\u2026\" Kovu sneered that's not fair, reptiles live longer than mammals. Pompous snake... The snake asked, \"Whence do you hail from, lion cub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wasteland.\" said Kovu with a slight sigh. This was the only way to get any answers. Any information to keep from bungling again with Mipa was valuable. \"Just outside a place I'm sure you've never heard of, the Pridelands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" hummed the snake noncommittally. \"And your question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know about Mipa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake curled its neck around. \"I know some things, you merely have to ask the right quessstion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu wanted to jump down and try his luck throttling the legless freak. But he knew better than to take on the giant constrictor directly. Seceding to the reptiles game, he just asked the first thing that came to mind, \"Well, how did she get here? Can you tell me that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake's tail rose above the water and splashed the surface several times. \"Such insolence!\" it complained, \"I've grown too large to leave the buoyant marshy waters, even when the rains come to the desert beyond. I know only that the Fat One came in from over the mountains...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't help me at all!\" Kovu snarled, \"I want another question!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then maybe you should think more about what you asssk before you open your mouth, lion cub.\" the snake hissed, \"I can only tell you that she came to the oasis, nigh ten moons ago, from over yonder cliffs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Ten moons ago? That's less than a year!\" Kovu exclaimed, \"Are you telling me Mipa hasn't even been here for one year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake hissed in response, recoiling. Kovu dug his claws into the bark. That was an important bit of information\u2026 with a lot of implications; the least of which being the rate that Mipa has been putting on weight even before Kovu arrived... \"For my next quessstion...\" started the snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kovu rose and turned on his branch. He was already trying to see how he might get to the other side of the tree in a hurry. \"I'm sorry, Oh Great Leggless One, but I'm done playing your game. I've got a girlfriend I need to see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake hissed angrily at the breaking of their contract, or more probably at not winding up with more questions answered at the end. It began to move, shifting its coils lazily in the water. Kovu wasn't fooled though to mistake lack of speed for lack of intention. It called up spitefully, \"You are a fool to court her, hot, ambitious male!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've heard it before. She's cursed and whatnot.\" rattled off Kovu, still looking for a branch to jump to that would take his weight, even briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow, the snake sputtered hissed laughter. \"You do not know as much as you think, Lion Cub. She is not cursed, but her affection will still be your doom. Her mate will not be happy to find her scent all over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat froze Kovu to the branch. \"Mate?\" he asked, turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to see the snake's head just a few feet below his own; it was bracing its bulk against the tree trunk. \"Yesss,\" said the snake, it's lidless eyes seeming to be gaping chasms now, \"and he is a jealous lover from what I hear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu looked, fascinated into the bottomless depths of the snake's eyes, even as it struggled inch by inch, higher and higher towards his perch. By chance, it slipped against the tree where its thick body was leaning. The resulting jerk of the snake's head broke the trance. Kovu's eyes darted and the snake reacted quickly, jutting its head forward, open mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake grazed his left paw with its hundreds of needlelike teeth, but Kovu pulled away. Hardly sparing a moment to look, he leaped from the branch. He collided with a new perch a quarter of the way around the tree, but it immediately began to fold under his weight. Kovu was lowered to the ground, the snake busily arranging itself to get at him. Kovu wasted no time and ran. He let his paws lead him to dryer ground and somewhere behind him, the snake gave up the chase where the water ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Kovu was licking his paw clean of muck, two fairly deep cuts would add a couple of parallel scars to his repertoire. He thought about what the snake had told him, wondering how much of it was true. He knew only one thing for sure, he wanted to go back to Mipa, he wanted to squeeze her luscious softness and never let go.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mipa hugged her belly after Kovu stomped off down the the mountain. She was glad to have him and his pungently male scent leave, but at the same time, she felt terrible. I drove him away, she thought. With my recalcitrance and thick-headedness, I drove him away... She pressed her forepaws hard into her soft tummy which bulged just below her rib cage now, even on an empty stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at herself, how her waist bowed out gratuitously and her torso was round, smooth and barrel shaped like a sausage, the lioness was filled with anger, hurt and confusion. She brought her closed paw down on the curved surface of her belly, hitting it and shouting. She hit her belly again and again, each time the fatty surface absorbing the shock and rebounding with a wave she felt over her whole body. When a bruise formed on the skin, Mipa whimpered with the pain of it and had to stop. Then she huddled herself into the tightest ball her flabby body would allow and cried so much that she began to stain the fur at the corners of her eyes. She felt horribly alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovu...\" she cried. His name was both sweet and sour on her tongue. She could scarcely believe what he had done less than an hour before, pressing himself against her so she would feel his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered and shut her eyes tight. A dozen unwanted memories pushed into the darkest corners of her psyche emerged, unwanted, pressing against the edges of her sheltered consciousness and threatening to spill out their blackened contents. Mipa knew about her past experiences with the rogue males, in a vague sort of way; the memories welling up, however threatened to sink her raft of willful forgetfulness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaws groped her brutally, a heavy, heaving weight on her back and the power contained therein. Her knees ground into the dirt as she was forced to the ground when he finally caught her. The hot stiff thing he shoved rudely between her thighs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa cried out, holding her head in her paws. She yelped and rose, trying to banish unwanted memories back into abyss of her subconscious. She walked, or rather paced around the roughly circular glade in which she made her home. She took deep even breaths and tried to keep her eyes open. She was afraid of what she would see when she closed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked, she could feel the weight of her body pulling at her; it was unavoidable. Her gut wobbled left and right as she moved, waddling for the girth of her torso. Every step sent a small shiver up her blubbery flanks as they shook with the shock. Her chest also shook, as well as her neck...even her thick thunder thighs shivered with her steps. Mipa could feel the discomfort in her hips, knees and elbows as her joints were called on to support her mounting weight. The subtle sensation grew inexorably with time as her weight had risen and continued to rise. Her weight had been worming its way into her life in a way that it hadn't out on the savanna. Since coming here to the oasis, her weight had sky-rocketed and she'd become more sedentary in response, little by little so that she hardly even noticed it. <i>\"It seemed so harmless...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there were other issues as well...dark motivations wriggling through her thoughts, unglimpsed before, but now visible, if only in outline and texture. Mipa shook her head, feeling like she didn't even know herself. Her waistline had begun to grow with successful catch after successful catch. She'd been a proud huntress and there was no one here to deride her anymore...but still, those others were never far from her thoughts. Her frame went from pudgy to overweight, and more lately clearly obese, all so quickly! It was only three or four more moons before her first anniversary of freedom. Something told Mipa, as she struggled with her own thoughts, that there was more to the story than a simple abundance of food... It had to do with her constant cravings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa slumped in mental exhaustion. She just wanted all the figments and phantoms to leave her alone. She wanted to go back to her daily routine, the careful weaving, the diligent setting of traps, the simple pleasure of food and a full tummy... But that was not all, there was more now, there was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovu...\" said Mipa, raising her head. She said the word with longing now as the shroud veiling the world before her eyes abated. The shadows lifted from around her, removing their claws from her mind and sinking down below where they belonged. Mipa thought that she must be insane, living on a blissful little island of ignorance above a dark ocean of her own thoughts and feelings. But she knew that she would be even more insane if she dared to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And things are different now.\" she thought. \"Kovu is here now, for better or for worse, and he's not going to leave.\" The black maned lion had stormed off, but she knew he would be back. And she knew, in her heart of hearts, that he was different. He'd upset something deep inside her just now, throwing her buried assumptions and premeditations into unease, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovu would never do that to me. He's different.\" she said aloud. \"...Maybe he can fix me...\" she added, moving her mouth around the words without speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn shaking knees, she stood with some effort, battling gravity to lift her expanded bulk. She felt her belly against her knees where she stood, new evidence of her ever-growing size. Her increasing weight, however, seemed a small issue at the moment. \"I've got to find Kovu.\" she said. and waddled down the slope out of her glade and into the jungle below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu limped through the dense growth which surrounded him as if attempting to entangle him. He had an image in his mind of a giant carnivorous plant slowly manoeuvring him into some acidic vat of stomach acid with the patience of seasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt surprised him that he still had not found his way out of the tangle of overgrowth, given that the oasis was of a finite size, after all. But then again, he'd zigzagged a lot during his flight from the giant snake. Only on dry land had he seemed safe, the lack of water speeding his paws while hindering the snake with its great weight. Only just as quickly as he'd found his way out of the marsh, he became trapped in this explosion of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu pushed leaved as broad as his shoulders away from his face, spluttering. He forced his paws through dozens of stems to make a single step. They pulled at him like hundreds of ropes of lilliputian settlers below. \"This is bad...\" he thought, suddenly uneasy. \"This isn't right...\"</span></div></div>",

Likely it had been its plan all along, Kovu realized the second that it sunk its teeth into his shoulder and he saw the great glistening coils move through the vegetation beyond. Kovu yowled in pain and struck the great snake on the head with his paw. His claws slid off the surface on the first blow, but he adjusted and made ready to rend through the snake's protective skin. Kovu was determined that it'd lose at least an eye in exchange for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever before he could bring his claws to bear a second time, the wily old snake released him and slipped its head away. In its place, it threw a huge coil at him, thicker around than Kovu's chest. The lion slipped away, barely. His blood ran freely from his shoulder and he clawed desperately through the vines entangling him. \"There's got to be a way out of here!\" he roared. He had to roll through the muck supporting the myriad plants to avoid the heavy snake again. It seemed content with simply tiring him out now with huge, slow moving blows. Eventually, he knew however, it would bite him again. \"As soon as she gets a coil around me, I'm done.\" thought Kovu, knowing it to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was losing hope of escaping, what with the snake blocking off the route he had taken to get into this vine-filled hell, he heard a voice calling his name in the distance. \"...Kovu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu's ears perked in surprise. \"Mipa!\" he shouted, \"Im here, Mipa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Kovu!\" he hear her shout, this time a little closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black maned lion now had a heading. Though he hated the prospect of exposing Mipa to danger, he didn't know what else to do. He didn't stand a chance one on one with the half ton snake. The massive creature slithered unseen nearby. Kovu couldn't see it, but he could smell it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Mipa's near the game path, we can both make it up the mountain and away from here!\" he thought as he broke and fumbled his way forward, crawling over the fragile stems and vines. He hoped that he was not simply providing the snake with a second entr\u00e9e. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mipa!\" Kovu roared when he saw her at last. His heart fell when he saw that she'd come far from the beaten path in her search for him. Then it seemed to leap out of his chest when he saw something shiny moving towards her close to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovu. Hey Kovu!\" shouted Mipa. She sat on her haunches and raised a paw to wave it at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu cursed under his breath, \"No! Mipa, run! There's a snake, Run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Kovu did not need to repeat himself. The snake made little attempt to conceal its bulk as it rushed towards her with a single-mindedness that would have been astonishing if he had not know of her general reputation in the oasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu trundled after them as Mipa turned and ran, the snake on her heels. His head swam. Either the snake was making good on an unexpected opportunity or this truly had been its plan all along. Kovu couldn't live with himself if Mipa was delivered to her rivals because of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa was on flat ground, but she was rather slow carrying all her extra weight. The snake, however seemed to slither forward with exuberance despite its handicap of being out of the water. It seemed almost to exalt in perceived weakness. Kovu hurried after them as fast as he possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw an opportunity when he saw the tail of the snake run by him. The thing was simply enormous! Perhaps as much as 40 feet in length. It had undoubtedly survived many decades of harsh predatory life. Nevertheless, Kovu struck out at it with all the fury he could muster. He raked it deeply, exposing the red meat under the scale and a convulsion of pain raced up the entire length of the reptile. It pulled itself away from him however, leaving Kovu to break through the last of the fronds holding him before he could give chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing constantly, the lion broke free and tore after the snake and Mipa ahead of him. When he heard Mipa scream, he redoubled his efforts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his fleet paws brought him to them, though, the scene was not at all what he expected. Mipa leaned against a tree, panting and shivering with exhaustion. The snake lay a body length away from her, coiled and hissing in agitation. Two thirds down the snake's body length from the head, the snake was supported off the ground by a tight loop. One of Mipa's snares! It was not nearly large enough to incapacitate the snake, but it was keeping it immobile for the moment. Mipa, however, looked totally spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu went to her, pressing his face against her soft neck \"Mipa...Mipa, I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed bewildered, even as she fought for breath, her pigeon chest heaving. \"For...what?\" she asked blearily. \"I...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu shook his head, she seemed slightly dazed and in no shape for fighting. He tried nosing her up. \"Come on, girl. We need to get out of here before that snake breaks loose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run? No...no running...\" said Mipa a little more lucidly. She spared a look at the snake. It stuck out its forked tongue in response. The part of its body that was trapped kept writhing and pulsing as it sought to burst from its bonds. She looked at the lion with the black mane, \"Kill it...\" she breathed. \"It's no good...kill it.\" she closed her eyes and then opened them, \"For me...please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu didn't know what exactly was going on, what sort of history she had with the great constrictor, but honestly he didn't care. He saw nothing in it worth preserving during his brief conversation with it. He'd kill it just to make the oasis a safer place for Mipa. As an answer to her request, he strutted boldly forward, chest puffed. His hackles rose and he let out a fierce battle roar right at the snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt opened its mouth and hissed back at him, its black mouth gaping and filled with tiny fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu, with blood still seeping down his left shoulder hunched and made ready to pounce the snake. Its greatest strength - stealth - was gone now and it couldn't move around as well anymore either. Still, Kovu felt like he would only get one good shot at it. \"Go for the head.\" Kovu assured himself. Then, feeling the course strength pervading his lean body, he leapt and dove into the writhing snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all went wrong so quickly. Kovu landed on a fat coil. The snake had tried to protect its head by pulling back at the last instant, but Kovu got a paw around the other side of its neck and soon had it in his mouth. He felt a tooth sink into an orbital cavity, popping the eye in the process, but the snake's skull was still too stout to crack with his jaws. The snake twisted under him and in a moment, Kovu's bottom hit the ground, scaled muscle surrounding his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt squeezed Kovu and he squeezed the snake's head in his jaws. They both saw the need to quickly subdue the other. Now was not the time for compromise or examining the situation. It was only strength versus strength. When the snake got another coil around him, then another, Kovu knew. The snake was too strong for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu kept trying to crush the snake's skull, but the bone held up. The snake squeezed him then with brutal efficiency as it held the big cat in its grasp. Each time he exhaled left less room for the next breath... The world began to grow dark, but he never relented, he would die with the taste of cool blood on his tongue.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Then something was tugging on the snake's head beyond. Kovu could not tell exactly what was happening, his vision gone all blurry. He had to concentrate just to retain consciousness. His body was squeezed so tightly, it felt as if he were being compressed into paste. More movement from beyond, hurried, and calculated movement. Then he felt the snake's head move in his jaws. at first, it felt like it were simply jerking it again, but this time the movement was different, it was uniform, persistent and far, far stronger. Kovu had to fight to hold on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...-et go, Ko...vu!\" the voice came to him as if from underwater. Oh, how sweet it was, a siren of the deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of it, Kovu!\" Mipa shouted again and the lion came aware enough to understand. The snake shifted in discomfort all around him as the tugging continued on the snake's neck and his skull continued to bleed between his fangs. \"Let go?\" he thought mussily. It seemed like the last good thing to do, but if Mipa wanted it, well, at least he would pass from the world that much more quickly; his body to rejoin the Circle here in this beautiful oasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake's head whipped up out of its own coils as soon as Kovu let go, yanked away by some unseen force. A shiver went through its entire body and before Kovu was completely aware, its hold on him had weakened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovu! Please, hurry up and kill it!\" Mipa was shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mindless desire to obey made Kovu worm his way out of the serpent's coils as it squirmed and writhed, struggling with something. He gasped for breath when he won his chest free of the creature's enormous body. He looked around for Mipa, wondering how they might still escape the old reptile, but he didn't see her. Then he looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa clung to a rock supported by a crudely woven cradle, adding the weight of her body to the balance of the former snare. Somehow, Mipa had reworked the ropes of her trap, however for it was a snare no longer. It was a noose. The snake's head was suspended even higher than Mipa and her formidable bulk. A tight loop wrapped about a foot below its jaw. It struggled and writhed with its titanic strength as it fought for breath. Kovu could tell that if Mipa moved or lost her grip, the entire assembly would collapse and the snake would be utterly free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill it Kovu!\" She shouted at him. \"Kill it now!\" Her claws left white streaks on the stone as she slipped a few inches, her plump bottom pointed to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the situation and what Mipa had cleverly accomplished gave Kovu no right to slack now. It was a heroic effort to extract his hindquarters from the snake's last coil, but he did it. His legs pulsed uncomfortably as blood rushed back into them so he half stumbled, half dragged himself over to the snake's head. Taking a deep breath, he lurched up and sank all of his fangs deep into the snake's neck, tearing it ruthlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coils tossed in every direction, smashing the undergrowth flat and threatening to smash Kovu as well. There was tortured creaking from above and Mipa let out a shrill cry as something in her makeshift trap snapped and she fell. She let out a harsh breath as the heavy stone hit her round belly and then she lay still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake's head fell as well, but Kovu moved with it. He grabbed it a little lower down and opened the flesh there as well with his powerful jaws. Air bubbled in the snake's throat as it aspirated futilely. It quickly bled out, though its coils continued to twitch for some time after it had died. As quick as he could, Kovu went to Mipa and dragged her as far as he could from the tossing snake; which was not far, she was still very heavy! She remained unconscious for some time, but Kovu did not dare rest. Instead he sat over her protectively for the hours it took for her to come around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few hours before dawn when she did, fluttering her eyelids as she awoke. She coughed a bit and held her tummy. Kovu saw two bruises there, a large one from the boulder and also a smaller one. She moaned unhappily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it dead?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" she said and they both turned to stare at the massive snake. It had been a 40-foot giant, undoubtedly weighing more than half a ton, now reduced to nothing so much as a pile of twisted meat and scales\u2026 fresh meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa's belly growled with true hunger. \"Would you like some breakfast, Kovu? I think you earned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin spread across his face. \"Only if you would join me, Mipa.\" He let her lean on him as she got heavily to her feet. Together, they helped each other limp to the feast in front of them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The carcass of the snake took weeks to eat, even with Mipa's impressive appetite. Seeing as the carcass was too heavy to move, even with the large felines' combined strength, they both decided to hunker down there around it. It was an easy decision, given that both were pretty banged up after the deadly encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu came away with gashes on his paw and shoulder as well as what felt like a couple of cracked ribs. He was sore all over for a week and never went more than an hour's walk away from their temporary abode while he was recuperating. It didn't seem like Mipa should have been as badly off as Kovu, but she malingered, coughing and complaining of pain when she breathed in too deeply; a result of the rock landing on her belly perhaps. She abandoned her traps, leaving them to rot while there was plenty of snake to eat, preferring instead to spend her time around Kovu while he limped here and there, sometimes staring out into the jungle for hours. But mostly both of them just slept as cats do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meat spoiled, naturally, but they had strong stomachs and with Mipa there, they were able to compete with the natural process of decay, eating it almost as quickly as the exposed flesh decayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa...she showed Kovu the depths of gluttony she was capable of sinking to when there was literally unlimited food available. She ate herself into a stupor that first night, giving herself such a bad stomach ache that Kovu had to rub and massage her in an effort to make her feel better. After that, Kovu usually found Mipa either sleeping or sampling at the huge carcass. Her sleeping hours became erratic. Kovu would sometimes wake in the middle of the day to find her hunched over the scaly beast, feeding. It seemed almost that she never slept more than a few hours at a time, waking constantly to the need to top off her burgeoning belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two weeks of keeping herself constantly full, Kovu noticed a visible increase in her general capacity to eat, as if her stomach were expanding to keep up with the new digestive demands. And her stomach was not the only thing expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both injured after the fight and neither felt up to venturing very far from their makeshift home on a flat piece of grass near the carcass. The abundance of food and the lack of even her nightly laps around the oasis quickly had a pronounced effect on Mipa's waistline, and his own, Kovu had to admit to himself. They both put on weight, but with Mipa regularly eating twice as much - and later easily three times as much - food as he from the snake, she began to show it sooner and just kept adding to her personal stockpile of adipose. Kovu said nothing about it, though honestly, he loved every minute of watching Mipa eat and having the gift of the snake around that they had both earned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both treasured the free availability of food while it lasted, though they both knew it couldn't last forever. The boon was enough to sustain them as they recovered from their injuries, but Mipa more than even Kovu understood that it would be back to business as usual before long. When the great snake was half gone, she began to spend her waking hours weaving, that is, when she was not busily stuffing her face with the ever ripening meat. Kovu did not join her at first, complaining of his hurt paw still although it had more to do with a lack of interest in the art. However, as she spent more and more time at it, he eventually joined her. And they talked as they both lay in the grass, stockpiling cord. Mipa showed Kovu how to bind tree bark also, however Mipa always took it upon herself to strip it from the trees, the strands needed to be delicately separated, and the task required great delicacy from her paws. Kovu couldn't gather the bark, but he could save Mipa the labour of turning it into usable cord and then winding that cord into stronger rope. Later, Mipa began gathering a stockpile of smooth twigs and branches as she began wandering father and farther from the diminishing corpse. She assumed she would have to remake all of her traps already out in the jungle, those existing surely having broken or rotted by now. Kovu, once he learned what features were useful to her, began to assist as well although it struck him as odd to be gathering dead wood rather than looking for prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two moons, the giant snake was reduced to little more than bones and scales. Still the two lions picked at it. However, by then, Mipa had begun building and setting traps again, walking out into the woods eve afternoon as she had done for the past year. However this time, she had Kovu along as well. The big lion helped out with his strength, making it easier for her to lift things up and string the ropes though the high branches where she could not easily get to; what with her climbing ability pretty much reduced to nil. It seemed so natural, so easy for Kovu, like he'd been doing this all along. Mipa usually finished in the early evening and settled down to her various crafting projects. During this time, Kovu stalked the forest interior, a natural predator. Later in the night, he and Mipa would meet again at the glade and talk some more, sometimes snuggling or grooming each other, sometimes going down to the lake to look at the moon's reflection on the water. It was all so serene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Mipa made it possible. By the time that they had abandoned the bones of the snake, their wounds had mostly healed, though Kovu found that he still had pain in his shoulder which forced him to limp as he walked. But also, Mipa had grown to double Kovu's weight, which itself had increased with the freely available snake meat. She had rounded out nicely, growing a huge sagging paunch and a deep shelf of fat at her tail head. She waddled as she moved, her hips swaying in a way that pleased Kovu immensely. He himself was heavier than he had ever been. His ribs were finally hidden from plain sight and he had some meat on his shoulders and thighs as well. The dip under his rib cage to his stomach was less sharp now and the ground did not feel so hard under him where he slept. However, Mipa still complained of the bonieness of his shoulders and the ridge of his spine when he slept against her. He loved when she complained about it though, it was only a greater contrast between their two physiques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Mipa did not stop there, either. The weeks grew into passing moons and eventually it seemed like they were simply meant to be together. Mipa caught the vast majority of their food in the form of a constant selection of small animals - mostly birds and monkeys - while Kovu was able to bring in the occasional boon of a warthog or something larger that had wandered in from the larger desert. They shared everything, but Kovu always insisted that Mipa get the 'lion's share.' She seemed fine with it and didn't question the policy, just as he didn't question her different quirks or even the fact that she accepted the sheer amount of food that she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer frame continued to bow out, the pounds piling on her almost just from the smell of food. The bigger she got, the more irresistible she became to him. Slowly, she began asking more favors from Kovu. Simple things, like fetching objects or fastening branches, things that she used to do herself, but now... Well, Kovu didn't mind in the slightest, in fact he enjoyed the additional work, further validating his reason for being here with her. Mipa didn't talk about the matter of her increasing dependence all that much. Kovu just did his best to understand wordlessly and to always be at her beck and call, so that she never would feel constrained by her growing bulk. Apparently he succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wet season came to the oasis with a booming clap of thunder one evening. It brought the monsoon storms that Mipa said would double the size of the oasis and turn the desert into a vast flowering prairie for a few beautiful weeks. They celebrated the coming of the raised with a long bout of sensual massage, Mipa having grown far more comfortable with Kovu caressing her over the last months. About a moon later, Mipa had tripled Kovu's weight, making her into a huge lioness of unheard-of proportions. Her handicaps had grown along with her 'waist'-line and she'd begun talking to Kovu more and more about how she might bring her growth to a halt at last. So far, however, they hadn't done much more than talk about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon was a curving, ghostly crescent in the sky and thunder pealed in the east, heralding a storm. Kovu awoke in the late afternoon and then woke up Mipa with a gentle jostling of her fatty shoulder. It was time for their daily inspection of the traps. Little did Kovu know then, however, that that night would bring about changes for the both of them...</span></div></div>",

She drew in a deep breath and Kovu heard it rasp in her fattened throat in a  way that it hadn't just a few moons ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mipa.\"  said Kovu a little louder, and shook her more vigorously.  Her shoulder, rotund and heavy, jiggled profusely with the motion of his paw.  Kovu relished the sensation of Mipa's softness.  \"It's time to get up, lazy cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa coughed wetly and yawned, her jaw creasing where her fatty neck welled up thickly against it.  Sleep hung more heavily on her these days it seemed.  She smiled warmly up at Kovu when she came fully aware, however.  \"Good afternoon, Kovu.\"  she said and reached up her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe touched noses, as they often did now, and Kovu moved his paw so as to ruffle the fur and loose skin abundant behind her ears.  \"Let's get going shall we?\"  Kovu said taking the standard position by the fattened lioness.  She nodded and began to get to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu helped Mipa get up as he usually did, although she was quite capable of getting up by herself.  Mipa pushed up with her forepaws, her hindfeet splayed out to the side to allow room for her gorgeous tummy.  Her chest dropped low and forward between her forelegs, and there was hardly any empty space left behind her legs when she was sitting up, so big her belly had grown.  Stretchmarks showed through the fur there, evidence of how fast she had collected her newfound weight.  She slouched where she sat, a result of her sheer bulk altering the dimensions of her body and the ways it could move.  After shifting her weight forward with a couple false starts, she leaned against Kovu, straining with her splayed hind feet to raise her weighty hindquarters.  Kovu rose when she was on her feet - she took a few deep breaths to steady herself, her flanks expanding roundly - and took in her granduer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa was a wholey new cat in his eyes.  Standing, her generous belly fell just past her knees, well below the level of her own deeply padded chest.  Her torso had gained significant depth but it also gained substantial width.  Her flanks spread to either side of her roundly and very plump.  She'd been growing past the original width of her shoulders for some time now and  currently she sported a little more than half of Kovu's own width to either side of her where sheer solid bulk rested against her.  Those flanks then curved out and down all the way to the level of her sagging tummy, making Mipa a <i>very</i> large cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed against his chest as he stared at her.  She purred, rumbling in her thick chest.  \"I'm hungry.\"  she said playfully, in their own running joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu laughed and reached up to pinch her fat flank with a paw, finishing with a couple pats to her bovine flank.  \"Well, let's go find you something to eat, then.  Before you waste away.\"  He made the mistake of turning away from her and received a pinch to his own flank.  Mipa had a good sized roll of skin from the side of his abdomen between the pads of her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not exactly wasting away either, tub-cat.\"  said Mipa, giving him a silly wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The nerve of that girl!</i>  laughed Kovu in his mind.  She had a valid point, however.  His frame had not escaped entirely intact with the recent deluge of food.  Kovu had developed a small belly.  And it was a real belly, as Mipa would frequently point out;  it curved out from his abdomen, a small inverted hill of tan colored fur. His was nothing compared to Mipa's nor as sensually soft, but she tended to gently jab him about his weight. He didnt mind at all; he thought it was healthy for her to do so, especially given the daily reality of her own weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu could felt the new weight on him as he walked down the slope from the glade, following Mipa.  As much as Mipa liked to talk about his small rounded belly, a lot more of his new weight had found itself planted on his shoulders and neck, as well as his thighs and the base of his tail.  His shoulders had broadened markely, but they were soft to the touch and less musclature showed despite the fact that the new fat was quite firm and dense.  He could still feel it jiggle and shake slightly as he walked, however.  The story was the same for his thickened haunches, though fortunately they still did not rub together the way Mipa's fat turkey thighs did.  Mipa did not believe him when he told her that he was getting fat around his neck and chest area.  \"You just look handsome and muscular, Kovu.\"  she would say, and he could not tell if she was lying for his benefit or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Mipa, Kovu didn't have to lie.  He loved every inch of her and every inch that she continued to put on.  It had been facinating to watch her expand week by week, moon by moon, from a pudgy cat into sagging barrel shaped goliath who out massed his own increased weight three times over.  Kovu figured that, considering her smaller frame, she really weighed over four times her 'proper' weight.  Fortunately for Mipa, she was still young and carried all the extra weight well.... er, well, certainly well enough.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa couldn't run, she couldn't even really jog anymore; she complained that her chest and belly flapped around too much when she tried.  She <i>waddled.</i>  Kovu licked his lips, watching her bulk sway from behind.  And she was good at it.  The whole of her fatty body seemed in motion when she walked.  Mipa's bovine flanks swung side to side in her slow, easy gait, her spine curving side to side more degrees that Kovu would have thought comfortable.  Her thighs, having become quite excessively blobby, rolled across one another, using the give in the skin to prevent rubbing.  The tall shelf of fat at her tail head tiltled left and right as she sauntered, jiggling madly at each reverse.  Between her hindlegs, Kovu could see her belly shifting.  Loose dark skin accumulated at the bottom edge of her wide gut, bifrucated by the bowed out ligand which supported her abdomen.  As her wide flanks shifted left and right widely, the bottom barely shifted, though each step shook the loose amalgamation of cellulite and skin like it was filled with soft pudding. Kovu could hear the underside of her tummy scraping against her knees as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was honestly an effort to keep his purely animal side under control.  Kovu had kept himself diligently in line despite the increasing temptation that Mipa offered as she ate with reckless abandon, seemingly <i>trying</i> to tighten the sensation he got in his loins when he looked at her.  The only reason he had been able to keep himself in line this long was that one missing ingredient.  A male lion's libido was highly tuned to one specific scent, almost reliant on it, in fact.  The scent of a female in heat.  Kovu would not say that males were non-sexual creatures without a receptive female around, but usually sex was not on their minds unless that certain scent wafted on the breeze... and then it drove them mad.  Sometimes - even as he longed for it to come - he worried about how he would react when Mipa's time inevitably come.  He just hoped that their relationship could survive once the beast inside of him was unleashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa's breath was fairly heavy despite the fact that they were walking down hill.  She didn't usually talk until she could sit beside one of her traps (and ask Kovu to fetch her things and make adjustments elsewhere), but right now she did.  \"Kovu?\"  she asked, turning her head against her thick neck slightly so that he could just catch a glimmer of crystal blue as she kept moving slowly in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and let it out before speaking, though she was already breathing heavy, so it may have just been a natural breath.  \"Kovu, I've been meaning to ask you something for the past couple weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu's green eyes widened.  Effortlessly, he flowed up to walk at her side.  Every two steps, her rocking flank banged against his side; Kovu decided not to widen the gap between them.  \"What is it?\"  he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAir hissed between her teeth.  \"I've been putting this off, but now there isn't anymore time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Kovu cut across her path, forcing the fattened lioness to stop.  After just a moment, she let her hindlegs fold under her, gratefully letting the great weight of her belly and rear end onto the ground.  Her brisket protruded in front of her like a large, fuzzy grey fruit; it protruded nearly as far as her nose.  Kovu's loins tightened again, and he had to strongly reel in the urges that seemed to pulse outwards from his crotch and lower belly.  He was already half-guessing.  \"Mipa, what is it?\"  he put his paw on her, but she turned her face away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their faces met again, her blue eyes were piercing.  \"Kovu...  Are you ready to start a Pride?  With me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an answer, Kovu pushed forward, his neck against hers and crushed her to his chest as hard as he could.  \"Am I ready?\" he cried, real tears of relief sliding down his snout and onto her chocolate fur.  \"I couldn't imagine better news!  I love you Mipa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, crying a little herself, and pushed against his much firmer body, letting him feel some of her formidable weight.  He could take it.  \"Any day now, Kovu, we'll be able to make some cubs together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Kovu found even more strength to squeeze her soft torso and the harder he squeezed, the more she sighed relaxed into him.  Neither one of them wanted to break the embrace for a long time.  Even Mipa didn't mind if they missed out on checking some of the traps this evening.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The storm rolled in from the east about an hour before dusk, just as Kovu had foreseen. Water blanketed the oasis like a curtain and thunder boomed in the skies overhead as the Ancestors lashed their tails. Checking the soggy traps suddenly became trebly difficult.  Mipa sat on a bed of lush ferns which held the ground together despite the liquid onslaught and dictated instructions to Kovu.  The black maned lion honestly didn't mind as he tugged on vine and rope with his teeth or tried manipulating Mipa's delicate mechanisms with his still clumsy paws.  All he had to do was look over his shoulder to see the rewards for his effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu had developed a powerful physical attraction for the chocolate furred lioness.  Her soft, round, bulging form seemed exquisitely feminine, at once powerful in her sheer mass and delicate in her increasing lethargy.  The fact that she chose to ask him to perform menial tasks she used to do herself was actually more of a turn-on than a hassle.  The rain came down and smoothed the fur on her wide back.  Where she lay, her flank swelled in a vast, smooth brown plain transitioning to her grey tummy which sprawled generously over the damp ferns past her knees.  \"Now you have to lift the counterbalance, Kovu.\"  she shouted at him over the thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\"  asked Kovu, cluelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That log over there.\" tittered the lioness, waving her paw in the general direction.  \"You dummy.\"  she added affectionately under her breath, but still loud enough for him to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu grinned and moved over to where she directed, splashing through ankle deep, black mud.  Working in the rain was not so bad, when it came right down to it.  He was soaked and muddy, but the effort kept him warm and being well fed these last several months had stockpiled his form with both new muscle and new sleekness; he was up to the challenge.  As Kovu hauled the weight of the log high up into the canopy to provide energy for the snare, he thought about what Mipa had told him, about how much she'd change in the last several months and how much things between them had stayed the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa weight, just like the height of the log he was raising increased as time went on, and so increased Kovu's physical attraction to her.  However high the log went, however, the tension of the vine he was holding in his jaws stayed the same, much like the tension that still existed between himself and Mipa.  Now that he thought about it, remarkably little had changed between them.  They shared the fruits of their respective hunting techniques and slept together every night.  Kovu learned about balances and triggers and knots and Mipa learned more about how to behave socially as a lion.  However, Kovu still did not know much about her past, nor even the very basic reason why it was that no amount of food ever seemed to be enough for Mipa's greedy maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lioness saw food, she became someone else.  Normally quiet and subdued, she became straightforward and insistent in eating protocols, favoring anything which increased her own portions.  No matter what they caught or how much, it never seemed to be enough to satisfy her.  She ate until she couldn't possibly eat anymore.  Kovu hadn't questioned it, hadn't <i>wanted</i> to question it.  It was too much of a turn-on to watch her eat and sigh and imagine her belly getting rounder still, her body heavier and softer.  And when she'd obviously begun to slow down due to her sheer weight, that had been a turn-on too.  He'd been at her beck and call these last months together, just so that she wouldn't feel the hassle of her own bulky body, hoping that she wouldn't change her ways.  In a way, it had been glorious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now everything was coming to a head.  With Mipa coming into heat, he could finally fulfill everything his adolescent hormones have been demanding of him.  He would feel her soft girth under him, the breadth of her wide back between his forepaws...  His brawn would be contrast to her doughy softness.  Kovu sighed with longing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovu!\" shouted Mipa and the lion felt the vine slipping between his teeth.  He bit down.  \"Concentrate on what you're doing, Kovu!\"  she chided.  \"You know how long it took me to find a vine that long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu, holding the long vine in his mouth, turned his head and winked at the fattened lioness, mumbling something incoherent.  She waved him off with a lazy paw.  Kovu snorted and pulled down with the strength in his shoulders and neck.  However his mind turned to less pleasant topic, brought to life by the friction burn he'd suffered on his chops.<i>\"What about after?</i> thought Kovu.  <i>What about when she is my mate and we have cubs?\"</i>  Kovu honestly had some difficulty imagining Mipa as more than a sexual object.  He'd ignored so much about her, simply for who she is and what she's been becoming; namely something straight out of his deepest darkest fantasies.  Mipa was at the heaviest she'd ever been in her life and - with any luck - would soon be pregnant.  <i>\"Could there be any drawbacks other than the sheer weight of being so heavy?\"</i>  Kovu wondered.  He didn't know.  He'd never met another fat lion.  Another reason why Mipa seemed so intensely interesting and unique.  Still, faced with the prospect of starting a new pride with her, Kovu wondered for the first time if what he wanted for her might not actually be in Mipa's best interests...  No, that wasn't quite right.  It was the first time that he <i>cared</i> if it was in Mipa's best interests or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa waddled over after Kovu had finished lifting the weight.  Effortlessly, she tied a complex knot, finishing the snare.  Water dripped from her chin and she said, \"Phew.  That's one done.\"  She let out a breath like she'd done any of the actual work, but she grinned and Kovu knew she was teasing him.  He stepped forward and nuzzled his face against her chubbier one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu began walking then along the route that he'd since memorized.  \"Hopefully the next one will have something in it.\"  he commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa supplied an answer she knew Kovu would like.  \"Good, because I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu chuckled.  She'd been giving him more of these one liners and he still wasn't sure if she meant them or if she was just saying them because she knew he liked it.  As her big belly was rocking towards his side, he sauntered over and banged his flank against hers.  She stumbled just a bit, knocked off ballence.  Kovu said, \"I don't know about that.  You look pretty round to me, and you're not even pregnant... yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa bared her teeth at him, but turned it into a grin and stuck her tongue out at him as she recovered her waddling gait; Kovu wondered if she could indeed run anymore.  \"Only because you keep stuffing me full of monkeys and forest pigs!\"  Mipa grunted.  She meant it as a joke, but Kovu wondered how much she really meant it.  She continued, tossing her head and throwing a stream of water off of her, \"And I'll be getting even rounder when the little ones come.\"  She winked at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu smiled an honest smile despite his recent turmoil.  He put his head over Mipa's neck, feeling her soft warmth under him.  \"I'll like that, Mipa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you will, Kovu.\" said Mipa, raising her head slightly.  Kovu's eyes widened a little when she added.  \"Just don't ever leave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion's breath caught in his throat momentarily at the sound of fierce passion in her voice.  As he removed his head, he managed.  \"I won't Mipa. I promise.\"  The black-maned lion cleared his throat and shook his mane so that it was out of his eyes.  \"I think I see something dangling up ahead...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle of the evening found the two cats back in Mipa's glade high in the oasis.  The catch had been heavy with well fleshed monkeys and ground nesting birds.  With the oasis having doubled in size already with the rains, there was a lot of food to go around.  As ever, there only seemed to be enough food to satisfy Mipa's craven hunger despite the obvious bounty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt continued to rain and Kovu watched, drenched to the bone as Mipa smacked her chops and tore meat away from the small bodies to swallow in big gulps.  The sight made him feel tense and hot and tightened his loins.  Though he was still a little hungry, he passed over a small limp primate, just so Mipa could stuff herself just a little bit more.  It made him feel so good to see her take it with no resistance at all.  After all, everything belonged to her already, or so went the hasty reasoning.  But then again, would Mipa be setting as many traps as they currently had if she'd had to do all the work?  Especially with all the new bulk weighing down her feline frame.  Kovu licked his chops, savoring his own meal for the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChange was hard, though perhaps recognition was the first step to achieving a new equilibrium.  Kovu was willing to take it slow.  He had enough on his plate just now and the first order of business was how to show Mipa that he could be a King her her eyes...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mipa polished off the small menagrie she'd single-handedly decimated.  Her stomach felt bloated and stuffed to the brim, but the only reason she'd stopped eating was because there was simply no more food.  <i>\"For tonight</i> she thought wryly and picked her teeth with a skinny forarm bone; be it from primate or pheasant, she couldn't exactly remember.  As always, this night's glut was mostly a blur, she had no idea how many small animals she'd consumed exactly, but she was aware of the fact that Kovu had surrendered a couple of his own even after they'd divvied up the catch.  She released an immense and ungraceful belch and patted her belly in comfort without shame.  Kovu seemed to appreciate any added evidence of her great appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was there.  He was always there, especially after she'd finished eating; sometimes so much that she needed a belly rub to ease the pain.  The black maned lion settled down next to her putting his paws on her wide flank and rubbing her wet-slick hide.  She could smell his desire on his breath.  It was frightening, but oh so tantalizing.  Mipa felt like a moth drawn to a flame.  Kovu was exquisitely male and had the same power and ability to destroy that a male had, and yet the prospect of him hurting her seemed remote.  He was so gentle with her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mipa...\"  he breathed in her ear.  \"Have I told you how amazing you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa grinned and reached up with a paw to bat at the lion's face.  \"Not today, though you do tend to go on about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because it's true...\"  Kovu said and then, purring, stood, forcing his forepaws into Mipa's flab at her ribs and her belly.  \"You are getting <i>soooft</i>\"  drawled the lion as he kneaded Mipa's distended bulk like a kitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa growled lazily and rolled, though the lion followed her easily, walking with his hindlegs behind her.  \"Oh stoppit, you numbskull!\"  cried Mipa, laughing.  \"That tickles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh.\"  replied the lion, sticking his tongue out.  \"This is too much fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't laughing when Mipa suddenly grabbed him when she was on her back and dragged him over her wide flowing gut.  Kovu flopped head over heels and landed with a splash in a puddle on his back.  He lay there, coughing weakly between giggles.  Mipa got up and stood over him, her belly hanging ponderously low and actually touching Kovu at his hips.  She licked his cheek.  \"You have to be the silliest lion I've ever met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu got a wild glint in his eye and reached up to grab her with his paws.  She fell on top of him and he wheezed slightly with all of her weight on him.  But he seemed to enjoy the sensation for he said, \"...And you are the... sexiest lioness I've ever met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa tried to push up a little with her elbows, but he prevented her with a sweep of his paw.  His strong forearms reaching up into the fatty hollows behind her forelegs, he pulled her sagging weight fully down on him and she pressed against him along the entire length of his comparatively lean body, from her brisket which flowed into the hollow of his neck to her tummy which flooded his crotch.  She could feel his robust excitement.  Mipa still felt slightly embarrassed that her girth slumped onto the ground on one side past Kovu, so obese she was.  Kovu sighed under her bulk, or perhaps she was just pressing the air out of him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa suddenly didn't feel so comfortable.  She rose despite Kovu's gentle, unspoken insistence past the reach of his paws.  As she moved, her low slung belly dragged over her body.  The lion let out a small gasp as a certain patch of belly pulled over a certain patch of him.  However this only intensified the lioness's distress.  She waddled a short distance away as Kovu lifted his head to look at her in confusion.  The chocolate furred lioness grimaced and plopped her fatty rear on the ground.  She felt a belly ache coming on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu followed only after a few minutes and Mipa shivered as he brushed against her.  \"I'm going hunting for a while.  I'll be back before dawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Kovu.  I'll be here.\" said Mipa distantly and Kovu disappeared into the still steadily pouring rain.  When he had, the very round, very heavy lioness staggered to her paws and moved under the cover of some trees at the edge of her glade.  She spent some time grooming herself with her tongue, but the areas she could reach had decreased drastically.  This fact only increased her uneasy feeling.  Mipa blew, lifting her chops and looked down.  She saw a curving grey furred tummy, could actually see it despite the fact that she was sitting normally; or at least as normally as she could with her weight.  She ran her paws around her vastness.  She was so wide that her gut was spilling past her knees in both directions, a hideous distortion of a lioness's proper shape.  Her nipples were tender and so was her crotch as her time neared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a soft sob.  Kovu had been looking at her more for a while now, before he was even aware of the change, though Mipa was not unaware.  He had that hungry look in his eyes, same as the males out on the plains...  Mipa felt a sharp stab of pain in her gut and bent over, hugging her overfull tummy.  She knew she was giving herself a bellyache, but couldn't help herself.  There were things that she simply did not understand.  \"How can he love me?\"  Mipa quietly asked the storm.  Thunder rumbled an incoherent reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater continued to drip onto Mipa's wide back despite the best cover that she could find; she didn't mind it so much as her own thoughts.  The fear welled up in the back of her throat as the time approached when she would be at her most vulnerable once again.  It was a female curse which Mipa honestly wished she could do without, or at least she had...  She held her head in her paws and shook it to and fro.  <i>\"Kovu is different!\"</i>  she cried at herself, but there was still the looks he gave her, the way he eyed her, the firm feel of <i>him</i> against her.  She wanted to run away, to just be away from him and from anyone else.  But she remembered and couldn't forget.  She'd known love once before...  She might know it again and maybe for longer than an embrace, so brief.  She had the chance to become whole again, she couldn't throw it away, no matter how afraid she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa stood, getting heavily to her paws and bracing herself against the trunk of the near tree.  However, feeling the uncomfortable weight on her paws, she decided to sit again just a short distance away.  She could feel her gut against the backs of her forelegs.  The pragmatic side of her said that she was getting dangerously obese.  Mipa lifted a paw again and stroked the side of her sagging abdomen which filled completely the space between the ground and her undercarriage and caused her to slouch forward.  She'd put on more weight in the last several months than she had in the past three years.  And she showed no signs of slowing down any time soon.  The worst part of it was that she didn't even know how to feel about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd never relied on athleticism to catch her dinner, so most of the pragmatic arguments were out.  For the longest time, Mipa had felt ugly and undesirable because of her weight, but she didn't feel that way anymore, not around Kovu, who made very plain his attraction for her size and stature.  She retained some of the old discomfort looking at herself, but Kovu had shaken her old proclivities to the core.  Sometimes she did - almost - feel attractive around him.  But then there were all the little aches and pains, the difficulty in rising and in walking long distances, the way her thighs rubbed together, the way she spent too much time sitting around these days.  Kovu went out of his way to minimize inconveniance, but as much time as he spent around her, he couldn't fix <i>everything</i>.  Mipa sighed and patted the side of her tummy, sending waves rolling across her wide torso.  She just didn't know how to feel, the old disgust wouldn't come but neither did Kovu's unnatural attraction to her size and plushness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, her appetite seemed to dictate that she continue to grow.  And that seemed the darndest thing of all.  She'd never been this hungry before.  But since meeting Kovu, if there was food around, she ate it without thinking.  However much there was, she ate it.  It was a compulsion, pure and simple and it scared Mipa as well.  She felt out of control when there were carcasses near with fresh meat on them.  The hunger and the impulse stirred at the mere sight of food.  And the eating felt so... <i>good.</i>  Every swallow was bliss, but she couldn't get enough, even when she had past hunger, she wanted that feeling of flesh sliding down her gullet.  She still wanted it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa belched again, less loud then before and settled onto her wide tummy.  It was so big, it felt like a cushion under her, even preventing her from touching her knees to the ground unless she tilted to one side or other.  Did her weakness around food make her a bad lion?  Growing up, she's spent time alternately starving and in plenty, but that was common enough on the savannah.  You didn't see any of the other lionesses acting this way around meals nor bloating to her current size.  Mipa threw her head down onto her crossed paws. Slowly water dripped from her chin from where the mist continued to land on her face and the rest of her.  She didn't fee cold, though, she had a lot of insulation.  \"What's wrong with me?\"  she asked plaintively of the Ancestors in the sky.  She wept when they didn't answer, though her tears mixed with the water falling slowly on her face.  She stared a long time into the gloom of the glade before eventually, she settled into a light, uneasy doze.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kovu said that he was going out to hunt, but he was actully stepping out to think. Also he wanted to give Mipa some space. She did this sometimes. One moment she would be really receptive to him, the next the door would slam shut. It was hard not to get angry at her. He'd thought he'd been making progress...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"but I knew she was damaged goods when I signed up for this.\" sighed Kovu fondly. \"I'll show her. I'll find a way to get through to her...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKovu tramped through the enlarged oasis. There was plenty of room now to roam and even the desert beyond was fairly hospitable with fresh new grass and flowers as far as the eye could see; during the day at least. He still wasn't sure what he was going to do. Instinct and what he'd learned from his mother told him that a female might be impressed by a show of strength or dominance. Kovu shook his head as he plowed through the abundant undergrowth. That didn't seem right for Mipa. It would probably only frighten her. She had a thing with male lions... \"but what can I do?\" Kovu asked, lifting his face and black mane to the stormy sky. He'd given her time, months of time, and so far things had been well enough to please him. However if she was going to be his Queen, he needed more.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThunder exploded overhead, so loud it shook the trees around the lion and knocked loose what felt like a small pond's worth of water down on his head.  He rose, gasping and shook his long shaggy mane, the world was silent save for a loud ringing in his ears.  He recovered quickly and Kovu grinned.  He had his answer.  \"Yes!\"  he shouted up at the monsoon.  \"I must act as well.  Thank you!\"  Kovu bounded into the woods, wondering and puzzling over what form his action might take...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu returned just before dawn, like he said he would and bedded down with Mipa in the driest nook they could find in the trees around her glade.  Her woven mattress of grass had been blown apart and it would take a long time to remake it.  Kovu did his best to keep her warm an dry in the scant shelter they had between the boughs of the trees.  The day was long, hot and humid and Mipa slept heavily with a full belly.  It still struck Kovu as odd for a lion to eat each and every single night; especially coming from a wasteland where a meal once a week, interspersed with whatever insects could be scrounged from the dust - seemed like the norm and enough to survive on at least.  He smiled down on her vast sleeping form.  He liked that his mate didn't have to know what that was like.  And judging by his own frame, he was adapting in his own way to the new dietary regime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-maned lion extricated himself early in the afternoon from Mipa's heavy, flabby rolls and excused himself to a sleepy, only semi-concious lioness.  He paced down into the jungle and unfortunately was not able to return until just before dusk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was slightly alarmed when he saw her gone from the glade.  Dark clouds drifted by the stars and the bright moon above as he looked about for her in a quick circle.  He caught her scent leading down the opposite path and realized she must have gone to check the traps by herself.  He hoped she wouldn't be too mad at him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kovu!  Where have you been?\"  cried Mipa as she turned roundly to face the tardy lion; her sides wobbled slightly as she executed the tight turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu had stumbled upon the obese lioness as she had been struggling to reset a sprung, though empty snare; that happened quite often, as many as a third of all the traps had to be reset every night because of the simple triggers Mipa was able to employ with stakes, string and bits of wood. She'd turned when she caught his distinctive scent. Her glare and the obvious effort she'd been through to reform the snare sent a pang of guilt down Kovu's spine. It was true he had been gone much longer than he'd anticipated. \"Mipa,\" He pleaded, striding out from around a stout tree, \"I'm sorry that I was gone.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe very obese cat sat down on the damp turf in front of Kovu, easing the weight off of her hindlegs and spreading her tummy over the ground under her.  She breathed a little heavily as she spoke.  \"You're supposed to help me with this.  Do you realize how long it... took me to fix this thing by myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her belly and wide frame heaved in a delightful way as she spoke, Kovu felt terrible that she'd been put in her current situation, worse that seemed to be brushing up against her limitations for the first time.  And it was a very intuitive guess that while Mipa was taking out her anger on him, its origins were closer to home.  \"I know, Mipa and I already said that I was sorry, but I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\"  intrupted Mipa, jutting her pigeon breast forward and raising a paw to jab Kovu in the chest.  \"What was so important that it couldn't wait until we'd finished collecting our <i>food?</i>\"  Mipa said emphasizing the word.  While Kovu recognized that the ongoing quest for food was a vital part of their existence, he also realized that it was not as though either of them were in any danger of starving.  Again, it was Mipa's odd fixation on food cropping up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu took a deep breath and let it out.  After this, there was no going back.  \"I'd like to show you... if you'll let me Mipa.\" he said, lifting his face to meet hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa was slouching, her belly sagging across the ground and her cheeks full round and sagging a little as well.  However her blue eyes seemed younger as they widened in surprise.  She turned away, embarrassed at her own wrath.  Then she threw Kovu a line.  \"Alright.  Let's see what you've been up to these last few hours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu led Mipa back up to the high point of the oasis, where the streams were above the waterfall and then higher still.  Mipa complained about going uphill.  \"Kovu...\" she puffed as she waddled, her belly swinging side to side and her knees pressing into the fatty flesh with every step.  \"Why're you bringing me... up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-maned lion glanced back at his much slower companion.  Mipa lacked much of a lion's basic grace as she plodded through the grass about as enthusiastically as a mule.  Felines tended to move both paws on the same side of the body at the same time as a general rule.  Not Mipa.  Not since she'd managed to grow her tummy from an overlarge bulge to something which dominated her frame.  Now she moved one paw at a time, and her feet were widely spaced, making for an inefficient and taxing gait.  To Kovu, it was beauty in motion.  \"It's not much farther now.  I wanted to put it higher up, but I would have had to drag everything father from the oasis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you talking...\"  grumbled Mipa, but then subsided into subvocalized mutterings at a plaintive look from Kovu.  She took a few more gulps of air and continued dragging her fat ass up the hill to where the oasis finally ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last stretch of the journey, Kovu dropped back and asked the laboring lioness to close her eyes.  She rolled her eyes at him, but obliged him without too much fuss.  She'd come all this way after all and from the sound of her heart, she really was excited to a degree.  When Kovu let her open her eyes, she let out a small gasp at what the lion had constructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply put it was a small windmill.  Fortune had provided the intrepid lion with a dead tree whose trunk supported the slowly rotating blades.  It was simple in construction, even simplier in Kovu's head, but in practice it'd taken him four tries to set up.  As much as he'd learned from Mipa from the time living with and assisting her, he simply lacked the finesse in his paws for subtle manipulations.  The assembly creaked as it slowly turned in the breeze.  Kovu had made the blades from twigs and leaves mostly.  It were also festooned with flowers woven into the blades as well as many small bones from the remains of Mipa's meals.  The latter clicked and clacked in an appealing music as the wheel turned slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa was rendered speechless, so Kovu said.  \"I built this wheel so that you'd know that how I feel for you will never go away, Mipa.  Just like the arms keep turning, so will my feelings for you continue, forever.\"  He brushed against her, rubbing his whiskers against her ear, \"I will always be here for you Mipa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa choked up, looking at the thing that Kovu had built, built for her.  A range of emotions played on her face: surprise, elation, disconcertion, humility and... well, love. \"Kovu... I... I don't know what to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to say anything.\"  said Kovu, brushing up against her soft seated form.  Mipa smiled and looked up at the colorful clacking blades.  The differently shaped bones created an eerily intense sound and the way the fans moved about unsteadily in the breeze was almost mesmerizing.  The two large cats sat there and looked at it as the sun set behind them.  It kept spinning and it would continue to creak about slowly through the night and the nights to come.</span></div></div>",

It reflected from the water lying in the once-desert, creating a red wonderland as otherworldly as the afterlife must be. Together they watched the show, entertained by the music of Kovu\u2019s contraption, and then, with a new day ahead of them, headed down the mountainside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa had just as much trouble going down as up the hillside, only it was her forelegs that received most of the abuse. Not only did they take most of her weight but the loose fat on her body rolled forward, smothering the movement of her forelegs. It was slow going and Mipa was obviously concentrating very hard, so Kovu did not say anything. Only when she got onto the flat below did she lie down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew!\u201d she said, breathing heavily. Crystal blue eyes sought out Kovu\u2019s, however, and despite the distress of her overburdened body, the expression her chubby face could only be described as... excitement. They\u2019d hardly said anything to each other all night, so Kovu only looked back until Mipa said, \u201cThat was... a beautiful thing you made.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was made for a beautiful lioness,\u201d he said, and bowed. Mipa giggled, the fat on her pigeon-like chest rocking in synchrony. But then she stopped, eyes widening, panting silent in a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKovu...\u201d she said, then paused. \u201cI... I want you to take me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu blinked, then his heart leapt and he darted forwards. Mipa lay there, but her eyes widened as he moved and she flinched in the other direction. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing... just take me,\u201d she said, though her fear was still apparent. She did not get up, but her gaze never left his. Her tail was still; it was obvious she wasn\u2019t aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMipa-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, her voice a squeal as her panting returned, this time controlled, as if due to panic. \u201cJust take me. I want to be yours. I want to be yours and I trust you just take me now and... and...\u201d She met his gaze again, \u201c... let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face studied Kovu for his reaction, but Kovu didn\u2019t know how to react. She wanted him. He wanted her... but she was scared. Too scared to copulate with him properly. And anyway, the female lioness was meant to arouse the male. This was all wrong. This wasn\u2019t what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he opened his mouth to say as much. \u201cMipa-.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sprang \u2013 lunged \u2013 to her feet, the effort evident on her face. \u201cKovu! Don\u2019t make this harder than it needs to be. Please, I want to start a family with you, so... take me.\u201d She turned, facing her fat body away from him.<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t mount her. Instead he walked by her side. \u201cMipa...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding her face, Mipa sobbed. \u201cKovu...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready, Mipa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI AM ready. It\u2019s just... my mind... my stupid mind. I\u2019m ready, but it\u2019s not. My soul is ready... but my mind...\u201d<br>\r\nKovu rubbed his flank against hers, but his chin over her neck. \u201cWhen you\u2019re mind is ready, I\u2019ll be ready,\u201d he said. \u201cI can wait. I desire you too, but I will wait... for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I\u2019m never ready?\u201d she said, still facing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll make the best of what we have,\u201d he said, licking behind her ear, rubbing his body against hers. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing too badly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him then, blue eyes full of tears, cascading over her fat cheeks. She nodded to him, and he nodded back; they both smiled. \u201cI... I\u2019m starving,\u201d she said at last. \u201cShall we go check some traps together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be my pleasure,\u201d he said, then licked her cheek. Side-by-side, they walked off into the rich underbrush.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kovu slinked his way through new green grass which rose to the large cat\u2019s shoulders.  The muscular mounds worked up and down as he prowled as silently forward as he could.  As he did, he could not help but reflect the difference a few monsoon storms could make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area in which he was now stalking had, in fact, been little more than barren desert before the start of the wet season.  Now the grass was rich, abundant and flowering.  The dead looking twisted trees which existed here and there now sported new coats of green and colorful flowers.  One was as likely to step in mud now as solid ground.  As for the animals, the time for migration was upon most of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oasis was a smear of green on the horizon behind Kovu.  He\u2019d ranged out far for tonight\u2019s dinner.  He just hoped he was cat enough to catch it.  Walking, Kovu could simply feel a new sleekness on his frame, a softness that was not there before.  Mipa had had an impact certainly on him, or rather the abundance of food her hunting technique provided.  Hunching his shoulders in the grass and wishing at this moment that he lacked the large conspicuous mane which he wore, Kovu just hoped that the new weight which slightly padded his figure would not slow him down.  However, if he did things right, there shouldn\u2019t be much of a chase in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere they were, just ahead of him.  The wildebeest gathered in the new prairie by the thousand, perhaps hundred thousand, perhaps more.  To Kovu at least, the herd appeared endless and he knew that the could only see a small portion of thier total number.  Several dozen of them paced ahead, munching on the newly sprouted grass.  Five times that number were steadily walking through those who had stopped.  Wildebeest didn\u2019t hurry much, but they never stopped moving.  This time of the year, they were going [south].  They weren\u2019t doing more than passing through the area, but still their numbers blackened the living desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench of their sweating bodies put Kovu on edge.  The muscles along his spine and in his legs were tight like springs and his eyes darted to follow every movement.  The large cat read the herd as a human would a sheet of parchment.  There were certain patterns of motion which Kovu was looking for, ones that indicated age, illness or infirmity.  He was also aware of every small shape representing each calf and observed them in case any wandered just a little too far.  In Kovu\u2019s world, an easy meal was preferred to a hard one; only desperate lions tried bringing down young, fit prey.  And Kovu along with his family had been that desperate on a number of occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd more, now that he was older, Kovu found that he respected the strength of his prey.  To take life and death into one\u2019s paws was not a light matter.  The strong ones advertised their strength in the herd both to their mates and to any predators that might be watching.  They seemed to say to Kovu, \u201cI understand my place in life, but I also understand yours.  Come and deliver your trial unto me; I do not fear that I shall not pass.\u201d  Kovu smiled a small cat\u2019s grin and sidled closer, his belly close to the ground and his eyes fixed ahead, looking for the one he would present with his challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion\u2019s heart pounded in his chest, quicker and quicker the closer he got the the large, lumbering shapes.  This was exhilaration, this was fun, this was passion and philosophy all rolled into a single sweet symphony.  Kovu knew that everything he was feeling was leading up to just a few moments of action where his own life and the life of his prey would be, for a few precious seconds, entirely up in the air.  Granted, the odds were in his favor for the coming battle, but only in the short run.  There was a reason why there were more wildebeest than lions, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent of the herbivores was intoxicating.  It made Kovu giddy.  The lion was filled with a sense of barely restrained power.  It felt almost like he could simply launch himself at any of the plodding shapes and deliver instant death; though he knew better from firsthand experience.  Ahead of him he saw it, an older male now past his breeding years.  Normally, Kovu would have passed this one over in favor for one sick or a calf, but the beast was walking with a rather heavy limp, an old gnarled and grey scar on his hindleg marking where he\u2019d once been gored.  He was a bit on the thin side also and looked as though life had been rough to him.  Kovu was willing to bet that he lacked stamina now in his waning years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion creapt closer.  The stink of wildebeest was intense and now the lion was passing fresh droppings as he neared his chosen one, grazing on the outer flanges of the constantly moving herd.  The Old One had other scars on his body and he was strongly built in his forequarters.  Perhaps he had been a bull in his prime, though judging by his condition, the reign must have been short-lived.  At any rate, Kovu figured that he was past the age of siring young now.  The herd would not suffer for his loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension only grew as he approached the target, moving as quickly as he dared.  Kovu was acutely aware of the fact that if the wind changed only a little the herd would detect him and all his efforts would be forfeit.  A young mother lifted her head nearby and looked in the lion\u2019s direction.  Kovu happened to be looking in her direction and so was able to vanish into thicker grass before she could startle.  The lion paused and waited a few moments and she placidly dropped her head.  Kovu, however, was gripping the ground with his claws, so tense was he.  If he had been a year younger he might have already darted for the older male, probably to the ruin of his whole hunt.  But he had some experience hunting alone.  More in these last several months than he\u2019d had living with his mother, sister Vitani and his brother Nuka.  He continued on, close to the ground.  Only a few dozen more lengths to go\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reflected on his own painfully developed patience, Kovu had to consider one other thing about the recent changes to his life.  As much as he loved Mipa and her luscious, voluptuous body, he would never understand her disinclination towards standard means of hunting.  Granted, he didn\u2019t disaprove of her method, in fact he loved it.  He loved it because it demonstrated just how clever Mipa was and also because it allowed her to support such an awesomely erotic figure that would be completely unattainable or supportable with the traditional methods.  But despite its cleverness and even despite the fact that Kovu had learned much of the way of mechanics and weights and tension, <i>this</i> was something that he could not live without.  Simply put, Kovu would not feel like a lion if he didn\u2019t hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet\u2026 Mipa did not hunt at all.  Kovu still had not fully come to terms with the concept.  He\u2019d brought it up on many an occasion in the past, but Mipa had always shrugged and either said she thought her way was better or that she never liked hunting.  But how could one not like this?!  It was what lions were born to do.  Mipa seemed to have other motivations\u2026  Perhaps it was why she still seemed so opaque to him, even after all this time.  Perhaps it was one of the reasons why she flinched when he touched her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Old One lifted his great horned head and snorted.  Scuffing the ground with a hoof, he looked out uncomfortably over the prairie. Kovu held his breath and tried simultaneously not to move and to lower his belly to the ground\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late!  Kovu locked eyes with the Old One and he let out a bellowing cry.  The lion was on his feet and leaping forward, launching himself forward with his hindlegs with all the power in his youthful male body.  The wildebeest, bigger and slower than Kovu, nevertheless turned like a dancing bird and began to tear up the new turf with his hooves.  The alarm spread through all the gathered animals, but the chase was already on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu was close, but not as close as he would have liked.  It took several moments to catch up and the burst of speed drained a lot of his reserves.  Lions, nor any other big cat, could not match the stamina of most of their prey animals.  Either you caught it in the first few seconds, or it got away most of the time.  But this old timer had a limp and had seen too many summers, it seemed for Kovu was able to gain on him.  The black maned lion made the crucial leap with a powerful thrust of his hindlegs.  The grass under him was a green blur as his body plowed through the air like a fish in water.  Then the hot, steaming body of the wildbeest was under him and his claws were drawing down, ever so slowly it seemed.  Kovu watched as an outsider as his nails sank into the beast\u2019s thick hide.  The Old One let out another bellow.  Kovu feared that the others would come to assist the old timer, but his mates were drawing away, seemingly able to sense that now was the time for this beast to prove that he was worthy for continued survival\u2026 or not.  With all the heads up and staring at them, Kovu felt akin to a celebrity.  He was in a duet whose song was central to all things; Life itself.  With his weight crashing down onto the wildebeest\u2019s back, Kovu reached forward and sank his fangs into the back of its neck. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stillness pervaded the forest where the lioness plodded through the sparse, though leafy undergrowth which thrived in the constant gloom.  Vines dangled motionless from far above or else grew and twisted around the green trunks of the trees who managed to survive year long in the moist shelter of the oasis.  The air was heavy with moisture and yet the smell of it seemed to offer yet more rains to come; they were less than halfway through the wet season after all.  The only noise came from the birds and monkeys who were the denizens of that upside down world.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTheir chatter fell on deaf ears, however.  Mipa was too busy tugging on a length of cord with her teeth to bother listening to the constant ramblings of lesser creatures. \u201cDamn this cord is all frayed\u2026\u201d thought Mipa as she struggled to reset yet another empty trap.  The snare consisted simply of two hook shaped sticks pressed into the ground, a cord hanging down from a nearby sapling, a third stick hammered to make a triangle with the first two, and then two more slender sticks to form the trigger; at least it seemed simple to Mipa.  The cord came down around a straight stick held in place by the two hook shaped sticks and knotted at the end of this was a small twig.  Mipa had to hold this down with her teeth while placing the last stick so that it braced against the third stake and the trigger.  Tension would hold the assembly together, that is, until an unlucky creature happened to brush against the last stick.  The lioness was having a little trouble holding down the sapling while reaching across to get the last stick into position.  Also, one of the stakes was jabbing into her low slung chest\u2026<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJust then, the rotting cord gave way; maybe she bit down a little too hard, it didn\u2019t really matter.  The line whipped against Mipa\u2019s cheek on its way up and the big cat yowled.  As her eyes began to fill with tears for the pain, she stumbled backward a few steps and then plopped down heavily onto her wide rear.  With the weight off her paws, Mipa gingerly raised a forepaw to brush lightly against her cheek.  The back of it came away red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d she said to herself, her voice warbling in her throat as she choked back tears not just at the pain but at... everything. Her traps were failing one by one, her back was hurting, her paws were hurting, and Kovu was nowhere to be found. The black maned lion could have been here helping her fix them, but he wanted to \u201chunt,\u201d a method he\u2019d proven to be far too time consuming and which left her alone and hungry. Why he didn\u2019t want to just stay with her and check traps together, she could only guess.  However, the first thing that came to mind was likely that he simply didn\u2019t enjoy her company anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started forward, getting up just a little too quickly, and a lance of pain flew up her spine. \u201cDammit,\u201d she hissed as she plonked herself back down onto her well padded rump.  On her second try, she gathered her legs beneath her, then carefully eased her backside into a standing position. It felt like her spine was being pulled to earth by a heavy weight tied around her middle - which was pretty much exactly the case -  causing the muscles to spasm as she waddled forward, one leg at a time... front left, rear right, front right, rear left, then back again. If she tried to take too large a step her stomach would get in the way of her knees. If she didn\u2019t swing her spine way out to either side, her stomach would get in the way of her knees. If she swung her sides out too much, the pain along her spine was tremendous.  She sorely wanted to simply lie down for a few hours, yet her hunger drove her forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn you, Kovu. Where are you?\u201d He had been gone for hours. <i>Why does he leave me alone so often? What is he doing out there? Why is he ignoring me?</i> The thoughts and suspicions circled around and around in her head.  One moment it seemed Kovu was the most devious sort of creature, the next it seemed like he was a saint.  The breath came heavy in her throat, not because she\u2019d exhausted herself - she hadn\u2019t gotten above a plodding waddle this entire time she\u2019d bee out in the jungle - but because of all the little aches and pains building in her joints and muscles.  There was simply too much weight to carry around.  She was hurting before she even had the chance to get tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity forcing her way through the rampant undergrowth and hatefully uneven terrain of the jungle, Mipa reached the spot she\u2019d been aiming for.  The snare here too was sprung, but at least there was something in it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first trap that Mipa had checked so far today that had caught anything; granted, it was only the twelfth one she\u2019d gotten to so far, how slow her pace had become.  Some poor monkey had gotten its leg caught in the snare, some days ago by the smell of it for it was already dead.  Mipa stepped forward gingerly, her flanks swaying to make room for bowlegged hindfeet to move move forward across her ballooning abdomen.  She let out a little sigh of relief when she sat her fattened rear down on the ground.  She nosed at her catch and licked her chops.  Normally, she and Kovu would collect all the catches and take them up to her hollow to feed\u2026  But Kovu wasn\u2019t here was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t give the matter too much thought before letting her stomach decide for her.  The sight of fresh meat dangling in front of her was already making her mouth water.  Ferociously, she reached up - her back flaring again slightly as she reared up - and grabbed the simian in her jaws.  It was thicker and more hefty than it initially looked.  Good.  She bit through the leg and let the snare spring up with a clatter of shaking leaves as she settled down onto her wide gut to eat her meal alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lingered there, under the snare, for a while absentmindedly licking the bones.  It was less because she didn\u2019t want to waste any of the meat on her catch than she wasn\u2019t looking forward to continuing her rounds; let along resetting the trap beside her by herself.  It was in this funk, after the surges of appetite had left her in peace, that she heard the sound.  It was faint and it took her several long moments to recall what that peculiar sound was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa lifted her head away from her skeletal meal to hear it better.  Thick and heavy bunches of skin hung from her throat and the underside of her jaw as she did and behind her head she could feel one or two of her permanent collars of flab shift against one another.  It was a faint clack-clacky-clack sound; hollow bones.  Then she remembered; Kovu\u2019s windmill, his love for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d been up there to repair it twice now. It had only been a week or so since he made it, but already it needed repairs. \u201cFailing,\u201d a voice nearby whispered. \u201cJust like your partnership with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe well fed lioness turned swiftly away from sound of the windmill floating down into the oasis.  She started for the voice was close at hand and even more, was quite familiar.  Between her paws - past her generous brisket filling much of the space between that is - was the skeletal remains of her meal, held together by nothing but ligaments and gristle.  But the hollow eyes of the empty cracked skull caught her attention.  They gleamed.</span></div></div>",

What evidence is there that he even exists?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa looked around. Of course, there was none at hand.  She sighed. \u201cJobie, I\u2019m not that foolish-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need him, Mipa!\u201d  Jobie interrupted,  \u201cYou need me. I kept you from being alone, and besides, look what he\u2019s done to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa shied away slightly, but turning her head only allowed her to see her engorged flank spreading into view as well as feel the copious quantities of flesh draping from and surrounding her thickened neck.  She could still hear Jobie speaking from the ground.  \u201cHe\u2019s turned you into a hippo, Mipa!  He\u2019s made you soft and slow and made it hurt to even walk and fix your traps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKovu didn\u2019t do that, Jobie\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d  but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to say it, even to Jobie.  The shame was too great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did do it!\u201d  Jobie insisted.  \u201cYou\u2019ve all but doubled your weight since you met him.  How can it not be his fault?  Think about all the food he\u2019s offered you.\u201d  He said silkily.  \u201cHe all but shoveled it down your throat\u2026 and the way he looks at you when you overeat\u2026 for him!  He even said he likes the way you look as well.  How ridiculous is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breath caught in Mipa throat from the tirade.  Things she\u2019d been blind to before suddenly seemed obvious.  She could see Kovu for what he was, a charlatan, a user.  Tears came freely to her eyes the more she thought about it.  \u201cHe\u2026 He couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d  she stammered meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe just wants to see how ridiculous you\u2019ll look after feeding into his lies and then he\u2019ll abandon you and you\u2019ll be helpless.\u201d  His story seemed to bring the world into harsh illumination and made Mipa want to break down and sob, but suddenly Jobie\u2019s presence was stronger than ever.  It was as if he was just on the other side of her, a hair\u2019s breadth away from touching her far flank.  \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Mipa.\u201d  He cooed.  \u201cIt\u2019s not too late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-too late for what?\u201d  asked Mipa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo leave this place.  To just get up and go.  Now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?\u201d  The very idea filled Mipa with terror.  In her mind\u2019s eye, the endless desert she\u2019d almost died in spread out before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet up and leave, while the cad is still out <i>hunting</i>.\u201d  Jobie spat the last word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere w-would I go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d  Jobie asked.  Mipa felt an electric tingle up her spine at the ghost\u2019s presence behind her.  Jobie hadn\u2019t seemed so real in almost a year.  It was almost possible to imagine his former self standing behind her.  \u201cWherever you go, I\u2019ll be there, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa was silent for a moment, considering the words of Jobie.  Slowly she shook her head.  She lowered her face to peer down at the little skull again.  \u201cJobie\u2026 that\u2019s crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skull said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the more she thought about it, the more she allowed herself to remember the past several months, the less convinced she grew that the matter was really as urgent as Jobie would have her believe.  \u201cI don\u2019t need to escape Kovu.\u201d  She said finally.  \u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything to hurt me and he\u2019s had plenty of opportunities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not sincere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how do you know that?!\u201d  growled Mipa suddenly.  Oh how she wished she could believe all of that dark maned lion\u2019s sweet, sweet words.  \u201cWhy on earth would he stick around this long, otherwise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe only wants what all other males want.\u201d Said Jobie in a low tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was like cold water being dumped on her back.  Of course it was true.  She\u2019d smelled as much, she\u2019d <i>felt</i> as much\u2026 and yet\u2026  \u201cWait, you said that he was only pretending to desire me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen how could he want me for that as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the skull had nothing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa took a deep breath and wiped her face with the back of a paw, it stung a little when she rubbed her cut cheek; she lowered her head as it was slightly more difficult to reach up against the thick fat of her shoulder nowadays.  She spoke quietly once she\u2019d cleaned away the tears.  \u201cKovu said he loved me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLies.\u201d Said the skull<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKovu makes me feel good.\u201d  Mipa blurted before she was half aware of what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKovu makes you feel afraid.\u201d Countered Jobie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was right about that. Every time he neared her... the thought of him coming closer... she was afraid. But then once he was there she felt so good. She needed him... he was good for her. He was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJobie was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have Kovu. I\u2019m sorry, Jobie.\u201d  Said Mipa, and inside, she felt something of a clarification beginning, a sense of tranquility regarding the future.  Kovu still scared her, that much she could admit, but somehow she also thought that perhaps that was what she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll regret not leaving him.\u201d Said the skull, but already the voice was fading.  She couldn\u2019t feel Jobie behind her any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I do then I\u2019ll deal with it when it comes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skull let out a final sigh.  \u201cI\u2019ll always be here for you Mipa\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa smiled down at Jobie.  \u201cI know you will\u2026  You\u2019re never more than a meal away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skull grinned up at her and spoke no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa sighed and slumped exhausted both mentally and emotionally.  The thought crossed her mind to make her way back up to her alcove for a late afternoon nap, but the thought was also exhausting.  She lowered her head down onto her paws, feeling her neck and brisket squish under her, and settled into an easy doze.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sleep peeled off the turgid lioness only reluctantly.  In fact Mipa may have continued to lie in her spot beside the still-wet skeleton of her meal for a long while more if it hadn't begun to drizzle.  It was only misting really, but the configuration of the canopy above conspired to drip a stream down on the fattened feline; right on her muzzle.  Mipa got laboriously to her feet which at least weren't hurting as much now for the nap.  For a few moments, she was torn between returning to the shelter of home in the alcove overlooking the rest of the oasis and finishing her round of trap checking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut really, there wasn't a choice.  Mipa simply didn't have the energy or the will to finish her hike through the jungle.  She just wanted to lie down somewhere cozy and lick the starches she'd accumulated on her soft tummy a rub the still-stinging wound on her cheek.  She turned to waddle back the way she'd come, not at all looking forward to the uphill fight against gravity that was to come.  It turned out that gravity would be the least of her concerns, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa had only taken a few steps when she realized that something was amiss.  The disquieting stillness that had stolen over the jungle was noticeable even through the steady patter of light rain and the chimes of drips and drops that managed to find their way down to the ground.  The birds and monkeys were not just being quiet, they were gone.  Mipa hunched her fatty round shoulders and took small steps.  Unease and fear filled her irrationally, even though she ought to be the biggest thing out in the jungle now that the ancient serpent was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa's fear only grew until she could continue no more.  The silence surrounding her was deafening to the ears.  Painfully slowly, she turned her huge self about in a circle, sniffing the sodden air, and looking every which way.  She had the feeling of being stalked.  She remembered it from the bad old times out alone on the savanna and in heat.  And given her present state, how could she not expect some sex crazed male to be hot on her trail, even here, years after she thought she'd made her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was not a male who stalked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere.  Her eyes nearly passed over them, but there they were all the same, definitely not a trick of the eyes.  In the shadows of the foliage beside a fallen palm tree she'd passed were a pair of sinister eyes.  Cat eyes, and they glittered with their blue and yellow intensity right at Mipa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed for the longest time another nightmare come to play with her senses, an unreal thing like she sometime saw in her darkest moments.  She stared at the eyes and they stared back at her and didn't move.  And then they did.  She stepped out of the leaves slowly, gracefully in an easy way that Mipa could no longer manage with her rolling, wobbling gait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Mipa's turn to freeze, just like the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat stepped out of the shadows could not be a better representation of everything Mipa was not.  She was a lion, but thin and angular as a reed.  Her ribs protruded from her flanks and her shoulders pumped like blades under her thin fur.  For that, though, there was still ample muscle on her haunches and filling out her forequarters as well.  She might have lacked a trace of body fat on her, and she looked fast and exceedingly dangerous.  Everything Mipa was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped before Mipa and looked at her down her nose, not saying a word.  If anything, the mild expression on her thin face spoke of disinterested bewilderment.  As if this stranger had come across some exceedingly odd variation of beetle and was deciding if stepping on it would yield an ounce of amusement or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa couldn't take being sized up like that.  And also, her knees were starting to hurt a little.  She tried to speak but found her mouth unbearably dry.  \"He-He\"  she swallowed and tried again. \"Hello?\"  she squeaked finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was answered with silence.  Inequitable distain shone in the strange lion's eyes as she continued to glance at Mipa as if continually surprised by her appearance at every new moment.  Despte the lack of answer, and the pain in her knees, Mipa did not think for a moment about turning to go about her business.  She wished desperately that Kovu were near instead.<br>\r\nFinally the stranger deigned to speak.  \"You're a curious thing,\" the stranger said and began to circle the bloated lioness.  Mipa turned her head to keep her in sight, but couldn't seem to bring herself to move her heavy paws.  Soon the thick fatty rolls she'd accumulated on her neck blocked her head from turning anymore.  Mipa's extremely generous hindquarters felt hideously oversized and vulnerable. \"Was your mother a hippo, and your father a lion? Or around here does food just walk into your gaping mouth?\"  The stranger asked as she came back around.  Mipa noticed that she'd paused a little to sniff her crotch and surely realize her current condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa gulped.  \"Please... I don't want any trouble.\"  Her feet shuffled clumsily to shift the bulk of her a little away from the cold-eyed lioness.  Her body moved in the way it should have if she were much thinner.  As a result, she nearly tripped as her knee caught in her low slung belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger didn't make a move to get nearer.  Likely they both knew that there was no way Mipa was going to get away, even with a generous head start.  \"And you won't have any, not so long as you tell me what I want to hear anyway.\" She sat and looked at her paw as she slowly extended and retracted her claws, like knives.   \"I am looking for a lion, one with a black mane.  I don't suppose you've happened to stumble across one have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu!  Mipa thought agonizingly.  What on earth is this female looking for him for?  Mipa didn't have a whisper of an answer. \"N-n-no\u2026  I haven't seen anyone like th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lie!\"  The stranger roared and surged forward.  Mipa backed up, but the speed at which the lioness flowed over the ground was such that she'd barely taken two steps before they were face to face.  Mipa's heavy rump fell to the ground with a dull Thud she and the other lion could feel in their toes.  Mipa felt clumsy, heavy and useless and was in addition afraid for her life.  \"His smell covers you from your head to your toes!\" Then, just as quickly as she/d dashed forward, she began to laugh. \"He must have been desperate, this far out from home. Where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipa paused, terrible thoughts speeding through her mind. How did this lioness know Kovu? Was she... a former lover? Did Mipa have a rival? Panic welled up inside of her and her breath became ragged. Too many terrible thoughts were springing up in a whirlwind of confusion.  It rendered her speechless.  But it was clear that this lioness would not take silence for an answer.  Claws withdrawn, the lioness boxed Mipa across the face.  It was harder than Mipa could have ever anticipated.  Her foreleg folded under the weight of her forequarters as she teetered off balance.  Instinctively, Mipa reached out with one of her paws, but it didn't come close to hitting the stranger.  Mipa collapsed painfully onto her flank and the lioness was on her in an instant, paws planted on her chest, and fangs close to her oh-so-squishy and tender neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to give you one more chance to answer.\"  she growled and Mipa could feel her claws sinking into her fatty hide on her chest.  \"Where is he?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well... perhaps not so average because here we explore the everyday life of a common person, except this common person happens to also weigh in the extremes of the normal weight categories.

In fact, he gets along fairly well thinking little of his abnormal size, aside from all the little ways in which being large in a world designed for smaller frames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm going to start with the name of John Avery, but you can change it if you wish during the course of the story.  The main character must remain the same, however and no gender swapping.  A female protagonist has certain qualities concerning attractiveness and self image that I want to downplay in this story.  This is to be a study and a role play of what being at an incredible size might be like in real life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the spirit of this goal, please observe the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>No magic and no unrealistic technology<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo rapid wight-gain.  If there must be WG, then make it extremely gradual, i.e. no more than 3 lbs a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo unrealistic eating.  The main character has a normal appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry to keep extreme situations to a minimum.  Remember, this is just your average guy with normal, everyday dramas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main character doesn't fondle himself nor does he fantasize about how big he is or how much bigger he will be.  He is a man who is secure in his body shape and has gotten to his size through inattention or lack of maintenance.  He is not a feeder or a feedee by nature.

For trying to feed on one of the bovines they'd begun to graze on <i>her</i> territory. The tigress also cursed the many other striped cats she'd cone across in her flight, unwilling to give even an inch of their precious territories to the injured cat, and adding their own injuries besides. Not that the scratches did much, she had to admit, but each stinging cut added its own flavour of pain to the feast of agony her other injuries were feeding her. The burns across her back and flanks felt like the fires there were still blazing, though they'd gone out days before, her mangled haunch sent spurts of agony up her spine with every step, and as if all of that wasn't enough, her stomach, now five or six days empty, was giving her no rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Natii's spirits lifted slightly as her nose picked up a faint scent; <i>water!</i> Moving as fast as her injured leg would allow, the tigress followed her nose and found, not just the stream she'd been expecting, but a pool, not a huge one, but rather deep for it's size, certainly deep enough to allow her to wade. Thanking the heavens vaguely for this gift, the injured cat stepped into the pool, following the bank down until with the ridge of her spine barely showing out of the water, her forepaws cold no longer touch the bottom. There she floated, enjoying the cooling, soothing sensation of the water on her wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii floated in the pool for hours, not moving but for breathing and the occasional weak kick to keep her in the more-or-less middle of the watery heaven. The water also helped soothe her grumbling stomach as she drank several gallons of the cool liquid. The tigress knew she'd eventually have to get out of the pool though, but waited until nightfall to do so. Finally emerging from the pool, she shivered at the temperature drop, she wouldn't have noticed it in the pool, but out here, without the insulation provided by the water, the night air chilled her. For a while, she considered staying here, the pool would have made a nice focal point to her new territory, but after an investigation of the area she decided to leave, as nice as this pool was it didn't seem to be regularly visited, indeed it did not seem to have been visited in several moons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSad to leave, Natii slowly began to leave the waterhole behind. Normally she'd have shaken herself dry upon leaving the pool, but night the chill provided by the water within her fur seemed to dull the pain of her many injuries, which she considered more than a big enough reward. The tigress spent the night travelling as aimlessly as she had the past five days, and by morning, she was prepared to drop from exhaustion and pain. She temporarily staved off her slumber though, when she spotted a rather unnatural looking rock formation nearby. At first she wanted to run, things that were unnatural tended to involve humans, and humans were best avoided at any costs, but when a quick investigation found little evidence of humans, her fear was overtaken by her curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving closer to investigate the strange rock formation, Natii found to her surprise that while it did indeed bear the unmistakable touch of humans, no humans had visited for a long time, certainly there was no evidence of them beyond the rocks themselves. Her curiosity as satisfied as it was likely to get, the tigress immediately began to search for somewhere to sleep, eventually finding a place where the roof of a building had fallen in, leaving beneath the rubble a hole just big enough for her to turn around in, and completely sheltered from the sun. weighing the find up against the probability of finding anything else as inviting, she decided that the hole would do nicely, and so crawled in, and despite being unable to get comfortable, eventually drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Natii attempts to push her body out of the crevice she had slept in, but found much resistance to her movements though she made some progress. A few more three legged shoves pushes her out and into the early morning light. Natii ponders how she could fit in at night but not in the morning as her leg uncramps, when a glance at her side gives the unexpected answer. The scratches and slashes that had streaked her side were now healed to faint pink lines. Though startled by this, Natii has no time to think as her six day needs to be broken, and soon. She stalks off wishing for an early success. Midday produces a pair of very fat deer with seem to be thriving off of the lush grass and the absence of predators. Natii leaps attempting to hit the closest deer but she misjudged the needed jump and hits the deer with only her back paws though she does hit the seconded one with all four feet. After subduing the deer Natii turns to find the first stone dead on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii knows that it will be impossible to drag both deer back to the structure that she had dubbed \"The Temple\"  and difficult with only one, but her near staved state hates to leave any amount of meat to rot. She also knows that while she could most likely eat both deer she would need to sleep soon after, and be in no state to fight should an enemy appear, however unlikely. With a plan in mind Natii digs into the second deer, to keep the blood from pooling and giving away the element of surprise next time. With a bulging stomach and the deer down to the organs, she prods around for a moment, snatches the heart and eats it. With the first deer in her mouth Natii drags it back towards \"The Temple\". The tigress thanks everything that she had circled around the temple and only stood a half-hour or less away from relative safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii drags the deer to the front of \"The Temple\" and sits it, and herself down in the warm sun set to gorge when a glint from the shadows caches her eye. The tigress stands a stalks off to the shadows. The glint came from a pool of water that had gathered in a low spot at the edge of the shade and so she dips her head and drinks a few swallows of cool water. Natii drags the deer over to the edge of the sunshine and sits down with her head in reach of both deer and water. Natii then eats about half of the deer before stopping to drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sun low in the sky Natii finishes off the deer and drinks till she can drink no more.

A dark <i>silent</i> plain what was more, she could hear not a sound around her, not the whisper of the breeze, not the insects chirruping in the non-existent grass, not the distant call of the night-flying birds and bats, nothing. Even more disturbing perhaps was the lack of light from the pitch-black sky, no stars, no moon, nor the fluffy texture of low-hanging cloud that would normally shield them from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering with uncertainty, Natii stepped forward, and felt odd, there was ground beneath her feet, but it was smooth, solid, hard, like rock, though when she tested it with her claws it didn't score like stone normally would have, nor make a sound. Thouroughly disconcerted, the tigress was unable to contain her alarm any longer, and asked \"is anyone there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, I am,</i> said a voice that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere, and seemed to be as much a thought in her head as a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who are you,\" Natii asked, turning her head to try to find who had spoken, \"<i>Where</i> are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My name is Banka-Mundi,</i> came the voice again, <i>As for where I am, in this realm that question has no meaning, I am everywhere.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This</i> realm,\" Natii asked, \"this place is different from the normal world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It is,</i> Banka-Mundi replied, <i>That realm you call the 'normal world' we refer to as the Mortal Realm, and this is the Shadow Realm, it is where we higher powers can best touch the minds of you lower creatures.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lower creatures,\" Natii asked, obviously disdaining the term, \"and what are you? Gods?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That definition will suffice,</i> Banka-Mundi said, <i>Though it is better to refer to us as </i>higher beings<i>, we disdain the term </i>gods<i> for the childish, petulant connotations humans give it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you doing here,\" Natii asked, \"and for that matter, what am <i>I</i> doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am here because I am always here, now,</i> Banka-Mundi replied, <i>and you are here because you are asleep within the bounds of my temple.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this <i>is</i> all a dream then,\" Natii said, sounding relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, this is the Shadow Realm,</i> Banka-Mundi said, <i>You may describe it as a dream, but this is more real, as real as anything you've ever experienced; more real in fact, since your own mortal senses are fewer and more limited than they need be.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't feel any more real,\" Natii said, \"it does feel odd though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You are not yet experienced enough here to understand,</i> Banka-Mundisaid, <i>with time and exposure you will learn, eventually.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in the meantime,\" Natii asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And in the meantime I must limit my expression to terms you can understand,</i> Banka-Mundi replied, <i>as demeaning and crude as such measures are.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demeaning,\" Natii asked sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Had you known Spiritsong we could have concluded this 'conversation' in much less than a moment,</i> Banka-Mundi replied,  <i>that you don't is only to be expected, but this 'language' is slow and crude.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're here to lord it over us mortals,\" Natii asked not even trying to keep the irritation out of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No,</i> Banka-Mundi said, <i>You are wounded and weak, and will eventually starve without help.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're offering me help are you,\" Natii asked, trying to hide her eagerness beneath her irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In a manner of speaking, yes</i> Banka-Mundi said, <i>although it is more of a deal, for I too am weak, and crippled.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the deal,\" Natii asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I cannot heal your wounds,</i> Banka-Mundi said, <i>But I can provide for you so that it does not matter.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in exchange,\" Natii asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And in exchange you must take me to the humans</i> Banka-Mundi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No chance,\" Natii said, \"Not in a million years am I going near those monsters again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Then we are both of us doomed</i> Banka-Mundi said, <i>I beg you to reconsider, if only for your own gain.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the humans,\" Natii asked, \"why d'you need them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Once, when they worshipped me, I was powerful,</i> the voice said, I could draw in whole herds, big herds that would be then penned and watered, or slaughtered and preserved, but no more, now I would struggle to draw in a single beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, <i>worshipped you</i>,\" Natii asked, \"I thought you said you weren't gods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We are not,</i> Banka-Mundi replied, <i>but worship does make us more powerful, in a way you are too ignorant yet to understand.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, you want me to take you back to the humans so you can get big again,\" Natii said, \"what's in it for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Survival,</i> Banka-Mundi replied, <i>or the chance of survival anyway, against the certainty of death</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how much of a chance are you giving me?\" Natii asked, \"You've already told me even one beast's a struggle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To draw a beast in is hard,</i> Banka-Mundi said, <i>to make a beast, blind to your presence is easier, easier still if it's alone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to need a bit more help than that,\" Natii said, \"I wouldn't have a clue where to start looking for prey out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can help with that also,</i> Banka-Mundi said, <i>now, the deal?</i></span></div></div>",

Sighing, the tigress said, \"Okay friend, it's a deal, but if they try to hurt me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You doubt that I will keep my word?</i> Banka-Mundi said <i>You obviously still have no inkling of what a boon this will be for me, and for you as well</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tigress sniffed where she sat on solid darkness.  Rubbing her whiskers with a paw, she said. \"And don't you know that insulting people isn't a very good way to earn their trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence for a few moments, though the sudden prickling feeling on her back seemed to indicate to the tigress divine disapproval.  Eventually Banka-Mundi said, <i>Simply communicating in this manner is insulting in itself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Natii could say anything, the goddess continued, <i>But you agree to help me obtain new worshippers?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026In return for my survival.\"  said Natii.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Survival for the both of us</i>. Said the hidden entity.  <i>\u2026And more besides.  Even now I have some power left to me.  It will only grow as the old faith spreads once more.  You should be honored to be a vessel for a being the likes of I.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii slanted her eyes.  The large cat was still having doubts about the ability of this bodiless fiend to safeguard her life.  But then it was hardly as if she had anything to lose right?  However the spirit had stumbled onto a topic which piked her interest.  \"So you're telling me you're going to give me powers?\"  The tigress's tail lashed behind her, \"What sort of powers exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hidden voice hesitated for only a moment.  <i>A couple I already described, drawing in creatures from the wild and rendering prey deaf and dumb to your presence.  But that is hardly the extent of my prowess. </i> Banka-Mundi elaborated. <i>You will gain other abilities once my strength begins to return to me.  Natii was - perhaps a little immaturely - imagining herself flying over the tops of the trees and viewing the world as a bird does when the goddess continued.  You will have to relinquish control to me on occasion, of course.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't sound good.  \"What do you mean by that?\"  asked the large cat, still futilely studying the featureless dark of this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a whisper of a sigh before Banka-Mundi spoke. <i> I mean just what I say.  At times, I will need to act through you and when that happens, you will need to surrender your body to me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean possess me\u2026\"  Natii shivered a little at what she was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Semantics</i>.  said Banka-Mundi <i> It is what it is, no matter what you call it and this is how things must be if you want to survive.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Natii was not so sure she wanted anymore to deal with this invisible Banka-Mundi.  She turned her head around, but the area behind her was just as black and impenetrable as the region in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she were able to sense the tiger's hesitation, Banka-Mundi spoke in a less harsh voice.  <i>It is not such a large thing that I ask.  Your fleshy container is not you, certainly.  You shall not lose yourself.  And I swear that this will only happen on occasions when a display of power is necessary.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii frowned.  By the moment, she felt increasingly as if she were dealing with a demon; and really, if the surroundings were anything to go on, Natii was not entirely sure she wasn't.  \"And how do I know you will keep your promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very air quivered and Natii realized that Banka-Mundi was chuckling.  <i>You must think highly of yourself, little hunter, if you think I would be interested in occupying such an insignificant little vessel such as yours.  No you shouldn't fear me desiring to displace you\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air continued to vibrate in the goddess's mirth and Natii did indeed feel small and insignificant.  She looked at her paws and could at least see those clearly.  If it was an act, it was a good one, the tigress had to admit.  The very idea of taking over her body seemed to have the goddess quite amused as the atmosphere continued to thrum.  The tigress didn't know whether to feel comforted or insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the vibrations dissipated, the goddess spoke again, <i>Do you accept offer then, little hunter?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii shut her eyes and considered for several long moments.  The realization she came to at last that outweighed all other concerns was the fact that she didn't want to die.  \"I do accept, Banka-Mundi.  However I reserve the right to cancel our deal if I find it displeasing in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a low grumbling, like the grinding of rocks the size of mountains on the other side of the world.  <i>Hmm\u2026  I will accept your condition, but only if you agree to let me know ahead of time, so that I may consider how best to end our arrangement.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded fine to Natii.  \"Very well,  we have an agreement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark void surrounding Natii seemed to brighten, the tigress took this to mean that the goddess was pleased.  <i>Good\u2026</i>  drawled Banka-Mundi.  <i>Now sleep, you will have a long day ahead of you tomorrow\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, it felt like the ground was swept out from under her paws and Natii was falling, if one can fall without a breeze, that is.  After a few moments, it felt more as if she were floating than falling, a warm nothingness cradling her body.  The tigress felt fatigue crawl up her spine and throughout her body and she stretched and then curled up.  Sleep took her then and in her mind's eye, Natii saw herself as a tiny golden mote in a vast sea of darkness she hadn't the least comprehension of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii awoke slowly at first, groaning at the aches and pains in her body, then suddenly all of was replaced by an agonising burning in her flank that awoke her very quickly.  Rubbing her burned flank against the roughness of the stone felt as if someone were taking a blade to her flesh. Struggling to manouver herself in the confined space, the pain stirred her to greater speed, but the tigress attained numerous more scrapes and bumps in getting out of the tight hole. Checking herself over in the light of mid-morning, once she was out in the courtyard again, she was rather displeased to note the numerous oozing wounds her exit from the hole had opened, especially where her fur had been singed away. That was the last time she'd sleep in there, she decided, until her wounds were rather better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent a good long while licking herself, though she had to go gingerly on the wounds as even the roughness of her own tongue was often too much for them.  As she groomed herself, Natii could not help wondering if everything she had experienced last night had been nothing more than a fever dream.  She was certainly too wounded to dismiss the possibility.  After grooming herself thoroughly, however, her thoughts turned naturally to food and her long empty belly.  That was when she received confirmation for last night's vision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was only there long enough for the shock to take effect, then it vanished and became again a distant shining. \"Good grief\" she said \"did I just-\" <i>did I just see that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It can come as a shock the first time, can't it</i> Banka-Mundi said sympathetically <i>don't worry, you'll get used to it with experience.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii was silent for a good while, then finally asked <i>can I use down there in the real world?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In the Mortal Realm, yes you can</i> Banka-Mundi replied <i>it's harder though, because your physical senses will constantly interrupt you concentration.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But I could use it to find prey couldn't I</i> Natii asked <i>I mean, if I really needed to.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It would take a great deal of time</i> Banka-Mundi <i>there are ways of speeding it up though, which I will tech you eventually.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not yet</i> Natii asked, disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, not yet</i> Banka-Mundi replied <i>there is still much you need to learn before you can make proper sense of it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh</i> Natii said <i>well, what sort of things do I need to learn?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You first need to learn how to control your Shadowsight</i> Banka-Mundi replied <i>and then how to sense distance while doing it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, practice makes perfect I suppose</i> Natii said <i>could you give me something a bit less, energetic to practice on though?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I will endeavour to do so</i> Banka-Mundi replied, then after a few moments, said <i>do you see that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I think so, yes</i> Natii replied, noticing a slightly duller white dot a way away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good,</i> Banka-Mundi  said, <i>now focus on it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Natii several moments to understand what she needed to do, then the stone appeared in front of her, this time a foot from her muzzle, <i>am I...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, you're doing it</i> Banka-Mundi replied <i>and quite well too considering how little practice you've had.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It almost looks like I could touch it</i> Natii said unintentionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why don't you try to then</i> Banka-Mundi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\" Natii said, her concentration suddenly disrupted \"did-\" <i>did you just say something?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes</i> Banka-Mundi replied <i>you said it almost looked like-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I didn't say that did I</i> Natii asked <i>I hadn't meant to say it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You will learn</i> Banka-Mundi said <i>and now, the stone again, and this time try to touch it, you may be surprised.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to take her mind off her recent embarrasment, Natii concentrated on the stone, calling it up much more easily now that she knew vaguely what to do. For a few moments the tigress held it there, and then inquisitively, reached out a paw gasping as she felt its rough surface beneath her paw. The surprise, shock even, was enough to disrupt her concentration, but as the rock snapped back to its distant point, she was left with the memory of the roughness \"did I-\" <i>did I just...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, you did</i> Banka-Mundi said <i>easy, wasn't it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But, but it's so far away</i> Natii said <i>how could I have...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Distance here is not as limiting as in the Mortal Realm</i> Banka-Mundi explained <i>it still exists, yes, but there is nothing physically preventing you from crossing many miles in a single leap.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But, how can that be</i> Natii asked <i>I don't understand.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You will, eventually</i> Banka-Mundi said calmly was silent for a moment, then added <i>or perhaps not so eventually, you see this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Do I s-where'd that come from</i> Natii asked, recoiling at the large white stone that had suddenly appeared beside her <i>did you create this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In a sense, yes</i> Banka-Mundi replied <i>although </i>create<i> is not quite the right word, nevertheless, climb it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why</i> Natii asked warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It will help you to, understand</i> Banka-Mundi said <i>go on, it's quite safe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain, but at least slightly reassured, Natii did as Banka-Mundi instructed leaping easily onto the stone <i>now what?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now, focus on the other stone</i> Banka-Mundi instructed <i>bring it near, and then jump to it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jump to it</i> Natii exclaimed <i>But it's so far-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No</i> Banka-Mundi said <i>it is as near as you imagine it to be, as I explained.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii was silent for a moment, then said uncertainly <i>well, here goes.</i> Drawing the other stone close with her mind, the tigress moved it to what she thought was a reasonable distance, and then bracing herself, leapt. There was a moment's uncertainty as she landed, and then she looked around for the rock she'd just come from, now a white dot on the horizon <i>did I just...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, you did</i> Banka-Mundi replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but\" <i>that's impossible</i> Natii stammered, more than a little frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It is only because you perceive it to be</i> said Banka-Mundi <i>in the Shadow Realm, perception is everything, If you perceive a great distance to be short, then it is.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii shook her head in confusion, and said <i>but that's not how things work in the real world!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe was a slight pause and then Banka-Mundi spoke <i>you would be surprised, young one. And again, this place is just as real as the Mortal Realm, and in some ways less odd.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Natii was still staring at the distant white rock on the horizon, the one she had been sitting on just moments before. The world seemed to be spinning. <i>Banka-Mundi...I...</i> Natii managed despite the sudden vertigo <i>I-I'm not sure...I can do this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All things in time</i> Banka Mundi said, <i>but now it is time for you to return to the Mortal Realm</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn those words Natii, overcome with dizziness, and fell from her perch on the white rock. The ground didn't break her fall, however, she just kept tumbling down...down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sleep... Natii...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii drew in a breath with a gasp. The air was warm and humid and stank of crumbling masonry. Wincing, the tigress again felt the many aches and pains coursing through her damaged body. She was awake, alive again. It had all been just a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr had it? Natii crawled forth from her hole and sat her haunches down on some smooth, mossy stone, carved long, long ago by human hands; humans who had once worshipped a goddess named Banka-Mundi. The tigress felt the hollowed stones under her paws and closed her eyes. She exhaled and tried to remember what that place she'd visited in her dream had felt like, tried to recall the feeling. It was hard because of the pain she was in, but she tried anyway, not knowing if what she was doing was foolish or not. She breathed in. <i>Banka-Mundi</i> Natii asked in her mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natii waited for a response... and waited.  She let out her breath and rubbed her eyes with a paw, though reaching up pained the burns she had on her back.  Still, the tigress felt this was important enough to try again.  She calmed her breathing, closed her eyes and focused, bringing her mind back to that dark, still place.  <i>Banka-Mundi...</i> she thought into that blackness in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was so faint and indistinct, Natii thought she might have been imagining it.  But she chose not to believe the voice was a figment of her imagination. <i>Little Hunter...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this supernatural being was strange and the things she had shown her were strange, Natii could not help but feel uplifted at this small measure of success and validation of what she had experienced while she was asleep.  \"Now you said you were going to help me.\"  said Natii aloud to the empty ruins.  She'd taken three breaths before she realized her error.  She swallowed and again tried to focus her mind, but now that she was awake, she found that the black, silent place was hard to find amid the buzzing of insects, the light behind her eyelids and the pains infecting her body. <i>You said you were going to help me.</i>  Thought Natii at the sickly goddess.  She sounded demanding, even in her own mind, but being awake reminded the tigress what a grim situation she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Natii was not sure if she was imagining the voice or not, but the blackness seemed to answer, <i>East... east...</i>  The voice gave the direction and furthermore, Natii sensed that the goddess's destination was not far, quite close in fact.  That was good.  Natii did not think she had the strength anymore for much wandering.  The injured tigress got crookedly to her paws and limped across the green stones.  An archway led out the intended direction and into the jungle proper.  It was twilight and the beginning of a new day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as she might, Natii could not summon up Banka-Mundi's voice again as she walked.  But she didn't stop or concentrate too hard, instead trying to make as good a time as possible, so it didn't bother her much.  In fact, Natii was a little relieved to again have the privacy of her mind restored so she could dwell properly on the goddess's proposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGods were not beings to be trifled with, either your own or others' and even though Banka-Mundi had said she was not one, she still bore an incredible resemblance.  And furthermore, she desired worshippers.  That scared even the large cat.  She was no priest.  She had no idea what she was getting herself into.  It was like leaping into a gulf without checking to see how deep it was first, or if there was water below to catch her.  The cautious side of her just wanted nothing more to do with Banka-Mundi or shadow realms or the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet Natii limped as she walked and cuts and bruises and burns ravaged her once beautiful coat.  She hadn't had anything to eat in a week... and she was starting to feel the deathly weakness infiltrate her body.  How could she hunt like this?  Her common sense told her she was not long for this world.  The sense of impending doom wanted to make Natii cry.  She'd never thought the world fair, but that didn't make her anymore prepared to accept her fate as a ruined hunter.  \"I don't want to die! Damnit!\" she wept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tigress paused to rest, her injured leg was hurting too much and the depression threatened to overwhelm her.  Although the jungle was noisy and busy with life all around her, the tigress could see nothing but her own death ahead of her.  And it was just as Banka-Munid had said.  Accept her proposal or die...  strong incentive indeed.  But still, in Natii's experience no one ever gave away something for free, and she was sure that a being as old and obviously wise as the goddess of hunting and fertility would benefit the greater from the bargain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii closed her eyes and leaned against the damp bark, waiting for the ache to fade.  She wondered what a half-dead god could do anyways.  She doubted that even she could save such a wretched cat as she.  As Natii relaxed however, the blank slate of her mind seemed to peel away, revealing a rippling image.  It was an elderly chital, lying down amid some broken branches and a patch of nettles.  She looked stringy and thin, but still quite delicious.  <i>She is dying.</i> came the familiar not-voice.  <i>she is waiting for a hunter to deliver her peace.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii was already struggling to rise.  Not only was she hungry now, but the matter had suddenly become one of honor as much as an easy meal.  It was a sacred understanding that the hunter was to usher her prey into the next stage of rebirth, especially when that animal was in pain.  Natii tried to still her mind, <i>Where is she?  Where...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Natii heard nothing and the tigress was driven half mad by a desperate need to find the ailing deer.  She set out, listening, looking and sniffing the breeze.  She was sure that the goddess would not have shown her the vision if this needy creature was not nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her leg hurting her at each step, it seemed futile to search, however luck seemed to be with her... or else another force entirely.  Natii had set out in the right direction and she was able to pick up the chital's scent when she crossed it.  It only took a few seconds to know which way the old deer had gone.  Natii followed the scent of her prey's footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tigress pushed her way through brush and brambles and along the way, she was filled with the sense that the chital was choosing a place to die.  Natii pushed herself, although the brambles made the going slower and more painful for the bigger tigress.  The scent of the chital laced through all the nettles ahead of her.  And then suddenly, there she was, just as Natii had seen in her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chital lifted her head to look at Natii, her eyes watery and filled with even more pain than the tigress herself.  The big cat understood somehow that the small deer was dying of parasites in her gut eating her from the inside.  She was ready and she was grateful that someone had come.  Natii took a few steps forward and descended on the chital.  She took her neck in her jaws and broke it with a sharp twist of her head; the chital's spine felt as insubstantial as a twig.  When the deer went limp, Natii finally felt at ease.  Her duty was complete.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii let go and heaved a sigh.  The tigress felt approval from someone distant and yet not far away at all, and something more; mutual understanding.  Natii crouched and began to eat.  Although they had not spoken, she would not soon forget the chital who had saved her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was not a whole lot of meat on her, though the tigress was not complaining.  The disease had mostly consumed the chital before Natii had arrived.  Still, it was more than she'd had and the hunter was grateful.  However, the sight of the putrid innards which filled the chital's distended abdomen disheartened the tigress; even the liver was fouled.  The skeletal muscle and the hide and brain would have to do.  She spent three hours cleaning the corpse of everything eatable and at the end of it all, she rested on a comfortably distended stomach.  Her meal was good to keep her for the next day and a half, though she could go three if she had to, Natii supposed.  Right now, all she wanted was another long nap.  She'd only been up a few hours, but her body was hurting her and her full tummy was making her drowsy.  Natii didn't feel lazy, it was simply the way of cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even caring that she was bedding down in a small clearing in a patch of brambles, Natii curled up to nap.  As she faded, her thoughts were on the faceless goddess who had brought her this boon and what she might ask in return...  Secretly, Natii hoped that Banka-Mundi would not be able to pull her into the shadow realm outside the ground of her temple, but didn't put much stock in that particular hope.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natii dreamed of her home territory. It had been a lush place in her mother's time, or so she'd told her. Every year the river would swell so wide that one could barely see across it, but with it, brought enormous bounty for every creature. The jungles of West Bengal are vast and Natii had just a tiny portion along side the western bank of a great river, but it was her portion. Her mother had told her than their line had dwelled in the area for untold generations. It was good land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or at least it had been. Tall apes with loose, often smelly outer layers draped across their bodies came. They'd always been there and Natii had heard tales from tigers passing north through their territory; horrible stories. They told of demons who knocked down the jungle, laying the earth bare and filling it with segmented pools for the growing of rice or else tempting open pastures teeming with fattened cattle which seem just ripe for the picking. But there was a curse across all the human lands and a tiger, no matter how formidable was ever safe there. Just prowling in the open could result in one being struck dead on the spot. A terrible crash like thunder was the only warning. They told Natii that if she ever saw a human she should run, especially if they have skin as pale as the moon, as pale as death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii had scoffed at such ghost stories and her mother had shooed these traveling tigers on through their territory. Both mother and child were far too busy with the business of hunting and maintaining their territory to pay any heed to such fanciful tales. Her mother had learned the hard way the validation of the stories...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wounded tigress tossed and turned in the night. She didn't want to think of the fire nor the destruction. With a deep breath and a relaxing of her spine, she changed the dream, escaping into the deeper past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii found herself sunning on a rock which was all too familiar to her. It was her favorite sunning place both because a fallen tree had opened up a great hole in the usually omnipresent canopy above and because the shape of the rock was extremely comfortable and usually dry. She felt the warm touch of the sun on her back like it was new and she let out a sigh, stretching her body languidly over the firm surface of the rock cupping her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii was only an adolescent, so her mother was out hunting. Janani had gone west, away from the river, she she was likely searching for jungle boar in the dips between the near hills, it was their rutting season after all. They would be incautious and fat to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tigress rested her chin on a small flat prominance in the stone. She wasn't reliving this memory, she remained aware of the next 18 months of her life and the great amount of ruin which had come upon them so suddenly. She wished that she wasn't. She wished that she could forget that this was a dream and choose to believe that nothing bad had happened. Natii felt like weeping for the beauty of the green ferns and tall trees surrounding her, but the dream lent her a measure of comfort. She was in the past, and those things didn't have to be here if she didn't want them to. And Natii didn't. They were all too fresh in her waking mind already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii was interupted in her brooding by a breaking twig. She perked her head up to see a newcoming entering the small clearing around the hulking mass of the fallen jungle titan. Natii got to her knees and crouched on her rock. It'd take a foolish creature indeed to stumble upon a hungry tiger, either that or unlucky. It didn't really matter at this point. The tigress's pulse quicked when she saw the shape of the deer and she licked her chops. But then she saw who it was, and <i>remembered</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii was stunned to see the chital that she had killed and eaten not more than a few hours ago. <i>\"Why is she here in my dream?\"</i> Thought Natii curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the Chital spoke in a quiet, unassuming voice. \"Is this your home?\" she lifted her head slightly to take in the surroundings. \"It's quite beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling confused at the presence of someone she only just \"met\" in her dream, all the tigress could say was, \"You don't belong here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" the Chital said, \"but I wanted to thank you for the kindness you showed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kindness...\" Natii asked, turning her head uncomfortably, \"but I killed you for myself, for what little of you I could still eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chital did shift her front hooves a little in the soil, but admitted, \"That's nature.  I don't hold you accountable for doing what you have to to survive, anymore than I imagine the grass blames me for eating it.  Besides, I was in terrible pain.  What you did for me was a mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii relaxed and then sat on her haunches, relishing the lack of pain.  \"That's certainly an enlightened point of view.\"  she said and then lifted a paw, \"And while I'm grateful that you're not holding anything against me, I can't help still wonder why exactly you've come here... if, in fact, you are not just a figment of my imagination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown crossed the small deer's face and then she charged.  Too shocked to move at first, Natii had to ward off blows from sharp, light hooves when the chital reared up and started kicking her with her front hooves.  The tigress leaped back from the assault and onto her rock.  She growled and was about to reciprocate the attack when the chital relaxed.  She was not out of breath and said, looking up into the tiger's eyes, \"Would a figment of your imagination do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii licked her forearms where she's received the kicks.  The little nicks and scratches did sting.  \"I suppose not...\" she said between pulls with her wide, scratchy tongue.  \"But still... why have you come?  Don't you have better things to do now that you're dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small deer back up a couple paces and the tigress looked at her curiously.  She seemed uncomfortable all of a sudden.  \"I did... I mean I do, but...\"  the chital sniffed, \"You were right here and I felt I ought to do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii crossed her front paws and rested her head on them, looking down on the chital from the high rock.  \"And what exactly is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I should... warn you.\" the Chital replied, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warn me,\" Natii asked, lifting her head in surprise, \"of what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of something coming from the west,\" the Chital replied, \"I don't know what it was exactly, it seemed pretty weak, but I am sure it was trying to come for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In the west? But in the west lay...</i> Natii thought about this, surely the goddess, already so weak within her temple that she could barely be heard during waking was utterly incapable of spreading her influence this far. Nevertheless, the thought sent a slight chill up her spine. \"You stopped it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so yes,\" the Chital replied, \"It sure didn't seem to like the territory of your mind.  It stuck to the shadows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it is <i>I</i> who must thank <i>you</i>,\" Natii said, \"and now I wish you safe travel on your journey, wherever that leads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do not wish me to stay around?\" the Chital asked again shifting her hooves in the loam, \"Whatever it was that came for you may try to come again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatii considered this, if indeed it was Banka-Mundi that had tried to come for her then there was no <i>may</i> about it, but now that she knew that something had tried to come for her she'd be ready.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She almost walked past it, sitting there in the window of the antiques shop, but just as she was drawing abreast of it, the light caught the gold, making it glitter, and catching her eye. Stopping to look, the young woman saw that the piece must be new, it looked unusually fresh compared to the sun-faded goods in the rest of the window. About six inches high, it seemed to be a cross between a 'fat old man' buddha statue and one of those stone-age fertility idols. Her curiosity piqued, she decided to enter the shop and enquire about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bell tinkled as Katie opened the door and entered the shop, which drew the attention of the old lady behind the counter, \"oh, hello miss, and how can I help you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering about that statue in the window,\" Katie replied, \"it looks new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is,\" the old lady replied, \"I was given it only last week, young man came in, purporting to be from the Luckmann estate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Luckmann estate,\" Katie asked, surprised, the Luckmanns were millionaires, as rich as croesus, to think that even the tiniest possession had ended up in this dead-end shop...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what he said, yes,\" the old lady replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie thought about it for a moment, then asked, \"how much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hundred,\" the old lady replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's eyes almost boggled at the price, this little old lady wanted a hundred bucks for a little statue she all but admitted she'd been given?

Cursing at whoever had been careless enough not to put their rubbish in a bin properly, Katie was about to screw it up when she realised it was a five dollar bill. She glanced around to see if anyone was chasing it, and, spotting no-one there, shoved it in her handbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Katie was passing by a lot bookshop. Normally she'd have passed right by it, but then she remembered the bill she'd just picked up, and decided to chance her luck with a couple of scratchcards. Picking 3 cards at random, she stood at the booth and scratched, the first card was a bust, the second got her all of another five bucks, but the last...It took her a moment to realise it, but when she did she almost yahooed, she'd never won a damn thing out of any competition before, and now she'd won a thousand bucks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling beatifically as she stepped out of the shop, Katie decided to treat herself, after all, she may have just spent eighty bucks on that statue, but it had sure paid off. Stepping out of the shop, she spotted a cancer-society charity stall, normally she wouldn't have bother with such, sure medical research was expensive, but the FDA was funding them wasn't it? Still, she'd just won big, so why not give some away. Pulling out her purse though, she was dismayed to find a real gap in her small-change she had just over half-a-buck in nickels and dimes, and then nothing right up to a lone twenty-buck note and some fifty-bucks. Pity, she wouldn't have minded giving as few bucks, but a whole twenty-note was a bit much really...</span></div></div>",

For a while, Katie tried to ignore her gut, but within a few minutes it was almost unbearable, and she was forced to give in and head for the nearest source of food, which happened to be a McDonalds. Normally, she'd have steered clear of such a place, but right now the hunger pangs were just too great, so she went in instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an agonising few minutes wait, but eventually Katie was at the front of the queue, and the girl behind the counter asked, \"what would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just a filet-o-fish,</i> Katie thought, but somehow it came out as, \"A Big Mac thanks.\" Suddenly, alarm bells started ringing in her head, <i>I don't want that, I can't possibly finish-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And would you like anything else,\" the girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No!</i> though Katie, but again, her mouth seemed to have a mind of its own, \"sure, large fries, large coke and a fudge sundae thanks.\" Before she'd even reached the end of the order she'd zoned out, coming to only when her body, apparently operating on automatic, put the loaded tray down on the table, and seated itself in the booth. Surveying the food, she suddenly felt a touch queasy, there was no way she could finish even the burger, let alone the other stuff. The concerns weren't taken up by the rest of her though, as her body, still intent on doing its own thing, began the meal with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie wasn't normally one to count calories, but she was doing so now, and the numbers were just too big. This didn't seem to concern her body though, which had slowed noticeably since the beginning of the meal, but still seemed intent of finishing every last morsel, which it did, though not before the 20 minute mark. Finally, once the meal was over, whatever had been holding her body in its gluttonous sway finally vanished, though this wasn't much of a comfort, since the size of the meal was such that she couldn't do much more than sit there and rub her over-full stomach, and wonder just what the heck had come over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Katie was finally comfortable enough that she could get up, and so she did, and headed straight for the ladies room, hoping she could purge what she'd just eaten. The hope was quickly dashed though, no matter how much she tried, she couldn't get a single morsel of her meal to come back up. Afterwards, she decided to return home, partly so she could put the statue away, and partly so that she could try to figure out what on earth was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie could sense a subtle wrongness the moment she stepped in the door, but couldn't put her finger on it just at the moment. Going to her bedroom, she cleared some room on the dresser for the statue, and then went down to get some antacids. Taking a couple of pills, she went into the kitchen, meaning only to get a glass of water, but her body, again with a mind of its own, opened the cupboard to grab a jumbo packet of potato chips, then hesitated, <i><b>that shouldn't be there!</b></i>. She, or rather, her body didn't hesitate for long though, grabbed the bag, and a bottle of coke out of the fridge, and loafed down on the sofa and clicked on the TV. As her body opened the bag, she zoned out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to after some time she found...</span></div></div>",

Time wasn't Katie's only concern though, for no longer had she she begun to wonder of the time than her stomach rumbled, announcing its hunger to the world. As before, she tried to ignore the grumbling, but once again, within minutes, she was overcome, forced to go into the kitchen to find something, anything to fill the yearning void within her. In her search she completely missed the fact that the trash bag was now rather fuller than it should have been, most of the extra space being food wrappers. She searched for a few moments then selected a packet of chocolate-chip cookies - which her cassandric inner voice told her shouldn't have been there - and another bottle of coke before settling back down on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore hours passed as Katie nibbled, first on the cookies, then on another packet of chips that had magically appeared in cupboard. Cookies and chips wouldn't be enough to sustain her though, and so later, her body picked up the phone and ordered a pizza while her mind drifted fitfully, returning to reality only when the delivery boy knocked on the door. Once again, she had to endure the uncomfortable, no, downright scary situation of her body acting apparently of its own volition, scoffing food down like there was no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Family sized pizza was half-gone when Katie was finally given control of her body again. Storing the rest of the pizza in the fridge, she went into the lounge and turned on the TV again and flipped through the channels, before switching to a romantic movie. Zoning out once again, as the minutes ticked away, she came to just at the end of the movie to find one hand clasped around yet another bottle of coke while the other was finishing off a packet of biscuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified at what was happening, but unable to do anything about it, Katie resigned herself to her fate, and watched her body return to the kitchen, drop the now empty bottle into the trash, and the bowl into the sink and then, to her disgust, grab two of the remaining slices of the pizza out of the fridge and scoff them down. After a quick trip to the bathroom to do her ablutions, she got into her pyjamas, which seemed a little looser than they should have been, especially given her recent binging, and climbed into bed - which like the other furniture in the house was now larger and more expensive - and was asleep within minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie awoke to the sound of her stomach grumbling...</span></div></div>",

For a few minutes though, Katie lay there, trying to get her senses back, had she dreamed all of that yesterday, or had she really eaten a feast at McDonalds, and then half a family pizza for dinner? And what about that dream? Strangely, the dream had seemed as real as her other memories, despite the fact that, with the cave and jungle and feast and things, there was no possibly way it could have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust remembering the dream almost seemed to take her back there; <i>Katie brushed away a hanging vine and wiped her forehead, why had she agreed to go on this crazy mission in the first place, surely there couldn't be anything worth finding out here. Nevertheless she had agreed, so a good idea to make the best of it she thought and grabbing her water-bottle, she took a long drag, before continuing on. Hours must have passed she was sure when she finally came upon the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, she was staggering, she'd taken another drag on her water-bottle some time before, but in this humidity it did no good, the sweat just stayed there, wetting her clothes. Still, she'd made it, if this was it, so now all she had to do was grab the statue and she'd be out of here. Moving into the cave, she saw the statue sitting there, and reached out for it-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-and suddenly found herself sprawled on the ground, no, it was too hard to be ground, it felt like stone, but not as cold, what on earth- \"Hello young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What,</i> Katie thought mussily, <i>who-</i> \"h-hello, wh-who's there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" came the voice, rich and full, \"and now, so are you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around for the speaker, Katie suddenly saw her, a fat woman - no, beyond fat, beyond even obese really, the woman was a monster - sitting on a stool in a Greek style that she vaguely remember from history was called a curule, \"wh-who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am called, in your language, Fertility\" the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fertility,\" Katie asked, rolling over and standing up, \"what sort of name is that?\" As she continued to stare the scene just got odder, not only was the floor hard but not cold, the cave, or wherever she was now, faded into blackness quickly, except for where the obese woman was sitting, which seemed to be spotlighted, though despite looking she couldn't spot where the light was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a description as much as a name,\" the woman said, \"and a description of what I do as much as what I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI-I don't understand,\" Katie stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you wouldn't,\" the woman said, and stood up, a move which , Katie saw was a bit of a struggle for the woman, but not nearly as much as she would have thought it would be. Once she was standing, the woman came towards the archaeologist in a confident manner that made the thinner woman back off a bit and raise her hands protectively. \"Don't worry,\" she said, \"I won't hurt you,\" and then reached for and undid the buttons on Katie's jacket one after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the third button, Katie - who until then had been just standing there too shocked to move - came to her senses and grabbed the fat woman's wrists to try to stop her going on, but was surprised to find that this didn't even slow the woman down, \"what the heck are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You no longer need those fancy clothes,\" the woman said to Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather keep them on if it's all the same to you,\" Katie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish,\" the woman said, withdrew her hands, and looked Katie up and down, \"although how much longer you'll be able to do so is debatable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Katie said, baffled, what are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me show you,\" the woman said, and waved her hand. Katie whirled as the scene behind her changed from blackness to a grass hut, well it looked sort of what a grass hut would have looked like anyway, had it been enlarged to the size of a football stadium. There was a table around the outside, and sitting so close they were almost touching were a row of women almost the same size as this 'fertility'. in the centre were a group of people, both men and women, cooking, while another group were constantly ferrying loaded plates of food to the table and taking away the empty ones to be refilled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, realisation dawned, \"you make women fat,\" Katie said \"you're going to make <i>me</i> fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What greater show of fertility is there than a woman with a wealth of sustenance,\" the woman said, and waved her hand towards the nearest bench, where an empty space had appeared, \"now, sit, and partake of fertility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I don't want-\" Katie began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no choice,\" the woman said suddenly grabbing Katie's wrist in her iron-firm grip and leading her over to the bench, where her other hand, placed on the young archaeologist\u2019s shoulder, forced her into the high-backed, but armless seat, then released her wrist and waved at the plate of food, \"now, eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at the plate, piled high with succulent fruits and rich meats, Katie had finally had enough, and so swung at the woman, although it didn't connect, as the woman moved like a snake, grabbing her wrist, and effortlessly bringing it around behind the back of the seat where she tied it, immobile, \"I will brook no disobedience young lady, now are you going to behave, or will I have to feed you like a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do your worst,\" Katie muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I will,\" the woman said, and grabbed Katie's other wrist and repeating the process, before reaching out for a large plump fruit the archaeologist couldn't identify, \"open wide.\" Instead, though, she was met by clenched teeth and tight lips. \"you know,\" she sighed, \"I had thought you'd start co-operating, it's in your best interests to.\" When this didn't have any outward effect on the defiant young woman, she frowned, and said, \"you leave me no choice then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Katie was bent double as the woman rammed her plump fist into the archaeologist\u2019s gut, and then before she could begin to recover, had something between her teeth and her head back leading back against the chair, \"'at are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you refuse to eat yourself,\" the woman said, almost pleasantly, but with a stern look on her face, \"I'm going to have to make sure you get enough to eat.\" Picking up the fruit again, she held it, two-handed, just over Katie's mouth, and <i>squeezed</i>. Katie almost drowned in that first rush of juice, but managed to drink most of it, just before the pulped remains of the fruit landed in her mouth. The next thing the woman dropped into Katie's mouth was a strip of meat that fertility cut into chunks with only her thumb-nail, and after that - by now the archaeologist was beginning to zone out - a large handful of sardine-like fish, one at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie shifted uncomfortably, her belt was cutting in under her overfull stomach - which unbeknownst to her wasn't full in the slightest, but which <b>had</b> become a large fleshy belly - and her bra too, strangely. The woman seemed to understand her discomfort, for she turned away from the food, and carefully undid all of the button's on Katie's jacket, reached in behind her back and undid the clip on her bra, bringing blessed relief as her now much fuller breasts surged forward, before moving on to her belt, chubby but, finger probing deeply in under the archaeologist\u2019s still </i>comparatively<i> small belly roll. After that came the ties on her wrists, and whatever it was pinning her head back to the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow finally free, Katie brought her hand forward, working over herself, examining her new, expanded form. She didn't have much time to examine it properly though, as the woman bent down beside and said, \"stand up.\" There was barely a moment's hesitation now, barely a twinkle in her eye to disagree with Fertility. The moment the once-archaeologist, now glutton had stood up, Fertility began to remove her clothing, starting with her jacket, then her t-shirt and finally her bra, before starting on her lower garments. When it was over, Fertility sat Katie down again, and said, \"now, eat.\" Again, there was barely a moment's hesitation, before the thinner - but still fat - woman began digging into the pile of food before her, a pile which had not reduced in the slightest, and in fact may well have grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of her mind, Katie kept abreast of the changes while her body ate, her belly pushing out further and further, taking up more and more of her lap, her love handles spreading out sideways, only prevented from drooping over her thighs by the fact that they too were expanding, as was her behind, pushing her gradually further and further up off the seat. Also, her breasts, arms and even face were expanding, filling out under the constant intake of food...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie drew her fingers down her face, she'd known dreams were weird, but that was one of the strangest she'd ever had. Still, she thought, as her stomach made its presence known again, no point in dwelling on a dream, and so she threw her bedclothes off and...</span></div></div>",

There were other growths as well, hips thighs, love handles...<i>everything</i> about her was huge now, even her fingers looked like sausages. Still in a state of shock, she struggled get to her feet, utterly unused to her new weight, and in ignorance of how to handle it. Eventually she managed to sit up, although this didn't help much, as it only confirmed in greater detail her extreme corpulence, her belly for example, now filled her lap - or as much of a lap as she had these days, since it weight was pushing her legs apart - to within a couple of inches of her knees, while her backside raised her several inches higher than she'd once sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings didn't get any easier for Katie once she was on her feet either, with her immense weight, her centre-of-balance was completely different, and it took her some time to get used to it, while all the while her stomach gurgled loudly. Groaning, and rubbing as much of her stomach as she could reach through her pendulous gut, she waddled slowly towards the kitchen, not even noticing that the house was now subtly different, a little more accommodating to her current size. Also going unnoticed for the time being were photos of pivotal moments in her life, now different, oh not so much in her early ones, though the young girl in them was now chubbier, but in her later ones, the difference was marked, where she had once been shot in uniformed glory for winning some cheer-leading prize or other, she was now in celebrating her academic achievements, top of her class in music, in cooking, in maths. The final pictures was perhaps the most markedly different, previously they had shown a progression of her through university, from earning a scholarship to her, in academic robes, holding a BBus, it was now of a chubbier - though still stick-like compared to what she was now - her, first holding a winning lotteries ticket, followed by some holiday snaps from Hawaii, and finally as she worked her way halfway through a BA, and through about a dozen dress sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, at the end of the hallway, Katie found herself confronted, not by, as she'd thought, the kitchen door, but by a staircase fitted with a stair-lift, though this was not a normal one, the near arm was gone, and the seat was extra wide and swivelled. The revelation of this, that she was now too large to even climb stairs, at least with any ease, set her panicking, though there was little she could do as her body, moving of its own volition seated itself in the lift and hit the down button. The ride was slow, which allowed the once slender woman to calm down and contemplate somewhat her new reality, though it didn't help much, as her panic just turned into a sort of morose amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she made it to the kitchen, Katie almost panicked once again, watching her body pull out a bowl, then put it back again, before going for the fridge for the remnants of yesterday's pizza, only now there weren't just two slices, there were ten, overlapped sloppily, and a folded up pizza-box in the rubbish. a quick rearrangement on a plate, and a zap in the microwave, and her body managed to scoff down 5 slices of pizza. It then stored the rest, and head for the bathroom, where she noticed with mounting alarm, the handrails by the toilet and the once bath with a showerhead and curtain that was now a bath, a modified spa as it turned out, with a set of fold-down steps. Suddenly her view was obscured as her arms, moving of their own volition, began to remove her night-dress...wait, night-dress? Hadn't she gone to be wearing pyjamas? Still, no use in fighting it she supposed, her body seemed to know what it was doing, even if she herself didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBathing took a lot longer than Katie was used to, although she supposed it was only natural - if she could call her new body natural - given the number of nooks and crannies she had to wash now. Finally it was over though, and so her body got out of the bath and picked up a bathrobe, a big one, and wrapped and tied it around itself, before hanging a towel off the still exposed bits. Inside, the young woman was almost weeping, this bathrobe was absolutely huge, and yet it wasn't even completely covering her. The view in the mirror came as even more of a shock, instead of smooth hair hanging below her shoulders, she now had scruffy hair so short it barely covered her ears, though this was a peripheral concern compared to her face, which, now far from the slender beauty it had been, had chipmunk cheeks wider than her temples and a globular second chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, it was over to the scales, which Katie noticed with horror, were big medical ones with the readout on a pole. Even more horrifying was the readout when she stood on them, the display whizzed past 200lb, and then past 300, and began to slow around 350, before coming to a stop on an incredible 387 lb. As she stared in shock at the numbers though, her mouth said, \"not bad, only 5 pounds so far this month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Five pounds this month,</i> Katie screamed silently, but it was only the twelfth, if just under two pounds a day 'wasn't bad'... Meanwhile, the body had started drying itself off, a process that took almost as long as washing, due once again to all the nooks and crannies the rolls created. Once dry, Katie's body went to select clothes for the day, selecting a light-blue, mid sleeved dress that looked big enough to have been made out of a bed sheet. Not that selecting what to wear was the hardest part of getting dressed, no, it was far harder to get in, and despite only wearing three basic articles, it still took over ten minutes, less than a minute of which was putting the dress itself on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Katie was left really in control of her own body for the first time that morning.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...Finally decided to take a look around, and catalogue, in her mind at least, every last change. The first change Katie noticed was the bed, gone was the simply adorned twin she'd slept on for several years now, to be replaced by a plushly adorned queen. Next was the mirror, which she hadn't spotted until now, it had once been a narrow thing, no more than a foot wide and about three-and-a-half feet high, it was now at least three, maybe four feet wide, and looked over four feet high, edged in floridly carved, silver-painted plaster, rather than plain wood. The room itself was much larger as well, previously her queen-sized bed would have left hardly an inch spare down the size, but now the room was more than wide enough to fit another queen by its side. Her wardrobe was also bigger, and an inbuilt one rather than an old, scratched-up standalone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up Katie waddled her way out into the hall and into the bathroom for no other reason than it was across from her bedroom door. This room was also much larger now, and lighter due to a sun-tube in the ceiling. The floor, formerly cheap linoleum, lifting around the edges, was now slip-resistant tiling while the walls had gone from painted drywall to floral-patterned glazed tiles. There was a shelf unit in the corner with towels on it, though like everything else, it was larger and more sumptuous. That seemed to be all, then she saw up on the wall the TV, a large one, and wondered why it was there opposite the tub, before moving over to investigate, and being surprised, and then slightly disgusted to find a control panel embedded in the side of the tub, evidently the new her was much richer than the old her, and a lot more lazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the Bathroom behind, she explored the rest of the upstairs as best she could, which consisted of another two bedrooms - each as large as sumptuous, though more spartan, than her own - and a separate washroom. She explored each in minor detail, not so much out of interest as out of disdain for having to use the stair-lift. Finally though, she could put it off no longer, and began to move towards the stairs, almost ignoring the pictures on the wall, before realising they were their, and stopping to look at them. Each picture she looked at brought a flood of memories with it, overlaying, but not, for now at least, overwriting her 'true' memories. The 'new' her proved to be different indeed, oh the same more-or-less in childhood, but diverging wildly as she hit high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new her was more academic, less athletic; more taken with emotion than appearance; more artistic, less efficient. The older she got, the more the two hers diverged. In reality, check, in her <i>old</i> reality, she'd managed, by dint of much effort to win a scholarship, which had seen her enter college and study, whereas the new her had been content to drift along, getting a job at a local cafe, and earning herself a respectable if not brilliant wage, and that's where she might have stayed, if she hadn't won big on the lottery, netting the extremely tidy sum of five million, four fifths of which she'd immediately stuck in the bank before trying to find ways of spending the last million. The first being a year's world travel, which had broadened both her horizons and her waistline, she'd never been good at minding her weight, and a year of luxury had cost her, as she went from merely a touch chubby to undeniably fat, or to put it mathematically from 142 pounds to 175.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey had also sparked Katie's wish to be an artist and under that desire she'd joined a university in search of a BA, but had kicked it before she finished, she'd had few friends due to her size - which over the year-and-a-half she was there had risen to over 250 pounds - and the degree hadn't been as interesting as she'd hoped, though it had given her a good grounding, which she'd used in setting up herself up as a freelance artist. She'd also, soon after, brought the house, using the rest of her 'spending million' and a bit of the 'bank millions'. Now she was made for life, she'd money enough to live on, and plenty besides, and was even able to afford a cleaner, June, to come around twice a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact today was one of those days, so Katie straightened up, and made her way over to the stairs, and while she knew she would probably need to use the lift most of the time, today she decided to get down the stairs on her own, a process made much harder - she realised to her dismay only <i>after</i> she'd triggered the lift to descend ahead of her - by the fact that the stairs now had no hand-rail, remembering belatedly that she'd had it removed after she'd had the lift installed. Nevertheless, she was determined no get down on her own, and so, with one hand against the wall, she started to descend. The journey to the bottom was painfully slow, much slower than the lift would have been, but also strangely rewarding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once she was down, Katie thought about further exploring the house, but decided against it...</span></div></div>",

Standing almost six feet at the shoulder, this hefty canine is pushing nearly three tons in weight, an awesome number that keeps climbing as her endless hunger drives her to continually search for new food sources in the large city where she currently resides in the shadows of the night, and elsewhere in the day to hide her huge frame.

Her personality is like her body; though her exterior is stony and rough, she's softer and warmer on the inside, with a heart of gold (it works in the analogy, since she can digest metal, but it takes awhile, and thus gives her gas. She has recently eaten the hoard of a dragon and all the coins in her make her belly drag across the ground. the hard bony plate covering her skin look out of place when they jiggle on her rotund form.

She is lean and light, but needs to bulk up for a cold winter. Luckily, there is prey all across the land, and she can grow fat on their meat.

She is about to ask permission from Ni-zall, the alpha of her wing, who is also their shaman and wombmother (leader of the broodmothers). She is a large dragon, in both size and girth, her fat appearing in rolls all over her, right up to her very mammalian face. She is also perpetually pregnant, as is the case with broodmothers, with a womb stretched to make up most of her size, though she often swallows large prey (though some dragon prefer to tear it apart), sometimes larger than herself, adding more to he size. She walks on three legs, using one foreleg to clutch her staff. She is very close to Shimmer, and will certainly grant her her blessing. But Shimmer hopes to one day have the biggest, most productive womb, hundreds of feet in radius. She even wonders if she can take Ni-zall as her lover and mate when this happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Reffeh is a mammalian creature, closely related to dragons.

This tail extends from her large rump and wide hips, which attract many males(and some females). She has a darker grey mane at her head, resembling hair, from which four horns protrude. Her face is like a mixture of canine and bovine with two dark streaks, and a creamy patch around the nose. This creamy coloration continues on her substantial belly and around her paws. She has an entire elephant(slightly bigger then herself) gurgling away in her stomach (She's an omnivore. She can graze like a cow, tear into meat like a wolf ,or swallow it like a snake, and she can stick her long sticky tongue into insect mounds). She has one cub in the pouch on her belly (and none in the pouch inside of it, or the ones in her cheeks, or the one just inside the walls of her sex), a rare single birth. She didn't know she was pregnant until she went into labor. She has teats (unnoticeable), breasts (ample), and udders (productive). She's having trouble feeding this young one, let alone the litters on the way (she is of a speacies with multiple wombs that frequently has overlapping pregnancies in each.

Luckily she has large fat reserves all on her body, especially her breasts, hips, butt, and stomach, with some on her cheeks and thighs.

He tucked at his dark grey cloak, trying to conceal himself in the well-lit Inn. His muted orange fur was damp with sweat and his eyes were wide open, darting left and right, as if he was expecting that every costumer that the lion served that evening was out to get him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander grinned. He knew exactly what this person was. For the last twelve years he owned this Inn, in a small town nestled in the bottom of a valley, he had came in contact with all walks of life: bandits, nobles, soldiers, mercenaries, knights, traitors...He could already identify them by sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel was no doubt a thief, and by his behavior told him that he recently stole something very valuable and was expecting someone to come up and slit his throat for it. Not that Alexander minded much, as long as they take there quarrels outside and not make a mess of his establishment. He had, after all, just cleaned the place up after a drunken fight broke out only a few days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I get you, sir?\" Alexander asked with his deep voice politely<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel was silent for a moment, looking over his shoulder and surveying the room, just to make sure no one was watching him. \"I-I would like a room f-for the night,\" he finally stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his pocket he produced a gold coin, placing it on the table, and the lion swiped it away with his big paw. Alexander was no fool. He knew that gold could be faked. He learned that lesson the hard way when he first opened his Inn in his youth. He gave it a nibble with his fangs and was satisfied that it was genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you'll be taking one of the best rooms for the night?\" Alexander said, beaming and raising a bushy eyebrow at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel looked over his shoulder a bit more frantically, and it was evident that his paranoia was growing worse by the minute. He, Alexander saw, only wanted to get away from the preying eyes of the other costumers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, sure,\" he quickly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to bring up some food or ale for you?\" Alexander asked casually, like he did with all of his costumers that gave him a gold coin, ignoring the weasel's growing distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please, just a room. That's all,\" the weasel said, raising his voice a little. His breathing was coming quicker now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" said Alexander, giving his shoulders a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion bent down, opened a drawer, and took one of the many keys that were inside. Like many of his new costumers that wanted to rent a room, Alexander expected that they wouldn't be able to find it without some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel followed him obediently, only glad to be away from the crowd in the main room. After moving down a few gloomy hallways, they made it to the room, the lion plopped the key into the weasel's hand, saying: \"Here you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made an attempt to dart inside, but he suddenly stopped. He turned to Alexander and said, \"Do you mind if you'll you wake me early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion scratched his brown mane and said, \"Sure. I get up at the crack of dawn. I'll wake you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile and a quick \"thank you\", the weasel went inside, slamming the door shut. Alexander only shook his head and went downstairs.</span></div></div>",

Sexual overtones may appear throughout the interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is primarily a weight-gain interactive.  The stories gathered here cater to people who like to see characters wearing generally heaping helpings of excess body fat.  Characters may end up gaining weight or may just start out fat, but generally, the tales here will be concerned with at least one obese individual.  There is no set topic, but this interactive is devoted to true literary excellence in this field, which frankly is appallingly lacking in writing talent across the internet.  There is no 'fapping' material here.  There are real stories with real plot, characters and drama which take place with an eye to this particular kind of aesthetic beauty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Edit*  After some thought, I have decided to allow general posting to this interactive.  Each story slot is marked with the choice \"Blank.\"  The first chapter's title should be the title of your story and each availible choice needs to be filled.  Character creation is usually a goodt option, but \"Something Else\"  will do if you can't think of anything else to fill the choices.  <br>\r\nIn order for me to edit the root chapter, I need a short summary of your story to put into the list as well as the title of your story; this you can e-mail to me.  Single sentence stories or short intros are subject to deletion; you don't have to use the entire character limit, but I expect quality of what is there.  Quantity and Quality are not the same thing, but longer stories do show commitment and an ability to cohesively organize prose.  I will ultimately decide whether to include a new story on this interactive.  If I ever remove something from the interactive, I will send you an e-mail explaining why I did so. */Edit*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that, feel free to post in any story which has already been started.  But again, chapters will be subject to some scrutiny by myself.  Always, I will try to resolve any issues via e-mail.  Please leave all options available when you post, to allow others the chance to build on what you wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, let me place down some ground rules:<br>\r\n1) No prolonged explicit sex scenes  (It's alright to say what is happening, but don't center the story around it.  Sensuality and implied sex are preferred)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) No cross fetishes (that means no vorephilia, no unbirthing, etc...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Killing/replacing the main character is fine, but not wantonly  (provide a reason)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Feel free to be creative, but observe <i>all</i> material which has preceeded your chapter (you mustn't be selective)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5)  Feel free to consult me before/during writing a new chapter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) All chapters are subject to revisal/removal.  (Removal will always be the very last resort.  I will contact you if I deem that a chapter is interfering with the progress of the story and try to resolve the matter with you.)</td>",
