Watching the TV she storms in the room with a angry face and she has a go at you saying how ignorant and lazy you are. As she finished this you turn around with a blank expression and say what. As you say this she shouts out, \"I wish......</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had a loyal friend to talk to, and not a layabout bum!!\" your girlfriend shouts at you, shoving you out of the bedroom. She adds to this, \"You used to be so loving and dutiful, but now you just sit around watching sports all day, especially after you lost that scholarship!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your dog, dammit!!\" you growl. \"...and stop reminding me about my damn knee!!\" you still remember clearly the day in college you suffered that injury that ended your up-and-coming tennis career, and as a result you turned to pot as a coping mechanism and your grades slipped, and you flunked out of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah... Why am I still with with you? Sometimes I think a dog would be better, but the building doesn't allow pets...\" She sighs, almost tearful. Turning around and throwing some sheets at you, she says, \"If you want to stay by my side, I expect you to do your share. Tomorrow, if I return and the laundry isn't done, floors swept and mopped, and supper done, then I'll know you know care anymore.\" She closes the door on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the bed, almost sobbing, she asks, \"Why <b>AM</b> I still with him?\" She sits, then asks, \"Who can I talk about this to?\" She reaches for her phone, but pauses. \"Mom's asleep...\" She motions again, and again stops. \"I stopped talking to Jane in tenth grade after she tried to frame me for stealing some jeans, and Molly sleeping with my last boyfriend while I was dating him...\" Wow, I have no friends... at least no friends that haven't betrayed me. I really do need a loyal friend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were trying to lay down on the couch, infuriated by your girlfriend's rant. Why was she mad at you? You didn't do anything wrong. You just... Wait. \"Don't care anymore...\" You were both mad, and a bit hurt by that statement. It was actually about of the only parts of the whole argument you actually had listened to. The rest was just \"blah, blah, blah\" to you. However, you got the feeling she had meant business this time, and if you didn't put forth an effort, she'd walk out on you. A part of you still cared for her, but for the most part, your soul had died the day your dreams did. You stare at your knee and feel the mild ache in it. \"Why bother...?\" You drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout this time, cosmic forces begin their work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I have to head out for work. You remember what I said.\" the girlfriend calls out from the front door. \"If I don't see supper, and I mean something you cooked, not something frozen, not some take-out crap, not burgers, but actual <b>FOOD</b>, as well as the other stuff done, <b>WE'RE DONE!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"''Kay.\" You utter zoned out, watching SportsZone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour day days on like normal for about an hour - watching sports, drink a beer, smoke a joint, scratch your balls, jerk it, then get up to go take a shower. However, unbeknownst to you as you showered, your hair grew longer as your body shrank a little and became a little more supple. As the cool water ran over you, your boy bits shriveled away inside you to create a new slit. Stepping out of the tub, you still were clueless to your new A-cup mounds on your chest. Wiping the condensation from the mirror, you brushed some of your longer hair clean out of your eyes to be shocked not that your hair was longer, nor that you had small breasts, but that you no stubble to shave. \"Must've done a good job shaving yesterday...: you mutter. It seems the beer and pot was affecting you just enough to keep you from seeing your transformation, as outside of your genitals, nothing significant had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to dress up and do notice the sleeves on your baseball tee seem shorter, and the legs on your jeans look a little shorter too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, she shrunk my clothes...\" That was when you remember she wanted you to do the clothes. \"I'll show her!! I can do the clothes better than <b>THIS!!</b>\" You down another beer real quick first, and then you gather all the dirty clothes up, and as you do, with each article, your waist pinching inward and your hips flaring. You open the door to the basement where the washer and dryer. With each step down each stair, your hair grows as your body shrinks, and your face softens and feminizes. As you load the clothes, your sleeves and pants legs pull up more as well, turning your clothes into a t-shirt and shorts. \"She sure has a lot of clothes.\" you comment, not recognizing a number of your garments in a feminized form and shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clothes start washing, you sit there and think, \"Maybe I should do more... I want to stay by her. I really do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw the clothes in the dryer, when you realize you can be better utilizing your time then sitting here watching the portable TV in the basement waiting on the clothes, particularly when a certain scent wafts by. \"The floors!!\" You run up the stairs, as you do your bum becoming a luscious firm heart shape as your shorts tightening into fine booty shorts, your hair draping just above it. Meanwhile, your ears vanish from the sides of your head and re-emerge out the top of your hair in the form of floppy doggy ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the broom and sweep the floors diligently, making sure not to miss nary a microbe. It felt like as you did this, all your woes were being metaphorically swept away with the grime. \"Maybe we <b>CAN</b> be happy again, me an her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing by the TV, you see an ad for Beggin' Strips dog treats and your mouth strangely begins to drool. \"Bacon... Bacon, bacon, bacon!!\" You realize the time and set out frying pans to begin supper. You throw a <b>LOT</b> of bacon into the frying pan, along with some pork chops and spare ribs, and allowed it to simmer on medium-low while you mopped. However, there was a section in the kitchen that the mop couldn't reach, so you decided to be thorough and scrub it by hand. As you got on your hands and knees, you felt a momentary waft between your legs, but brushed it off it to focus on your duty. Making your girlfriend felt so important to you now. What you had ignored though was your booty shorts turning into a miniskirt, your current booty-in-the-air upskirt posture showing off your lace panties that had a dog's paw printed on the rear. As you thrust back and forth, your breast grew in size - B, C, D, E, finally to F cups, as your t-shirt became a tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you were done scouring the floor, surprised to notice your knee no longer hurt you in the slightest. \"Hah, she's going to come home and be so proud of me and we'll stay together forever and forever and forever...\" You then feel something alien flapping back and forth lifting the back of your skirt up... Wait, you were starting to sober up now, and beginning to notice things, starting with your reflection in the floor, the floor you did an impeccable job on. This only made your new tail wag harder, as though part of you is waiting for her to come and compliment you on a job well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god!! What's going on with me?!\" you panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout this time, your girlfriend walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Her eyes fixed on his crotch, she was hypnotised by the bulge visible through his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers quaked in anticipation, or dread at the unwanted drives. But Kendra lowered his zipper until she could tug him free. Her nostrils flared, as the scent of cock hit her nostrils. She swallowed it in one swift gulp, her tongue swirling around his meat. Her lips working his shaft as though she were milking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apparent expertise was incredible, as Henry's head slipped backwards. The secret fellatrix was a natural, and if he'd been capable of more than softly moaning, he'd have been cursing the time lost to this ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the scent of copper prickled in Henry's nostrils it barely registered. Shifting his hips he felt the sensations change, but staying just as pleasurable. Eyes fluttering uncontrollably, his gaze fixed on the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an effort to bring that into focus... But he tried ... just to make the pleasure last longer, just to draw out the ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt very different, as Henry finally came. Hips thrashing wildly, Henry felt a shifting on his chest too. It didn't register, as his tongue darted out, moistening lips that felt too dry from a mouth that felt parched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/75a3477adc43ab6070aab69789cad7c2/tumblr_pxpl8hNjrI1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/75a3477adc43...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra had rocked his world entirely, everything felt different. Even blinking felt odd, but the thought never meant anything, as Kendra attacked his crotch once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft feminine moan, that felt like it came from her throat. But reaching his ears, was sure it had to be Kendra's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nibbling, gnawing, lapping assault on his crotch continued, driving Henry wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted this to be his whole life, Kendra on her knees, an eager mouth working feverishly to satisfy him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moan, turned into a groan, as that same womanly purr hit his ears. His lips tingled, as he fantasised how the bimbo cloud was making Kendra into his perfect lover. His tongue darted out once more. This time feeling longer, his lips if anything more parched. They felt swolled and dry, as he lashed his lips with a tongue that felt muscular and probing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/72991ffe633be6110fefce79628b983e/tumblr_pxpl8hNjrI1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/72991ffe633b...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands coming down to keep Kendra's lapping tongue in place. It was that that broke the spell. Henry's skinnier forearms brushing against his chest. Instead, finding the swell of a bust there... His own bust. She gasped, then giggled...<i> 'If I have a bust...'</i>, giggling. But couldn't complete the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as that revelation penetrated, so too did Kendra's tongue keeping Henry in place. Unwilling to risk spoiling that climax she was racing towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/092d112ff7c3279328fecd0a1b6b22e3/tumblr_pxpl8hNjrI1w2lwkto3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/092d112ff7c3...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry shrieked, as she came.

A price she'd happily pay if she could make Kendra feel this good...</span></div></div>",

Tyler was a sweetie, a tad slender for her tastes but what she really loved was a chance to cook.  She'd helped her mother in the kitchen and with two jock brothers had some good experience with pleasing the appetites of young men.  She missed working in the kitchen and dating an upper clansman like tyler who had his own apartment and enough cash to buy food, she was in heaven.  Skinny Tyler wasn't a big eater but with Gina's help that could change.  She fixed a nice five pound pot roast with lots of potatoes and carrots and left it to simmer.  <br>\r\nTyler was enthusiastic when he smelled the aroma of the pot roast.  Doug had told him to eat big and he was ready to comply.  He took a big serving and plowed in.<br>\r\n\"I guess my eyes were bigger than my stomach.\"  Tyler whined.  He had managed to eat only a part of his first serving.  \"It's great, Gina.  I just don't have much capacity.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that.\" she told him.  \"Eat what you can.  Then just a bit more to build up your capacity and you'll be eating like a big boy in no time. You go work on your paper and I'll clean everything up.\"<br>\r\n\"You are a peach, Gina.\"<br>\r\nGina had taken a small serving and with Tyler's, the pot roast was hardly touched.  \"It did smell good.\" she thought taking a bite of the beef on Tyler's plate. \"Tastes pretty good,\" she thought taking another and without thinking she ate the rest of Tyler's dinner.  Then she couldn't help herself from nibbling on a potato, another hunk of roast.  \"It won't be much good later,\" she rationalized and took some more savoring the rich flavors.  Back home with two hungry brothers, she didn't have leftovers.  \"Might as well finish it off.\" she thought.  \"Tyler won't heat it later and before she knew it Gina was sopping up the last of the juice with a slice of bread.<br>\r\n\"Can't eat like that all the time,\"  she told herself but I won't have to worry because as Tyler bulks up, he won't be leaving any leftovers for me to clean up.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A little while later Gina walked in to the living room where Tyler was working on his paper. Just as Gina sat down on the couch, Tyler finished his paper &amp; shut his laptop. Gina asked, \"You already done with your paper?\" Tyler replied, \"yes I just finished. I just can't stop thinking about how to increase my appetite so I can get bigger muscle wise.\"<br>\r\nGina replied, \"From my experience of helping to feed my brothers &amp; growing up with them there are things they did to increase their appetite &amp; get bigger muscle wise. Those are as follows:<br>\r\n1. Make sure your stomach is never empty. Eat as much as you can at each meal even past the point where your full. Eat as often as you can. Take snacks with you to school &amp; every where you go.<br>\r\n2. work out every day not just 2 days like you do now.<br>\r\n3. You should drink a prework out shake before your work out. Then after your work out you should drink a post work out shake. I could start coming over each day &amp; cook breakfast &amp; dinner for you. I could even pack large lunches for you with plenty of snacks to keep you full all day. I think you should stop by the local GNC store &amp; get some pre &amp; post work out shakes.\"<br>\r\nTyler replied, \"that sounds great. I'll talk to Doug about working out ever day &amp; stop by GNC tomorrow. How about we watch the movie now?\" Gina got up &amp; replied as she walked towards the kitchen, \"ok but I think you should eat some thing while we watch the movie.\" A few minutes later Gina walked in with 2 quarts of Blue Bell ice cream with 2 spoons. Gina started the movie &amp; sat down with Tyler. Gina handed him a quart &amp; spoon then started eating her ice cream as she encouraged Tyler to eat as much as he could.<br>\r\nBy the time Tyler had eaten almost all of his quart, he couldn't eat any more. Gina unbuckled his belt then unbuttoned his pants to give him more room for ice cream. Gina massaged Tyler's distented belly relieving the pressure. Tyler burped a few times then finished his quart. Gina handed her quart to him which he amazingly was able to finish off by the end of the movie.<br>\r\nGina said, \"I'll see you in the morning.\" She then walked out as Tyler went up to bed where he quickly fell asleep.<br>\r\nThe next morning Tyler woke up to the smell of food cooking down stairs. Tyler got up &amp; got dressed then walked down to find Gina cooking breakfast. Tyler greeted her, \"good morning beautiful. It smells good.\" Gina replied, \"sit down at the table &amp; I'll bring the food to you.\" Tyler did as she asked. Gina set a plate of sausage, scrambled eggs, bacon toast &amp; a towering stack of pancakes. Gina then brought a plate with smaller portions for her. Tyler ate as much as he could but could not finish everything. Tyler ate everything except for some of the pancakes. Gina finished his food off as he got his books ready for class &amp; got his lunch &amp; snacks ready.<br>\r\nTyler came back with his back pack just as Gina was about to leave. Gina said, \"I'm proud of how much you ate last night &amp; this morning. I made a large lunch for you &amp; brought snacks for you. I'll see you tonight for supper.\" Tyler replied, \"thanks. I'm going to do everything I can to eat more &amp; get bigger. I'm going to stop by GNC before I go to class. After class I'll go work out for a few hours before I come home for dinner. I'll see you tonight.\" They then left &amp; went their seperate ways.<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later Tyler walked in to the local GNC store to find a tall &amp; muscular blond haired guy in his early 20's standing behind the counter. He walked over &amp; introduced himself as Mike. Mike asked, \"what can I help you with?\" Tyler replied, \"I need to increase my appetite so I can get bigger muscles. I would like some pre work out &amp; post work out shakes.\"<br>\r\nMike replied, \"I know what you need. Follow me.\" Mike lead him down towards the back of the store. Mike pulled down a few cases of different supplements &amp; shake mixes. Mike said, \"take 2 pills of the appetite stimulant at each meal. Take these shakes when you wake up, before &amp; after your work out &amp; when you go to bed. these shakes &amp; appetite supplements will not only help you get bigger muscle wise but could also help you get taller to.\" Tyler replied, \"great. I'll take a case of each of them. After paying for them Tyler went to class.</span></div></div>",

The sun is just beginning to rise, bathing the world in a golden glow. The glowing green numerals glare at you, mocking your feeble attempts to remain asleep. You flail around until your hand hits the snooze button before rolling out of bed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Immediately, something seems off. Your boxer shorts are way too low on your body, slipping past your waist and hanging on your hips. Additionally, your nightshirt feels extraordinarily loose, like it somehow grew a few sizes overnight. Puzzled, you waddle over to the bathroom, holding up your underwear so it doesn't fall down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking in the mirror, you are shocked by what you see. You are about 6 inches shorter than you were the night before, but that is the least of the changes. Light brown hair frames your face, hanging down to just above your neck. Your face is close to what it looked like before, but now it's more feminine, with softer features. Suspecting further changes, you peel off the loose shirt to reveal a pair of small, pert breasts. They aren't huge as breasts go, but they feel large on your body. You also notice that your once-broad shoulders are now much narrower, and your arms are thinner.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gulping, you begin to realize the extent of your changes. With a mixture of fear and curiosity, you pull down your loose boxers, and look between your legs. Nothing is readily apparent, save for a small patch of fuzz. You ferret through one of the drawers, casting aside nail clippers and combs until you find a small compact mirror. You place it between your thighs and angle it upwards, so you can get a better look. You can see a pair of small, pinkish lips between your legs, making it clear that you have a vagina. You momentarily resist the urge to touch yourself, as you are too weirded out by the whole experience. It still seems surreal to you, like some sort of messed-up dream.<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

Tall, long toned legs, natural sexy tan, fiery red hair, large perky DDs, a nicely shaped backside that created a wonderful hourglass shape, all clad in a tight pink bikini. However, next to her was not the same you. You were no long the tall, lithe, dark haired boy. In your place was a very petite, very cute brunette girl.

You move your hands to your rear and feel that it is much softer and wider than before. Moving your hands to your inner thighs you realize that their blubber touches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, relatively speaking, you stand up and are startled at the new offsets to your balance. You jiggle over to the scale in the bathroom and look down, realizing that you cannot see it over your enormous endowment and midsection. You bend over and fold your arms over your bosom, your upper arms feel meatier and plumper. You gasp and both hands shoot to cover your plump-lipped mouth. \"I weigh 253 pounds!?\" you shriek in a very effeminate way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning cautiously to the mirror, you see a very plump and curvy woman staring, horrified, back at you. Your breasts are larger than even your head, which has also grown chubbier. As well, they seem to be propped up pleasingly on your round, smooth belly. Hefty love-handles rest atop wide, soft hips. Thick, fat legs touch together in your current, most comfortable, posture. You can no longer see your pubic hair as your enormous stomach spills over your formerly trim waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to wonder, slowly taking in all these startling changes that have taken hold of your body in these few short hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

You do notice that you and Amanda are about the same height in this picture, which to you seems good. \"It is odd,\" you think to yourself, \"It's almost like there are a bunch of people making all of these strange things happen to me at their own whimsy.\" You blush at how scantily clad you are in the picture and you turn toward your dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou first look in the bra cabinet and take out an enormous brazier. It fits a little snugly, as if you gained a few since you purchased it, but it will do. The bra shapes your deep cleavage sexily and you blush as if you caught yourself staring at another woman's breasts. The hot pink panties you pull out fit more like a thong than normal underwear and the unfamiliar sensation of female arousal tantalizes your nether regions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appears as though you have not gone shopping much since your female self gained all this weight and most of the clothes seem to be fit for someone with a shape more like that of your girlfriend. The only thing that seems like it might fit is a spaghetti strap shirt with a flowing hemline and a pair of short shorts with a broken elastic waistband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirt really only covers your large chest, while leaving your cleavage unhindered, and the hem falls just above the plateau of your gut. A short person could easily see the underside of your lace bra if he looked up at you. Even with the broken waistband, the shorts refuse to go up past your hips and you are forced to leave them riding very low on your body. You can feel that the waistline does not cover your pubic hair, but that is okay because your belly does, and you can feel that a good portion of your butt crack is exposed and the lower parts of your hindquarters squeeze out from the bottom of the shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shorts feel skin tight and this strangely pleases you.

Your clothes ripped off while you were out, and you almost feel embarrassed to be staring so intently at a naked young woman, even if it is yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to panic, you waddle toward the bathroom door. You stumble and realize you've accidentally stepped on a scale. You turn your head, your other foot falling on the scale in an attempt to retain your precarious balance. Looking down over the swollen slopes of your body, you see the scale read 273, the needle moving further clockwise with each breath you take. Soon the needle reads 297, 328, 359, all the while you feel yourself filling out, spreading, growing wider and heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering your panic as the needle reaches 400, you stumble towards the door. You come to an abrupt halt, however, as your immense girth has gotten stuck in the doorway. As you continue to fatten and plump, you can hear the doorway beginning to creak and snap. You feel your belly begin to brush the carpet of your bedroom. Your squirm and moan until finally, you manage to explode out of this trap, tumbling in a huge jiggling ball toward the door out of your apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fattening breasts jiggle wildly as you crash through the door and fall out into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

You always felt she tried to be dominant, but at 5' 5\", it was hard for her to back up her threats. While you weren't an muscle bound Adonis, you stood half a head taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attempts with heels, just had her wobbling, and unstable, and took away any appearance of power, or control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with the device, you decide to help her adjust to a new potential form. You craft a new body for her on the Master PC, ensuring she'll be even shorter, and more submissive. Well, that's the hope anyway. Changing her ethnicity, you make her Japanese. There's something about Japanese women that draws your attention. The demure, submission seems to come as second nature. A natural deference for men, especially Western men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her petite new body, you have her relocated to the City centre Fetish Club, that she's talked about, 'Madame Sadique', a few minutes there as a submissive will surely make her appreciate her man. Her seductive, promise laden eyes, and her long black hair will make her popular. The protection of your powerful arms a welcome relief from all that attention. The musk of your sweaty body. Your nose crinkles a little at the idea, more in discomfort than excitement. You imagine her snuggling in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you don't want to wait too long, and leave her vulnerable. In the bottom of the screen, a red light flashes, as you select 'Madame Sadique' as your own destination. Perhaps a warning that Sakura, the re-named Sam is in danger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tap the icon, to send you to join her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forgot how loud the music was at the club. Pounding deafeningly away, but there's another priority. As you quickly realise, the warning wasn't about Sakura being in danger. It must have been your own changes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ones that are already making you squirm. The tightly bound rope, marking you as a submissive. The fishnet black veil across your face, and most troubling, how it all squeezes your boobs and makes you feel on display and vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tablet is back at home, your hands empty and powerless. You look up... up into Sakura's smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dilly-dilly-do.tumblr.com/post/162321899824\" target=\"_blank\">https://dilly-dilly-do.tumblr.com/post/1...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear etched on your face, just inspires her to draw her gaudy whip across your flesh. The experiment with the Master PC, just having taken you further down the rabbit hole. Sakura/Sam is still as much the dome, but your relationship, now suits her better. With your own changes happening to accommodate the redesign you gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My favourite dish, or a touch of variety....\" she mused aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd baying around you, enjoying the sight of Sakura, as she chose between you, 'her favourite', a description that made you shudder, and thrill. Or the 'variety' course, whose warm flesh presses insistently against your own.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My girlfriend said that we could go shop at the mall, because she needed a few things as well, and the attached supermart was having a sale. We hit the store and I started looking at underwear. For some odd reason, none of the available men\u2019s styles looked comfortable. I mentioned this to my wife, and she said that I had just commented on her panties this morning. Why didn\u2019t I get some for me to wear? I mulled that over for just a split second and agreed. She picked out a few styles and paid. I liked the new and improved girlfriend, but I just couldn\u2019t always remember what we had done the day before. This was a little disconcerting, and I mentioned it to my girlfriend. She just blew it off, saying that that was normal with all the things that were always going on. <br>\r\nWe went home, and after a little while I decided to take a nap. I got my mp3 and immediately fell into a deep dream-filled sleep. In it, I was wearing the panties we had just bought, and also a bra, because for some reason I had the most beautiful breasts on my now not so manly chest. I was so turned on that I could almost feel a pair of lips wrapped around my member, giving me a fantastic blowjob. I woke up and my girlfriend was doing exactly that. Wow! I mentioned my dream to my girlfriend, and she said she would love to see what I looked like with breasts.<br>\r\nI agreed, and the next thing you know, we are out shopping form bras. I was amazed to find that I was a 42B, considering that I was always conscious of what I ate and worked out. My girlfriend said it may be because I was in my 40\u2019s and my metabolism must have started slowing down. I didn\u2019t give it a second thought and went back to my routine. Two weeks (and many erotic, weird dreams) later I told my wife that I felt I needed new bras, since the ones I had been wearing had become very tight. <br>\r\nWe went shopping again and now I measured a 38C, and I noticed that I had gotten a little smaller in the band but larger in the cup. Hmmm. And back home and another nap. This went on for several months, and always the weird dreams. One morning I asked my girlfriend what was going on, why had my breasts gotten so big? She said a few words that didn\u2019t have anything to do with the conversation, and all of a sudden my memory filled in all the blank spots.<br>\r\nI had been working out to Richard Simmons, wearing a spandex leotard; I\u2019d had my hair styled and dyed a nice chestnut color; I had gotten a manicure and pedicure and had them colored a nice plum; I had quit my job and cashed in my 401k, signing over the money to my wife to invest (and we were now very well off); I had continued to lose size in my chest and waist, but my butt had grown so much that I was now wearing women\u2019s jeans; I had my belly button and my tongue pierced once and my ears 5 times each. On top of that, I had permanent makeup on my eyes and my lips had been injected with filler that plumped them up to look like the perfect hooker lips.<br>\r\nI screamed and ran to look at myself in the mirror. I must have done this a thousand times in the past few weeks and months, but this was the first time it actually registered in my mind. I was now one of those exact same men and sissies that I had been enjoying looking at on the internet. I also noticed some other changes in the house. One of the biggest changes was that there were cameras in every room in the house, and I asked about those. Those, my girlfriend said, were so that all my changes could be watched by subscribers to our new website that showed my feminization over the last few months. It turned out that we had several hundred viewers subscribed to watch how I became more and more feminine. Since I had quit my job, I had hardly left the house, and I had been instructed by my girlfriend, now my life partner, to go around naked so all my changes were clearly visible. I noticed that I now jiggled when I walked, and running without a bra was definitely out of the question. <br>\r\nI unzipped my pants to realize that my penis was completely gone and a vagina was right in its place...</span></div></div>",

I'm in my room!\" Rachael replies. You hurry down the hallway to the first room on the right, where you find Rachael sitting on bed bed in only a bra and underwear. And for good reason: you quickly notice the shiny gray tail that's sprouted just above her backside. Then you spot the wolf ears on top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what happened,\" she starts, her voice still shaky. \"I just woke up during the middle of the night, and found that I... well, you can see what I found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know Rachael can be a prankster at times, but she wouldn't do something just to waste your time. You decide there has to be more to this, so you take a seat next to her on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I...?\" But she knows what you're going to ask, and nods her consent. You slowly trace a finger down her spine, her skin feeling cold to the touch. You eventually come to the base of her new tail, which her spine simply continues into. Somehow, her tail bone decided to actually be of use. You can feel the bone at the center of her tail which otherwise feels soft to the touch. Why it was the tail of a wolf, you had no idea. Explaining the ears was a lot more tricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do? I can't go out like this!\" she exclaims. Her wolf ears drooped, showing her sadness even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take her hand, where you see her nails have become sharp claws. However, you ignore mentioning them for now. \"Rachael, I don't have any way to explain this any more than you do right now, but I'll help you through it, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up to your face and smiles. She reaches to wipe a tear, but you quickly see her claws. \"Here, let me get that. I don't want you to scratch your eye out by accident...unless you want to be a pirate wolf-girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael laughs, knowing you're trying to make her feel better. \"So, what do we do? I can't possibly go to class like this!\"</span></div></div>",

Here you are getting all excited and soon as your hand touches a boob she shuts you down. Honestly you're a little annoyed. You've been together since high school. Things used to be hot. Neither one of you could keep your hands off each other, but here lately she has gone cold. You feel like you're an old married couple. \"What's with you? You never want me to touch you anymore\", you state trying to keep from sounding angry. \"If you would touch me the right way I wouldn't have a problem\", she retorts. \"Right way\", you think to yourself? You the say out loud, \"I touch you the same way I've always touched you and you never complained before. If fact you used to beg for it.\" You feel her tense up and you know you've struck a nerve. She's about to say something but is interrupted by someone behind you yelling, \"Shut up and get a room.\" Nikki gets up without a word and storms off. You sit there for a while wondering if it's even worth chasing after her. You decide it's better to chase her now than to have to deal with her later if you don't. \"Shit\", you mutter and then chase after her. You catch up with her in the lobby. \"Nikki, wait\", you shout grabbing her shoulder. She jerks away and says, \"I'm not a piece a meat for you to just feel up whenever you're in the mood.\" You shake your head and mumble, \"Must be that time of the month.\" You swear you can see smoke coming out of the top of her head. \"Oh, that's your answer. You have no idea how it is to be an attractive woman, to have guys always gawking at you. All you guys want is to grab some tits and stick your dick in something. Always thinking with the little head.\" You feel your own anger start to swell and reply with, \"Oh, and like you don't like it when a guy gives you attention. You shake your ass, show some cleavage, and just lead him along until you get what you want and then shut him down. You have no idea what it's like to be a guy having a hot woman taking advantage of the fact that we think with our little head. It's all good until it's time to pay up.\" Just then an old woman appears and says, \"Maybe I can help.\" You both look at her and state, \"This is none of your business.\" \"Oh, but it is my business.\" </span></div></div>",

By the time you get home you're unusually exhausted. \"It's not like you were getting lucky tonight anyway\", you think to yourself and head for bed. Nikki seems to be feeling the same way. You brush your teeth, get undressed to your boxers, and get in bed. Nikki soon joins you. She quickly turns her back to you and moving to the edge of the bed. You've learned it's her way of saying don't touch me. It's not like you were going to anyway. You quickly fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The next morning you start to stir. You immediately sense your hand on a bare breast. You vaguely remember Nikki had a top on. You slowly start to fondle said boob and notice two things. The first is that it feels way bigger than Nikki's boobs and as you fondle it you can feel your hand on your chest. You move your hand around and confirm that it's own your chest, but also on a very large boob. You move you hand and find its twin on the other side of your chest. \"What the hell\", you think sleepily. \"This must be a dream\", you figure even though you're becoming more awake. You feel them up some more to confirm that they are really there. You then move you hand down between your legs only to feel nothing. You jerk your hand away and lay there for a few seconds. You open your eyes are stare at the ceiling dimly lit by the rising sun outside. After feeling you're sufficiently awake you feel your chest again. Like before you find two very large breasts. You feel you heart starting to beat faster. You leap out of bed and run for the bathroom, trying to ignore the jiggling flesh on your chest. You flip on the bathroom light and are temporarily blinded. As your eyes adjust they're greeted by the sight of an attractive busty young woman wearing nothing but boxers standing in the mirror. You look down at yourself and realize that woman is you. \"What the fuck\", you scream in a high soprano voice!</span></div></div>",

With you changes you realize who this man must be. \"Nikki\", you state. He looks at you and his eyes go wide. His eyes drop to your chest. You cover them quickly with your arms. \"Mark\", he asks? You nod your head and reply with, \"It's me, but some weird shit is going on. I think it must have been that crazy old woman last night.\" Nikki shacks his head and says, \"No, no, no, this can't be real. You just don't wake up the next morning as the opposite sex.\" \"Well, I got a set of double D's that says different\", you scoff while grabbing you breasts for effect. \"We've got to figure this out.

We've got to find that old lady and get her to straighten this out\", Nikki states finally seeming to accept this is happening. \"I agree, lets get some clothes on, eat some breakfast, and head back to where we saw her at the theater\", you reply.

You heavy cotton robe is changing before your eyes into skimpy silk one. You open it up to find your boxers have become a white lacy thong. \"What the hell\", you mumble. You then hear Nikki shout from the bedroom, \"Where are my clothes.\" You rush back to find Nikki wearing nothing but a towel having just got out of the shower. He's rummaging threw his drawers. He's pulling out various male clothing. \"Things are still changing\", you state. He turns to look at you. \"Where did that come from\", he asks? You shrug and say, \"My robe turned into this and my boxers turned into a Victoria's Secret lacy thong.\" You walk over to you closet and open it only to find it filled with feminine clothes. \"It looks as if more than our bodies have changed\", you state. \"I wonder\", Nikki states looking on the dresser where she had left her purse the night before. Now wallet sits there. He opens it open and gets a shocked look on his face and hands it to you. You look at the ID. It has a picture of the man standing in from of you with the name Nicholas Miller on it. Miller is Nikki's last name. You drop the wallet and look for your own. You spot a purse that is not Nikki's by a dress that is also not hers by the bed where you undressed last night. You dig through it and find an ID. Just as with Nikki you current face is on it. The name on it is Carrie Douglas. Carrie is the name of your little sister. When your Mom was pregnant with you they picked out boy's and girl's names. You were born a boy so you were named Mark. Your sister was born a year and a hold later and they used the girl's name, Carrie that they picked out earlier. \"Oh crap, reality is changing\", you state as it dawns on you. Nikki, or rather Nick now drops to the bed and starts sobbing. \"This can't be happening\", he mumbles between sobs. You sit down beside him, a little alarmed by how small you've become, and put your arm around him. \"We'll figure this out babe\", you say. As you rub his back he starts calming down. You then see his towel starting to rise. You jerk back and shout, \"Are you getting a hard-on!\" He shrugs and says, \"I can't help it.\"</span></div></div>",

As Alice sobbed and nodded, it was unsettling and calming that she found the changes as difficult as yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with the last days of school behind you, there wasn't the social pressure and stigma to face.

You don't hear the shrug as Alex doesn't answer. But a yawn spills from your lips, and you find the bed calling to you. A distant memory from the chat with the consultant springs to mind. The changes take a lot out of your body, and sleep is necessary for you to adjust properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping back beneath the sheets, you murmur a sleepy good-bye, to Alex, and the phone lands a little heavily on the small table.

This time it's his hands wandering over your body. Your body squirming at his touch, your breath gasping at his touches, tweaks and teasing exploration. Your dream annoyingly imprecise, as you haven't really felt the touch of a man. You crave it, you fear it, you need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worry about how sensitive your new titties will be, how much you'll respond, how you'll respond. The questions as distressing as the answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hardly feels like you got any rest, as you awake once more. But, now it's already the morning, the entire afternoon, evening and night have passed. Already knowing what you face, you allow the sheets to slip from your body as you sit up. Their passing a silken caress against your soft, sensitive skin. But your eyes widen in horror, as you take in your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly shaking your head in denial, you look down at your cleavage. It's bigger, deeper, your bust fuller, firmer, even heavier as it pulls at your shoulders. A glance over your narrow shoulder blade, tells you these aren't the only curves that have developed. Your rump looks impossibly inviting. In your sleep your hips have widened. You can only think how much they'll swivel and sway as you walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/c95034d70c3a2d6efd938dd231090a85/tumblr_olhkt2SNxS1w2lwkto4_r1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/c95034d70c3a...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing your eyes closed, you try and dismiss the development.

Your dreams have you terrified to touch them, to tweak them. Afraid you'll cum from the merest touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour bust ripples, soft waves rolling across your abundant, luxurious bust as your breath shudders in and out. Your stomach gurgling nervously at this worsening of your condition. You catch your ghostly reflection in the window. Your face is as gorgeous as your body is voluptuous. You're more beautiful than Alice. A sense of pride at this makes you feel guilty, and you find yourself concerned at the attention your new body will attract. A naughty thought deep inside your brain teases you with the idea of Alex's transformation being as extreme, his masculinity pushed to it's limits. Your cheeks burn, as you find your thoughts shifting to his impressive cock. Imagining it filling you, completing you, ... splitting you in <i>TWO!?</i></span></div></div>",

You turn your head down a bit as you watch Luke rest his hand in your thigh trying to be romantic . He sits right next to you, supposedly to watch TV with you. But at a glance, you can see that his eyes are busy shifting  between you and the TV. When your glares meet his face started to turn red and you could feel him sliding away slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is it? I was... I wasn't looking at you...\" Luke muttered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riight .Let me know when you figure out what's so interesting about the wall, then.\" You said with slowly cracking a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a coincidence that the you and Luke had met. You had decided to rent out the spare room in order to earn a bit of extra cash, when the dorms got to expensive for other students and he had been the only one that you were comfortable with accepting. Most of the bigger guys that you had met were a bit disgusted moment they saw you due to your scrawness, without even looking around a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you first met Luke, you had expected him to run off like most of the others. He had the same handsome and somewhat intimidating expression on his face when you walked up to greet him. While, he seemed unbothered about the idea of living with you, he had liked the look of the place. You were quite surprised when he agreed to take the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did take him a few days before he was willing to do anything beside head straight to his room and close the door. He only poked his head out for the first time while you were cooking dinner. He had meekly asked for some after seeing the rather sizable amount you had made for yourself.That night was the first time the two of you actually spent a bit of time talking to one another, but after he got used to speaking with you, the two of you seemed to get along great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou learned more about him over the weeks that back in high school he towered over others at 6 feet 2 and with the amount of lifting he does he intimated whole school when the jocks.One day you saw that Luke looked about ready to explode, so you tried to give him a hug, and ever since then, the two of you had grown more and more relaxed and comfortable with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with the amount of time you two spent together, you started suspecting Luke of having a bit of a crush on you. It was difficult to miss the stares that he would give you when he would arrived back from a workout, or when you were busy cooking, even. Even when the two of you were sitting together, you could notice his eyes glancing around your body and his hands restlessly fidgeting as his hand covered your lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, Mark ? I-i've got something to ask...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" You smile casually as you turn your head down. The TV was turned off at some point, and all of Lukes attention seems to be turned towards you. From the sound of it, Luke's going to try something. He happily reach a hand forward, before pulling you a little closer by the shoulder. Luke's eyes looking right at yours. He had a deep blush on his face , and you only let your hand move to his side. \"What is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I was wondering...\" Luke struggles to keep his eyes looking at yours, but he manages to keep speaking as his gaze falters. \"I-if you want... I mean, if you're interested... Would... Would you want to... You know... Go out with me sometime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break into a wide grin before leaning in, your lips pushing in against his. Luke pulling you in closer feeling his 8-pack against your torso as, his cock pushed through his shorts every bit as hard as yours slowly overpowering yours.The kiss only lasted a few minutes, but Luke was redder than you ever remember seeing him as you slowly pulled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you knew I was going to ask? I... I thought I was...\" Alan's eyes are staring towards the ground as he speaks. You reach a hand forward, only giving a firm nod as he pulled you in closer, your arms now firm to his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering when you would. Took you a while.\" You rest in against one of his pecs, chuckling. \"I'd love to go out with you sometime, Luke.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on... I got something for you. I've been saving it for when you were feeling brave enough to ask.\" You reach into your pocket, taking out a small box. You open it up for him, revealing a simple wooden charm on a string. You had found the charm somewhere in the woods years ago,   waiting to give it to a special person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushes a little bit as he took a good look at it. \"R-really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just something I thought would fit you.\" You grin as you just press the box into his hands, kissing his cheek as he stared. \"Something to remind you that you don't have to be nervous around me.\" He lightly pull the charm out, lifting it over his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only manages to make a small sound, before looking up at you. \"T-thanks... So, I'll meet you here after class tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" You yawn and stretch out a little as you stand up with him. \"We'd better get a good night's sleep, then... Want to be awake for tomorrow.\" He bended over giving you one last  kiss as you blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right... Tomorrow...\" The two of you stand there, holding each other for another minute or so before breaking apart. You went straight to your room after, hoping to give him some time to process everything. Hopefully, tomorrow, the two of you could go out without him being worried about others seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your smile faded and you gasped. His handsome face was no longer where you were used to looking, and you were staring at a far too tight shirt showing large tears with a 8-pack pushing through the staining fabric. Instead you had to step back to find his eyes beaming with barely contained glee and large tear across his pecs. Looking him up and down your eyes only stopping for a sec to see the outline of his cock though his white boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning cutie\" He giggled and kneeing down wrapping his larger arms around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-uke what happened to you?!\" You ask dumbfounded at the sudden change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Mark? I hugged you\" He blushed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned back and stared lovingly into your eyes, and laughed softly when he saw your shocked/blushing expression. \"Surely you still can't be THAT shocked that were finally together?! It's not like I haven't been eyeing you all semester, Mark.\" You continue to stare, still dumbfounded at Luke's new-found size, but he didn't seem bothered or even to acknowledge that he just grew a few inches and gain 100 pounds of muscle over night . \"Luke  you... You're big!\" You almost blurt out, mentally slapping yourself for your prosaic language; this is not at all how you had prepared to greet him this morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" If he's going to pretend nothing happened, I won't push the subject\" thinking to yourself. You shake your head and try to throw back the loving smile you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee? That's much better\" He giggles pulling you in closer and leans in to kiss you again. You close your eyes and lean back into the tender kiss with full passion. You pull back with a soft sigh and smile happily back at Luke, \u201cI\u2019m so happy your here and I can\u2019t believe that you \u2026 I can\u2019t believe that you choose me over everyone else !\u201d He almost melted from all from that sentenced. Turning back to hand Luke his breakfast and soon get ready for class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin to yourself and shrug your shoulders before heading to class yourself and still thinking about the somewhat same old Luke.</span></div></div>",

He moved through the crowd of students with an effortless grace, even at his increased height and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you stood there in a daze, before you realized that dozens of eyes were staring at you. Snapping back into it and start heading to class.You arrived five minutes late to your next class, slipping in the back and sitting in the last row.The room was a large lecture hall, and the subject was Biology, a topic which you knew a good deal about already. With today's topic, cellular structure, being one you already knew pretty well, you soon found yourself losing focus and starting to daydream Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it over in your mind about how big Luke gotten over night, but what's even stranger is that he (and everyone else except for you, for that matter) seemed to be so oblivious to it\u2026 that troubled you, and you could shake that feeling. Still, he sure was damn sexy. You had seen him shirtless before at the pool, and you couldn't stop watching as the water ran down his rippling muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Biology, and the nondescript Statistics class that followed it (which allowed you to daydream about a shirtless, then naked, Luke even more), you had a break of three hours before your final class of the day, Literature, one you also shared with Luke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards the cafe on campus. Walking inside you order your normal cup of coffee and go sit down in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see Nik sitting across from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello, yourself, Nik,\" you replied. \"Hey, can I talk to you for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNik grinned \"What do you think we're doing right now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes \"Whatever. Listen, I need to ask you something about Luke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNik's eyes lit up. \"Yeah, I heard the two so , What's the question? Are you looking to buy him an engagement ring? I think emeralds would best match his eyes. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!\" You blushed slightly. \"Who told you that we were an item?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Mark , I've known the guy since grade school. We tell each other everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I've noticed.\" You shook your head. \"Listen, just keep this relatively quiet for now, okay? I mean, we're not keeping this a secret or anything, but the whole campus doesn't have to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Nik chuckled, \"it's kinda too late for that. Everyone's talking about you two.\" You gave him a puzzled look, so he continued. \"I mean, it's not everyday the of the tallest and, most attractive guy on campus who was the star quarterback and wrestling captian start to make out with you in the middle of the hall. Most people well take notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's not fair. We weren't making out in-- wait!What did you just say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what? About him being attractive?\" Nik grinned as he leaned back in his chair. \"You got to be honest he is good-looking.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to go back to your original question \"So, you also noticed that Luke grew a few inches and packed on a ton of muscle from yesterday \".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so?\" Nik shrugged. \"He's been that tall and muscular since he was sixteen. I'd chalk it up to genetics, but neither of his parents are anywhere close to his height and muscle mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were completely confused, and beginning to question your own sanity. Maybe Luke really had always been this big, and you didn't notice it until now. No, that's impossible .You remembered bening eye leveled with his pecs now your standing at his 8-pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNik looked down at his phone, and his eyes bulged as he noticed the time.  I'm gonna be late for chemistry. Talk to ya later, Mark!\u201d You didn\u2019t even notice as he jumped up and waved good-bye, as you were still lost in a fog of confusion about this whole situation. Nothing about any of this made any sense at all, and you felt your head begin to pound from all the confusion. What was going on?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Heart racing she looked down to see her modest, but nice breasts had been overwhelmed. Replaced with gargantuan breasts, each topped with ripe, juicy strawberry sized, and shaped nips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA caressing touch, found her increased sensitivity. In the simple chair, Alyssa, was still the same, a nice full C-cup girl. But now, more worrying she, Cassie was the bustier of the pair, the girlier of the two of them. A giggle slipped from her lips, as she imagined the returned punishment that'd be heading her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a hand over her proud flank, she wondered how it'd feel to burn at her spankings, to feel the pink outline of a hand print, from Alyssa's attention. A nervousness, drew her to cup, cradle and protect her expanded chest. The flesh sloshing over her slender arms, and squishing between her splayed fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cautious glance saw that her Mistress, was still asleep. But her own fear was driving her actions, and she tugged at the necklace. A warbling whimper slipped out, as her fingers traced around it.

The cruel delight in her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie babbled incoherently, only sounds emerging, rather than words, even protests. As in an instant she found cuffs wrapped then secured around her wrists. Her protests lacked voice, as she wasn't sure she objected. Her body was hot and bothered, undeniably turned on, and craving this control, this domination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuiding her with playful slaps to her thighs, and belly, she guided Cassie to their playroom. Until squirming and excited, Cassie danced on the spot. With a firm push to her svelte tummy, Cassie crashed backwards against the tin bath tub. Her legs collapsing, with a warm soapy splash, her broad ass soaking the wooden floor. She squirmed in the water, her excitement driven higher than she could resist. But with her hands bound, she was reliant on her mistress dealing with her pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/9dc51ddbb46fe38c9336200988a15d57/tumblr_oopedlqYcM1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/9dc51ddbb46f...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking her legs playfully in the air, arcs of warm suds flew through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I been a dirty, <b><i>dirty </i></b>girl.\" she purred to Alyssa's amused approval. She saw Alyssa's cheeks redden, flushing with her own building arousal. Kneeling by the tub, her arms dipped into the water, hidden by the bubbles, she traced her way along Cassie's smooth thighs, down to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurling her feet, in anticipation of an assault of tickling, she grunted and groaned, every breath a fight to restrain her sexual tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Alyssa once more clapped her in irons. A longer chain reaching between her ankles.

For one, her tiny height of five foot nothing meant that she had trouble passing for 16, forget 19, and for some reason that Jess couldn't quite place her finger on,  this older girl seemed to ooze a sexy feminine charm, with her tomboyish build and habits, and tiny stature. But Jess knew something she could place her finger on. Oh yes, that much she did know.<br>\n<br>\nShe simply couldn't help herself. One day, when Amy was visiting yet again, Jess decided the time was right. A swift move in the hallway had her grabbing the older girl around the waist and dragging Amy into her room. She put up a fight at first, but the shorter Amy soon conceded to the feisty blonde's insistence, and Jess could finally place her finger... Wherever she wanted!<br>\n<br>\nAmy's young look meant that no one would raise an eyebrow, as long as there wasn't anyone there who knew her. As long as they kept things in relative secrecy, they were free to enjoy their relationship to the fullest!<br>\n<br>\nHowever, things weren't going to stay that way. As if the hand of fate had decided to mock them, after giving them a loving relationship, it decided to take something else away...

Her father passed away years before, and her mother was not exactly pleased when Sarah brought her girlfriend around for dinner last year.

Also an avid cook, she is always trying new recipes, especially sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah lives with her girlfriend Isabella Montoya, a 20 year old 5' 3\" tall mixed heritage woman with long black hair and green eyes. Her mixed heritage leads to her having darker skin without being able to be called just one race by anyone who doesn't know her. She is moderately chubby with a slight belly, soft butt, and larger breasts (one of the few things she likes about her weight). Despite Sarah's loving care, Isabella doesn't like much about her weight and is always trying some new diet fad or exercise craze. This inevitably fail, and her weight continues to creep up (though Sarah's cooking is probably helping her weight go up as well).  Her parents are still together and and while they aren't one hundred percent about Sarah and Isabella being together, they are more than willing to let them find happiness wherever they can. Isabella mostly works as a stay at home tech support girl, usually through phone calls and video chats.

Her boss \u2013 a small Asian woman who was the namesake for the store \u2013 was in back, filling out what seemed to be a never ending stream of paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinkling of the bell at the front door jarred Sarah awake again, just as her head was about to bounce off of the counter again. Putting on her best salesperson smile, her smile shifted once again when she saw that it was Isabella, her girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, baby, I was coming to see if you wanted to go out for lunch, but it looks like you might be too busy,\u201d the Rubenesque woman said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll ever find time to eat with all of these customers demanding all my time,\u201d Sarah responded with a similar grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up off of the stool, she held her arms out, and Isabella moved in, first wrapping each other in a hug before trading a kiss. The sound of the curtain being pulled back caused them to break apart, finding Mrs. Tong coming out to check about a customer. Seeing that it was Isabella, she gave a huff and turned about to head into the back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind if I head out for lunch, ma\u2019am?\u201d Sarah said, hooking a thumb towards the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a mumble of agreement, Isabella grabbed Sarah\u2019s hand and started pulling her along. They stopped when Isabella\u2019s eyes alighted on a recent acquisition. It was\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a pair of necklaces lying together, fine gold chains coiled with one half of a split pendent hanging from each chain. A sharply defined split bisected the pendant so that the pieces fit together like puzzle pieces. The combined piece was a glossy dark jade circle, with a chain of symbols or letters from a language that Sarah didn\u2019t recognize forming a circle around the outer edge of the medallion. Isabella wasn\u2019t normally one drawn to flashy jewelry, but she did have a small number of pieces, and Sarah could see how Izzy might be attracted to the idea of both of them having a matching piece like this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t recognize this one actually,\u201d Sarah said, trying to keep quiet, but she still ended up attracting the attention of her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly sensing the possibility of a sale, the small Asian woman adjusted the glasses resting on her nose before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the Amulet of Maya, quite a long history behind it,\u201d Mrs. Tong started, her voice slowly dropping into what Sarah recognized as her sales pitch voice. The store owner would regularly spin a legend about each piece in the store, though most used to have stickers or brands marking their origins as a mass producing factory rather than something really worthy of a story. This one was no exception, with a legend of a pair of star-crossed lovers who had to meet in secret. One of their secret rendezvous took place in a deep cave within a nearby forest, and within the shadows, the pair discovered the split amulet. They took the necklaces so that both felt like they were connected to the other. Mrs. Tong continued on, saying something about how the lovers were forever changed by a magic hidden within the stone, and the necklaces were lost around then, passing through numerous owners throughout the centuries, all who experienced a curse or blessing from the necklaces \u2013 depending on who was asked \u2013, though Sarah had mostly tuned out at this point, only half heartedly listening to the sales patter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t seem to put Isabella off though because next thing Sarah knew, her arm was being tugged on as her girlfriend pleaded, \u201cLet\u2019s get them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Sarah asked, getting puppy dog eyes in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she sighed, pulled out her billfold, and gulped slightly at seeing the asking price. Another look over at Isabella got another begging look, so Sarah extracted the wad of bills to pay for the split necklaces. Taking your money, Mrs. Tong bowed her head before handing you your purchase and scurrying off to the back again. In a flash, you were only holding one of them, Izzy snapping up the other and holding it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped it over her head, pulling her hair through, before chuckling and saying, \u201cUh-oh, looks I\u2019m going to be getting hit by the curse and/or blessing now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gave a half hearted chuckle back, tucking her now lighter pocketbook away before slipping her new necklace on. Holding the pendent up to the light, she almost swore that she saw a brief glow within the green depths of the stone, but shrugged it off as a trick of the light. Her next thought is that circle of text split between the two pieces, but she wasn\u2019t given much time to think about it because Izzy was already pulling on her arm, heading out the door. Unseen by both, a glow blazed within the two pieces of the amulet.</span></div></div>",

Lunch was hurried but nice, each getting a sandwich and a drink at a nearby coffee shop. After eating, the pair shared another kiss before separating and going their own ways. Sarah returned to work and was almost as bored as before, though a couple other customers showing up did relieve some of the tedium. One seemed especially happy to purchase an odd coin with rough etchings of what appeared to be a man and woman facing each other and holding round swollen stomachs; every time that Sarah had looked at it, she thought that it looked like they were both pregnant. Throughout the day, Sarah kept unconsciously adjusting her shirt and her pants, still somehow unaware that she was slowly but surely gaining further weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen quitting time was here, Sarah bid Mrs. Tong good-bye and wandered back home. She didn\u2019t live far away, so in no time at all, she was walking in the door, listening to Izzy murmuring into her headset; sounded like she was having a lot of fun with whoever was on the other end of the line. Wandering over, Sarah planted a quick peck on her girlfriend\u2019s cheek, triggering a slight grin across the plump lips. Later, Izzy recounted the story of how the guy was very belligerent with her when his issues were beginning with the fact that his computer wasn\u2019t even connected to the screen. As they ate, Sarah noted how the brunette was starting to get a little pudgy looking around the middle, while Isabella noticed that Sarah seemed to be getting actual breasts, though she dismissed it as just a trick of the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the rest of the night, Isabella seemed to be getting a bit more amorous than usual. The two of them had an active love life, but this was moving into a whole other level. Not that Sarah really minded, she was feeling a bit of that passion just the same. The two of them barely paid attention to the shows they were watching after eating, more intent on making out on the couch. They even retired to bed earlier than usual, barely breaking apart to get undressed before Isabella pounced on Sarah, knocking her into bed. After several frantic bouts of lovemaking, the two women laid together, holding the other tight, their hands roaming each other\u2019s bodies, realizing something was different but too tired to figure out what it was. As they slept, the discarded necklaces glowed even brighter, filling their whole room with the light, and illuminating their bodies as they continued to grow fatter and fatter.</span></div></div>",

They had moved to the big city together for college, outside their parents' judgmental gaze, and both had never been happier. Rebecca was white and very pale with long flowing blond locks. She was thin and petite, barely measuring five feet, and with her very feminine appearance and personality had been the butt of many a good natured joke about her resemblance to a pixie. Currently, she stood in front of a full length mirror in a frilly pink outfit, closely examining her appearance for any superficial flaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia was a bit closer to average in size and personality. Her half-Korean heritage was apparent from her looks, and her rich black hair barely reached her shoulders. She lounged on their bed in a simple bra and panties combination, toying idly with her iPad. Mia scrolled through her apps, looking for the puzzle game she had been playing on the bus that afternoon, when she saw one app that she didn't recognize. \"Partner Changer.\" Her finger hovered over it for a moment before tapping the icon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, a flashing warning screen appeared. \"WARNING: Use of this app will result in extreme perversion, spontaneous development of fetishes, and an obsession with manipulating your partner. Agree?\" Mia clicked agree without reading. The terms of use were always a waste of time. The disclaimer was instantly replaced by the word \"Active,\" printed in white on the dark screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia? If you could change one thing about me, what would it be?\" Rebecca's high pitch voiced called out from across the bedroom. Mia almost replied with something cheesy like \"Nothing, you're perfect!\" but she felt a dark impulse overtake her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one thing? Well, we don't have sex enough. I'd want you to be way hornier.\" Suddenly, Rebecca felt her entire body heat up, her slit suddenly becoming wetter than she could remember it being. She began to moan quietly as a blush formed on her cute face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia wanted to check if Rebecca was okay, but another course of action suddenly occurred to her. \"Hornier than that,\" she said. Rebecca seemed like she was having trouble breathing, and began stumbling toward the bed. \"Mia...\" she muttered. A dark smile appeared on her partner's face, as her own arousal began to grow.</span></div></div>",

Attached was a leather leash, the opposite end of which was gripped tightly in Mia's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so tiny and feminine! I look like a boy next to you when we go out! I can't stand it any more, Rebecca!\" Rebecca whimpered in response. \"I'm s-s-orry Mia...\" she said, feeling slightly afraid of her partner, but now possessing an overwhelming desire to obey. \"Then do something about it! Get bigger! Right now the only big thing about you is your breasts!\" Mia spat, the idea of dominating a larger partner driving her wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca stood straight up as if she had heard a shot, and slowly found the world around her, including Mia, growing smaller. As she grew taller, her clothing became ill fitting, her top exposing her midriff and her skirt scandalously short. Soon, she was over seven feet tall, towering over Mia and nearly scraping her head on the apartment's low ceiling. She was even scrawnier looking now, a beanpole, but her breasts had remained proportionate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia yanked the leash, forcing Rebecca to bend over and face her. Roughly, she dragged the larger girl into a firm, sloppy kiss, pushing her tongue into her mouth. \"A horny giant of my own...\" Mia said as they separated. \"But you're not ready yet.\"</span></div></div>",

Sitting alone at his body's assigned desk and getting busy working on tonight's homework assignment for algebra. Ahead of time, as always. He wasn't going to get another chance once she swapped with him after school, she never really did trust him with her personal stuff outside of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pencils down class.\" said the teacher, Ms. Oldman. \"Pass your tests up to the front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier sighed as he finished the last of the homework for tonight. He had completed the exam about fifteen minutes into things, so he had plenty of free time to kill before time was up. It was a good thing to, after slouching all lunch, his usual period to finish up her homework, he had fallen slightly behind. Xavier's fears were realized when a dark shadow loomed over him as the bell rang. A teenage boy, tall, skinny, and with acne-ridden skin, blocked his path up from the desk. It was Ashley Dawns, in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgot to work during the day, did we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...\" Xavier sighed, stretching his body. It was a pain in the butt how the womanly assets seemed to drain his back of it's strength. How Ashley could walk around with these was anyone's guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better be careful buster. You know the deal, if you don't finish up my homework at the end of each day and raise my grades, I'll strip naked and start running down the halls. That will get you expelled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it Ashley,\" he replied. \"Here's your homework, now can we go to the bathroom so we can change back? I'm tired of being stuck as you for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley reluctantly ticked her tongue and swiped the homework out of his hands, he could tell she liked to torment him. The both of them got up and headed to the older part of the school, where no one ever bothered to go. There was an abandoned restroom there, it was perfect to make the switch in. Stepping into the old boy's restroom, they each picked a stall. Xavier stripped naked, tossed he clothes over to Ashley, and waited with his arms crossed on the toilet seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee, be done soon!\" she called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting in reply, Xavier surveyed Ashley's naked body, over the past month it had become as familiar to him as his own. She was the sort of person who didn't deny herself a few pleasures such as good food, so compared to Xavier's skinny boy body, she was nice, plump, and curvy. On the downside, she was also slightly short. It was a torment to reach for things on the higher shelves while transformed as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited patiently, Ashley's pudgy form slowly dissolved away back to his thin normal self. He felt himself grow taller and his vision rose. The long brown hair Ashley sported fell away to reveal short spiky black hair. Eventually his stall door was kicked open, much to his annoyance, to reveal Ashley in her normal body giggling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can never get over how 'small' you are in certain departments, Xav.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavier blushed. \"Shut up, where are my clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the other stalls. See you here tomorrow morning. Don't forget, we have that biology exam then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she skipped merrily out of the bathroom, leaving him alone and exposed. At least she had been kind enough to fold the clothes in a neat pile on the toilet seat. Xavier continued redressing himself and stepped out heading for home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past month, since Ashley discovered these weird powers to swap bodies with anyone by wearing their clothes, she had taken to tormenting Xavier because of his brilliance in academics. Ashley had never been the best student and desperately needed his help with homework and tests. Half the time, Xavier didn't even have a choice as Ashley would threaten to make a fool of him in public, like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides his help wit her schoolwork, Xavier wondered why Ashley loved to pick on him so much. She annoyed him, even when he was doing her work for her. Not that he minded doing extra homework. Xavier was the best student in the school, after all. His only flaw, as his teachers pointed out to him was that he was lazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Xavier walked home to start his own homework...</span></div></div>",

Seeing Chris only had a single bag, she added, \"Is that all your stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I got the rest in my truck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. Well, this is your room,\" she said as she opened a nearby door. Dropping his heavy duffel bag on the queen sized bed contained within, Chris rotated his shoulder and let out a soft groan as it popped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris O'Brian was a young man of 25. Standing at 6'0\" and 180 pounds, he cut a long, lean figure. His hair was a dirty blonde, and he wore a pair of black-framed spectacles to correct his near-sighted blue eyes. He hadn't shaved in the last few days, having slept in his truck, and unfortunately also smelled like it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had been sharing a house with another couple of guys, but it certainly hadn't ended well. Frankly, it sounded like something from a soap opera, only a fair bit worse. Grant had started dating Mike's sister, and Mike was not taking it well. Making that whole mess even worse was the final room mate, Peter. Pete, after a single discussion on philosophy with the sister, decided he was madly in love with her and they were destined to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as it turned out, both Mike and Peter were terribly violent. Overnight, the house became a hot bed of knives and threats. And then, once he learned that their Land Lady was working on evicting the lot of them for both failing to pay their rent and being a bunch of pigs, Chris decided enough was enough. And so, he'd loaded up his stuff, parked in his on-campus parking spot, and started hunting for a new place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShani Kensington, meanwhile, was a young woman of 21. Her maternal grandparents were of different castes, and had emigrated from India in order to be together. Despite her father's Irish and French background, with a bit of Norwegian mixed in for flavor, Shani was very much her mother's daughter. Her hair was jet black, and her skin was a soft caramel color, especially when compared with Chris' pale tones, freckles notwithstanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, \"soft\" was currently one of Shani's problems. Standing at a relatively tall 5'9\", she'd started her time at college at a lithe 120 pounds. Not fond of exercise and prone to regular overeating, Shani had steadily ballooned over the last couple of years, with a particularly large spike over the last six months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose last six months had also coincided with her failing relationship with Bruce. Bruce was, in a word, an ass. He was quite the heavy drinker, very rude, and very critical of everyone. And, as you might imagine, his favorite target was his rapidly widening girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mixture of spite and shame, mixed in with a fair bit of stress, saw Shani's consumption and weight shoot up in equal measure. Every time she outgrew another pair of pants or confirmed her belly was up another inch, she was filled with both dread at Bruce's razor tongue and a strange sense of pride at giving him a lardy middle finger. Regardless of her mixed feelings on the subject, Shani just kept right on eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time of their spectacular break up last month, Shani was at a hefty 265 pounds, a new personal high. Though her gains were in part intentional, Bruce's parting words, \"I can do better then an ugly, fat pig who can't stop stuffing her face,\" had sent her into quite a bout of depression eating. Given she'd already put on a whopping 135 pounds, more then doubling her body weight, Shani dreaded just how much bigger she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Shani and Chris had met each other through the campus gaming club, and had quickly become fast friends. Between classes and their equally chaotic lives, the two hadn't been present for much of the other's recent drama. They'd met up for supper at a nearby restaurant earlier this evening, and aired their mutual grievances over their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Shani heard that not only did Chris need a new place to stay, but had in fact been sleeping in his truck, she'd promptly offered him the extra room in her townhouse, and refused to accept \"no\" for an answer. In truth, Chris had only put up a token resistance, quite tired of being effectively homeless, especially with winter around the corner. He'd gratefully accepted, and had followed her car home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for letting me move in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, for the last time, don't mention it. You'd have done the same for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Chris asked while taking a seat on the bed, \"do we need to work out some sort of schedule for the bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Schedule?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't your room across the hall?\" Shani's place was a rented townhouse, with a small garage. On the main floor was the kitchen, living room, and a small dining area, as well as a two-piece bath. Upstairs, where they currently were, was two bedrooms with a three-piece bath directly between them. And, as Chris was about to learn, there was more to the basement then he assumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm in the basement suite. It's got its own bathroom. This one is all yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you planning another room mate for the other bedroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I just use it for storage.\" Shani didn't want to say that it had been Bruce's room before their break-up, and that she had a lot of bad memories in there. After he was out, she'd closed the door, and hadn't looked inside since. \"The washer and dryer is in the garage, just beside the deep freeze. It's honestly pretty small, so your truck won't fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. I can just park 'er out back.\" There was a line of parking spots just off the back lane, with a spot reserved for each townhouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fine driving on a dirt road?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My truck's been through worse,\" Chris said as he rose to his feet. \"As much as I'd like to take a shower and collapse right now, I should probably get the rest of my stuff in before it gets too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you a hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris thought back to how hard Shani had been breathing from climbing that flight of stairs once, and she hadn't even been carrying anything. Chris thought to himself, <i>\"And if she's in that bad of shape...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need, Shani. You're already letting me stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. We can just put it in the spare bedroom for now and deal with it tomorrow. With the two of us, it'll be no sweat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus... *pant, gasp* ...fucking... *pant, gasp*... Christ,\" Shani gasped out between strained breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rapid and significant weight gain, coupled with a total lack of even the most minuscule amount of exercise, had left her poor muscles woefully unprepared to handle several flights of stairs period, let alone with a load. The first trip had seen her already panting and sweating, and by the end of the second, she had to sit on the bed and take a break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had managed two more trips while she was resting, checking up on her both times, and Shani forced herself to her feet afterwards, desperate to avoid forcing him to do all the work. She only managed a single trip this time, collapsing on the bed while he did the final trip alone. It certainly hadn't escaped her notice that his loads had been significantly larger then her own, even had they done an equal number of trips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Am I really that out of shape?\"</i> Shani thought, her chest heaving as she wiped the sweat from her brow. She didn't notice anything when Bruce was moving out. Of course, as she thought about it, she realized that she'd merely supervised from the ground floor, refusing to help him in the slightest, only climbing those two flights to check afterwards and make sure he hadn't stolen or damaged anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris, meanwhile, was feeling very conflicted. On the one hand, he was legitimately worried about her. For Shani to be so exhausted after so little work, and still struggling to catch her breath after such a long time, she must be in appalling shape. Her rapid expansion over the short time they'd been friends had also been quite shocking, and despite some of his hopes otherwise, she still seemed to be piling on the pounds even without Bruce in the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other, he was entranced by her body. Though he hadn't admitted it publicly to anyone, Chris had always loved fat women, and Shani had firmly entered fat territory. Her pot belly was a fair bit larger then it had been when he last saw her. Divided into two large rolls, it had wobbled magnificently with each heavy step. Her round thighs and enlarged posterior had a significant and flabby bounce that he hadn't failed to notice as he climbed the stairs behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she caught her breath in front of him, he couldn't help but notice her breasts, and what a pair they were. She was unquestionably a D, if not an E. Nothing was left to the imagination in a skin-tight white spaghetti strapped top. It was clear that her bra was too small for her massive mammaries, and their mass was certainly lard, as they rippled like jelly with each shuddering breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatters were made more complicated by his feelings towards her. He'd had a crush on Shani since they'd met, but it always seemed one or the other was taken at the wrong moment. Chris had, by this point, all but settled on just being her friend, but it wasn't easy at a moment like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that he realized that he'd totally missed on Shani saying something. \"Sorry, I zoned out. Come again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appeared to have (mostly) caught her breath, and if she'd noticed him staring, she gave no sign. \"I said, since we've now got all your stuff inside, what do you want to do now?\"</span></div></div>",

I've acquired a certain... patina over the last few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I wasn't going to say anything, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch. You wound me,\" Chris said while Shani giggled. Deftly trying to avoid noticing the wonderful jiggles her laughter sent through her soft body, he added, \"You could grab a couple movies while I knock off a layer of grease. Should only take me about ten minutes or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works for me,\" Shani said as she leaned forward to rise. The movement squished her bloated rolls and moved her breasts in some rather enticing ways, and it was with great difficulty that Chris looked away before she looked up. \"I'll grab a couple titles and see you down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. I'll be down in a just a minute.\" His eyes were locked on Shani's bouncing rump as she walked out the door. As he shut the door, Chris couldn't help but eye up her thick back rolls, squeezing enticingly around her tight bra strap, and slightly damp with sweat. As the door clicked shut, he rested his head against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh. My. God. This cannot end well.\"</i> Chris couldn't help but kick himself a little. He just couldn't keep his eyes off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is ridiculous. She's just out of a bad relationship, and doesn't need you drooling over her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, some compliments would certainly help her ego right now. And she really does deserve them. I mean, the only thing hotter then a fat woman is one that's getting fatter, and she's been gaining so much, so quickly. I wonder how much bigger she's going to get...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, man, get it together. This is Shani you're talking about.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaming his rather distracted mind on several days of poor sleep, Chris grabbed his towel and shower supplies, and made his way into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris made his way down, smelling and feeling fresh for the first time in a good while. As he reached the bottom of the stairs, he saw Shani was seated upon the couch, remote in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd obviously been to her room at some point, as she'd changed out her white top for a well worn pink sweater. Chris did feel a little bad with himself for how disappointed he felt at that fact. Sitting down next to her, he noticed a sweet, rosy smell. <i>\"She must have freshened up before getting changed.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was given a bit of a shock when he sat down, as Shani leaned over and took a deep sniff off his right shoulder. \"Ah, that's so much better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA coy smile crossed his face. \"Implying something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You smelled like a wildebeest in heat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just rude,\" Chris said to another giggle. \"Did we want to order pizza or something before we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShani's gaze briefly dropped to her belly, which was currently stretching the knitted yarn of her sweater. \"Oh, I don't know. I mean, we did just eat about an hour ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, it's my treat. Just to celebrate my moving in.\" A soft gurgle came from Shani's stomach, bringing a blush to her cheeks. \"It seems like you could use a snack anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay,\" she said as she rubbed her double-rolled belly as discretely as she could. Though she didn't want to admit it aloud, Shani was feeling a bit hungry. She'd gotten very used to eating as much as she wanted, whenever she wanted, and while she wasn't actually dieting, she was a little self-conscious of her recently expanded girth. She grimaced as she said, \"not like I need it, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be hard on yourself. You're gorgeous,\" Chris said as he tapped away on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShani's blush got a little darker. She smiled and snuggled into Chris' shoulder. He looked over in surprise at the young woman leaning against him. As he looked at her, he became aware through touch and sight that she wasn't currently wearing a bra, having likely shed it when she put on her sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't mention it,\" Chris stammered as he clicked send on the order. \"So, w-what did you pick for a movie?\"</span></div></div>",

Jet black hair, a well toned body, bright blue eyes... But it wasn't just the looks that made him a knock out for Cat. He was kind, always said hello to her whenever he saw her. He knew a fair bit about anime and manga, which Cat worshiped like the geek she was. And he was generally a nice person. He did charity work on the weekends. CHARITY WORK! Who wouldn't like Alex? Everyone in school knew him, and there were few people that had something bad to say about him. He was perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, okay, almost perfect...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat yelped as a hand smacked her in the back of her head. Unfortunately it belonged to the last person Cat wanted to notice her ogling Alex from her desk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at there, flat-girl?\" It was Marlene, the biggest bitch that ever bitched at a car-full of bitches. Sadly she was also Alex's current girlfriend, much to Cat's constant dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...Just doodling as always, <i>Marlene</i>.\" She answered, Cat hated being called flat-girl due to her features. Or rather, lack of thereof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene huffed, and released Cat's dyed orange head. \"I saw you, you were watching my man again. You chibi-obsessed freak. You do it one more time and I'll cut off all that orange hair of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat waited until she was back at her desk before muttering. \"Bitch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene wasn't exactly a nice person, especially not to Cat. Most people around the school knew her almost as well as they did Alex, though usually not for very good reasons. She had the WORST attitude imaginable. One time she knocked a small kid down and made him cry, just because he accidentally cut in front of her while in line. Who knew why Alex liked her enough to date her. Maybe she threatened him or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, there was her body. In comparison to Cat's no curved body, Marlene looked like a stripper. She had hit puberty early, after all. Considering they were all only in their Freshman year of high school, that made Marlene the biggest girl in the grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sucked. Alex was the one for Cat, and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the bell for study hall rang. School was over and Cat could get home and drown out her sorrows with some good anime. Just as she was about to leave, she felt a slap on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cat! What did Marlene say to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned. It was her best friend, and fellow geek, Tandy Birley. Tandy was more of a goth though, and appropriately wore dark attire and make-up. Of course, in truth, she came from a very well-to-do family, though she'd never exploit her money for popularity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing Tan. The usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk. You sure I can't hire a hit-man for you? Dad can probably find a good one, real easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat laughed. \"No that's alright. I wouldn't want to get YOU in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tut tut. Assassin's aren't expensive for no reason, but if you're sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made it to the doorway, but Alex got there before them. Being courteous, he motioned for them to go on through first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you, ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat blushed but didn't say anything, Tandy answered for her. \"Thank Al.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe warmly smiled at them, while Marlene glared at Cat from behind him. Wasn't Cat's fault, Marlene said nothing about Alex HIMSELF speaking to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls went to Cat's house to work on some homework and watch anime together. Spending time with Tandy usually put her mind off things, the two had been inseparable friends since the beginning of school last fall. But of course, thoughts of Alex and how to win him over always filled Cat's head. No matter what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels good to have everything done at last for the week.\" Said Tandy as she stretched, having finished their last assignment. \"Tomorrow's Friday, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Cat was exceptionally more brighter than Tandy, and usually finished before her. \"Need help with anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Just gotta do that stupid reading. What was it again?\" She did several finger quotes. \"<i>Ancient Magical Studies and Relations to Animals</i>. What a load of bull, I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat laughed a little nervously. She hadn't mentioned it before, but her parents were both druids and into that sort of beliefs. She had just never brought it up with anyone before, the last thing she needed was more ammunition against her when it came to her whole Marlene issue. Of course, she herself had never really looked into the magical beliefs of her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to get dad to drive you home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'll walk. No one wants to go near anyone who looks like a vampire in the middle of the night anyway. Later Cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left, and the room got depressingly quiet. Leaving Cat alone with her thoughts about Alex again. She looked at the clock, \"9:30\". A little early for bed, but there was nothing else to do tonight anyway. She went to her bed and noticed that there was something on top of the covers, it appeared to be a small box with a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what's this?\" Cat said to herself, picking up the note to read it. \"<i>'Cat. This is a little something from your father and I. It's a lucky coin. For years it's given me tons of luck and something tells me you need that luck right about now. Don't mention it. Mom.'</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the box, Cat found a very small silver coin. It looked really old, like hundreds of year old. But on the face was a very clear indentation of a cat. Hah, funny. Just like her name. And her favorite animal to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed the cat with her thumb. \"Huh, lucky coin? Well I certainly could use a lot of luck right about now. How about you work whatever magic on helping me get noticed by Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat half-expected there to be a sudden spark of magic, like in Cinderella. Maybe bring her up a cup side at least, something! Nothing happened though and she sighed, placing the coin on her bed stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic? Yeah right, time for bed.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a spring in Cat's step today, a feeling she hadn't had in a long time. Indeed it had been awhile since she was actually looking FORWARD to school instead of dreading its very existence. Either it was the magic of the coin, if there were such a thing, or a late growth spurt. Either way, Cat was noticeably bigger all around. So much so that her clothes were a little tight on her, but still not unwearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hummed her way through breakfast and almost forgot to say goodbye to her parents before taking off to the bus, though her mother seemed to eye her the whole time with both a look of suspicion and amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, she practically ran towards the school looking for Tandy to tell her the good news. She was in such a hurry that she mistakenly ran into someone, and knocked their books over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpringing instantly to her feet with an unusual amount of agility, she apologized. \"Oh crap! I'm sorry about that! I didn't see you and was in a hurry, my ba-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped, for it was Alex who she knocked over! He chuckled. \"It's alright Cat, no harm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, she tried to give a reply. \"U-uh huh. W-well, a-again I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex eyed her curiously. \"Say, you look different. Did you get a haircut or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath. \"Yesididnowifyouexcusemeireallygottaberunningalexokaysorryagainbye.\" And in instant she ran for the doors of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex blinked several times. \"Huh. Well that was sure weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy laughed at Cat over lunch. \"So you ran right into him!? Smooth, girl. Real smooth.\" She took another sip of her coffee while Cat sat there blushing. \"By the way, did you get a haircut or something? You look different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right! The thoughts of the coin had completely slipped her mind the entire day. \"Oh right! I forgot to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached into her pocket and pulled out the silver coin with a cat on it, gently placing it in Tandy's palm. The goth stared at it, trying to figure it out before saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a coin so what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom left it on the bed last night. I don't know what's up about it, but when I woke up,\" She gestured to her chest. \"I was 'bigger' for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy snapped her fingers. \"THAT'S it! You look bigger, and not just there. Here stand up for a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat obeyed, and was stunned by what she saw. Normally Tandy was a good few inches taller than her. Today, they were exactly the same height, a little more than 5'4 each. Tandy reached up at the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about that, even exactly. And that's not all! Look at your nails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat hadn't even noticed the sharpened points on her nails all day! They almost looked like... \"...Claws?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy chuckled. \"Feeling catty today, Cat?\" She held up the coin, the picture of the cat beamed in the reflection of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...Now that I think about it, that's really weird. Do you think...Do you think the coin had anything to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy flipped the coin back to Cat. \"You know me Cat. I don't believe in that hocus pocus, mumbo jumbo stuff. Still there's always such a thing as a good luck charm. Why not hold onto it and see what happens tomorrow? Who knows? Maybe you're really be a Cat-girl.\" She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...A Cat-girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell for gym rang, Cat's least favorite period. Marlene ALWAYS loved to pick on her with a practical joke. One time, she and a few other girls were able to steal her clothes from her locker and toss them in the boy's locker room. Cat was a little too deep in thought to notice that Marlene and a group of sophomores were snickering as she made her way to her locker. She opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPLUOSH! Someone had jammed a hose through the back of the locker wall and into Cat's locker! Water poured out like a fire hose, getting Cat soaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Hey! Stoppit!\" She cried out to no avail, getting thrown to the floor due to the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally one of the girls in the group had the kindness to turn off the hose, but Cat was still the laughing stock of the locker room. All of her homework and books were completely soaked and ruined. As she coughed out some of the water in her lungs, Marlene walked over to her and sneered. Cat returned a glare. The bitch had gone a little too far this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, a pent up anger rose to a boiling point. A red hot flare filled Cat's head and she stood up to face Marlene. The girl was still a good few inches taller than Cat and didn't feel threatened, returning the glare. Smugness was in her eyes. Cat filled them. She hated everything about that stupid bitch. This was just stepping over the line now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Cat took a swipe at Marlene's face, expecting only to give her a small scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, blood poured in the air and Marlene cried in pain. Where Cat's fingernails had hit was thee gigantic slash marks going down her right cheek, blood was seeping everywhere. Tears were welling in Marlene's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww y-you little witch! What the hell did you do that for!? OWW! It hurts! It hurts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir other classmates were rushing to Marlene's aid, the sophomores were all giving Cat some really nasty looks. She got scared, she didn't mean to hurt Marlene! She just snapped, it was an innocent mistake right!? However, the blood all over the floor told a different story. Sensing danger, Cat ran out of the locker room, trying to get away. About this time, she started crying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the office was a phone booth, where students could make private calls. It was an ideal hiding spot, especially if you wanted to be alone. Cat sat on the bench, quietly sobbing; she was drenched in wet clothes and had blood on her fingers. She'd be lucky enough not to get expelled after something like this! Everyone saw what happened, Cat attacked Marlene first. No one was going to believe she didn't purposely mean to hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday started out great, and now was looking absolutely terrible. So much for showing off to Tandy and Marlene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cat wiped her nose, there was a tap on the glass door that startled her. Someone was outside the phone booth! It was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cat's heart just about stopped. The last person she wanted to have him see her like this, Alex was knocking with a concerned look on his face. Quickly, she tried to wipe the rest of tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alex! S-sorry I was just u-using the...p-phone. I'm done though I-I'll get out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan to open the door and get out of there as fast as possible. Alex, however, pressed down on the glass preventing her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast. First, tell me why you were crying in there Cat.\" There wasn't a hint of anger in his voice, and judging by what he said he probably didn't know about the incident in the locker room yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I wasn't crying...I was j-just...Ummm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation couldn't get anymore awkward. It was one of those moments were all the heat in your body went to your head, and you felt like you wanted to die just to end the torture. Alex wasn't giving her any relief though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat, come on. That's not a good answer. I'm not going to tell anyone, you can trust me.\" His voice was calm and clear, yet authoritative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere really was no safe way out of this. Cat felt exactly like in the position she was in, trapped in a small box with no way out. What point was there in hiding this from Alex? He was Marlene's boyfriend. He was going to find out about it sooner or later. Yes, she had to tell him about here and now. Maybe he'd take some pity on her if he heard the story from her perspective first rather than Marlene's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-promise not to get mad, a-alright Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerity was in his eyes. \"Promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...M-Marlene and some girls from the s-sophomore year shoved a h-hose in my gym locker-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They shoved a hose in your gym locker?\" Asked Alex, clearly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh huh...Then, when I o-opened the door they turned it o-on. E-everything I had on me got r-ruined including my homework. I s-swear I didn't mean to. I just got SO a-angry with her. I swiped a-at her with my fingernails. I...I  think I cut her really badly, t-there was blood everywhere. I-I ran away and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was eagerly listening the whole time. He opened his mouth to say something, then closed it as if having second thoughts. Cat was grateful that he didn't look the least bit angry, at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...\" He finally said. \"I'll have to have a talk with her. And the principle, so you don't get in trouble for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The principle!? But I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't worry about it. You snapped.\" He smiled warmly. \"These things happen. Come on, I saw you were under a lot of stress this morning when you ran into me. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe released the glass door at last. \"You just weren't thinking at the time, I mean you got really sharp nails. But it's not like you killed someone, the worst she'll get is a few stitches. She'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, he reached out a hand which Cat took. He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're completely soaked, you might want to go change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, everything on her was wet and water logged. Her already tight clothing looked even tighter on her now, especially with the T-shirt around the breast area. Something she wasn't exactly used to. She noticed Alex was staring at her as well. Yelping, she covered her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your eyes...\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't mean to stare. You have really nice eyes is all.\" He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh...thank you...I-I guess...\" Little did she realize, her eyes had become cat-like over sleep the last night. A small change she neglected to notice due to not looking properly in a mirror before school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBRRRRRRRING! The end of class bell went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops! That's the bell, crap. You don't have a lot of time! Better hurry!\" He turned to run for class. \"See you later Cat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was still in her own little world trying to put together what had just happened in the few short minutes she had alone with Alex. She whispered weakly \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Um...Okay...Bye...</font>.\"</span></div></div>",

Thankfully it was merely history class, and Professor Fry didn't seem too bothered by her late entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss. Hill?\" Asked the fifty year old professor, fixing his glasses. \"Do you have your assignment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold bead of sweat dripped down Cat's back. She reached into her bag and pulled out a soggy wet wad of paper. It looked more like a giant inky spitball after being sprayed by the hose in the locker room. Professor Fry shook his head as she placed in on his desk and took her seat next to Tandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Very well then. Continuing with the review on Magic and History-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat took a deep breath of relief, despite having everything gone totally wrong in the past hour things weren't turning out too terribly. Tandy took the time to whisper to her, about the usual gossip while Professor Fry was busy with the lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst! What the hell did you do to that girl, Cat!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was truthfully hoping to avoid this conversation until Monday, or at least the weekend. Word traveled fast apparently. \"I don't know...I just sort of had enough of her. I only meant to swipe at her-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swipe at her!? Some kids are talking about her needing a new FACE! Boy, you stirred up the hive big time Cat. The whole school knows about it already! There was an ambulance here and everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, can we talk about this later? I want to catch up on what I missed.\" Professor Fry had given her a bit of a glare. She was probably on thin ice as it was already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Sure. I need to talk to you about something anyway. Let's meet at your place after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat had never been so thankful to get out of school. Everywhere she went in the hallway, all she heard was gossiping about her confrontation with Marlene. Some of them were getting so outlandish and insane that she was half tempted to turn around and yell at the people speaking. Seriously, someone said that she had literally bit Marlene's face off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when Tandy and her were safe and sound on the sidewalk did she finally start talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never want to go back to school again. Ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy laughed and patted her on the back. \"Cheer up. I actually paid attention today in history class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodie for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good, for you as well once you hear what I learned. You'll be glad you actually help me with these homework assignments for once. C'mon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her by the hand and started running for Cat's home. Cat had to be careful not to dig her fingernails into her friend's arm, but could still strangely keep up with her just fine. Cat's parents weren't going to be home till dinner, as usual for a Friday night. Meaning Tandy and her had the whole house to themselves discuss whatever she had discovered. Tandy didn't hesitate to lock the door to Cat's room anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then reached into her backpack and pulled out the reading meant for history class today. There were several parts highlighted in a hastily manner, it looked like she scrambled to get every down while the teacher was talking. Something Tandy probably wasn't used to, never being one to pay attention in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat finally answered to the sheet of paper shoved in her face. \"So...what? You took notes in class. Well done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read!\" Tandy violently tapped the highlighted bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her usual super-fast reading, Cat skimmed through the page with relative ease. It mentioned a lot about the old druids that existed around the town in the past, but as it went on it got more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat read one bit of it aloud. \"...Some of the old druids would worship animal deities. Members of their cults would create symbols like COINS of their respective gods, believing they possessed some MAGICAL proprieties!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat reached into her pocket and pulled out the cat coin. \"You got yourself a magically druid coin there, girl.\" Smirked Tandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...How...? I mean there's got to be some sort of logical explanation to this-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't you the girl who said she always wanted to cast spells and learn magic when she was still in middle school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Yes but-\" Cat sat on her bed, she massaged her forehead with her fingers. \"Tandy...This is all too much to take in all at once. I mean first the changes, then that thing with Marlene, now this...I'm going to have a nervous breakdown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy frowned and tried to crack a joke. \"No, me doing my midterm project two hours before it was due was a nervous breakdown. Have you talked to your parents about this yet? Your mom gave you the coin right? Maybe she knows something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they won't be back till dinner either...I don't think I want to wait for them that long either. I just want to go to bed and sleep through this whole mess...\" Cat reached for her pillow, only now noticing it had been torn to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well listen,\" Said Tandy, patting her nervous friend on the back. \"Things will be alright, okay Cat? I made a small 'list' so to speak so you can record any changes the next day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to help Cat...If you're really not in the mood for this I'll let you get some sleep, alright? I'll just leave this here.\" Tandy put the notepad on Cat's bed stand. Cat wasn't hearing any of it though, and had the remains of her pillow covering her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no getting through to her, Tandy quietly gathered her things and let her friend sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

Nothing stood in her way, everything was so simple and so fun. It was...invigorating. She felt free, for once. Not trapped, not a geek, just herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had to be dark out, maybe midnight judging by where the moon was in the sky. For some reason, she could see perfectly though. Every star in the sky and every little blade of grass clear as crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town was virtually empty at this hour, save for a few cars that drove by. Some even spotted her and slowed to a stop, but Cat didn't mind them noticing her. Her figure silhouetted the moon as she sprung into the air and landed in a dark alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled, she was hungry. Thankfully there was a few trashcans nearby, and at this point it didn't make any difference where she got the food. Her furry hands reached out grabbed the lid. Then all of a sudden, someone was shouting something at her. A man with a flashlight and security guard outfit was shining a flashlight at her, he was yelling something she couldn't make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat, it's time to wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Cat sat up from her bed with a start, breathing heavily. She stared at her hands, no difference from yesterday and they even still had the claws. It wasn't like in her dream though, no fur like a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Cat, it's time to wake up.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no one in her room, the door had been closed since after school yesterday when Tandy left. After school... How long had she been asleep!? She couldn't have passed out later than 4 PM! She checked the clock: \"9:00 AM\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...\" Cat covered her face. \" That's what? Seventeen hours of sleep? I've never been asleep that long be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand brushed against something out of place on her head. Suddenly she recalled the changes from last morning. Cat scrambled for her bedroom mirror, she had changed more overnight, she was sure of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the mirror, she sulked her shoulders in depression. Cat ears! Pointy little car ears were poking out of her medium length orange hair. Worse too, Cat was sure she was just a little bit taller than before, if only an inch. Today was already proving to be a terrible, terrible day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a handful of ear in both hands, she pulled down trying to think what to do. How the hell was she supposed to hide something like this? Nails and a little height were one thing, but actual giant cat ears!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax Cat...\" She tried to talk herself down. \"You can find something to hide it...It's no big deal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe month being late May, there was little winter clothing she could cover herself up with. Cat spent days begging her parents to let her dye her hair orange, so she hadn't invested in any good hats either. There was one thing she could try though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing an absolute fan-girl for the Naruto series, Cat had purchased a large blue lead headband. For cos-play purposes mostly, but there was a fat chance of that happening now. Still the headband would make an ideal thing to hide her ears with. She snatched it and went to her mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new ears had the full nervous system of her old ones, and didn't respond too well with being tugged on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" Yelled Cat, adjusting her ears so they completely hid from view. Easier said than done though, they felt like they were being twisted around to the point of ripping off. But at least no one could tell from a glance that she had real car hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door just as Cat finished. It was...</span></div></div>",

Man, you slept like a dead person! Say...What's with the headband? Halloween's not for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat clasped the areas where her new cat ears were and lied. \"Nothing. Just felt like wearing it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy wasn't buying it though, and squinted her eyes in suspicion. \"Caaaaaat. Come on now, did you change again overnight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was slowly backing into the corner of her room. \"No! Please Tandy, can't we just drop it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff, no that would be the kind and respectful thing to do. Friends get on your case about these things until you want to kill them.\" She grinned and dove at Cat. \"Now give me the headband!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat had trapped herself in the corner so there was no dodging Tandy, the goth girl tugged at her headband while Cat tried to keep it on her head with both hands. Tandy dangled on a loose portion of the cloth, though the strain was getting to the material. Eventually a tearing sound was heard, followed by a SNAP and a THUD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy was on the floor holding half of the ripped headband. She looked up and saw Cat, closing her eyes with two giant cat ears peaking out of her orange hair. Tandy tired to fight the laugh, but couldn't resist and started cracking up, pounding the floor in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! I'm- Haha- Sorry Cat! It's just- Hah- You look ridiculous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat's ears drooped. \"I know...How am I supposed to go outside now though!? I didn't have anything else to cover these things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy wiped a few tears from her eyes. \"Sorry, *sniff*. Hah! I really needed that laugh...Don't you have a hoodie or a hat? Something more...natural to wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I did I wouldn't have worn the headband...Thanks for ripping it to pieces by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy sighed and reached for the clipboard on Cat's nightstand. \"Well, tell you what. We'll go shopping and I'll get you a new one. Hell, we might want to go look into new clothing for you anyway. Did you grow again last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat looked down, her stomach was visible at the bottom of her shirt. \"I think I might have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, so that's cat ears and a little height today...\" Tandy mumbled to herself, scribbling something on the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recording your changes on a daily basis. This might be important, especially if you change completely into a cat-girl. Who knows? Maybe we can estimate how much time you have left being normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat's ears were drooped again. \"Well that's...comforting...\" She decided to not tell Tandy about her dream last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy grinned to try and cheer her up. \"Oh come on, this isn't bad. At the rate you're going I'd say you have a week left. But you can always hide everything, I mean your nails you can cut right? And ears and a tail, if you ever grow one, should be easy enough to hide under clothing. That's why we need to go clothes shopping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Cat tugged on her ears again, they certainly were distracting. \"How am I supposed to get to the mall like this without a headband though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to ask...\" Muttered Cat. The only thing they could think of to hide her ears was to give her a turban made of some towels from the bathroom. She felt completely ridiculous, and was considering just going through the mall exposing the ears altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax and ignore the stares.\" Comforted Tandy. \"You're doing great so far. Once we get to the store you can go into a changing booth and I'll grab you a hat to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mall was a major, major place of gathering for teenagers their age. It had an arcade, a movie theater, and dozens of stores making it the ideal teenage hangout. Of course, there would be tons of kids from their classes around which didn't help Cat's predicament. Thankfully, it was still pretty early in the day but by noon the place would be filled with the Saturday rush crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust so long as they didn't bump into someone they knew really well, they would be fine.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course, as luck would have it, the moment Tandy and Cat were steps away from the entrance to the clothing store a familiar voice called out to the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey! Cat, Tandy!\" It was Alex, Marlene was also with him though she didn't seem as enthusiastic to see the two girls as Alex did. \"Just the two people I wanted to see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy whispered to Cat. \"Just play it cool.\" Easier said than done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy greeted the couple first. \"Hey Alex. Hello Marlene...\" Marlene just sneered. There was a large white medical cloth held together with tape on the right side of her cheek. Cat tried not to make eye contact with the girl, thought she could feel Marlene's eyes glaring holes in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the the turban?\" Alex asked, pointing at the white bath towel wrapped around Cat's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Uh...I had a bad hair day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, one of THOSE days huh? Well maybe this will cheer you up.\" Alex dug into his pockets. \"You guys like anime and manga, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smiled and pulled out two white pieces of paper. \"You know about the Anime-Con down in Summerset this Monday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anime-Con!\" Cat unexpectedly blurted out. \"Those tickets are IMPOSSIBLE to get! Tandy and I tried for weeks and...and...\" Cat suddenly realized that everyone was staring at her. \"Uh, I mean...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex laughed. \"It's alright. I happened to get four free tickets from a friend who didn't want them, and since no one else I know seems interested in the sort of thing I figured you guys, Marlene, and me could go together!\" He offered the two tickets to Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cat refused. \"Well...T-that's nice of you Alex, b-but I don't think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy took the tickets for her. \"Thank you, Alex. We'll meet you guys Monday. Uh, what time though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It opens at 9 AM, so I'd say around eight would be good. There will probably be an hour long wait to get in though, some people actually camp outside the night before to get in first. Oh, and we'll have to skip school but getting an excuse won't be a problem for you girls, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy rubbed the back of her head. \"Well I've skipped too many classes already...But I guess one more day wouldn't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, Cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I can p-probably make it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! We'll stop by your place at eight on Monday then! Oh, and be sure to bring a costume. I hear you get in easier if you go costumed, anything will do. There's going to be every of kind of characters there; anime characters, game characters, heck there might even be cat-girls...\" Marlene gave Alex a nasty look. She didn't seem too thrilled about going, and even less about inviting Cat and Tandy to come along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, sorry to interrupt your shopping, see you Tan. Later, Cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene tugged Alex by the collar of his polo shirt to lead him away from the two girls as quickly as possible. Cat turned to Tandy in a mad panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you take the tickets!? We can't go with Alex! And with me like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy sighed. \"Relax, this is a good time for you to try to make a move on Alex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tandy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being serious. And don't worry about going there like that. You'll be in costume remember? He won't notice a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...already have something for me to wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I think I have something in mind that will work just perfectly. Tandy gave an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was well past noon when Cat and Tandy finally finished their shopping. Cat eventually settled on a large floppy cap that hid her cat ears perfectly, though they still felt squished and uncomfortable. They had also purchased plenty of concealing clothing, which was on sale considering the warmer weather of spring. It made Cat relax a bit that even if she was going to completely turn into a cat-girl, she could at least hide her entire body so no one would notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incoming summer heat though was not something she was looking forward to though. The thought of having to trug around in a winter coat all summer was not a pleasant one, indeed. Tandy had made up for ripping her ninja headband by buying her a new one, as well as several new DVDs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were walking down the main street of their town now, there were plenty of alleyways and old buildings. It gave the town a certain old fashion flare to it. Cat almost did a double-take when they passed by the alley she remembered in her dreams, but they quickly moved on. She never said a word about her nightmare to Tandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they neared home...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cat's house was just a few streets away, they had decided to take a small shortcut through the darker alleyways. The town they were in wasn't known for its crime, exactly. However, every once in awhile there would be some sort of robbery or mugging. Cat's luck had been nothing but terrible today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat heard footsteps behind them when they were halfway down the backstreet, Tandy didn't seem to notice anything. Cat looked behind them and saw nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Cat?\" Asked Tandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear footsteps...or something?\" Cat was sure that someone had been walking directly behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy looked nervous, she was the kind of person who scared easily. \"Footsteps? Come on now girl, don't scare me today... I still have nightmares about what you did with the tomato sauce...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being serious. \" Said Cat, scanning behind them one last time. \"I think we're being followed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're creeping me out. Maybe it's just a hobo...or something. Come on, let's get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy went on ahead, and Cat slowly followed. She was absolutely positive she heard footsteps tailing them. Maybe it was just because her thumping heartbeat banged like in a drum in her ears, but she couldn't hear the footsteps anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look there's the street again...Come on catch up\" Said Tandy as she pointed to the light of a nearby street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a large man in a trench coat jumped from behind the corner, he was armed with a black pistol. Tandy screamed, dropping her bags to the floor. The man violently grabbed her around the mouth and aimed the gun right at her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up you stupid bitch.\" He ripped her purse from her hands and shoved it into one of the pockets of his giant coat. He then pointed the gun at Cat. \"You, hand over your purse too or your friend here gets her head blown off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat couldn't move. It was like she was paralyzed with fear. Her tongue felt swollen, she couldn't say a word. Every cell in her body screamed for her to drop the purse and run. But she couldn't get herself to move, her body only shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear me? You stupid git.\" He was now aiming the gun directly at Cat. He cocked the gun. \"Drop the purse. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy yelled something, but with the giant man's hand over her mouth it only came out in inaudible mumbles. She probably was telling Cat to do what he said, and they'd be alright. Cat still didn't do anything, her eyes were just widened in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumb bitch...\" The man pulled the trigger. Cat watched the bullet slowly come out of the muzzle, then slow down...Stopping just a few inches from the front of the gun. In fact, everything had slowed down to stop. Strangely enough, everything had turned a black and white grayish tone as well. Time had frozen itself, though Cat still couldn't move. She held her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You're pathetic, you know that Cat?\"</i> Said a voice, as clear as day. It sounded like someone was whispering in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...Who said that?\" Cat thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice gave a sigh. <i>\"It doesn't matter. Do you want to die?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Do you want to die?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat stared at the bullet, frozen in place at the barrel of the gun. It was going to kill her. She looked at the man, there was nothing but coldness in his blank dead eyes. Tandy's eyes had a look of surprise and fear in them, she must have been thinking she was about to see her friend die that very second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I want to live.\" Cat decided at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice gave a short laugh. <i>\"Then, leave everything to me. It will be over in just a few seconds.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nColor was returning to the scene in front of Cat. Time was returning, Cat panicked but put faith in the voice. Her body was no longer in her control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! The sound of the bullet being fired finally escaped the gun. Cat very clearly saw it coming right at her, but it was still slow. Like a balloon filled with air floating in space. Cat felt her body drop the bags she was carrying and jump out of the way. The bullet zoomed past the cheek of her face. She had just dodged a bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's eyes changed from its blank look to one of complete fear, Cat was charging right at him. She remembered Marlene and how she had cut her face up pretty bad with just a swipe. Confidence returned. She was going to do much worse to this man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fired a panicked shot but it didn't even come close to Cat this time. She had been moving at an incredible speed, for she was already a few feet away from the man's face. The claws on her hand were ready to slice. The man was now exhibiting the same eyes Cat had, eyes widened with complete fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat snarled and ripped into the man's face. Blood was everywhere, again. But this time Cat was smiling. The man released Tandy, dropped his gun, and brought both hands to his face with was oozing crimson liquid. He screamed in pain and slowly backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you crazy bitch! Gaaah! Arrrgh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat must have gotten him pretty good, he couldn't even see where he was going as he made a run for it. Cat could move her body again, but instead felt her legs give away and fall to the ground. There was blood everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cat?\" Asked Tandy. Her legs also did not have the strength to allow her to stand. \"Holy...shit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy started slowly laughing, repeating \"Holy Shit\" over and over again. Cat laughed a little too before asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-should we tell the police?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And reveal to them your 'changes'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat looked at her claws, they were caked in blood again like yesterday. \"I...I guess you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy was slowly able to stand up and went over to Cat. \"Let's just go home and try to forget this ever happened. I need something to drink...\"</span></div></div>",

They made their way to the kitchen and just collapsed on the chairs, not even bothering to take their shoes off. A yellow sticky note on the counter read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Catherine. Your father and I went out to visit some old friends for the afternoon. There's some fish in the fridge you can heat up for lunch and dinner. We may not be back until late, don't wait up.  -Mom\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fish...\" Cat repeated the word. \"Fish sounds good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up to obey the hungry demands of her stomach, Cat hadn't eaten anything since yesterday school lunch. Swinging the fridge door open, she scanned around for the tasty treat. Tandy put her head down on the table, still a little freaked out by the attempted mugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There anything to you have to drink in there Cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat laid eyes on the tin foiled wrapped salmon and grabbed it before listening to her friend's request. \"Let's see. We got soda, fruit punch, orange juice...Ohh...\" She paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome rustling and clanging was heard, Tandy looked up to see Cat with a see-through jug filled to the brim with white liquid. \"Milk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat didn't even bother to grab a glass as she torn the cap off. Tandy eyed her friend with concern. \"Uh...Cat what are you doing there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a single bit of proper manner, Cat tilted her head back and started chugging the gallon of milk like a bottle beer. In just a few short seconds, Cat had drank the entire container. She gave the loudest burp Tandy had ever heard and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Opps...Excuse me.\" She laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy grabbed the empty gallon and turned it upside down. \"You pig, you didn't even leave any left for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...Didn't you want something to drink or maybe something to eat?\" Cat asked, putting her plate of salmon in the microwave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'll pass now.\" Responded Tandy, tongue stuck out in disgust. \"You made me lose my appetite...Seriously, how can you drink an ENTIRE gallon of milk without even feeling the least bit nauseated? It's not normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" She answered, licking her lips clean of clinging drops of milk. \"Maybe it has to do with the changes. I don't know, it felt like taking a big drink of ice cold water after running a marathon. Ohh...Fish is done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy almost gave a laugh at her friend who had stuck her face in the plate of cooked fish, perhaps the changes were also affecting her in mannerisms. She shuddered at the thought of having to feed Cat cat food in a bowl on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you're done making a mess of yourself, what do you want to do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls decided to spend the rest of the day playing video games, watching TV, and doing homework (much to the annoyance of Tandy). Tandy requested to sleep over for the night, in case some majorly bad happened to Cat during her \"change time\". Cat graciously accepted the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the incident with the man in the alley, both of them wanted to do nothing else for the remainder of the day. Chances are, after what Cat did to him, he would never try mugging again. Tandy suggested Cat become a superhero and go fight crime. Something which Cat flat out denied. Her life was becoming too complicated as it was, the last thing she needed was to answer a \"Cat Signal\" in the sky every hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they had to order pizza for dinner, because Cat had eaten all the salmon. They barricaded themselves in Cat's room for the night. Tandy, however, suggested they talk to Cat's mother about the coin, though Cat didn't want to bother them. There was plenty of time the next day to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked the remainder of the night about stuff; more superhero stuff, what sort of costume Tandy was going to wear to the Anime-Con considering she said she had one for Cat already, and other manner of girl topics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a little before midnight, they finally went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cat was laughing. She had done something really funny, though she couldn't quite remember what. The laughter was passing as she climbed up again on the rooftops of the town, she was free again. The wind whipped across her body, making every itch of her skin feel alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a beautiful night, there wasn't a cloud in the sky. The moon wasn't full, but it still gave a bright glow lighting the roofs of the buildings cat hopped along. But the fun of running free was becoming dull, Cat felt like a child that was already bored with its new toy. She needed something exciting, maybe something daring, to do. Against better judgment, she stopped at the roof of a nice looking apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a colorful yellow building, which made it stand out in the dead of night. Cat could see it housed more than one family, multiple garage doors at the ground level lead into the basement of the apartment. She leaned over the side of the roof, coming face to face with a large bay window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was a decorated pink color, most likely the room belonged to a girl. Stuffed animals were all over the place, including the small bed in the corner of the room. Under the covers was a sleeping little girl, she couldn't have been older than eight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat's curiosity got the better of her, she quietly cracked the window open and stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffing the air, Cat recognized the scent somewhere but she shrugged it off and stood over the sleeping girl. She too seemed familiar in some way, there were certain features on her peaceful face that Cat could have sworn she'd seen somewhere before. Cat leaned in close to try to get a better scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl opened her eyes, Cat froze. Her chestnut eyes spotted Cat and she spoke softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...kitty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat had risked way too much. She bolted back for the windowsill and jumped into the night, she sensed the girl following her to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back kitty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat!\" Said Tandy, violently shaking her friend. \"Cat, wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was back in her bed, sweating and panting for air. She quickly sat up and held her hand to her head. It was a dream again, but it seemed so real like all the others. Tandy was standing over her, she looked completely terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...That you Cat?\" She asked with an unusual sense of alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Tandy? Of course it's me!\" Cat looked down to see if she had changed anymore over night. There was no fur on her arms, that was a good sign. But then why did Tandy seem so nervous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god! I mean...Cat. Don't you remember anything about what happened last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I remember staying up till midnight...then we went to sleep. What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy covered her mouth. \"Yes, but...after that. About thirty minutes in...You started to make these weird growling noises. I tried to wake you up but then...you changed. And I mean completely changed. Into a cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\" Cat stood up and noticed something different right away, there was more weight on her chest area. She had probably gone up another cup size. \"Tandy, what do you mean? I was a cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy was trying to visualize it, it must have been a terrifying thing to see your best friend turn into what could be described as a monster right before your eyes. \"W-well. Like I said you started growling then...changing. God. You grew fur, bigger claws, a tail...Everything. I tried to wake you up, but you didn't until the changes stopped. You were like another person then, you started laughing then you...\" She gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was tickling Cat's legs and she turned around, she had sprouted a big bushy yellow tail. She HAD changed more overnight. \"Did I...attack you Tandy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't remember...I passed out when you jumped at me. Then...When I woke up you were back to normal.\" After nearly getting mugged and attacked by a cat person late last night, Tandy was at the edge of her rope. She huddled in the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat's ears drooped. \"Tandy, I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's not your fault. I'm the one who s-suggested staying here tonight.\" She cracked a forced smile, but Cat could tell she was really shaken. \"I just thought...the real C-Cat was gone for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat sat next to her friend and gently touched her on the shoulder. \"Well...Thank you, for staying the night. And again, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Cat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shared a moment of silence together. It had to be eight in the morning, and already the room was trashed from last night. Pizza boxes and books were everywhere. The window next to Cat's bed was wide open, presumably how her \"sleeping self\" escaped. Cat began to wonder if those dreams she had been having were really even dreams at all. And that voice that spoke to her yesterday...Cat shivered. The thought of something else living inside of her was just creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy finally noticed Cat's new tail, which flapped around slightly on its own. \"You grew a tail...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a tail. I just hope I never lose myself like I did last night. I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was some loud snoring coming from under Cat's bed. Both girls yelped, Cat's new tail got all spiky like an alerted cat's. Something was under the bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell is that!?\" Asked Tandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat slowly got up. \"I don't know...Stay there I'll check it out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreeping as silently as she could, Cat tiptoed to the cloth covering underneath the darkness of the bed. Her heart was pounding as she lifted the covers. Sleeping there was...</span></div></div>",

Sleeping under he bed, dressed in pink pajamas complete with a teddy bear, was the little girl Cat remembered in her dreams. The dreams very dreams where she became a full cat-girl and hopped around the roofs of her town. The dreams where during which, she may have attacked Tandy. Cat just stood there trying to put everything together. Her dreams couldn't POSSIBLY be real, could they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy stood up trying to see what Cat found. \"Well, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... a girl. I've seen her before too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!? How the hell did a girl get into your room!? And where have you seen her before!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat had forgotten that she hadn't yet told Tandy about her dreams over the last few days. \"Well, see Tan. I've sort of...Been having these weird dreams lately where I go around town as a cat-girl and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND YOU WERE GOING TO TELL ME THIS WHEN!?\" Tandy was clearly still upset about everything that happened yesterday. \"Cat, I almost got goddamn mauled last night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tandy, I'm sorry alright! I had no idea that anything like this would happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy got up to leave, grabbing her stuff as she went. \"No, you're not sorry! So far during this whole thing you've done nothing but whine about Alex! You know what, there are other people you need to worry about too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's not true!\" Or was it? Alex had been on her mind nonstop the past few days, but she cared just as much for Tandy's well-being. Didn't she? \"Tandy, please come back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't listening, and seemed pretty close to tears. \"Piss off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat winced as the door slammed, her ears felt like they were touching her cheeks they were drooped so low. In fact she felt like crying herself and she would have gone after her, however, she suddenly remembered that there was a little kid sleeping under her bed. How she was still asleep after all the yelling was anyone's guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat sighed and poked the girl softly, trying not to prick her with her claws. \"Hey come on, up and at 'em...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shifted in place but didn't even stir. Cat poked harder in her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on...Up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nothing. Cat sighed and tried once more. Though this time she poked a little too harder, the girl's eyes shot open and she screamed, hitting her head on the bottom springs of Cat's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat had found some bandages in her desk drawer to patch up the little girl's bleeding head and scratched arm. She was surprisingly taking this very well, considering she had been woken up by a teenager with cat ears and a tail. Cat still wasn't sure if she had kidnapped this girl...or if she had merely followed her home. After she finished patching up the girl's forehead, she finally asked the biggest question on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright all fixed...Now who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie!\" The girl smiled, she had two missing teeth in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Jamie.\" Cat said as sweetly as she could. \"You mind telling me what you were doing under my bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Followed you!\" Cat mentally sighed in relief. At least this nightly-ego of hers didn't kidnap random children like the monsters in those terrible child stories. She continued prodding the girl for information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Followed me? Were you the one I woke up last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie nodded. \"Big brother won't let me keep a kitty. But I followed you anyway! It was fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun? You wandered around the streets ALONE in the middle of the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie shook her head. \"Nuh uh. Followed YOU, so I was safe. Didn't break any of my brother's rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat clasped her forehead and closed her eyes. She wasn't sure how to explain to an eight year old that the thing she saw last night wasn't really technically her. Jamie cocked her head, waiting for a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...It's complicated to explain to you right now. But it'd be VERY NICE of you to not tell anyone what you saw last night or about my ears and tail. You're a nice girl, aren't you Jamie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now where do you live exactly? Your parents must be worried sick.\" Cat was already dreading finding an explanation for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't have parents! Just me an' Big Brother! Live in an apartment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you know the address at least? You know, the street name?\" Cat would be able to recognize the apartment again so long as she knew the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Jamie's stomach growled. \"But hungry now! Can we eat before you take home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat sighed, she looked around for her hat to cover her ears. \"Alright, fair enough.\"</span></div></div>",

An eight year old girl that could break into a second story house on her own in the middle of the night, Jamie was something else. Cat felt like Jamie must have been a real headache for \"Big Brother\" figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was wearing her hat again to cover her ears, her new tail was less of a challenge to hide. It was scrunched up in the back of her pants, which of course made walking a real pain. She was suddenly very thankful that Tandy suggested going shopping yesterday, nothing she had would have fit her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie happily walked along, munching on the poptart she had gotten from Cat's thievery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Jamie. Why you follow me home last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were cute kitty. Brother won't get pet for house. Says lord-land don't want pets. Maybe let you stay though! You are nice kitty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat sighed. \"I'm not a cat though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you has ears like a kitty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well-Yes...But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An'a tail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatur' name anyway, kitty?\" Jamie looked up at her with a childlike innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat stared into her eyes for a moment before groaning. \"...It's Cat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie squealed for joy, feeling that she had won their argument. She pointed at Cat, speaking in a much louder volume. \"See! Your a kitty! Even your name is kitty!\" People walking by were being to stare at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat tried to calm her down. \"Alright, alright! I'm a cat! Just please...Shhh! I don't want people knowing it, okay? Including whoever your big brother is, it's our little secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why though? Don'tcha like being a cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's becoming very tiresome...\" Cat was already starting to get a headache just talking to Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued along the streets, Jamie had no idea what the street name for her apartment was but she seemed to know where it is. Taking several shortcuts through back alleys and even the dump, Cat was suddenly grateful this poor girl didn't get kidnapped because of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie, how far away is your house again?\" Asked Cat as she pushed her way through some trees, Jamie had led them into what appeared to be a forested area of the town Cat had never been to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Across the park!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...park?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat finally broke through the trees and landed right into an open field, Jamie ran past her jumping through the flowers. She pointed at several furry animals running at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, look!\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat looked up. \"D-dogs...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe furry animals were indeed medium sized dogs, one with golden fur and one with brown fur. Cats HATED dogs, even before the changes had occurred. Once when she was a small kid a big one knocked her down and bit her, she was in the hospital for a few weeks after that. Needless to say, the fear of them never left. She whimpered as they playful jumped at her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandy! Zack! Cut it out!\" Called a girl running towards them, a sudden streak of realization ran across her face. \"Wait, what the-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat recognized the girl as well, it was Marlene! The white bandage from yesterday still remained on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well. If it isn't Cat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat would have greeted Marlene with her usual 'friendliness', but the dogs were still jumping around her legs. \"H-hi...M-Marlene...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here, you anime-tard. And Jamie, where in the world have you been!? Your brother has been worried sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wa-wait...her brother is...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene glared at her. \"Yes, Alex is her older brother. Didn't you know that? What were you even doing with her anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...found her sleeping under my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene gave Cat a strange look, then looked at Jamie who was giving a big grin. \"Something tells me I don't even want to know. You are the STRANGEST girl I've ever seen Jamie, well alright the second strangest girl...\" She eyed Cat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat rolled her eyes. \"Look Marlene, I-I didn't come to fight. I wanted to bring Jamie home. C-can you please call off your dogs now? I hate dogs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Sandy, Zack, back off.\" Marlene took out her cellphone as Cat sighed in relief. \"I'm calling Alex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than five minutes, Alex made it all the way down to the park. He was wearing his usual polo shirt and jeans, though his brown hair was in mess from rushing to get over here. He gave Jamie a huge hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Thank god! Jamie, don't you EVER runaway like that again! I mean it this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie rolled her eyes. \"Yes big brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you find her, Marlene?\" Asked Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene huffed and pointed at Cat. \"Ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, hey Cat. Did you find Jamie for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi Alex...Yeah...She was, uh, under my bed when I woke up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under your bed....?\" He looked at Jamie again. \"Jamie...I told you before. Stop breaking into people's houses! One of these days you're going to end up in jail because of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex ruffed her hair up a bit, much to the displeasure on Jamie's face. He turned to Cat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Cat, Jamie does that sort of thing sometimes. She takes a little bit too much after our older brother...But that's not important, I should repay you finding her for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, no it's fine! She just scared me and Tandy a little. It's no problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. You want to go into town with us today?\" Marlene gave Alex a real nasty look. \"It's the least I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex...\" Said Marlene. \"Come on, you've already Cat and the other one to that Japanese thing for tomorrow...I'd like for this to be just the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat nodded. \"I-I really don't want to intrude...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't listen to Marlene.\" Smiled Alex, completely ignoring Marlene's comment. \"You deserve a little something for all the trouble you went through getting her here! Come with us.\"</span></div></div>",

She had never seen her so angry before...A sly smile grew across Cat's face. She had Marlene right where she wanted her. After a year of torturing her with pranks, name calling, and being a complete bitch, the cards were finally in Cat's favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I...Guess I'll go with you Alex, if you're sure...\" Cat didn't stop looking at Marlene's hilarious distorted face, she had to hold a grin though else Alex would get suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Uh, Marlene. You want to go home and put Sandy and Zack in your house?\" Asked Alex, completely oblivious to Marlene's obvious discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene was trembling with absolute rage, but tried to keep a straight voice. \"Yes...I'll go...do that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene stomped off with the leash of the two dogs in hand, Cat slightly giggled as Alex rubbed his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, wonder what's with her today. Oh well, I hope you don't mind Jamie coming with us as well Cat. I doubt I can find someone to babysit on such short notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...Oh, it's no trouble at all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large, overweight bald man in a police uniform sat merrily whistling to himself while reading a dirty magazine. The room he was in was a small basement-like room, there were three cells along the walls. Only one was occupied by a young man with his face buried into his cuffed hands, brown hair covered his eyes. The door in the center of the far wall opened, in stepped a thin black cop leading a large man in an overcoat into the room. The overcoat man was whimpering and muttering crazily to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Frank.\" Said the cop leading the guy with the overcoat in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank looked up from his 'reading'. \"Hey, Jackson. Whoa, he's a big one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank tried to get a good look at the man, aside from his size and overcoat there was nothing distinctive about him save a long fresh scar going across his face. It looked deep and extremely painful, covered in dirty bandages and tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson led the man into his empty cell. \"Yeah, his name's Jonny Vale. He's that mugger we've been after for several weeks now. Someone done and cut up his face pretty badly, we found him whimpering to himself in a street corner about giant cats. Captain says we gotta keep him here until his trial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank laughed. \"Hah! Think it has anything to do with those phony cat-monster calls we've been getting recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop shook his head as he locked the door to the cell. \"No idea, can't say I believe in that superstitious junk. Next thing you know we've have our own tourist hot spot, the next Loch Ness Monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson noticed the other man in the cell next to Jonny Vale's. He hadn't even made a sound the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the spook?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank put his magazine down. \"Who? That kid? Some nutcase they're transporting to the insane asylum and they need to keep here until a spot opens up. I think the bugger's name is Maxwell Lenard. Hear what he did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murdered both of his folks, in cold blood too. Just snapped apparently. Would have killed his siblings as well if our boys didn't get there in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, some people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to both officers who continued their \"water cooler chat\", the look in Maxwell's eyes changed under his mop of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where's Tandy today? Haven't seen her?\" Asked Alex as the group walked down the main streets of the city. Marlene was trying to keep as close to Alex as possible the entire trip, acting as a shield between him and Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sorta...Got into a fight this morning, she got really angry and left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex shook his head. \"Huh, what was the argument about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just something stupid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex gave Cat a concerned look, she tried to think of something to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Uh...What are you going as for the Anime-con tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a secret.\" Grinned Alex, Marlene rolled her eyes. \"Let's just I always wanted to go as him. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right, Cat hadn't even thought of something yet. Tandy said she would come up with something for her, but after their fight... \"Err...I haven't decided.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, better hurry, right? Tomorrow's the big day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I can't wait to skip school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, don't say that. You're making me regret giving you the tickets in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two continued their conversation with each other, Marlene's face was slowly becoming angrier and redder by the second. But she wouldn't leave and give Cat the chance to jump in and \"steal\" Alex. Thankfully, Jamie broke up the tension between the two girls by running towards a nearby vendor stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Hotdogs!\" Cried the younger girl, Alex had to chase after her to make sure she didn't go and hurt herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene took the opportunity to get a one on one with Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing you little witch!?\" She jabbed a long finger right in the cat-girl's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat tried to play dumb. \"Wha-? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act like even more of an idiot, Cat! I know what you're doing! You even try to steal Alex and I'll shave your head bald!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat returned Marlene's glare. \"Sounds like someone's a little jealous...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last warning bitch! You try anything else and you'll be sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat had to admit, Marlene looked royally steamed. She probably really was nearing the point of doing something crazy. Cat huffed and swatted Marlene's finger out of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't scare me...I'm not doing anything wrong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat walked over to Alex and Jamie, eating hotdogs. Marlene stood there, completely dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you bitch...!\"</span></div></div>",

No one got in her way when it came to anything, NO ONE! Especially not an anime-obsessed, smart ass, freak of a geek!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched with fists trembling as Cat joined in with Alex and Jamie, Marlene's thoughts were going a mile a minute trying to of think way to get back at the geek. You didn't get to be the most recognized, ruthless, and notorious girl in school without knowing how to deal out decent revenge. The thing was, Marlene couldn't think of anything to do to her. Absolutely nothing at all! She knew how to pop an inflated ego of a wanna-be popular girl, she knew how to spoil the reputation of a goodie two-shoes freshman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea, however, how to get even with someone who had the gall to go after her man, right in front of her nose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marlene, you want one?\" Asked Alex, blissfully unaware of the popular girl's bloodlust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Marlene.\" Said Cat, and just to put the icing on the cake she added. \"I'll buy one for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was somewhat taken aback by his girlfriend's loud declination, but shrugged. \"Suit yourself then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow more than ever, Marlene wished she hadn't taken her pets Sandy and Zack home. At least Cat proved to be totally terrified of them. But afraid wasn't the same as sorry, Cat messed with Marlene and she was going to pay the price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of thinking quietly to herself, she still couldn't come up with a damn thing to at least stave Cat off of Alex, and boy was Cat growing bolder. The two were becoming inseparable. They'd spend minutes just talking nonstop about the most pointless crap! Anime! Manga! School! Who cared about any of that!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire time Marlene was feeling sick to her stomach, while a hot fog brewed in her mind. It felt like the gap between her and the two of them was slowly but surely widening as they walked along the sidewalk. She had to do something and quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somethin' a'matter Marly?\" Asked Jamie as she walked next to the brooding girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene huffed. \"It's nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Kay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie\" Called Alex from ahead. \"Come here and hold my hand while we cross the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex tottered up to her brother, but before they could cross a large bus pulled in front of them and stopped to let its passengers out. This blocked off the group from walking along the crosswalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene finally caught up to them. Cat was standing awfully close to the bus and didn't seem to be paying attention, still talking away with Alex. She was wearing a pair of jeans with one of those steel chains connected to it. Marlene looked at the bus again, it had plenty of handles on it for gripping or tying things to the bus...That gave her a very evil idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quietly as possible, Marlene walked next to Cat and slowly reached for the chain while she and Alex weren't looking. Slowly, she tried to tie the chain to the bus. She was running out of time, the doors were already closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she finished a double-knot, the bus jolted and began to move. Cat was still too busy talking to notice the tug on the side of her pants. The chain extended as the bus pulled away until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIIIIIIIIIIIIIPP! The entire side half of Cat's jeans went flying along the side of the bus, the other half crumpled to the ground. Cat yelped and quickly sat down trying to cover her butt while wincing, as if sitting on something painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my pants!\" Cried Cat as half of them blew in the wind, still connected to the chain attached to the bus. Cat was pulling her pink over-sized t-shirt down, attempting to hide her exposed bottom. Alex looked around for something to help her with, Marlene tried to fight back a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just stand there Marlene!\" Said Alex. \"Help her out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'll get right to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood over Cat sneering at her before going to Alex to look for some newspaper or something, the anime-girl seemed to get the message and glared right back at her. This was her doing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex handed Cat a jacket some nearby man was generous enough to give up, she used it as a towel and wrapped it around her waist. Thankfully, Marlene and Alex didn't notice Cat's tail which was now safety hidden under the cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright there Cat?\" Smirked Marlene. \"You gotta be more careful next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not funny Marlene, she could have been pulled under the bus and killed!\" Retorted Alex, though he seemed to have no idea Marlene had tied Cat's pants to the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat slowly got to her feet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dressed in nothing but a large shirt and a jacket to serve for make-shift pants, Cat punching Marlene right across the face would probably only succeed in exposing her hidden cat tail. Still, that did not make the urge to do so any less greater. Cat was FURIOUS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex seemed to sense what Cat was thinking and got between the two girls. \"Easy! Take it easy Cat! I'm sure Marlene didn't mean anything by-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene couldn't keep her gloating to herself any longer. \"No, she should have watched what she was doing. It's her own fault Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat shuddered, the same pent up rage she felt last Friday had resurfaced and the desire to rip Marlene's over confident mug off her face dribbled into Cat's head. No! She couldn't lose control, not like last time! Cat took a deep breath and tried to clear her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?\" Grinned Marlene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marlene, that's enough-!\" Said Alex, only a little too late. Cat had already jumped on top of Marlene and was proceeding to wind up a punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene was completely taken by surprise, she hadn't expected for Cat to literally start a fight with her. Nevertheless, she was prepared enough to catch the punch just in time for Alex to grab Cat from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat! Come on both of you! Stop fighting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in their own little world though, while Alex was holding Cat back Marlene stood up and rush at the pinned cat-girl. Thankfully, Cat's new form had given decent enough reflexes to be able to kick Marlene back. At this point she could have cared less if her tail got exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her kicks landed right in Marlene's nose, she felt something crack and blood oozed from her nostrils. By this time, Cat was able to break free from Alex's hold and pounced at Marlene again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was sitting alone at a counter, she had on a large overcoat Alex had bought her from a street to cover herself with. She was too deep in thought and busy cleaning the three massive cuts going across her face to notice what was going on around her, nor care for the cup of hot coffee the waitress placed next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, Cat was proud of herself. Sure, she had snapped again, but she didn't completely lose control. Any injuries inflicted on Marlene were done by punching and kicking, she didn't use her claws on her at all. Actually, aside the dislocated nose, Marlene had the least number of injuries. Still, she insisted that she be taken to the hospital by the ambulance after the police broke up the fight, probably just to make it look like she was the victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were scratches and bruises all over Cat's body, Alex went to go find some disinfectant for Cat's injuries. He seemed to be taking it well too, besides being utterly embarrassed by associating with the two girls that got into an all out brawl on Main Street. But he still seemed up for spending at least a little time on the town. Cat couldn't help but laugh at the thought of what Tandy would think we she heard about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden depression hit Cat as the realization set in, they weren't on speaking terms anymore. She sighed as Alex returned with a box of bandages and a bottle of alcohol. Jamie had already taken a few bandaids and stuck them all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright Cat?\" He asked as he handed her the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...It's just...Sorry about that Alex. I shouldn't have snapped like that, it's the second time in a week with Marlene...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" He sat at the counter with his own cup of coffee. \"I've never seen two people so high strung with each other, you're like cats and dogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat laughed slightly, only she knew how true his analogy was. \"But that doesn't excuse it...I-I'm sorry...I kinda ruined your date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex glanced over his mug of coffee and looked into Cat's big eyes. He sighed. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Goddamn eyes...</font> Look, don't worry about it. Marlene isn't exactly the nicest person. I know she's been giving you a lot of grief, especially lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat looked down at the ground. She had been forgiven but she did want some way to make it up to Alex. She mumbled the first idea that came to her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">...You...wanna...go...dinner...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't get that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat took a breath of air and asked louder. \"Do you...want to go get dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex blinked several times before laughing. \"Sure...I don't think Marlene will mind that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie had been apparently listening the whole time. \"Yay! I wanna come, I wanna come!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alex had suggested they go to a place he knew off, he said it was pretty cheap and he knew the owner very well. Cat was more than happy to let him decide where to have dinner, and somewhat grateful that it wouldn't cost her a fortune (she was nearly broke after yesterday's shopping at the mall). It sounded like some Italian restaurant, La Vinard. She didn't care, the entire walk there she couldn't refrain from blushing nor keep eye contact with Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she been paying attention she would have noticed the \"restaurant\" was more like a rundown old bar squished between two larger business buildings. The door was coming off its hinges, there was no lighting save for a few candles, and everything from the chairs to the windows had some sort of crack or dent in it. Alex stepped up to the \"Please Wait to be Seated Sign\" and blew off the dust on the rusty bell before ringing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made a deep clang. \"This place sure brings back memories...\" He said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks a little...um...dated...\" Replied Cat, admiring the many cobwebs in the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah. I took Marlene here once. She's a complete clean-freak sometimes so she couldn't wait to leave. You don't seem like the kind of person who minds a little dust though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy footsteps were heard from the back of the bar counter followed by gruff breathing. A loud voice that sounded like a woman who had smoked for forty years bellowed out from the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there? Christ, I was just in the middle of a nap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed the voice belonged to a woman, large round black haired one. She was wearing a big black t-shirt that probably would seem like a blanket on Cat, it was covered with chalk dust and cigarette burns. Her hair was greasy and done up in a terribly made bun, there was a big brown mole on the center of her right cheek. The only other way Cat could tell it was a woman, besides her giant bosom, was the small skirt she wore. The woman got a look at Alex and smiled with big yellow teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex! Jamie!\" She said in a thick Italian accent \"How are you two doing, heh!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran over and gave Alex a big hug, Cat could have sworn she heard bones cracking but the look on Alex's face told her he was used to it by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two don't come by an' give old Aunt Caria visits much any more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Aunt Caria, it's been a busy semester.\" Smiled Alex, finally able to pry himself away from the obese woman's grasp as she turned to pat Jamie on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, little Jamie! You've grown since I last saw you! I- Wait, whatcha got there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat turned and saw Jamie grinning ear to ear. In her small hands were wallets, dozens of wallets. She let them go on the floor and they landed with a thud. Alex was the first to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was collecting 'em Aunt Caria. They're for you since I don't have no money, I figgered the nice people on the street would let you have 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" Said Cat, putting the pieces together. \"Did she...pickpocket all those wallets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex grabbed his forehead and started gathering up the leather wallets on the ground. \" I told her a thousand times to stop doing this...What a pain, now I need to call up all these people and explain to them that my little sister got at their wallets again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Caria laughed. \"Brings me back to when you were about her age, Alex boy...I remember when I caught you an' your brother trying to break into the safe in the owner's closet 'an-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was frantically trying to get her to stop talking. He blushed slightly. \"Uh, so Aunt Caria! Can we get a table or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure! It'll be my treat. I'd be happy to pay for the couple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...couple?\" Alex and Cat said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I can tell right from looking, you have matching personalities! Much closer than with that other girl you brought in last time...What was her name again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both started blushing hard and continued to speak at the same time. \"Err, no! We're not- I'm still dating- It'd be wrong to-What I mean is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Caria just smiled and said in a booming voice with a wink. \"Don't worry about it! I didn't mean nothin' by it, here let me take you to the best seat in the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaria had taken them to an opening in the ceiling of the bar, through it was a beautifully lit room with dozens of candles and wondrously painted portraits of rolling hills and landscapes. Best of all was the bay window that gave a clear view of the lake just outside the city, the sun was going down just on the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie had since given up her wallets she stole and went with Caria to the kitchen in promise of some \"treats\". Caria had also offered all three of them wine but Alex quickly refused, stating she shouldn't be offering alcohol to minors, though she continued to put up a tough argument. They instead settled for simple grape juice in wine glasses, Cat playfully stirred the drink as she stared out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some view, huh?\" Asked Alex with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gorgeous. Thanks for recommending coming here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, wait till you taste the food. This place may not look like much but I bet you it's better than anything you've ever had before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about what happened with Marlene...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, I'm sure she's over it by now, she got you just as good. I don't hold anything against you for it that's for sure.\" He smiled his usual warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to believe that just a few days ago, Cat couldn't even talk to Alex without stammering like an idiot. It seemed so stupid, so childish looking back now. She felt like...she had grown. Grown at an alarmingly rate the past few days. Was it the coin? Was it the changes that brought these newer and unexpected changes to come and pass? Who knew. Cat's thoughts turned to Tandy again...Thinking back, she had been selfish, she hadn't considered her friends feelings in anything. Cat's smiled slowly turned to a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with that look?\" Said Alex. \"You've had that frown all day, brighten up a bit. I smell the food coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat knew that already, she had been able to smell the veil being cooked since Caria took it out of the fridge. She had to go apologize to Tandy, as soon as this dinner was over.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time dinner was finished, which was as good as Alex promised, the sun had set. The moon glowed in its place over the glittering lake, all the candles had long gone out leaving the smell of apples and fire lingering in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex cleaned his teeth with a toothpick. \"Oh man, I haven't eaten anything like that in ages. Sure beats canned ravioli, huh Cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over the empty plates, not a crumb of food had been spared. Suddenly, she felt like a pig as Aunt Caria came and cleaned up the remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, there's a place I'd rather go to first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy's home was a mansion. A giant fence with pointed bars prevented anyone from entering the vast green lawn. Her home was a large Victorian styled house, beautifully painted maroon red and maintained daily by a crew of workers. They stopped at the foot of the gate, in between two brick pillars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, going to go have a talk with her are we?\" Asked Alex as Cat walked over to the buzzer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhm...I...I did some thinking over dinner. I was acting like an idiot. I guess I just...need to apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smiled, but even that wasn't enough to reassure Cat. She breathed out heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just nervous...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, well don't be. Tandy's a nice girl. She's not the kind of person to hold a grudge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Hope you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence...That is until Jamie started getting bored and took a stick she found on the ground then proceeded to bang it loudly against the iron fence, somewhat ruining the mood. Alex sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie, you mind waiting QUIETLY over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, big brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex waited until she was out of earshot, she skipped merrily over to the street corner apparently playing hopscotch on the sidewalk. He shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, she's going to drive me crazy one of these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat laughed slightly. \"She's cute though. She really cares about you, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother awkward silence, Cat stared at him again just as he returned the glance. Their eyes met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something on your mind?\" He asked bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little voice in Cat's head said 'Come on! Do it!'. But she fought back the urge and said. \"Oh...No...Nothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised an eyebrow. \"Oh really now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...r-really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on...out with it. I'm not leaving until you spit it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo persistent. Cat opened her mouth to say something but quickly closed it again. She'd been in this position before with him. There was no sense in dragging it out. \"It's...it's just...This wasn't a date was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't taken aback like she thought he would be. He looked straight into her big cat-like eyes. His own light blue eyes seemed to glow in the dark. \"I don't think so...Do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat didn't know if she should be relieved or heartbroken. \"Yeah...I...I guess it wasn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex chuckled slightly and smiled his usual grin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he did the last thing Cat expected him to do. He leaned in. Cat felt a warm sensation on her right cheek. She closed her eyes, afraid if she opened them she'd wake up from a dream. Alex pulled away and with eyes open she felt where he had kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Catherine.\" He said, turning to walk away. Alex left to go meet his impatient sister who was yelling something like 'Eww! Cooties!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat fixed her hat to cover her eyes, her face was beat red by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whispered to herself. \"...Was it?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood watching the brother and sister walk away until they disappeared into the night. She waited even longer before returning, at last, to the buzzer to get into Tandy's mansion. Her friend's voice greeted her over the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hello? Who is it?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi Tandy...It's me...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no response on the other end of the speaker, Cat suddenly feared the worst. Though her fears were quickly put to rest when she had a metal clang, the gate was slowly opening into the yard just as Cat heard thunder in the distance. Apparently they were due for a little bit of rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that means...come in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raindrops began to pour down on the ground as Cat slowly made her way to the door. It seemed the weather only got worse and worse with each step. Rain was pounding down on her hat at near golf ball sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she got to the door and stood under the roof, thankful for the cover from the rain. She knocked slightly on the beautifully coated chestnut door, there was a figure moving behind the small stained glass windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked open. A single painted black eye stared from behind the opening. It seemed really red and puffy, like it had been crying for the entire day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Cat...\" Said Tandy, her voice was strong but Cat sensed a strained tone in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat listened for a moment. A mixture of breathing combined with the drumming of the rain made a surreal orchestra, like the world was creating its own soundtrack for Cat as the tension built between her and her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Tandy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew what she had to say, but no words were coming out. It was like she had prepared for a speech and forgotten her cards that had everything she needed to say on them. How were you supposed to say sorry to someone? Were they just supposed to take your word for it that you truly were sorry? Could words truly mend everything that came between two people? Broken bones, shared tears, countless memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was being to feel naive, stupid. Like all life's problems could be solved with words. Words were expressions of humanity, but they could also be tainted. They could be lies. Who's to say Cat wasn't just lying to Tandy, even to herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Cat remembered what Alex had said just seconds ago before kissing her. His kiss spoke louder than his words. Even if she didn't believe the words she said to Tandy here and now, her actions as a friend would speak the truth of her intent. She'd live by her own example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Tandy...I'm sorry...You were right...I'm...Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like the dam gave way, Tandy burst into tears and fell through the door, knocking Cat into the rain and embracing her. The water didn't feel as cold and wet anymore as Cat hugged her best friend in the whole wide world under the cloudy sky. She couldn't tell if it was rain or tears that also ran down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis action spoke louder than any word the two girls could ever say to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smiled slightly as he closed the door to his sister's room. The rain was really coming down outside, he was thankful they had been able to beat it on the way home. He turned and headed to his own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, his posture slowly sunk, matching his feelings on the inside. He was torn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered his room, which was a giant mess. Bills and papers due for schooling and rent were stacked all over his desk, while his cloth were in random clumps all over the floor. In truth, he hadn't even showered the past few days out of fear of running up the water bill. All that water needed to go to Jamie, everything needed to go to her. Food, clothes, and school if need be. She should never have to know the fear of not having enough to pay bills or give up food in order to save money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bed was merely a mattress with a single thin sheet, laying flat on the ground. He tossed off his shirt and collapsed in a heap, deep in thought. It wasn't bills or food that was on his mind though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mattress was large enough to fit two people on it, albeit the holes in the lining. There was a pillow next to the one his head was laying on, empty and staring out into the darkness. Alex outstretched his arm, as if reaching out to an invisible person sleeping there next to him. It should have been Marlene, his girlfriend, who he imagined sleeping there, but it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuddered to relieve himself of those thoughts, it wasn't right to be thinking like that. It wasn't fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie, his sister, was the only person he could have time for in life. He couldn't love anyone else, not even Marlene. He didn't have time for any other person. He didn't DESERVE another person to care about, nor have that person care for him in return. Alex was a worthless, worthless human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, there was a longing, a deep primal urge to want to feel the girl in his thoughts. To have her be there with him. He fantasized what it would be like, life with her. The fun things they could do. The loving, the warm forgotten feeling of caring for more than one person. This feeling seemed to give magic to the apparition of the girl in his thoughts, she smiled and winked at him. Winked with her big beautiful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached for her face...And she was gone, there was only the sound of rain beating like a war drum outside. Thunder rumbled, mocking him in his pit of loneliness. He turned to go to sleep, it was going to be a busy day tomorrow. But not before muttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell and damnation...\"</span></div></div>",

Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was sitting in the middle of Tandy gigantic bedroom, freshened up and in a pink fuzzy bathrobe. Having the chance to look around without getting bombarded with questions, Cat noticed that few things in the room had changed. There were maybe a few new posters of goth bands added to the DOZENS that pasted the walls. Aside from that, same old king-sized bed with black sheets and pillows. Same old creepy Victorian era furniture that looked like it was pulled fresh out of a museum it was so ancient. Same old piles and piles of journals and books, filled with poems and stories written by Tandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat had to admit, Tandy must have had the good life, even if it was her and her father living alone in this massive house. She handed Cat a warm cup of hot chocolate, just the thing for a cold rainy night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, he kissed you!? Like, really kissed you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat's eyes narrowed. \"I love how that's the only thing you heard out of the story. But yeah...Only on the cheek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He kissed you!\" Squealed Tandy, giving her pillow a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat blushed. \"Only on the cheek! It was probably just a courteous thing to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marlene's gonna haaaaaate you.\" Tandy continued her taunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\" On reflection while her 'progress' with Alex was exciting, Marlene proved to be the biggest obstacle. Actually Cat was beginning to question if having the date with Alex was the right thing to do at all. Was Tandy right? Was she being selfish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Earth to Cat...\" Waved Tandy, snapping her friend out of her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?! I'm awake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long. You remember what tomorrow is right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat had nearly forgotten already with so much excitement happening so rapidly. \"Anime-Con...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy grinned and gave two thumbs up. \"More time to be alone with Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know for someone who just made up with me after a fight with me about talking too much about a certain boy, you seem way too interested in this whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat hadn't seen Tandy this happy since a vampire book was assigned to their summer reading. She grinned hugely again. \"Sorry Cat...It's just exciting is all...And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat could tell Tandy was getting serious again. \"...Just...I really thought that the fight we had...was going to be the last time we would ever speak to each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat frowned. She didn't want to say it to Tandy, but she had felt the same way the whole day. \"Don't talk like that...We got a lot to do before tomorrow. It's almost eleven! We need to be up by seven to get ready, remember? Do you have a costume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy snapped out of her seriousness state. \"Huh. Yeah, don't worry about me I'm going as Kanako Urashima!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would...But what about me then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy sighed. \"Like I said before, I already have something planned out for you...\" She winked. \"Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to like this am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeee. Nope!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then...How about this then...I guess I'm sleeping over with the weather like it is, if you don't mind anyway. But what are you going to do in case I go feral again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, Tandy reached into her new pocketbook standing on her desk and pulled out a large black pistol. Apparently getting mugged in broad daylight had a crazy effect on her safety beliefs. \"I'm well prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy!? You're going to kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey relaaaax. There's just rubber bullets in here. And they cause broken bones, they don't kill people...usually. I'm only going to aim for your legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's comforting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your feral side or me...\" Laughed Tandy. \"Ready to get to bed then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat didn't know how she was going to sleep after being threatened with a PISTOL, but she sighed. \"I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy had a portable/inflatable mattress for Cat to sleep on. Of course, balloons and cats never mixed, so Cat had to be extremely careful not to pop the bed with her claws. The girls watched some anime together before falling asleep before midnight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\"He kissed you!\"</i> Echoed Tandy's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat couldn't quite tell where she was. There was nothing but complete darkness all around her, black as the night sky. She couldn't even see her own hands in front of her face. Another voice echoed in the darkness, making Cat's heart skip. It was Alex's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I don't think so...Do you?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat blushed. What was going on? She had to be dreaming, for it felt like she was falling down an endless pit. There was no light. There was no end. Only the echoes of the past whispered words of past deeds to her. Things people had said to her...Things she had done. Stuck in memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You...you bitch!\"</i> Yelled Marlene's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Cat felt herself land hard on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blackness faded into a large gymnasium of sorts. The bleachers had been pulled aside to make room for countless tables and displays of famous anime characters and merchandise. It was...the Anime Con. Cat was sure of it. What was odd, however, was that no one was there. Not a single soul besides Cat, standing in the middle of the setups, was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat looked around. She felt alone, strange, but oddly at peace. She looked at her hands again. Fur and claws, she was definitely dreaming again. By then why was she in control this time? What was this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Desire.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights went out, surprising Cat at first. Someone was there! Standing in the center of the gym, near what appeared to be a stage. Even with improved nocturnal vision Cat couldn't quite make out their features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spotlights over the stage went on, shining on the figure. One, two, three. Cat winced slightly at the new found source of brightness. She practically yelped in shock at who was standing directly in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Alex, clad in a distinct purple samurai outfit, he seemed to be wearing a wig with red hair that went down to a ponytail in the back. There was also an 'X' shaped scar on his left cheek. He appeared to be dressed up as Himura Kenshin from Rurouni Kenshin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Cat!\" He said, with his usual trademark smile. \"Nice costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat suddenly remembered she must have looked like a real cat-girl right about now. She felt herself blush, as Alex slowly walked towards her. Cat took a few steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What do you fear?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat?\" Asked Alex, as his smile crept away from his face. \"Something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...It...This can't be real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" He reached his hand out. \"What's not to believe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This! You can't see me like this...And...I'm...I'm a freak!\" She slowly realized that nothing was getting through to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? Ah.\" Classical music came on from the stage. \"Would you care to dance Cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could react, Alex grabbed both of her hands, Cat was too confused to put up much resistance. \"But-but...What about Marlene? Why is it just us here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. You're cute when you asked so many questions.\" Said Alex as he started dancing with her, alone and under the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat blushed slightly. She still had no idea what was going on. Was this a dream? All her other dreams so far had proved to be truth and reality. But then where was everyone? Why were they alone together at the Anime Con?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I told you already...This is desire.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat's ears perked up. \"Who said that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said what?\" Asked Alex, continuing to waltz around the floor with Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That voice! Didn't you hear it!? Alex, please tell me what's going on! Please tell me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just sighed and brought his lips to Cat's. She stopped talking. At first she tried to resist somewhat but eventually succumbed to her own desires. He pulled back and smiled  at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Cat.\"</i> A voice called to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's form began to fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Cat!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was starting to disappear. The floor, the lights, and Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...please don't...\" Whispered Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's smile was the last thing to fade, like a Cheshire cat. There was nothing left. Cat was all alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Go...\" She finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"CAT!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat sat up from her sleeping bag with a jolt. She was breathing and sweating furiously. Another dream. Tandy stood over her friend with a concerned look on her face, pistol in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-did I change again?\" Asked Cat, looking down to look for any transformations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know. I never woke up after I went to sleep...\" Said Tandy, placing the gun down now that she was sure Cat was alright. \"You...might want to look in a mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy grabbed the hand mirror she had on her desk. She handed the delicate onyx bauble to Cat who quickly turned it around to gaze into the crystal mirror. She gasped at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed she had become even MORE cat-like over night, despite no \"late night expedition\". Her nose was smaller and cat-shaped while her mouth had the typical \"W\" shape that all cats had. Even her teeth had become more sharper. She could barely even recognize her face anymore, as she touched it disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting worse and worse...\" Said Cat. \"How am I supposed to go to Anime Con like this Tandy!? Alex is sure to notice something's odd!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey! Relax! Didn't I say I had a plan for this?\" Replied Tandy, hastily recording the changes in a notebook. \"I prepared for anything to happen, including this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tandy what could you possibly have that I can hide my entire face with!? Ears and a tail are one thing...But my face!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, well what if...\"</span></div></div>",

You have that crazed look in your eye...\" Cat said when she was backed to the wall of the room. But Tandy just kept leering, with a face like a cat ready to pounce on a cornered mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....look....ridiculous!\" Said Cat, staring at herself with a dumbfound look in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww no! I think you look precious Cat! Like a real cat-girl!\" Replied Tandy as she marveled at her \"creation\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was now wearing a skin tight leotard that amplified every single curve on her body. The leotard also left Cat's arms naked. Of course, the front was cut low to reveal her new impressive cleavage. There was a small hole in the back to allow her tail to swing freely in the air, of course Tandy forced Cat to tie two small golden bells near the tip of her yellow furred appendage. She had also managed to put Cat in thin black high heeled boots, despite much resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the cherry on top, Tandy tied a black bow to Cat's orange hair just next to her two yellow cat ears. Cat gave an annoyed look to Tandy who was too busy giggling to herself in the corner. She didn't want to yell at her though, as much as Cat didn't want to admit it...She looked hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bow is way too much!\" Spoke Cat as she tried to pry it out of her medium length hair. \"Come on! I look like a slut in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cute slut!\" Smirked Tandy, herself dressed up as Kanako Urashima with a long black button shirt and a white vest. \"Don't touch the bow! It took me <i>forever</i> to do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have used glue or something to hold it in place, because the ribbon wasn't budging an inch. \"Grrr....Stupid....Thing...Get...Off...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Tandy tried to persuade her friend. \"Come on, cut it out. You need to help me put on my mascara before Alex and Marlene-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>DING DONG!</i> The gate bell downstairs rang, Cat's ears immediately drooped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy went over to push the button on her wall to open the outside gate. \"Speak of the devil! Cat, can you get the door while I put on my makeup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT going down there like this!\" Cat pointed down to her exposing outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy crossed her arms. \"It's a good thing I hid your clothes. Take your pick, you can go down there like this or naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what!? I'm not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better hurry or Alex might get tired of waiting and leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just go Alex, Tandy's obviously not coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't me so impatient Marlene. Let's just give her a minute, she might have just woken up.\" Said Alex, wearing the same costume as he did in Cat's dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene huffed and crossed her arms. She was dressed up as Jesse of Team Rocket from Pokemon. In truth she knew next to nothing about anime, this was the only half-decent looking character she remembered from the stupid show as a kid. Of course her hair didn't nearly go out as far as the characters, but close enough to get in the convention. There was also a large wrap over her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving Cat and her spooky goth friend tag along today was even worse then the anime-geek going with her and Alex on their supposed day together on the town. Cat had already tried to make a move on Alex, Marlene was sure something would happen again today. That's why she had put so much effort into her own costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop being so worried.\" Marlene said to herself. \"What's the worst old flat chest can do? Alex already complimented you on your costume. There's not way she's be able to outdo you this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened just a crack, but no one appeared. A soft voice squeaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex seemed to know who it was immediately. \"Oh, Cat? So you guys made up, huh? You girls all ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-kinda...T-Tandy is still putting on make-up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Can we come in and wait then? It's hot out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Y-yeah...Hang on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was probably the equivalent to going to school without any pants on; opening the door to your crush not only in the most revealing thing you've ever worn but also as a REAL cat girl. With as much courage as she could muster, Cat quickly opened the door. Best to get it out of the way quickly like pulling a bandaid off. She closed her eyes, afraid to see Alex's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex jumped back in surprise at the door suddenly opened, but he then noticed Cat standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Wow...That's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat opened her eyes slightly. Alex had a nice blush across his face. Marlene was standing behind him, her jaw agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That's a really nice costume...Cat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat returned the blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed the back of his head and chuckled awkwardly. \"Yeah...It's funny too. You're a cat-girl, right? And your name's Cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks...I-I like your Kenshin costume too...Did you make it yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex suddenly went into complete geek mode. \"Yeah! You'd be surprised how much good cloth people are just willing to give away! I'm pretty good at sewing actually so I made the entire thing from scratch! It took me a few days but I'm really happy with it. He's my favorite character, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha...Cool...\" She welcomed them into Tandy's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marlene walked by her, she glared at Cat. Knowing it'd be best to not start off on the wrong foot with her, especially after the past few days, Cat tried to compliment her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your costume too Marlene...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just huffed again and walked right past her. Alex was busy looking around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus. I didn't know this place was so big! Does she live here by herself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...Her dad lives here too. But I don't think he comes home until late, so he's probably still asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, where is she anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here!\" Said Tandy as she skidded down the stairwell. She looked almost completely like the real Kanako Urashima now with the makeup on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tan.\" Greeted Alex. \"Nice Kanako outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned. \"Thanks Battousai. I just had to put the finishing touches on it. We all set to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. We'll take a cab, I have the guy waiting out there now.\" Alex checked his watch. \"We should hurry though, they'll be opening doors in half an hour.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just outside their hometown was the larger city of Summerset. It was across the bridge over the lake that separated the cities, few people went there though other than for shows or major shopping. Summerset had some of the largest buildings in the state, it was easily the biggest metropolis for miles. And, of course, was home to the Anime Con. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat had been to Summerset several times with her parents, but this was the first time she would be going alone with her friends. She could feel her tail flopping around the car seat in eagerness as they entered the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex, who was sitting in the back of the cab with her and Tandy, immediately took notice to the sudden movement. \"Gah! What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat suddenly remembered she was supposed to be in costume. She grabbed her tail to make it stop moving. \"Oh, crap! Sorry Alex! That's my tail...It's...Uh...it's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's electronic. It moves on it's own.\" Added Tandy, saving Cat from giving herself away. \"Very sophisticated stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, no fooling.\" Said Alex, eying Cat's tail. \"Its look very realistic. Mind if I feel it Cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh...Sure..uh..Go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex gently grabbed Cat's tail, but it still felt like someone had dropped an ice cube down her back. A tail on the cat's body was a very sensitive part of its anatomy, for Cat this was no exception. Just Alex stroking it felt like someone was playing the xylophone on her spine. But she bit her lip and tried not to make a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really lifelike. Where did you say you got this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat didn't dare open her mouth in fear of yelping in in discomfort. She turned to Tandy, practically begging for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just something we found on Ebay. Cool, huh?\" Winked Tandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very.\" Alex at last released Cat's tail, causing her to sigh in relief. \"What's the matter Cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, it's nothing...It's just...Early.\" She tried to fake a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex rolled his eyes. \"Come on. Technically it's a school day, you should be awake and chipper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to look out his window. \"Maybe this will wake you up. Take a look at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the cab save the driver moved to get a view of what Alex was pointing at. The Summerset skyline. The buildings rose higher than any of the mountains nearby, nearly blocking out the morning sun. The dull shades of gray now shown brightly in the light, almost making the city seem radiant. Alex pointed at a large, mostly glass based, building closest to the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where the Anime Con is. We should be getting there in five minutes unless we hit traffic on the way in. Hope you guys are as excited as I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat smiled. She certainly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mr. Vale. Today's the day.\" Hummed the overweight cop Frank as he merrily swung his keys around his index finger. \"By noon we'll be transporting you to court, and then I don't have to see that ugly mug of yours ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny Vale wasn't even listening, he still had his head in his hands, covering the giant scar across his face. In the cell next to his Maxwell Lenard hadn't seemed to move the whole day. Under his bushel of brown hair he was eying the fat policeman as he continued to taunt Jonny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear me you silent giant freak? I said by this afternoon you're a dead man. You've got blood on your hands. You'll get the chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny still gave no reaction. Frank spat on the ground then looked at Maxwell in the other cell. \"Jesus, it's like being in a room with a bunch of ghosts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Frank turned away to go to his desk in the corner of the basement, Maxwell muttered under his breath in a raspy monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny peaked through his fingers and whispered back. \"Lenard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking of escaping this place. Do you wish to join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden pain in Jonny's scar, it throbbed as it remembering a horrible memory. The giant man's eyes turned blood red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yes I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell grinned in a sinister manner. \"Be patient. Follow my lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's soooo big!\" Yelled Tandy as she shouted at the massive glass covered building with a giant banner that read 'Anime Con: Welcome Geeks and Nerds Alike!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we've certainly found the hallowed halls of nerd-dom.\" Muttered Marlene as she eyed a pair of cos-players posing for pictures nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, 9:15. We're running late. No wonder there's no line in front of the place.\" Alex said as he walked ahead of the girls, eying his watch. \"We gotta hurry up if we're going to get to the main event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Main event?\" Asked Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, didn't you hear? Saig\u00f4 Takeuji is supposed to be coming to announce his new series and sign autographs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat grinned. \"Say Tandy, isn't he the guy who wrote your favorite vampire series. You know, <i>Blood Demons</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy blushed slightly. \"I...I don't know what you're talking about Cat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene rolled her eyes as Alex cleared his throat. \"REGARDLESS. We should still get going before we miss everything fun about the convention. Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way to the front and were quickly granted easy access. They followed the signs to the gymnasium, it wasn't hard to guess where the action was. Crowds of people dressed in famous anime, manga, and video game characters littered the halls. Eventually the group found two large steel doors that seemed to open up into a whole other world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Look at this place!\" Said Alex, taking the words out of everyone's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were hundreds of stages and booths set up for what seemed like miles, selling various objects and collectibles for different series of genres. There couldn't be less than three thousand people in there. All fans and anime lovers, most dressed in costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the strangest thing was that Cat recognized all of it. Aside the mobs of people, this was the EXACT place she had been in her dream. And on top of Alex dressing up as Kenshin...Everything just seemed too coincidental. Was her dream real? Would something like that really happen today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat?\" Said Tandy. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!? Uh...Yeah...It's just...\" Cat tried to finish.</span></div></div>",

Can I talk to you alone for a second?\" Asked Cat, earnestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Sure...I guess.\" Came Tandy's reply before Cat quickly grabbed her by the wrist and pulled her away from Alex and the rest of the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually settled on a dark spot behind the pulled up bleachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tandy dusted herself off she gave Cat a somewhat troubled look. \"You're starting to scare me a little now, girl. What's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was struggling to get the words out. \"Tandy. I saw this all before! Everything! I had another dream last night...Only...It wasn't like all the others! But then everything...now...and then...happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down! Tell me what happened from the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat took a deep breath. \"Okay...Remember how when I dream, I don't really so much dream as I do sit back and watch stuff happen over night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy shuddered slightly, recalling the night Cat nearly attacked her. \"Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I dreamed again! Only it wasn't like the last few dreams...I was here in this EXACT place. Every little detail...I...I can remember it! It's like my dreams were predicting the future!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy thought for a second. \"Was it just you in the dream or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat blushed. \"No...Alex was there too...We sort of...danced then...kissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked grin suddenly filled the goth girl's face. \"Well that's good right? I mean, it's not like he knows about your little secret. Maybe he actually WILL kiss you today, in front of everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat girl's face somehow turned even more rosy red. \"I....I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy grabbed her friend's hand and started to pull her out back to the convention. \"Don't be such a worrywart. I thought you dreamed something bad like you mauled someone to death...Come on, this is a good thing! Let's get back to Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I guess you're right...\" Replied Cat, reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two best friends went back into the crowd to find Alex, Marlene quietly exited the shadows behind the bleachers, she had remained just out of sight from the two girls the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked. \"Hmm...<i>your little secret</i>...Huh, cat girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Alex.\" Said Tandy as they finally found the Kenshin cosplayer in front of a large group of people gathered near the stage. \"Cat wanted to get a picture of something and we only brought one camera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's no trouble. Say, have you guys seen Marlene anywhere? She just disappeared after you left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, maybe she went to the bathroom or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, oh well. She probably won't understand this stuff anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Alex finished speaking, a loud voice boomed over the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And now, ladies and gentlemen. Presenting, the master of manga himself, Saig\u00f4 Takeuji!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd went wild, including Alex and Tandy. Cat was the only one who didn't seem too thrilled, she was still deep in thought at the meaning behind her dream. Particularly the voice she heard while dreaming. Though her thoughts were soon dispelled as the key speaker entered the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA medium height, spiky haired Asian man with dark glasses and a black suit with a white tie made his way to the podium. After tapping the microphone a few times he said in a some what forced English accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Sorry for my speech. English is...not my best language.\" He pulled up a few note cards and read aloud. \"Welcome to the tenth annual Anime Con in Summerset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud applause cheered Saig\u00f4 on. \"I suppose most of you know who I am, but just in case. I am Saig\u00f4 Takeuji and I have the honor of hosting this great event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued his speech, a woman approached him from behind carrying what appeared to be a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's get started. To kick things off, I've decided to hold a little contest. I'm going to pick one of you in the crowd at random and give away a valuable prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up the book. It was mostly black, the title was written in red. On the cover were two young men with black hair, standing back to back. The art was beautifully done. Below all that was a signature in gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my latest unreleased work, <i>Blood Brothers</i>. It hasn't even been released in Japan yet. One of you will walk with this. So...Who wants it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like the audience had been waiting all day for him to say that, hundreds of hands shot up in the air. People were frantically waving to get the artist's attention. Alex and Tandy were practically jumping out of their costumes while Cat just stood there and sort of laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Let's see here...\" Saig\u00f4 said to himself as he eyed the convention. He eyes eventually landed on Cat, squashed in between Tandy and Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about that cat girl there? Come on up young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Me!?\" Cat yelled. Her only reply was a quick shove on the back from Tandy, pushing her friend onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat eventually fought her way through the crowds of people and stepped up on the stage. Saig\u00f4 Takeuji went up to her and shook her hand (of course, she had to be careful not to cut him with her claws). Staring out into the audience made her ears droop. There was never a time where she had stood before so MANY people in one room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaig\u00f4 took the book and gently handed it to Cat. \"You'll really enjoy it, it's probably my best work yet.\" He said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name, young lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh...It's Cat...sir. Catherine Hill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed slightly. \"Fitting name for a cat girl. That's an excellent costume by the way, if I do say so myself. Let's hear it for Cat, audience!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the audience clapped insanely. Cat just blushed. Again, dumb luck had granted her something she'd probably never be able to forget. But who was she to question it. Lifting the book up triumphantly, she smiled while looking straight at Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled back and gave her a wink.</span></div></div>",

Jackson stepped into the dank cell room, eying Frank heavily sleeping the corner with his usual \"material\" propped on his big belly, slowly going up and down as he snored. The more competent cop sighed and walked over to his partner to give him a nudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up Frank. Come on, this isn't break time yet. I can't cover your ass four times a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat man grumbled and slowly sat up. \"Was'sat? M-morning already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's noon. Time to transport mister giant over there. C'mon I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a grumpy bearlike manner, Frank stood shakily on his two feet as both cops made their way to cell door containing Jonny Vale. The giant man still hadn't moved all morning. Jackson reached into his pocket and pulled out a large set of silver keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really had to wake me up for this?\" Mumbled Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know damn well this routine. Two cops for one prisoner. Captain wants no problems transporting this guy to court.\" Jackson snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yeah...yeah..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Maxwell Lenard in the other cell began to start coughing violently, surprising the policemen since they hadn't even seen him move the entire time the mental patient had been in the cell. Blood was coming out of the sickly young man's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please...\" He muttered. \"M-m-my meds...I-I *COUGH* N-need...my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Swore Jackson, he momentarily forgot about unlocking Jonny Vale's cell and proceeded to unlock Maxwell's. \"Frank, get some paramedics down here! Quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank, still dazed from just waking up, nodded and bumbled to the door leading upstairs just as Jackson finished unlocking the cell. Frank heard the shuffling of footsteps, followed by a brief sound of grunting and struggling behind him. He turned to ask what was going on to his partner, but was greeted by two loud gunshots. Then everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell had Jackson in a throttling position with one hand and the policeman's smoking gun aimed at Frank's corpse on the other side of the room in the other. He wiped the blood from his mouth off his chin and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never did like that man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jackson could respond, Maxwell bashed the black cop's head hard into the cell wall. The policeman was instantly knocked out and Maxwell quickly grabbed his keys before he landed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made that look easy...Didn't even need me...Clever with the coughing up blood, did you bite your own tongue?\" Muttered Jonny Vale, as he looked up at the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, my brother and I have been in similar situations in our youth...This certainly does bring back memories.\" Smiled Maxwell as he continued to speak in a monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skinny man left the cell and slammed the door shut before locking it again. He then turned to Frank's body and propped it again the basement door. With his tasks complete, Maxwell returned to Vale's cage and held up the silver key Jackson was going to use to open his cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fancy a stroll around town. How about you Vale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the jagged scar down his face, Jonny Vale looked like a monster when he grinned back. \"Like I have a choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy was still squealing with joy, even at lunch, over the book Cat won and had given her. She hugged it close to her chest as she thanked Cat a hundredth time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh...Thank you again Cat! I can't believe you even won this! I love Saig\u00f4's works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem Tandy, really...\" Cat rolled her eyes as she finished her milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of four had found a table at the indoor cafe for the convention. The rest of the morning had been spent looking through the merchandise and wares people had brought in for sale. Cat spotted a few things that caught her interest, but nothing she desperately needed to have. Tandy, on the other hand, had gone just a little bit nuts with spending when they came across a Twilight booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had continually offered to buy the girls things but never actually bought anything for himself. Marlene seemed more interested in the movie stuff, though Cat caught a glimpse of her buying a Twilight figure as well when Alex and Tandy were busy loading all of Tandy's purchases in a bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat stared contently across the table at Marlene, who also seemed mildly amused about something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to be friendly again. \"You seem to be in a good mood today, Marlene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene did her usual huff and replied. \"Do I? Well let's just say, I feel like the <i>cat</i> that caught the canary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat raised her eyes in suspicion but her thoughts were quickly interrupted by Alex, returning from throwing the group's garage in the trash can. He threw a map on the table, labeled with points of interest at the convention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys. The convention's not even half over so we still got a ton of stuff we can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh.\" Said Tandy, pointing to one section of the map. \"There's a horror novel area...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no more creepy gothic stuff...\" Replied Marlene, pointing to another part of the map. \"I say we check out the movie area, there's some guest stars that will be appearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the manga workshops?\" Asked Alex, earnestly. \"I've always wanted to learn how to draw like the artists do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll those things seemed interesting to Cat, especially Alex's suggestion. But in truth there was one place she really wanted to check out. It was the...</span></div></div>",

Let's see...\" He pulled out a paper schedule from the folds of his purple gi. \"It's 12:30 so...There should actually be a dance party going on there right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dance party?\" Asked Tandy, winking slyly at Cat. \"That sounds pretty fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene, however, shot a glare across the table at Cat. She didn't say a word though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dancing...Hmm. I guess I'm game for it.\" Said Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect. Cat had hoped that she would get the chance to see if her dream was actually a prediction of the future. The dancing and the kiss were all the proof she'd need. Cat smirked at Marlene's angry contorted face before replying. \"Me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's settled then. Come on, if we hurry we can make it before it begins.\" Alex said as he stood up to collect the papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the group but Marlene got up to leave for the dance hall. She sat with arms crossed and swore to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try anything funny cat-girl and I swear, you're going to need more the nine lives after I get through with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she stood up to join the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe convention workers had pushed aside all the booths surrounding the stage where Saig\u00f4 had given Cat his new book. Strobe lights and fog machines lined around in the cleared square area, which would obviously serve as the dance floor. On the stage, a band was setting up their instruments while crowded onlookers readied themselves and were chatting profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, they're having a live band play here. This should be awesome.\" Yelled Alex over the roaring crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat nodded in agreement but had to fight the urge to cover her delicate ears. All this noise was no good for someone with cat-like hearing. Every little detail, every breath someone in the crowd took, every word they said, she could hear as if they were standing next to her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was becoming a little difficult to hear Alex talk, even though he was standing right in front of her. There were so many voices, it was a challenge to separate his from the inaudible mess that played in Cat's head like a bad recording.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Asked Cat as Alex mouthed something to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to be trying to explain things to her again, but her hearing was only getting worse as the audience grew louder and rowdier. Cat felt a grab on her shoulder. Tandy was pointing to a sign above the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Said Cat, reading the sign out loud. <i>\"Couple's dance. Pair up, compete, and win a prize.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she finished speaking, the loud screech of the microphone on stage filled the air causing Cat and several other people to cover their ears. A loud booming voice rippled over the audience's murmurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys! Thanks for joining us for the third annual Anime Con dance!\" Said the announcer, he appeared to be a young and slightly inexperienced guy with red hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, the band is still setting up but we should done in 5 minutes. Remember this is a couple's dance. You need to pair up with someone in order to participate. Step on the floor if you're playing and I'll explain the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Marlene grabbed Alex around the arm. Looks like she had picked up on Cat's little plan right from the start. Unfortunately, Cat was a bit too preoccupied with the volume level to care too much anymore. Tandy was more than willing to dance with Cat anyway, after all the rules didn't say the dancers had to be actual couples. The four of them assembled with the other couples in the center of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Continued the announcer. \"So, uh, let me explain how things will go. Basically the first round will be a fast paced sort of techno tango round. You'll dance with your partner for a bit, then switch randomly to someone else's partner each time the music stops. So in other words, you may end up with a partner that isn't even your own by the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat could at least hear that bit. In other words, she had a small chance to end up with Alex, and Marlene wouldn't be able to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll stop the music three times during round one. Once round two starts, the real dance competition begins! You'll stick with the partner you have until the end. The winning pair gets the prize. So...You guys ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dancers shouted in agreement, Cat clamped her ears shut to drown out some of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Alright guys, start 'er up!\" The red head motioned to the band behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat sighed in relief once the music started playing, it was far more soothing than the barrage of hundreds of voices. She and Tandy began to dance to the rapid techno beat the band. Though Cat was hardly a good dancer she could at least keep up with Tandy, who seemed overly into the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're off!\" Narrated the announced, pacing around the stage eying all the dancers. \"Jeesh, you guys really need to step up your game. We'll only give out this prize to the best dancers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was too busy trying to keep a steady pace to care, Tandy, however, started dancing harder, if that was possible. It took Cat awhile but eventually she started getting into the flow of the beat. It had a certain rhythm to it, like the waves in an ocean. Then all of a sudden...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP AND SWAP!\" Shouted the announcer as the music came to an abrupt end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a swarm of bees, all the dancers scrambled around like maniacs to find a new partner. Cat was left confused in the middle of the dance floor and looked desperately around for another partner. Alex was no where to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was eventually paired with an overweight teen dressed in a Batman costume, he breathed really loudly and heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...\" He said. \"I...Like your costume...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain. The techno beat started up. Cat's new partner had two left feet and just wiggled around really awkwardly. She tried to ignore him and looked around for Alex among the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!\" Yelled the announcer again. Once more, people zoomed by Cat to find new dance partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next partner Cat \"found\" was a tall and skinny guy in Vash's suit from Trigun. He at least wasn't as socially awkward as the last guy, however, he was much more quieter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to dance with you.\" Said Cat with a forced smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just sighed, and the music began again. Cat still couldn't see Alex anywhere. This was her last chance too. After what seemed like an eternity, the rapid dance beat was laid to rest for a third and final time. This was it, her last chance to pair up with Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat pushed her way through the crowd trying to find her Kenshin dressed crush...</span></div></div>",

Hope was slowly and coldly fleeting of Cat ever finding Alex in this ground. What had she been thinking? There had to be over a hundred people here, how the hell was she going to find Alex out of all these cos-players?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat stopped to sulk slightly but then jumped when a hand touched her on her right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a partner, Cat?\" Came an all too familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ears perked up. Cat turned around to see...,\"...Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smiled at her. \"Heh, I couldn't find Marlene anywhere. You were the easiest person to spot in the crowd. So...What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Cat yelled back at once. \"I-I mean...If you want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex didn't answer but instead laughed slightly and grabbed both of Cat's hands. The cat girl, again, had to be careful not to dig into his hands out of pure eagerness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally asked. \"Wh-what are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They want us to waltz, look around.\" Replied Alex, gesturing to the other dancers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had partnered up again and took the same position as Cat and Alex. This was real partner dancing, like the kind in love movies. Comically, Cat saw that Marlene had the misfortune to get paired with Tandy. Her best friend was trying her best to hold back Marlene, who looked ready to run over to Cat and punch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, Marlene's pissed.\" Muttered Alex. \"She's going to give me hell later on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...It's my fault...\" Cat's ears drooped a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked into her ears. \"Nah. You have nothing to do with this. In fact...I'm kinda-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Alex could finish, the microphone of the announcer screeched as the red haired man again took the stage to explain the next part of the dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so I see all you guys know what's next. Now we're moving onto the real fun part of the contest. This is going to be real partner dancing...\" He was greeted by several boos from the dancers. \"Yes fella's, that means you actually have to TOUCH the other person. We'll be going around, pointing out partners who get eliminated. So dance your best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden jolt of fear ran down Cat's spine. \"Alex, I just remembered! I don't know how to dance like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just laughed again. \"Relax. It isn't that hard. Here, I'll lead and you follow. Just try to...sort of go with flow. I know it sounds corny but trust me. I know what I'm doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music changed from a fast paced techno beat to a more slow quiet classical tune. In an instant, Alex pushed Cat forward until she was nearly on the balls of her feet. She thanked god that the coin had given such good balance, she wasn't sure she would ever be able to dance like this without it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex seemed so confident though. Every step he took was strong, precise, and focused. He spun her around like a top and quickly caught her with his other hand before bringing her in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now extend your right arm.\" He said with a smile. \"That's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey slowly and carefully side stepped down the dance floor, Alex was sure not to rush Cat in case she tripped, but she was dancing just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, you're pretty good for a first timer.\" He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was slowly feeling it. The movement of the symphony playing. The feel of dancing. It was just like before, only this was somewhat different. Cat felt safer. Warmer. She was enjoying herself, of course, but there was something that being this close to Alex did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex broke up her brief thoughts. \"Want to go faster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Cat replied without thinking properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Alex really stepped it up into high gear. The motions and dance moves were becoming quicker and more...sensual. All around them, other dancers were getting called out left and right. Unknown to the dancing pair, they were nearly exactly in the center of the dance floor. Crowds of people were gathering around them to watch, many of them were cheering Cat and Alex on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Cat didn't even seem to notice. Her head was too wrapped up with keeping up with Alex's dancing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex, on the other hand, had time to crack a small joke. \"If only we had a rose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually there were only three pairs left; including the swordsman and the cat girl. The competition was really starting to get intense, and yet still Cat remained in her own little world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept getting closer and closer to Alex...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the other dancers struggled to keep up, the two continued to dance away. More and more, the rhythm got faster and faster. Closer and closer Cat was getting to Alex's face. Closer to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't seem to be rejecting her approach either. It was a mutual feeling, a strong hopeful feeling shared between the both of them. In fact, he seemed to be getting closer himself. Their feet and arms were moving by themselves, though quietly slowing down in speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were going to kiss. For real this time. Not a peak on a cheek in the rain, but a lip to lip kiss. Was Marlene watching? Oh man, everyone had to be watching. The whole audience staring them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something funny happened. Cat didn't care. To hell with everyone, she was in complete bliss. This was meant to be, she was sure of it. Nothing was going to stop her. She closed her eyes and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND WE HAVE OUR WINNERS!\" Yelled the announcer, jolting both Cat and Alex back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat looked around. She and Alex were both alone in the center of the dance floor, all the other dancers had been eliminated. Blushing, she suddenly realized just how MANY people were watching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red haired announcer stepped off the stage and approached them with a big golden trophy. \"Congratulations you two! I haven't seen dancing like that in years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience was also starting to approach the pair, security had apparently been unable to hold them back any longer. Cat and Alex were suddenly under attack by a volley of questions, hand shakes, and pats on the back. It was beginning to feel extremely crowded and loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat tried to stay as near to Alex as she could, he whispered in her ear. \"Want to go someplace more...quiet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, grabbing her tail as someone tried to pull it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright take my hand Cat, and duck down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe obeyed and they both dove under the heads of the crowd, escaping from their newly-found publicity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, both of them were able to get to the same dark spot behind the bleachers Cat and Tandy had been at earlier, without anyone even noticing that they had disappeared. Alex still had the trophy they had won in his hand and was completely out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Cat and said between gulps of air. \"And...You said...That was...Your FIRST time dancing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was also catching her breath. \"Well...Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex took a big sigh of relief and leaned against the wall, placing the trophy on the ground. \"Jesus, I thought we'd never get out of there. You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared at each other, laughing nervously. But they were only fooling themselves, they both knew what was on their mind near the end of the dance. How close they had came to kissing each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex blushed. \"So, uh, you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat returned his blush with her own red hue. \"You already asked me that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed the back of his head. \"Oh right, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence filled the dark corner behind the bleachers. The two were dying to ask each other the same question. But like a battle between two generals that reached a stalemate; neither of the two wanted to make the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory of last night's dream flashed before Cat's eyes, she had to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we almost...You know...\" She tried to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Kiss?\" Asked Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat could feel her heartbeat quicken. \"Y-yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex didn't reply, but instead gave her a distinct look. It wasn't a \"You're crazy\" look. This was sincere though somewhat guilty, it was a look of acknowledgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat slowly brought her hand to her mouth. \"S-sorry...I shouldn't have a-asked...I-I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to leave but Alex said. \"No...Wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat's heart was beating like a machine gun at this point. Alex grabbed her gently by the hands. She wasn't lost in the moment of dancing like before, and she wasn't dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh...\" He whispered, coming in closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat just wanted to close her eyes and kiss him. But there was that nagging little doubt. It felt like in the cartoons, where the little angel and demon were on opposite shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Go on! Kiss him!\"</i> Snarled the devil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This isn't right though! Alex is Marlene's boyfriend, as much as you hate her this isn't you!\"</i> Replied the angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Don't be a coward. This is what you want!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Not like this! Give it time!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Kiss him!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Stop this!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat reacted just as Alex was mere inches from her own face. She broke free of his hold and yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked taken aback for a few brief moments then somewhat hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was just struggling to get the words out. She didn't know what to think. \"It's...it...Oh, Alex. I'm sorry! This...this just doesn't feel right! With Marlene...And...and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was expecting him to be to angry with her, that would seem to be the typical response. But Alex didn't look angry, not with her anyway. Rather it was almost like he was angry with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex...I'm sorry.\" Repeated Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't be...I'm such an idiot...I should, apologize Cat. I was being selfish is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selfish?\" Asked Cat. \"But I'm the one who-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, never mind. You won't understand. I just...I think I need some time to think, alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex started pacing under the darkness of the bleachers. Cat was free to leave at anytime, but she was now really worried about Alex. She had never seen him look so distraught before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go.\" He said, sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex....Really, I am sorry...\" She tried once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just-!\" Alex almost yelled in return. \"Just...just go. Please go...I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was near tears at this point, but held them back. The last thing she wanted to be doing was to be caught crying in front of him. She watched him pace, stare off into space, and begin painfully pulling at his hair occasionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cat turned to leave, what sounded like the fire alarm went off. A loud voice blared over the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Attention all attendees of the Anime Con! This is a red alert, we've just been informed that two dangerous criminals have escaped from a local prison and might possibly be in the area. Police are outside and are ordering us to evacuate the premises while they search the building. Please exit quietly and calmly out of the nearest fire escape.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat peaked out from the cracks of the bleachers to see people and cos-players all line up, murmuring about the sudden change of events. Alex approached her from behind to take a look as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a look of seriousness of his face that Cat had never seen before. \"Nothing good, not doubt. Stay close to me. I have a bad feeling about this...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly the electricity went out, for at least several blocks around. Cat reflexively squeezed Alex's arm, leaving Alex in further consternation about how he would treat this whole situation. Maybe there was some way to ease the tension between Cat and Marlene. Why did everything have to be so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of me, you brute!\" Marlene shrieked to Tandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy had bodily led her away from the crowd to put the odds in favor of Cat and Alex. Naturally, Marlene was not pleased with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in no position to call anyone else a brute. You're just a bully with a sense of entitlement, and nobody likes you Marlene, except Alex for some reason. I don't know what kind of black magic is responsible for that, but it's more than you deserve, and you know what else? It's not going to last. It wasn't going to last anyway. Some day he would have figured you out for what you are, and he'd have left you anyway. And you're not good for him either, he deserves better than you, and Cat deserves some happiness too. So I want to give my friend a shot with him.\" Tandy was close to running out of patience with Marlene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You psycho goth bitch, you don't know anything!\" Marlene said with a tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, you're actually crying, aren't you?\" Tandy was grinning. Tan was intent to show Marlene the queen bitch as much mercy as she had shown her own targets over time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! Shut up you manipulative bitch, who, hick, who are you to... hick.... conspire with that, that catgirl to try to take my huuuu.... my Alex away fr... from me! Huuu huuu!!\" She couldn't hold back the tears now. She was convulsing with tears that wouldn't stop flowing now and on her hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now I'm starting to feel bad. I just wanted to knock you off your high horse, not crush you, Marlene. The thought never crossed my mind that you might be this fragile.\" Tandy helped her up. Marlene continued to cry. Tandy hugged her, and Marlene literally cried into her shoulder. \"Look Marlene, Cat's a good girl, life's too short to waste it on being jealous on things like this, give her a chance and I think you might come to like her a lot instead of seeing her as some kind of enemy or obstacle. Is it even the end of the world if both of you were Alex's girlfriends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene continued crying and tried to say something, but was interrupted by a figure slowly stepping out of the shadows. Why was it so dark? All the lights had gone out after some announcement they couldn't make out, apparently the power was out. They got some light from the solitary street lamp overhanging the sidewalk they were on just outside the convention center. Apparently it must have a different power system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me for interrupting this truly touching scene, but I couldn't help but overhear you talking about Alex this, Alex that. You wouldn't be talking about Alex Lenard by any chance, would you?\" the figure said. His voice sounded similar to Alex's, but he wasn't Alex. As he stepped into the light, he was rather pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..yes, h..he's my b-boyfriend,\" Marlene squeezed out, the crying fits starting to subside now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. Quite a bit of luck is on our side, I'd say,\" the young man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother man, a much bigger man, a dangerous looking mountain of a figure, stayed in the shadows, and said \"I'd like to get a crack at that other one, Max. We know each other. We have some unfinished business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy knew that voice. \"Y...you. No, it can't be!\" She was terrified, as the man with the wound across his face stepped into the light, the mugger from before, a pistol in his hand, leveled at her. His hand did not waver. He was calm, and would not be apt to make a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pity your other friend, that freak, isn't here, I'd really like to put her away. But she's not here to save you this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't count on it,\" said a voice behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny Vale's heart almost stopped in his chest. He swung his large frame around to see the source of the voice. He saw two glowing cat's eyes gleaming at him, further back into the shadows. He reflexively retreated back and into the light, as if a live cockroach had just jumped out at him from his dinner he was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to aim his gun at her, but she was fast. SO fast, just like before. He fired at her and she seemed to either dodge the bullet or at least move out of the way with such reaction time that she was safe by the time he finished pulling the trigger. He instead almost hit Max, who ducked and jumped down and to the side, \"hey, watch it!\" Max said in an even tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat stepped into full view of the streetlamp, and Jonny's once calm grip on the gun was trembling now. He fired another shot which ricocheted off of a brick wall and into the darkness, and she had her hand, or her paw, on the gun and had twisted it away from him and out of his fiercely strong grip in just one moment of weakness, much like being slammed by surprise in an arm-wrestling competition. He took a frantic swing at her, and it connected! \"Maybe I have a chance after all\", he thought. He reached into his pocket and took the pocket knife he had taken from that cop, and opened it. If the bitch reached down to grab the gun, he'd slice her open. She had a bleeding nose and mouth already. She bled red at least. Whatever the hell she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny took a swing at Cat, who deftly dodged it. He tried it again and she so narrowly ducked away from it that the tip of the blade struck one of the bells decorating her tail and maybe sliced off a few hairs from it. But when it happened, the most absurd thing happened. She grabbed the knife away from him. WITH her tail!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving suddenly been disarmed, looking first at his empty hands, then looking at the creature before him, the beautiful young woman with the tail, who was holding the knife in her tail, after a second or two of stunned silence, yelled out \"WHAT THE FFFFF!!!!!!\" before having the wind knocked out of him from a fierce punch to his gut from that girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell slinked into the darkness and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saved me again. Are you sure you don't want to reconsider being a superhero Cat?\" Tandy said, smiling. \"Unfortunately, Catwoman is already taken so you'll have to come up with a different name I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Har de har har,\" replied Cat. She looked to Marlene, who was staring at her silently. The cat was out of the bag. She transferred the knife to her hand. \"The funny thing is, this thing isn't really very prehensile, I was only weakly holding onto it and couldn't have used it as a weapon and only got it because he let go of it at the right hand and it was just in the right position by chance. Marlene, uh, please, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thh...thank you,\" Marlene squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you're welcome? Um, Marlene, the answer is probably no, but by any chance, would you be able to, uh, not tell anyone about this? About me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I kind of already figured it out already. I was spying on you a little bit. I won't tell anyone, how could I possibly, after this, but, but what the hell is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat sighed and explained about the coin and what was happening to her and that the odds were high that she wouldn't even be a romantic rival for Alex anyway because by the time it was done, she might be all the way a cat or some sort of monster, but much to Marlene's surprise, she apologized to Marlene for trying to woo him right in front of her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were really cool tonight though Cat,\" winked Tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little too cool if you ask me,\" pouted Marlene. \"Could you maybe not all the way take away Alex from me? I'm sorry for the things I've done to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I have him a LITTLE bit. Just sometimes. Don't think of it as having lost him, think of it as having gained me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene laughed and cried. They called the police, and Jonny Vale was back in custody. Max Lenard however remained at large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Marlene was thinking about all this. Darnit, Cat was pretty cool, why couldn't she have lightened up on her a little bit on her own. Marlene had done some awful things to her. She closed her eyes and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marlene, did you finish your homework assignment?\" Marlene looked behind her. There was Cat, on her way to school, but without any apparent concern for hiding her feline features! Her ears were out, no hat or hoodie or anything, and her tail waved behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing Cat, someone's going to see you! You can't just be happy-go-lucky parading around like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I can't hide it forever. I don't think I'm going to change back. Either people accept me like this, or I have to hide in darkness and under a heavy layer of clothing like the invisible man for the rest of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, I guess,\" Marlene pondered. \"But are you sure you are ready for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't know unless I try,\" Cat replied. \"Maybe everyone will be really cool with this and it will increase my popularity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a distinct possibility,\" Marlene admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, I have the people I love all around me to help me through it if it gets rough, I have you, and Tan, and Alex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex knows?\" Marlene asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. But I'm sure he'll be accepting. He's a saint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That he is,\" Marlene sighed. \"But don't go around telling people you love me though, it's embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, but I DO love you. And you love me too!\" Cat said in a catty tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cut that out! My feelings for you are, that I have a moderately high opinion of you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You loooooooovvveee me!\" Cat mocked. Marlene rolled her eyes. \"And I love you too! I love you I love you I love you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Cat did something astonishing. She roughly grabbed Marlene's shoulders, pulled her in and kissed her passionately. Marlene was shocked. She pulled away to say \"Cat, what are you doing?!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm kissy kissy with the girl that I love!\" Cat said, and then kissed Marlene again. And then much to her own horror, Marlene felt horribly deeply sexually aroused. The sort of feelings she couldn't resist. And she kissed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" she screamed, sitting up in bed. \"I LOVE her?\" What a dream. But could it be true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Cat awoke that morning to be changed still more, and opposite to Marlene's little dream about her, was not eager to show it to the world. In fact, she had locked herself in her room. After another disturbing dream of her own, she found herself fully furry. Was it done? Were paws next? Her intelligect? Would she completely turn into a cat? No, that didn't make sense. She was getting taller and more buxom. Neither would make any sense if she was turning into a housecat. Maybe the taller part if she was turning into a tiger. That could still be a concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" asked Cat. At least her voice was the same. Hopefully she wouldn't soon be reduced to meows and hisses. She briefly tried to purr before, and couldn't. Or didn't know how to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Marlene.\" That was a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi Marlene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you open the door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not,\" Cat replied. \"I changed more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Sorry to hear that.\" But this wasn't the thing that concerned Marlene. What really concerned her was her heart going pitter-patter. She was genuinely excited about seeing Cat. \"I'm sure you're beautiful! I mean, that it's not too bad. You at least got a nice figure out of the deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but my figure is all that's human. Please, I really don't want to see anyone now. I don't know what to do with myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. But I'll be back later. Ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" What was going on with Marlene? Sure, she had arguably saved her life yesterday, but a complete change in personality? She sat in bed for a while. Another knock at the door. This time it was Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still pretty early in the morning. Marlene called Alex, who was groggy and surprised about the early visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex yawned, still wearing his pajamas, and said \"Hi Marlene. You seem upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to talk to you about Cat. And us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Look Marlene, I would be lying if I said I didn't like her, but\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet! I wanted to tell you it's ok with me if you, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He genuinely didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"have her as a girlfriend too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..... whoa. Wow. I didn't. Oh, I'd never, imagined, no, I'd never do that to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saying I wouldn't mind it at all. I like her now. Something kind of happened last night, and I'm kind of thinking it would be nice if all three of us were together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, holy, wow, ok. Then, then maybe, if that's what you want,\" he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk to her. Right now. She's going through something and she needs support from people who lov... like, who support her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene walked Alex to Cat's place. Maybe this would atone for some of the things she did to Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, he knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat, it's Alex. Can we talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we talk through the door? I'm, uh, having a bad hair day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd really like to speak to you face to face, I'm sure you're too hard on yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worse than you think, unless Marlene told you,\" Cat said, looking down at herself. Yeah. A whole-body bad hair day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Marlene did tell me something, she said you were going through something tough, but that's all she said. I'm also here because she thinks um, you're not going to believe this, but she thinks it's ok if you and I were to go out. She wants me to two-time you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound like Marlene. Are you sure you didn't misunderstand something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she was pretty clear. Something happened between you two and she has completely changed her opinion of you somehow. Now please let me in, we need to talk about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting that guy really must have made an impression. It didn't seem like it should have been that much to Marlene though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Alex, the truth is, that there is something going on with me, and it's worse than a bad hair day, and I don't think you would accept it. It's something I don't want you to know about it. Can you trust me about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever this is, I can take it Cat. Come on, how low an opinion of me do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door unlocked. It opened a crack, and with a breeze, it drifted open more. Alex pushed it open and approached Alex from behind. She was sitting in a chair, and still wearing the costume. Except now instead of her naked arms, she had apparently added to the costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on, Cat?\" Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, come on, what's the big deal here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and faced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's really cool. I wasn't expecting you to be still in your costume, and you've added to it. I don't know what you were talking about with the bad hair day before, not only does it look good, but you're adorable. This must have taken hours of preparation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat had been silent through this. \"Alex, it's not a costume. I'm really a catgirl, some magic ancient druid cat coin did this, is doing this. It's not a prank. It's real. I'm a monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was stunned. \"So all this time, you've hidden this from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you told Tandy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this! You think I'm such a terrible person, that you can't tell the truth to, have to hide something like that from me! What, you think I would just kick you to the curb because you think I'm some kind of shallow bigot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, I didn't say...\" He wasn't rejecting her for the reason Cat was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to think for a while. I don't know what to think about this for now.\" Alex bounded away, leaving Cat ambivalent about what to do. She looked at the floor, at her fuzzy feet, when she was surprised to hear Marlene say \"Hi.\" Cat twitched in surprise. It's not easy to sneak up on a cat. But this one was a bit out of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Marlene. I guess you heard that. I just, I don't, oh, my life is falling apart!\" Cat started crying. And Marlene tried to cuddle her like Tandy had her the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhhh, don't be sad little kitty,\" Marlene said as she rocked Cat side to side like they were in a slow dance. \"Things will work out, after all, you're surrounded by people who love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, love, is going a bit far, I think,\" Cat sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Cat know, Marlene was practically going crazy. How could Cat not feel her heartbeat? It must be 200 beats a minute! She couldn't take any more of this. She didn't know what was wrong with her, she didn't know why, or how, but she was feeling head-over-heels for Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Cat, we love you! Especially me!\" And Marlene seized a stunned Cat and kissed her furry face right on her mouth passionately. It was deeply exciting to Marlene in a way she didn't know was even possible for her, and deeply astonishing to Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you later Cat!\" Marlene squeaked giddily, and then gave Cat another quick peck on the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat spent the next 2 minutes staring into silence. Then she phoned Tandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tandy, could you come over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Any more, you know, changes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I've gone Chewbacca.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Sorry to hear that. I wonder if that's the last of it, or if paws are next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not helping. Just come over here, would you? I have something I need to ask you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes later, Tandy was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really doesn't look so bad. You're way, way more adorable than Chewy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tan, I have something else to ask you about though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll shoot all right, it's a shot out of left field. All right, here goes. Tan, hypothetically could you like another girl as more than friends, and what would you do if another girl liked you, would you be completely against it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence between them. \"Cat, I need you to be dead serious right now. Is this a silly hypothetical situation, or are you talking about yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm talking about a real situation. Yes, about myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Tandy started crying. This was shaping up to be a weird morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Tandy said the last thing Cat was expecting. \"I didn't think it was possible, I had already given up hope and didn't know how to bring it up, and didn't think I had a chance in hell, what with you just being so into Alex, Alex this, Alex that. But yes! I LOVE YOU TOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy then gave a further shocked Cat a quick peck on the lips, and shouted back \"we'll talk later!\" and ran from the room all excited. Well, that was two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what to do about the increasingly complicated situation, after 5 minutes, without warning, Alex walked back in through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex!\" Cat gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Cat, just listen. Let me say, I was wrong. I've given it some thought, and I was too quick to judge. Here you've been going through this scary thing, of course you would feel like you need to hide it from everyone. Anyone would try to hide it. And you know what?\" Alex got closer to Cat, and stole a kiss, right on her mouth. Not a deep, passionate one like Marlene, or a quick peck like Tandy, but a normal no-tongues medium level one. Cat was frozen in place by this. \"I love you! I've got to go, but we'll talk about it all later.\" He trotted out of the room, leaving Cat once again in stunned silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepending on how she looked at it, this was either a very good day for Cat, or a very bad one.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oi, Jamie. Be a good little girl and go upstairs until lunch's ready, eh?\" Shooed Aunt Caria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie had been up to her usual shenanigans in the old Italian restaurant. Alex had asked Caria to babysit her while he was out at the Anime Con. Of course, Aunt Caria jumped at the chance to spend more time with the young pickpocket. But even she was starting to have her limits of how much she could stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything that was somewhat valuable in the building was now either broken or at least cracked. Sure Caria didn't own much, but Jamie was proving to be a handful for the old tired woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Aunt Caria!\" Replied Jamie sweetly, perfectly masking the destructible demon within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the little girl stampeded her way up the stairs in the hole of the ceiling. The fancy table from when Alex and Cat were on their \"date\" had long been moved out, and the painting had been hidden so Jamie couldn't get at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo save herself from utter boredom, Jamie had brought several dolls from home which she happily took out of her backpack and began playing with. While she merrily hummed to herself, she failed to notice a dark figure slowly approaching the bay window; someone was climbing on the ledge just outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man gently tapped the window to get Jamie's attention. She looked up and giggled slightly. The pale young man gestured to open the window, which Jamie happily obliged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya mister!\" She yelled with a toothless grin. \"What'cha doing out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man answered in a monotone voice. \"Just going for a climb. You seem bored little girl, would you care to join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Muttered Caria to herself as she started kneading some pizza dough. \"Kid's been quiet for almost fifteen minutes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an experienced flair, she tossed the slimy dough into the air and promptly caught it before it hit the ground. A knock on the door suddenly got her attention and she yelled to the guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Come on in! My hands are full at the moment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly...\" Replied a voice as the door was suddenly kicked opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo men in trench coats clomped into the room, one much taller than the other. The smaller one spoke up, removing the fedora covering his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening, Aunt Caria...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Caria dropped the pizza dough on the floor as her eyes opened up with a hint of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Maxwell...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you're surprised to see me out of the asylum then...How's Alex doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaria slowly backed up to the counter where several sharpened knives were placed. \"You have a lot of nerve showing up here of all places! Get outta here before I call the cops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly reached for the closest knife behind her back. Maxwell caught onto her plot and pulled out a pistol from his trench coat, aiming it directly at Caria's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not another move. I'd rather not kill you, call it a weakness...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared right at him. \"You didn't seem to have trouble killing your parents...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was different...Something you or my brother wouldn't understand. Besides, there's nothing you can do to stop us anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaria suddenly remembered that Jamie was upstairs, she'd just have to distract him long enough...Maybe Jamie would be able to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember when I caught you boys trying to rob in the middle of the night...You sure have changed for the worse, at least Alex had the sense to give up that life.\" She spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. He could never do what needed to be done. But I didn't come here to chat Aunt Caria. In fact I already have what I really came here for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shudder of fear ran down her spine. \"J-Jamie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the van, playing with her dolls.\" Smiled Maxwell. \"She reminds me of Alex when he was younger, so naive and carefree. Actually there's only one reason I'm even talking to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that!?\" Snarled Caria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell aimed his gun right at Caria's lower stomach and fired. She doubted over, cursing in pain and fell on the ground. Blood was everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I thought you said you weren't going to k-kill me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't hit anything vital, you'll live for a few hours. But with a broken spine, I don't think you'll be getting up anytime soon.\" The look in Maxwell's eyes changed to a serious glare. \"Now you're going to tell Alex something or I really will kill you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent over the bleeding woman and grabbed her by the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we through with your chores?\" Asked Jonny Vale as the two drove down the street in their stolen police van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you for your assistance. You're free to do whatever you wish now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I'll take my chances with you. I have a feeling if I stick around, I'll be able to get my own revenge. I'd just rather not spend my time kidnapping little girls, who is she anyway?\" Asked Vale, staring in the back at Jamie who continued to play with her dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" Chuckled Vale, gently rubbing his scar. \"Sounds like a little family feud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In little under an hour, the entire convention had been emptied out and the police proceeded to scout through the entire building. Many of the celebrities there received armed escorts on helicopters while the rest of the attendees were gathered out in front with the local SWAT team. They were all waiting on either the all clear or a formal dismal of the convention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat and the others picked a shady spot under the tree, it had gotten awfully hot over the day. Tandy was busy playing with Cat's tail, much to her annoyance, while Marlene sat as far away from the girls as possible. Alex stood arms crossed brooding. He hadn't said a word to anyone since he and Cat had their \"encounter\" under the bleachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden a short bald police officer stood in front of the crowd with a megaphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention! Due to the possible threat of any escaping convicts, we regret to inform you all that this convention will have to be closed until said escapees are caught.\" He was greeted with several 'Awws' from the groups. \"We're sorry, it's just too dangerous to have a mass of people here while some killers are on the loose. We're ordering cabs to take people home free of charge. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer put down the device and sighed, turning to a taller and thinner blond officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's Jackson doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe policeman replied with a forced smile. \"Well, he just woke up chief. But he doesn't remember anything about where they may be going. Says that the mental patient was able to pin him down and kill Frank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief spat. \"Pah. I don't buy that. That kid was a stick, there's no way he'd be able to take out a trained officer with no problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief then crossed his arms and thought for a second. \"We evacuated town hall and the shopping mall. This convention was the last place we would think they could be. And this kid...What's his name again, Smithson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maxwell sir, Maxwell Lenard.\" Smithson handed the chief a clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, killed his parents when he was a kid...But still I doubt he's the one behind this. That other guy, Jonny Vale...He was a gorilla. Killed someone as well a week ago. He's definitely behind this, I don't care what Jackson says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief looked up from the papers. \"Did either of them have any family members?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...Vale had a wife, but she's in the hospital for some serious injuries. We have a unit protecting her. As for Maxwell...This might interest you sir. He had a brother and sister. In fact, his brother is at this convention according to the registry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well that certainly IS interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy had been complaining nonstop since the announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures! We get into Anime Con and then some freaking psychopaths break out of prison and then they close it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat grabbed her ears. \"Tan...You mind not yelling so loud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, you're giving me a headache.\" Added Marlene. \"It's just a stupid convention, what's the big deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy. Those were fighting words for Tandy. She immediately exploded. \"It's not a stupid convention! You saw how many people were there! That's the biggest thing for anime lovers for the whole year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, come on now...\" Said Alex, with a slightly less happy tone of voice than usual. \"Let's just get into the cab and go home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA free yellow cab pulled up to the side of the street to take the group home, but before they could even enter the car the bald officer who announced the convention closing walked up to them. He gestured to Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, you wouldn't happen to be Alex Lenard would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" Shouted Tandy, she nearly charged at the man. Cat had to hold her back. \"You're the one who closed the convention! I'll kill you! I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sighed but the policeman sighed, they just stared at the insane goth girl screaming at them. Alex finally answered \"Yeah, I am. What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologizes sir, but we've been asked to escort you and your party home for extra protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex blinked several times. \"Extra protection? Wha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not supposed to answer any questions sir. We'll be tailing your taxi and following you to make sure you make it home safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just shrugged. \"Well that's alright I guess, better safe than sorry. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride home was uneventful, Alex was still lost and thought while Tandy continued to complain about the convention's closing. And of course, no car ride would be complete without Marlene glaring at Cat the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth to be told, Cat was glad she was going home now anyway. Despite a lot of good stuff happening, the convention had ended in mostly disappointment. Cat couldn't stop thinking about what had happened under the bleachers. What if she really had gone through with it. And more importantly, why didn't she kiss him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe policemen were following the cab closely behind, but no one in the car gave them much thought. Cat assumed that maybe they were escorting them because they had won the dance contest, but that really didn't make any sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well. No sense in letting it trouble her, there was already enough on Cat's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex needed to make a stop at Aunt Caria's restaurant to pick up Jamie. As the cab rolled to a stop, the police car behind them pulled over too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bald man tapped on the window. \"I'd like to follow you in, if you don't mind son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" Replied Alex as he stepped out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat watched as both of them slowly walked up to the door and disappeared inside. Yesterday night she had even gone on a supposed date with Alex. Why'd she chicken out on kissing him? It just didn't make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the restaurant then kicked open. The bald man ran out with a very distressed and concerned look on his face. He was yelling something to the officer still in the police car. Car could barely make it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! Smithson! Call an ambulance! Call a goddamn ambulance! The owner has been shot!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cat played the past hour over and over in her head. After the police officer, who had apparently been the police chief, had found Aunt Caria lying unconscious and shot on the floor of her restaurant, an ambulance was called and all four of them were forced to head straight to the emergency room with the poor woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the gunshot was not a mortal wound though Caria did almost bleed to death. The bullet had entered through her lower stomach and shattered her lower spine. Doctors had been working ceaselessly in the ER to mend Caria's spine to the best of their abilities. However, Cat and the others had had from passing surgeons that the chance of improvement was grimly low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat's parents had been called and Tandy had already texted her dad so that they wouldn't worry as to where they were. Alex had been spending his time sitting next to Caria nonstop, Marlene had seemingly vanished after the group checked in at the hospital. Outside the building, dozens of newscasts were clawing over each other to get the latest scoop on the attempted murder. The police chief and the officer called Smithson promised that the cameras and press wouldn't bother the group and barricaded the waiting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie was no where to be found at the scene of the crime, though the police hadn't announced it publicly she had indeed been kidnapped. Alex did not take the news well and created a giant hole in the wall of Caria's restaurant after the police had searched the place. He didn't say a word on the ambulance ride over here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Cat still couldn't shake the flashbacks of the \"almost kiss\" she had had with Alex not two hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy huffed and flipped her phone closed. \"No reply. Dad must be in a meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat frowned slightly. \"How could he not know about those killers lose? I mean the entire city has to know by now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth just laughed slightly. \"He's just doing business...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat could almost hear in mind Tandy add \"Like always\" to the end of the sentence, but sensing an uncomfortable topic of conversation she decided to quickly change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Um...You know where Marlene went?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Lost her after we sat down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...That's odd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it, you'd think a girl like her would use an opportunity like this to comfort Alex and get close. In fact I'm surprised you're not in there with him now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat blushed slightly. \"I...I just want to give him some space. Aunt Caria was a really important person to him, I don't want to bother him at a time like this. Plus with his little sister kidnapped...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, that's probably a good idea. I mean the way he was cursing and screaming when they dragged him out of the restaurant. Your boyfriend has quite the colorful vocabulary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tandy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned. \"Just trying to lighten the mood a bit Cat. So what do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Find Marlene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat always hated hospitals. Not because she was a sadist or misanthrope, she thought it was wonderful what people were willing to do to save other people's lives. It was the smell that got to her. Sickness, depression, death all wrapped up into one foul odor that permeated the walls. Having a high power nose didn't help with this at all either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around them were people in wheel chairs getting rolled around by nurses or stiff walking patients in hospital gowns. It depressed Cat that some of them were kids her own age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy pulled aside a mid aged looking nurse with brown hair for some information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss? You see a girl about our age walk by in Team Rocket Jesse costume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman blinked several times. \"A what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Tandy tried to explain it better. \"Long red hair waxed to the side with a white and black outfit with a ridiculous looking red 'R' on the chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Uh, I believe I saw some girl dressed like that head over to room 218.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy motioned to Cat. \"Come on, this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, they continued walking through the sick smelling hallway. The stares Cat was getting made her feel more and more uncomfortable. Tandy had been kind enough to keep her own costume on to relieve some of the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder why Miss.Bitchy decided to explore the hospital on her own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene awkwardly fidgeted around on her feet, eying the person who appeared asleep on the hospital bed in front of her. It was a woman, probably in her 50's. She had a thinning head of hair, red as Marlene's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom...\" Said Marlene, a tone of discomfort in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother didn't answer. She didn't even move to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing? I haven't seen you in awhile...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, no response. Marlene turned her eyes over to the flowers on the stand next to the bed. They were once beautiful red roses. Now they had withered into an ugly brown corpse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad says to say....Hi....He's been doing well in business. Still sends a check every week...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene took a good look at her mother's face. In a way, it looked like a mummy's. Dried up, withered, forgotten. Just like the flowers next her bed. All except her eyes, which were the same faded blue/gray color Marlene always remembered them being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandy and Zack are doing fine...Both of them are all grown up and healthy now. Isn't that something? Seems like yesterday when you, me, and dad went to get them at the farm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene laughed slightly. She hated her mother's eyes. They always had the same look of disappointment on them. It was even worse when she looked at Marlene. Thankfully today she was either too lazy or too weak to look at her. Marlene could never tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here because...Well...Actually it's a funny story. One of my friends, well okay he's more then a friend, guardian got shot. She's actually over in the other end of the hospital. She got shot by some escaped convict, you hear about that at all on the TV?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the big black screen and judging by the dust surrounding it, Marlene could wager it hadn't been touched in months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not, well. It's really exciting out there. Maybe when you get better we can go take a walk through the park like we used to. Sandy and Zack probably won't even recognize you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence in the room was deafening. Marlene just wanted to say she missed her mom. Say that she missed her and wanted her to come home. The doctor said the illness was all in her head, but she still couldn't snap out of it. Not since dad left her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure this is the right door?\" Asked Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, room 218. See? Says here it belongs to Mrs. Wolfe. Wonder what that's about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was the smell of the hospital again, but Cat really didn't want to go into the room. She felt a little sick to her stomach as the door opened a crack. A familiar angry eye looked down at the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Asked Marlene, somewhat annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Just came to see your cheery face Marlene.\" Replied Tandy with a stupid grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we came to find where you were. You don't have to be so angry Marlene-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat interrupted Tandy. \"Tan, please. That's enough. Are you alright in there Marlene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Now, please, go away. I'll go back to the waiting room when I finish with some stuff here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat frowned slightly. \"Are you sur-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCats ears drooped slightly. Marlene wasn't angry with Cat this time, she recognized that tone after an entire year of dealing with her bullying. Something else was bothering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tandy, you mind waiting back at the waiting room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You sure Cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging Tandy headed back. \"Okay, boss. See you back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat waited until Tandy was far enough down the hallway to not hear them. \"Come on Marlene, what's wrong? Tan's gone. It'd just be the two of us, can you let me in?\"</span></div></div>",

She bit lip to prevent herself from yelping, clearly Marlene did not want her to be there. Still she persisted on asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you want to talk Marlene? I promise I won't make fun of you. Who's in this room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I'd want to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not leaving until you let me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat...Why the hell are you being so difficult? You're the last person I want to talk about this with, or have you forgotten our relationship already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of all the pranks Marlene had done to her over the year pinged through Cat's head. From the simple unscrewing the salt shaker to stuffing her locker with porn magazines. She had done everything in her power to make the Freshman year in high school so very difficult for Cat. Yet, strangely enough, despite all that Cat felt an odd attachment to Marlene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now do you get it?\" Choked Marlene, Cat could tell she had started to cry slightly. \"Just go away...Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it...But I want to help you Marlene...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Cat was looking at a plain white door with a sign on it, she felt as if she was looking directly into the ginger girl's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember all that...High school so far has been terrible...You did your share to make it hard for me, but...I just can't explain it, I don't hate you for it. Not now at least....I want to help you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat continued to stare through the door, wondering the sort of reaction Marlene had to that statement. She wasn't like Tandy, who Cat could read like a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, taking Cat by surprise. She was greeted by Marlene's real face, tear stained but somewhat relieved looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...so...stubborn...Have it your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had been sitting in the same spot for what felt like hours. Had it been hours? Maybe it had been a day. The hunger in his stomach seem to support that motion. He had just been sitting there, looking at Aunt Caria slowly breathing with the slow beeps of the heart monitor being the only thing to let him know time hadn't frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctors said there was probably no way Caria would be able to walk again. Maybe it was being selfish, but wasn't Caria who was on Alex's mind right now. At least she was alive, after the last time his brother had aimed a gun at someone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex felt himself closing his eyes. A strong and clear memory came into the focus of his mind's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was six again. Maxwell was with him too, he, however, was eight. They were doing their usual nightly ritual of robbing the riches of the upper class homes, it had to be only eight at night. The home they were in almost seemed like a palace compared to the rundown shop he and his brother were forced to live with their \"parents\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family of the home were gathered around the television, they were happily watching the Disney movie Aladdin. Alex had never seen a movie before, at least not the colorful animations of a Disney movie. Naturally, being six he was enraptured by the movie much to the annoyance of his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell continually tried to pry his brother away from watching the television over the balcony, whispering that they had to leave before the family noticed them. But eventually, he too sat down and watched the show. They sat there for a good hour until the father of the family sat up to go to the bathroom. Of course, he saw the two boys leering upstairs at the family and yelled something angrily at them and grabbed a nearby weapon to chase them. They barely got out with any swag from the home at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell yelled at Alex and smacked over the head for getting them into trouble, but Alex was quickly able to avoid a blown out fist fight by changing the subject back to the movie. That movie was the first Disney movie for both boys after all. They stayed up all night discussing the rare treat the night of thievery had given them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax loved Aladdin, saying that he was brave and strong, exactly what he wanted to grow up to be. Alex had to admit Aladdin was cool, but the character he liked the most was Jasmine. Sure, she was beautiful and all that, but there was something that drew him to her. She lived a life of riches and wonders, everything Alex  and Maxwell aspired to be, and yet she felt trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat word, trapped, continually played through Alex's head the whole night. How could someone like that feel trapped? She was a princess, she should love the life she had. But, when Alex looked at her eyes in the movie, he could tell she wasn't exaggerating. She had the same eyes he had every morning when he looked in the mirror. Eyes that were trapped in a world beyond their control. Alex loved those eyes. They were strong eyes. Eyes that could persevere. Eyes that could rise above the world around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Max hit him over the head for liking the princess of the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother memory flashed into Alex's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was recalling the first day of high school. It was a beautiful and sunny day out in the bleacher where the principle was welcoming all the new students with the traditional speech. There had to be a total of a thousand people on the field, students and teachers alike. All the kids were nervous about starting their high school career, Alex couldn't lie that he was nervous as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, the speech ended and the students were all excused to start their first class of the semester. That's when she slipped and feel over the bleacher. Alex could recognize her features immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a large over sized black t-shirt with some anime characters on it. Instead of pants, she had a large black skirt which had caught the edge of the bleachers and ripped. The most distinguished feature she had was a mess of medium length dyed orange hair that gleamed in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor girl's skirt had been torn in half, when she landed she literally mooned the entire Freshman class. Everyone exploded in laughter, except Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and a few other teachers went over to help the girl up as the Freshman class continued to pound the bleachers laughing. In truth, Alex had expected the girl to be crying. After all, mooning everyone on the first day of class probably had to be the worst, he couldn't even imagine it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead, as he gave her his hand to help her up, he saw that she was laughing herself. There wasn't a tear in her eye. That's when it hit him, they were the same eyes as Jasmines. The same strong beautiful eyes.</span></div></div>",

Their parents had left them with a newborn child, she was completely naked and rolling around in the dirty clothes that covered her, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax said something that finding food was getting hard enough, feeding another mouth would be too difficult. But Alex intervened, saying that he was acting no better then their parents. Truth was, they were both scared. No child at their age should have had to deal with the responsibilities of taking care of a younger sibling. But their parents were nowhere to be found, as usual. They were probably out begging on the street corners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex volunteered to take care of the little girl, Max responded better then expected. He said that Alex would have to pay for food from his own stolen stash. Alex shrugged and picked up the happy bundle of joy as she playful pulled at his hair. He took a good look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he wanted to name her Jasmine, but then he realized he couldn't even spell her name. So he compromised with the closest name he could spell, Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was picking up Jamie from the hospital, his sister had decided to try tree climbing again and broke her leg. Currently, he was waiting in line for insurance information as Jamie playing doodled over the hard exo-skeleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl his age stepped up behind him, she had a beautiful head of red hair. What was odd was she looked like she had been crying. Being kind Alex asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh school had been gone by reasonably well. Alex had made plenty of new friends and even started dating a girl named Marlene that he had met at the hospital. Everyone seemed to know who he was, even the upper classmen. Needless to say, he was enjoying himself so far though one thing bothered him. He never got to really talk to that girl who had fallen off the bleachers in the beginning of the year, despite really wanting to. He did know her name though, Catherine Hill. Or Cat as she was called around her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was between periods and Alex had asked to step out of class to go to the bathroom. As he passed the main office and the phone booths outside them, he heard a strange noise. It sounded almost like crying. He looked at the booth and saw that it was Cat who was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat, the girl who mooned the entire class and laughed about it. Cat, the girl he never worked up the courage to talk to. Her strong and beautiful eyes were now filled with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex wanted to do nothing more then to open the door and comfort her. He too had felt trapped in an inescapable world, but he had freed himself. He wanted to hug her and tell her everything was going to be alright. He wanted to make her stop crying. But he was too much of a coward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe merely knocked on the door, and Cat looked up at him with her big beautiful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alex continued to sit there in the hospital over Aunt Caria, he grabbed a handful of his hair. He wanted to think about Cat, but whenever he did he started thinking about Jamie. And whenever he thought about Jamie, he started to think about Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell was wrong with him? Why did he feel this way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the biggest question he asked himself was why did Maxwell kidnap Jamie? Was he really that cruel? What was he going to do to her? The very thought sickened Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as if his questions were answered by an angel Aunt Caria stirred from her sleep. She blinked her eyes open slowly and looked at Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex...Maxwell t-told to t-tell you something...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time ticked away like sands in an hourglass. The darkened hospital room housing Mrs.Wolfe was only a slight upgrade to the noisy and depressing outside halls. Still, everywhere Cat looked, she found a crevice or an object filled with pain and tears of the past. It was like everything in the room had been frozen in time, dust covered and stained with bile. Marlene lead her over to a table next to the bed with flowers on it; the flowers in the pot were withered and decayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat felt the urge to look over at who was sleeping in the bed. Whoever they were, they gave no real sign of life. Even though the tickling curiosity inside her head begged her to take a peak, she fought the desire and quietly sat down with her legs crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go to the bathroom.\" Said Marlene as she wiped her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat gave a forced smiled and nodded, turning her attention to the flowers on the table. She waited until she heard the room door open and close before reaching out to touch the petals. One of the leaves fluttered off the stem and into the water pitcher, dead and rotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Cat stared absentmindedly at the ceiling instead. She was still trying desperately to not gawk at the woman in the bed, who she was assuming was Marlene's mother. So she distracted herself by counting the ceiling panels. Then all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Who....You...\"</font> Muttered a weak voice coming from the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat blinked several times and looked down. The woman on the bed was staring right at her, a look of sadness in her gray eyes. Judging by the slight twitch in her face, it was a strain for her to even look in Cat's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Cat stood up. \"O-oh! Please! Don't hurt yourself madam! Sorry, I didn't even know you were awake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman gave a hacking noise which sounded somewhat like a cough. Her voice sounded like a dozen bull frogs croaking at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Don't mind me child...It would be...Impolite to not at least look my guest in the eyes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-If you're sure...I don't mean to be a bother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not at all...It's nice to have...Visitors for once...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat scanned around the room again. Nearly everything had been untouched, it looked like not even the nurses bothered to visit the room. The image of the flower petal dropping into the pitcher flashed into Cat's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So.You're Marlene's mother. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...You must be one of her...Friends, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat paused for a moment. \"Well...Yeah, we're...Friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene's mother's withered face smiled for what seemed to be the first time in a good while, all the wrinkles from smiling that had nearly disappeared on her face instantly showed themselves again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good...I'm happy...That she has a normal...Life...At least...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normal life...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman frowned. \"She...never told you.?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat realized the carelessness of her statement and tried to retract it. \"S-sorry! I didn't mean to-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...No...It's alright child...Marlene's a good girl...She tried to...Get me up on my feet after...Well that doesn't matter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I u-understand madam, please! I'm sorry! I didn't want to bring up something painful like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene's mother laughed slightly, though it sounded like a cough. \"She's a good girl...Marlene...Always used to visit me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat raised her eyebrow slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" Replied Marlene's mother. \"It's rude of me...To start talking about this to you...Sorry...I didn't catch the name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Cat. Well actually, it's Catherine. But my friends all call me Cat. And, I don't mind listening. Please, go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene's mother smiled again. \"You have...No idea how lonely...You get with yourself here...How there's no one to listen to you...No way to get what's on your mind out...Bless you, Catherine...Bless you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"I know...The way I worded it...It must have sounded like...Marlene stopped visiting out of embarrassment...No...I told her to stop coming...Told her to move on with her...Life...Told her to never come back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...She couldn't spend her life...Waiting for me to sort out my own...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCranking her head slowly up, Marlene's mother continued. \"My husband...Left me awhile back...Never said why...Broke my heart...Marlene was just ten then...She didn't understand either...I got sick...Couldn't get out of bed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an...Old woman now...I should be spending my time...Here in the hospital...It's best if everyone just forgot about me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could catch herself, Cat uttered the words. \"You're wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Beg your pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked by her own outburst, Cat tried to mend everything as best as she could. \"I...I...I mean...Marlene had mentioned you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Marlene's mother, judging her reaction. \"She...misses you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no reaction still, just silence. Cat couldn't get a proper understanding at what was going through the older woman's head, possibly due to her own lack of maturity. But before Marlene's mother could get a response out, Marlene herself opened the room door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Cat. What did you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene had cleaned herself up well enough, though her eyes were still a little red. Cat yelped slightly as she realized she was still standing up, quickly she sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...Marlene...It looked like you wanted to talk was all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms crossed, Marlene walked over to the other chair on the table and sat down. She never stopped facing Cat the entire time. \"And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat looked at her right in the eye. \"Don't you..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Might...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed once and closed her eyes longer then a typical blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to see you around Alex again Cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally agree with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene opened her eyes in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I agree with you...I was acting like an idiot. You guys are boyfriend and girlfriend, while I'm...I just don't think it's fair for me to come between you two. I was acting like a complete idiot...And I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene was still processing what Cat had just said. It was like nothing she had spoken had any sense at all. The natural order had been disturbed. Was Cat lying? But there was a distinct tone of seriousness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I...I'm sorry too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Cat's turn to act surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know words like that mean nothing after the entirety of freshman year, but I'm sorry for all the pranks. I guess I was just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene paused but couldn't finish the words to end the sentence. They were like poison on her tongue. There was a growing silence between the two girls, but each of them seemed to have a deeper appreciation of each other. It was almost like...They had become friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Spoke up Cat. \"Wow...I-I mean...Thanks Marlene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Said Marlene as she stood up. \"There is one more thing though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning, Marlene reached for the top of Cat's head and tugged hard on one of her cat ears. Cat yelled painfully but covered her mouth only just realizing that she had given herself away. Marlene grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. I knew it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking now, Cat dropped to her knees holding both of her ears. \"I-It's just glued on! They aren't real! I swear! Oh, please tell don't anyone Marlene! Please-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. I just wanted to know for sure. I won't tell anyone. I promise. I was just curious was all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...How did you even know!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was eavesdropping on a conversation between you and Tandy at the convention. It wasn't hard to put two and two together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat grimaced slightly, shuddering at just how quickly and easily her furry secret got revealed. \"You won't tell anyone...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you already...I promise...Now get off the floor, it's embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat quickly obeyed, slowly relaxing her grip on her ears. Marlene's wasn't lying. As the flower petals in the jar on the table wilted away, they revealed a single living rose in the center of the arrangement. Still lush and beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I....Thank you...Marlene...Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just grinned. \"Well, I think we're done trading apologizes for the day. Want to go back to the waiting room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before either of them could make it to the door, it was suddenly pounded by an array of violent knocks. Tandy's voice on the other side called out to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat! Get out here! It's Alex! He's gone!\"</span></div></div>",

For a normal person such a feat would seem insane, but for Alex...Some habits died hard. Particularly habits he'd much rather forget about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, his days of thieving had proved handy over the years. He and his brother had been quite the little acrobats back in their youth. His brother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex paused as he crouched low in the bushes to avoid two chatting policemen. He was recollecting his thoughts on what exactly Caria had told him just moments ago.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"...He wants to...Meet with you...Alex! Talk with you...!\" Coughed Aunt Caria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What!?\" Yelled Alex. \"That bastard kidnaps Jamie and expects to just talk about it!? What did he say about Jamie!? Did he say where he was taking her!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaria blinked away a few tears. \"N-no...He just said to meet in the usual place by midnight tonight...S-said that she'd be fine so long as you complied...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex slammed his fist onto the table next to the bed. \"The bastard...!\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThe usual spot...The usual spot...There was only one real usual spot that the two brother shared. Home, or rather what had once been their home. The little rundown shop on the corner of the downtown main street. It was the very place they had wanted to escape as kids, funny that they would meet there of all places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two policemen turned and continued on their patrol around the hospital. Alex bolted for the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Cat and Marlene ripped the door open, shouting at Tandy at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? He's gone!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked each other, both girls had a mixture of pain and deep concern on their face. Marlene crossed her arms while Cat put a hand to her head. Cat was the first to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where...Where did he go Tandy? Did they say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...The officers just entered the room and he was gone! No notes, nothing. That woman that was shot, Caria, isn't telling the police anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene gritted her teeth. \"This isn't good...He's probably going after Jamie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're probably right...\" Muttered Cat. She looked down at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Don't just stand there you two!\" Yelled Tandy. \"Come on! We got to catch him! Isn't there something we can do to stop him!? He's going to get himself killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene shook her head. \"No. When something involves his little sister, Alex goes into complete protection mode. There's no stopping him, that's why it doesn't surprise me that he was able to get past the police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Cat, she smirked slightly. \"Remember just a few days ago when you 'found' Jamie under your bed? Alex nearly broke some delinquent's hand off while looking for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cat didn't seem to think the joke was funny. \"Marlene, this is serious. He's going after an escaped serial killer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tandy's right! We need to stop him somehow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly do you plan on doing? He was able to get past a bunch of police officers and escape the fifth story of a hospital completely undetected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene turned away from the other two girls and faced her mother's bed. Her mother seemed to be asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You think you can stop him, but you really don't know the first thing about him. Do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Cat lowered her head, almost bowing to Marlene. Tandy, on the other hand, nearly went berserk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just what do YOU know about him that makes you so-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tandy!\" Interrupted Cat. \"That's enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer goth friend opened her eyes slightly in surprise, but quietly closed her mouth refraining from yelling. Cat looked up at Marlene with a serious look on her face like a child confessing that she had broken her mother's favorite vase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What are we supposed to do then, Marlene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In truth? I don't know. But I will tell you this, Alex won't accept any help. If he had wanted help, he'd have told one of us about it. He doesn't want to get you or me involved with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...We wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene nodded. \"His sister means the world to him. I trust Alex, he'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean just wait!? He could get killed out there and-!\" Yelled Tandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tandy please...\" Whispered Cat. \"If you think that's what we should do Marlene then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were on Cat now. She took a deep breath and finished her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Then I trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere could not have been two more opposite reactions; Tandy's jaw was hanging on a hinge while Marlene smiled at Cat with respect and gratitude. Cat was actually trusting Marlene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's speak to the police chief and get a ride home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy tried to piece together some sort of comeback to this shocking change of events, thinking of nothing she slumped her shoulders and followed Cat down the hallway. Marlene lingered in her mother's hospital room, still smiling yet somewhat depressed. She sighed and took a look at her mother before turning to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You have good friends, dear.\" Came a voice from inside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene's eye shot open, she turned to look at her mother. She was pretending to still be asleep, snoring slightly. Marlene smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had been waiting in the old shop for hours now, he checked his watch. It was five minutes to midnight. He huffed to himself, time went fast when a lot was on your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he had been there awhile, he hadn't given himself the chance to look around much. Everything was exactly the same as when they left it, if only more damaged and dusty. In the back room of the store were still the three cots he and his siblings would use to sleep on, they were probably moth ridden now judging by the overall disrepair of the place. Anything of value had long since been cleaned out by themselves and any other homeless person who came in over the years looking for shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith time to still kill, Alex sighed and stood up to take a look at one spot of the shop. His parent's room. During his childhood, they had inhabited the changing rooms of the store, though the doors were all ripped off the hinges now. His parents had cleared out all the stalls to make room for a thrown out queen sized mattress which laid on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though their room was only ten feet away from his back in the day, Alex and his brother never went in there. Thinking about it, this was probably only his third time standing in here. And the last time he was in here...Well...A big red stain on the floor next to the mattress explained what had happened then. Alex shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling sentimental?\" Came a chilling monotone voice from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex glared at the darkness of the store. There was someone about his size standing in the shadows with a trench coat and old fashion hat on. He knew immediately who it was by his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Jamie!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that anyway to speak to your brother after years of him being in a mental institution?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex rolled up the sleeves of his Kenshin costume. \"Don't play games with me Max! Where. Is. She!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still the vigilant older brother...She's fine my dear sibling, you'd think I'd mistreat her after we went through so much effort to protect her from our abusive guardians? Give me more credit then that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell shifted along the debris of dirt and bricks. \"Jamie is safe and sound in our hideout. Waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me where that is then.\" Alex cracked his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act so tough little brother, we both know who would win in a fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex snapped and rushed at his brother. Maxwell gave no indication of stopping him as Alex grabbed him around the neck hole and shoved him into a nearby wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You.\" Finished Maxwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've spent the last few years lazing about in a correction facility with little exercise. You on the other hand have probably been training and practicing regularly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax smiled. \"You're stronger then me, Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'll tell me where she is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well I wouldn't come here unarmed and alone without some sort of ace in the hole...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kill me and you never find where she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex growled but slowly loosened his grip. He released Maxwell's collar in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then. I've actually come here to give you a warning mostly. You being my brother and all it only seems fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What warning?\" Spat Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell grinned evilly. \"Be prepared to suffer a fate worse then death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Maxwell just checked his own wristwatch. \"Well then, it was nice to have a talk with you again brother. But we really must be going. Count on seeing me again soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a larger man in a trench coat slammed the butt of a pistol into Alex's head. The Kenshin cosplayer collapsed on the ground, he completely blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell smacked the dust off his coat and waved a thank you hello to Jonny Vale. The giant of a man stepped over Alex and muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly are you planning Leonard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revenge, my huge friend.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Did we almost...You know...\" Cat said to Alex, who was still in his Kenshin costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Kiss?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat could feel her heartbeat quicken. \"Y-yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a moment. Hadn't she been here before? Where was she? Under the bleachers at the convention? It couldn't be, Cat remembered distinctly coming home to a dark empty house in the police patrol car and collapsing on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was giving her that look again, he was going to try to kiss her soon. But for some reason Cat couldn't move on her own. Her body was acting on its own, the words that came out of her mouth were like the lyrics on a record player. Involuntarily, she brought her hand to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry...I shouldn't have a-asked...I-I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, she attempted to return to the convention but Alex stopped her. \"No...Wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had to be a dream, another dream just like the ones before. After all, it didn't feel like the real thing. More like a movie, the way you'd expect to feel when your life flashed before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex gently grabbed her hand and was pulling her in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Cat felt like she was in third person. That is to say, this was beginning to feel like an out of body experience. She wasn't looking at the moment through her eyes anymore, more like a camera lens just out of range. She could see all the little details of herself, her expressions and how she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh.\" Whispered Alex as he got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was different this time, her body wasn't pulling away. It was moving in closer as well. Cat focused on the point of contact between herself and Alex, the lips. They connected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf expecting some sort of fireworks to fire off in the background like in the movies, Cat turned away. She didn't want to see this, it felt embarrassing. The area around her began melt like it was made of soft warm clay. Even her body and Alex slowly began to dribble away into the floor below her. It formed a neat design of alternating black and white squares. Suddenly, Cat wasn't under the bleachers anymore at all. It was dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright spotlight shined off from in the distance at the floor, blinding Cat for a few brief seconds. Her eyes scanned the new area around her, it was just an endless void of the same black and white floor. Expect for one minor difference, there was a figure standing right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat winced under the light which made just looking at the blur like staring into the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure seemed to grin judging by how the light reflected off the area around its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Isn't it obvious by now?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these dreams, the voices in her head, the cat coin. They all seemed to add up to this one figure. This single grinning shadow now right in front of her. It was a physical entity, not just a voice in her head that she couldn't shut out. Cat tightened her fingers together and angrily spat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights dimmed, granting a feeling of relief in Cat's burning irises. She could make out the figure now, and it wasn't who Cat expected it to be. Her mouth hung open slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand...You can't be...You couldn't be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure was wearing the same black sleeveless leotard Cat had worn at the convention. The same ears...The same tail...The same face...The same eyes...Their only difference was that the person in front of her was completely covered in yellow-brown fur. She truly was a cat girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You?\"</i> Smirked the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat felt herself slowly walk towards the cat girl as she did the same. They were approaching each other almost symmetrically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What is it? Why do you have that look on your face? Are you...disappointed?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one! You're the one who's been talking to me! Controlling me! Making me go out at night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an anger unlike anything else in Cat's eyes as she screamed. \"Get out! Get out of my head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone laughed slightly, putting her hands around her waist. Cat felt herself do the same. <i>\"You think that it's that simple? That I merely a separate entity that's been pulling some puppet strings this whole time?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both continued to walk towards each other, Cat was dreading every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! You're using me! Changing me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat paused slightly, glaring her sharp teeth at the clone. \"I HATE you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You hate me, huh? That's a surprise. You've always hated me. From the beginning, I've done what you were too afraid to do. I've said things that you were too scared to say. I've acted in a manner that you'd never dare to act.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you!!!???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone reached her hand out, Cat's arm did the same. They pressed against each other at an exact equal length. But something was off, the clone's fingers felt cold...solid. That's when Cat noticed that she wasn't touching a person, she was touching a flat surface. She was pressing her hand against a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Cat, I AM you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crushing dread of realization momentarily suffocated Cat's lungs. She looked down at her arm, it too was completely covered in the same yellow-brown fur of the reflections. There was only one word that could sum up Cat's feelings at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am you.\"</i> Repeated the reflection. <i>\"I am what you want to say. I am how you've always wanted to act. I am who you wanted to be.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection grinned again. <i>\"No holds bar. I am the truth of your soul.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Tears welled up in Cat's eyes. Every word of the reflection was true. She couldn't deny it, but somehow the words still kept escaping her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sorry.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wake up, Cat.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Cat did wake up. In a cold sweat, on her mattress, in her room, alone. Just like all the dreams before...Vivid, realistic, believable. Cat breathed in and out, tears were rolling down her face even though she was no longer dreaming. Had she peed herself too? Or was that just the sweat dripping down her legs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraving the nagging doubts in her head, Cat looked down at herself. She was still in the leotard, still in costume, and...still covered in yellow-brown fur. The final change was complete. She shuddered and grabbed her knees, bringing herself in the fetal position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror...That reflection, her \"other self\"...Had that really happened? But there was no answer in the comforting darkness of her bedroom. And no wonder, when she looked over at her clock it read in big green letters \"3:05 AM\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was trying to compose herself, rocking gently back and forth and releasing waves of tears. After about fifteen minutes, she needed to tell someone. Hopefully Tandy would wake up at this hour. Cat pulled the covers over her head and quietly dialed her friend's number on her cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt rang three times, thankfully it picked up before the fourth ring, A tired voice mumbled a greeting on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...Uh...Tandy? Something...happened...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like most days in May within a lakeside mountain town, the rain was pouring down in buckets this early Monday morning. The houses were all still and silhouetted in the rain which blurred everything beyond a twenty foot distance in a sheet of water. There were no lights on, except for a single bedroom window light on the second floor of a rather plain looking white house at the corner of the street. Catherine Hill's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me again, one more time...\" Muttered Tandy as she sipped her third cup of coffee. The first two had done little save take the edge off her foul early morning mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat sighed, her head was still under the covers. \"I told you, when I got home I passed out immediately on the bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...right...But what about the dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat blushed slightly. \"Well...I was thinking about something that happened between me and Alex yesterday...Only it happened differently...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were dreaming about kissing him weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It's that obvious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid so. Anyway come on, get to the interesting part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...After...The kiss...Things started getting weird. I remember everything melting...Then darkness...Then a bright light and a figure standing in front of me smiling...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat paused for just a moment, as if trying to re-visualize the scenario. Tandy was getting impatient though, it was only five in the morning after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat just shuddered and shook her head at the same time. \"And the figure...It was...Me...Just like this now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled down the covers, completely revealing the final changes that occurred last night. Yellow-brown fur covered every inch of her body. She barely looked human now save for her body shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got angry at it...Started cursing at it. But we kept getting closer and closer together. I couldn't control myself. Then we touched, only it wasn't another person that looked like me. It was my...reflection in a mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the reflection say anything to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat girl looked down then up, as if the words were being whispered into her ear. \"...I am you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls looked at each other as thunder rumbled slightly in the distance. While Cat had an ominous feeling about the whole thing, Tandy laughed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you're mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tandy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat, I honestly don't know what to make out of the dream. If it were anyone else, I'd say it was just a dream. But considering how previous dreams have been going for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat recollected her nightly 'walks' and lied. She knew very well what the dream meant. \"I...I don't know what to make of it either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever the case, we have a bigger problem on our hands now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Monday, the weekend is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poisonous word every student hated to utter escaped Cat's lips. \"School...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing we went shopping this weekend for stuff to cover you up with. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm supposed to dress up like I'm making a trip for the north pole in the middle of spring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have any better ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat groaned. It wasn't disguising herself for school that she was worried about. \"I wonder what happened to Alex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy huffed the surface of her coffee, creating a spray of hot brown liquid that splashed against Cat's face. \"You are the most bipolar person I've ever met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat could tell that Tandy definitely wasn't in the mood to be hearing her complaints, especially after she called her over at three in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...I guess you don't want to hear about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.\" She mumbled through a sip out of her mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rain continued to beat against the window, showing no signs of stopping for the remainder of the day. Even though it was late May, today felt slightly chilly, almost tickling Cat to the bone. This was not going to be a good day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large black overcoat, two dark mittens, an orange and black scarf, a black hat to cover her ears, a belt to secure her tail, a long midnight black skirt to cover the rest of her, and Cat was ready to go to school. Dressing her up surprisingly only took an hour, especially with Tandy falling asleep every ten seconds. The girls had a quick breakfast alone and left to walk to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny.\" Said Tandy as they walked together in the rain. \"I haven't seen your parents since you got the coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does that strike you as funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, didn't you say it was your mom that gave it to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Said Cat, considering the fact that her parents might be practicing real druid magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, doesn't that strike you as just a little bit odd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I don't want to really think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was true, Cat had a lot on her mind. The fiasco at the convention yesterday, Alex running away, the conversation with herself in her dreams. The last thing she wanted to think about was her parent's unusual absence lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of walk under the pouring rain was mostly quiet. Cat had never felt so exhausted and fully awaken at the same time before. Tandy's eyes were still half closed, she had drank seven cups of coffee at this point. The weather was doing its best depicting the mood between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when they finally did return to school, soaking wet and tired, the unusual rat race began and Cat felt herself slipping back into the internal schedule her sub conscious had set for her Mondays. Her first class was study hall, which she wisely used to take a quick catnap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople seemed to be taking her 'disguise' rather well, despite a few whispers that she was crazy to be walking around with that kind of heavy equipment even if it was a bit nippy today. Cat just prayed that no teacher would ask her to take her hat off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't see Tandy until lunch period, usually the same period she'd see Alex as well. This gave her plenty of time to do some quiet thinking to herself, vaguely paying attention to the lessons in class. Though she hadn't mentioned it to Tandy, the confrontation with the voice in her head had left Cat feeling very uncomfortable with herself. It felt like there was an animal being caged inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus all those things she had done in her sleep. She nearly attacked Tandy, she climbed along rooftops, even broke into Alex's apartment. Secretly, Cat felt she enjoyed doing all those things. It felt...refreshing. Like she really was letting the caged animal inside of her out for a change, to hell with the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer morning classes breezed by, all Cat missed was turning in several homework assignments which she had neglected to do over the weekend. It was time for lunch, and thankfully Tandy seemed to be in a better mood since this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cat.\" Said the goth girl through two mouthfuls of tuna sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tandy.\" She replied, taking a seat right next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the extent of their conversation for the first brief minutes. Cat could still tell by looking at her friends face that she was under a lot of stress and sleep deprivation. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen...I'm sorry for this morning...And...Thanks for coming over. I really do appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy smirked. \"You think I'm upset about that? I just found out I bombed a math test last Friday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But all the same Cat, thanks. For the thank you I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of upset though, heads up. The bitch is coming over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat wondered who Tandy had meant until she looked up. Marlene, who had since combed her hair back down, was fast approaching the two with her lunch tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked. \"Hello Cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat returned the smile and nodded. Marlene's greeting to Tandy was somewhat strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tandy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marlene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I sit here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tandy and Cat gave replies at the same time, though each had a different answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all - Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy turned to Cat with the same expression a mother would give if her child told her that they wanted to be a ventriloquist when they grew up. Marlene laughed slightly, and sat down. Tandy sneered at the red head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Sophomores not good enough to sit with anymore, Marlene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem with me being here, Tandy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat shot her friend a look. Tandy just sighed. \"No, not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch suddenly got even more awkward. Cat felt as if she were in the middle of an invisible between the two girls. Thinking quickly, she tried to come up with a topic of conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, Marlene. Have you seen Alex today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's sitting alone over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed to the table in the corner of the cafeteria. There he was, sitting in his usual polo shirt with a white bandage going around his head. But otherwise he seemed alright. Physically at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And before you say anything else, I already tried talking to him. He won't say anything and demanded to be alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...Is he alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly hope so.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the outskirts of Summerset, far across the lake from where Cat and the others were at school, there lived a decent forty year old man by the name of Thomas Montero. He was from Spain, he and his family had immigrated to America in the 1970's in search of better business. For Montero sold guns, he made them by hand and had perfected the craft over the years he spent in business in the United States. Truthfully, he never enjoyed making tools that killed, he'd always push it back into his mind by telling himself guns were meant to be protection. But that's another story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMontero was married to his beautiful wife Sonia and had one child, Herman age fifteen. Montero slaved over his job that he hated to put his son into college, he'd be the first in the entire family to do so after all. He'd constantly pester Herman to study, unaware that Herman had no real ambition to go to school and instead wanted to become an artist. Fighting was a common thing at the Montero dinner table. Still, they pressed on with their passive aggressive lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already midday in the only gun shop of Summerset. Business was better than usual, often it was lucky if Montero sold even one gun to a customer, today he had managed to sell two before lunch. He sat at the counter, wiping bits of the roast-beef sandwich that his wife had lovingly made for him off his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the front door bells ringed, signaling a new customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome sir!\" Said Montero, with a slight Spanish accent. \"How may I be helping today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The customer was rather short, at first Montero thought he was an underage kid trying to get away with buying a rifle to show off to his friends. But his choice in clothing, an overcoat with a fedora, suggested that he was older then his size let on. He spoke in a strange monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thomas Montero, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, owner of Guns 'N Ammo. The best place for rifles in Summerset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I've heard. I actually have a special request for you to fulfill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe customer smiled, pulling out a dirty sheet of paper and placing it gently on the table for Montero to read. Montero picked it up and looked it over quickly. His face went pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sir, I'm sorry to say but something like this would be illegal! You need a permit from the National Guard for this, and I can tell by your age that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Montero. I really am not interested in your excuses.\" The customer pulled off his fedora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMontero backed away from the counter, visibly shocked. \"Y-you're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's of no concern to you who I am Montero. You're going to take my request, willingly or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was police standard procedure to release information regarding escaped convicts to gun shops. The man before Montero was an escaped mental patient by the name of Maxwell Leonard. Montero slowly reached for the pistol hidden beneath the back shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out! Get out before I call the police!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do no such thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMontero whipped out the pistol and aimed it straight at Leonard's head. \"I'm warning you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard just smirked and reached into his pocket. \"Before you do anything foolish, perhaps you should take a look at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out what looked like a photograph and clicked it at the aimed gun shop owner. Montero slowly reached down for it but never took his eyes or gun off Leonard. His fear turned into rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a photograph of his family, Herman and Sonia, both tied to a chair and blindfolded. They appeared to be bleeding from bullet holes in their legs. A gun was aimed at them by a man cut off in the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill me, and they die. You'll never find them and the blood loss will kill them if left untreated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expect the order to be fulfilled in twenty four hours and placed in the dumpster at the corner of Fifty Second Street with extra ammunition and the remotes. If you call the cops before then, you'll find them both dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard turned to leave the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tick tock, Montero.\" Came the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMontero watched Leonard leave, he never stopped aiming his gun at him but there was nothing he could do. He didn't have much time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one class Cat enjoyed more then anything else, it was art. She proved to be quite the artist and was already in the Senior art class, in fact she had built up a little infamy for herself amongst the upperclassmen. Cat loved to paint during the class, it relaxed her and let her express herself in a way words and writing failed to. And after a somewhat stressful lunch, this was exactly what the doctor ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch proceeded in a way one would expect the outcome of telling two blood hounds to share the same piece of steak to end. Tandy and Marlene constantly got down each others throats the entire time, leaving few moments for pleasant conversation between the girls. Afterward, Tandy asked Cat why Marlene had even chosen to sit with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat had been wondering that herself. Maybe the talk she had with her yesterday really did change her. But she shrugged it off and continued her painting as Mr. Brushwood, the art teacher, walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Catherine! This is a lovely little painting, once again!\" He said as he studied it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very interesting...The girl is standing in front of a mirror and sees only a small cat...Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping you could tell me that, sir.\" Replied Cat, half jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being tight lipped, are we? Fair enough, every good artist always lets the audience decide for themselves. Hmm...\" Brushwood held up the painting to take a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be painting with a heavy brush, creating a very dark feel in the painting. The mirror means self reflection or awareness. And yet, the girl seems to be half turning away from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does that mean then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I had to guess, I'd say that the girl is ashamed of what she sees. You see, most of the time when we take a good look at ourselves, the reflection is never what we expect it to be. In this case, the girl clearly did not expect to see a cat. As to why you choose a cat...Well...I haven't the foggiest idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat laughed slightly. \"It's alright, I'm not sure why I choose it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truly? Well then it's a mystery better left unsolved for now then. It's a good piece. By the way...Aren't you hot in all that winter equipment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the layers of clothing, it felt like Cat was in a sauna all day. She couldn't wait to get home and rip off everything, but she lied. \"No, I'm just cold is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're coming down with something then, you should go to the nurse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really. I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well suit yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang, school was finally over. \"Ah, that's the bell! Remember class, bring your sketch pads tomorrow. We'll be doing figure drawing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat gathered her things and carefully placed the painting into her backpack, Mr. Brushwood turned to her before she left. \"By the way Catherine. We should never be ashamed or afraid of who we are. Sometimes it's best if you just release the inner beast once in awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled slightly, but didn't quite get what he meant. \"Thanks Mr. Brushwood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure took your sweet time.\" Said Tandy as Cat finally exited the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Brushwood held me back for just a moment with a critic on my painting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. I just figured you'd be in a hurry to get out of there. You know, with all the stuff on and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me please, let's just go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, want to come over to my place today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever works, let's just go. Fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTandy looked over her shoulder. \"Hey, there's Alex. He's walking home with Marlene. Boy, he doesn't look too happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was crossing the street behind them, the look on his face was not a pleasant one. Marlene seemed to be trying to talk to him or cheer him up. He was ignoring her. Cat frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're sure Cat...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Cat and Tandy continued walking home in the opposite direction, Alex was focused on heading back to his apartment. Marlene continued to tag along in a vain attempt to put a smile on his face. It had been a rough day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from waking up in the hospital this morning, Alex had spent the beginning of his day barraged with questions from the police who were thoroughly concerned about his sudden disappearance yesterday. In fact, he was probably lucky didn't put him in a holding cell for his own protection. His missing sister never left his thoughts the entire day, she continually conflicted with his thoughts of Cat. It was complex and confusing. Like the two sides were competing for his attention. He didn't know which to turn to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat...They almost kissed yesterday. Why did she turn away? Did she hate him? She must have surely hated him now. He was purposely ignoring her, but for good reason. His brother was constantly watching, Alex couldn't see him but he could feel him. He wouldn't let Maxwell hurt anyone, including Jamie and especially Cat. She couldn't get mixed up with this vendetta, this deadly brotherly squabble. But he didn't want Cat to hate him, he only wished she could understand. He wished he could tell her the whole story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and his girlfriend walked towards the downtown area. It was mid afternoon and the traffic on the streets was beginning to pick up, showing signs of the upcoming rush hour. A wide demography of people filled the sidewalks, bouncing and colliding off each other in a race to get to their respective destinations. Marlene had grabbed hold of his hand and was staying close to him, but Alex's eyes were straight ahead. It was a noisy mass pile up of human bodies, too loud to even hear yourself think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlene had a thin red purse attached to her neck, which dangled at her side. She had probably never been pick-pocketed before, else she might have known better to keep it in such plain sight for any wandering hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small figure rushed past her and violently tugged at the straps, which instantly came undone. Marlene made a wasted attempt to grab the thief, but the figure was already a good distance away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My purse!\" She cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's body had already begun to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell watched, with some amusement, as his brother chased after the little purse-snatcher he had hired. The two tore off into the crowds of people, gracefully bobbing and weaving between the gaps. The kid was a good runner, but Alex was certainly faster. Maxwell patiently drummed his fingers on the arm rest of the van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids these days are too expensive...\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Asked Jonny Vale, as he polished a police shotgun in the backseat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was that brat's age, I would have happily done a gig like that for a few dollars. That kid wouldn't settle for less then a twenty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Times change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVale gently took apart the gun, taking extra care while dissembling every piece. \"Why did you even need to hire the kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To gather information, I needed to see something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're not going to tell me what that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell smirked. \"No, I'll tell you. I need to get someone else that's close to my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVale was visibly confused. His scared face contorted. \"Isn't the girl at the hideout enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's necessary, but I need someone else too. I was hoping that the someone else would be my brother's girlfriend there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not close to your brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had finally caught the thief by the ring of his shirt. He was holding the kid up with one arm and took the purse away with his other. By now, Marlene had caught up to the pair as had a policeman who had been watching the entire time. Alex gave the kid a very annoyed look as he squirmed and tried to get away. Maxwell looked deep into Alex's eyes from the safety of the black tinted windows of the van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is...But not in the way I require her to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means my brother's an idiot. He's dating someone he doesn't really care that deeply for, when there's another person out there who truly matters to him. That's the person I need to go after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't answer the question about why we needed the brat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell laughed. \"Knowing Alex, if someone had stolen a simple purse from that person he cared for, he'd probably nearly beat them to death. My brother is very protective about the people that matter to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you used the kid to find out if that girlie was the one you're after? You're a cruel bastard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police officer had begun taking the kid away, who was kicking and screaming. Alex handed the stolen purse back to Marlene who was overjoyed to have it back. Alex seemed completely indifferent, a smile curled on Maxwell's lips as he continued watching the two walk down the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was worth a try. Besides, I'd figure my brother caught on to my plan when I left him alive last night. He's probably going to be hiding that precious person from me, even if they hate him for it. He's going to completely ignore them to save them from me. He's that kind of person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell bit the tip of his thumb, a small drop of blood dripped down his finger. \"That's fine by me brother, there are other ways to lure your secret lover out of hiding.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The apartment seemed to be in even more disrepair now that Jamie was gone. Alex paced around the floor, it was all he could do to relieve the tension. This was the third time he had tried to sit down and do homework but had to stop and think, too much was on his mind. He checked the clock again. Nine O'clock. Cat was probably still up, maybe finishing off any remaining homework or getting ready for bed. Jamie was probably alone in the dark somewhere, terrified and confused. The thought sickened him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit!\" He shouted all of a sudden, slamming his fist into a couch pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere they still watching him? Was his brother laughing at him as he paced the room around, tearing himself apart? Was this all part of his plan? Watching him suffer while Cat drifted further apart from him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex cursed again and grabbed his coat. He couldn't take it anymore. He had to tell Cat, he had to know if she hated him for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Cat, the rest of the day had gone by as a normal day usually would. Tandy decided to come over for a little bit again which was a nice distraction from the problems earlier at school, they both worked on homework before watching some new Anime after dinner. As usual her parents didn't show up again until they had finished dinner and by then Tandy had to leave. Overall, it was an uneventful evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat had just stepped out of the shower, she had to be careful now so that her parents didn't see their daughter as a soggy cat girl. Having all the fur proved to be quite the annoyance, she dripped all over the floor and it took three towels just to dry herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending fifteen minutes blow drying her fur, she heard a tap at the window. Followed by another louder one. Someone was throwing rocks at her window. Cat quickly wrapped a towel around her head like a hood and looked outside. Alex was standing there, out of breath and looking nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex!?\" Cat quickly opened the window. \"Alex? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh! Not so loud.\" The voice whispered back. \"Can we talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat looked around her room. She had a robe and could wear some slippers and a towel around her head, Alex probably wouldn't be able to notice her catty self in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll be right down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you. I guess you just got out of the shower...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Alex, I could use some fresh air to dry off anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat's parents were already asleep. She and Alex were both walking outside in the dark along the sidewalk, Cat had to be sure to stay out of the street lights as much as possible. But Alex didn't seem to be paying close attention to her too much. He seemed jumpy and jolted around at the slightest sound around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to an dark alleyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat blushed. \"A-A d-dark alleyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, it's not what you think! C-crap that came out wrong! I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bit his lip trying to find the right words. \"I'd just prefer no one see us. I have something important to tell you but if anyone else heard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat blushed some more. Was he going to...confess to her? \"O-okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't have made that sound more awkward, Alex was also blushing slightly. He had to get her alone though, make sure that no one was watching them. He was already putting Cat at a huge risk doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey picked a long dark spot between two tall houses, all that was around them was a few trashcans and liter. It was pitch black, but with her improved vision Cat could see Alex perfectly. She had never seen anyone look so tense in her life. He picked a spot against the wall and leaned against it, trying to compose himself. Cat just stood across from him, arms behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. A few drops of water from the gutters was the only sound that could be heard. No cars were even out on the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you...Hate me?\" Asked Alex at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hate me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of where he was going with this Cat gave an instant reply. \"Of course not! I mean, I don't really know you all that well. But I...I don't hate you Alex...Why would you think that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a look of relief. \"I just had to know...I've been acting unfriendly lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Cat, I think...You're in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember how my brother escaped? How the police are after him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's after me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you tell the police!? They can protect you if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like that. He isn't looking to physically harm me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sighed. \"Something...Happened between us a long time ago. It ended with him going to jail and then the mental institution. He hasn't forgiven me since then. That's why he kidnapped Jamie, that's why...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped, not wanting to finish the sentence. \"...That's why he's going to be looking for someone else I really care about. He wants to get to me through people that matter to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Isn't everyone you know in danger then? What about Marlene? She's your girlfriend, right? Isn't she in more danger than I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex shook his head. \"Okay...There's no easy way to say this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Alex could see of Cat were her eyes shinning in the moonlight, the rest was covered in the darkness of the night. Cat could see him perfectly clearly though. Alex started fidgeting uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this sounds...sudden....Hell it sounds completely retarded in retrospect. I mean, I've only really talked with you for a few days now. But the truth is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both blushed at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like something was holding him back. A flare of doubt in his mind that was blocking the words from coming out of his mouth. He had to get this out. He felt like he was going to explode if he didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You matter to me...A great deal...And...I don't know...I think I like you. A lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I can't explain it...When I'm around you, I just feel whole. We've only really met for a few days and I can't stop thinking about the moments we're together. Even if it's just us talking. I don't know what it is...It eats me up inside. I've never felt this way about anyone, ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But what about Marlene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It's all confusing and not the same with her. She's a nice person, she's been a committed girlfriend too. But...She's not you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was having trouble taking in the sudden knowledge that her crush for an entire year had a crush on HER. She couldn't think of anything to say, her mouth mostly just hung open when she tried to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, the reason I'm telling you this is because...Well, it doesn't seem right that I ignore you without you knowing why. I want to protect you, I'd die to protect you. I won't let my brother harm you in anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat's silence was making Alex nervous. \"I must sound like an idiot don't I? Ungrateful to Marlene and interested in you in just a few days...But I swear on my life, I think I'm in love with you Catherine Hill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"...love...you...too...\"</font> Mumbled Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I s-said...\" Cat gulped. \"I love you too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Alex's turn to be speechless. Cat was starting to sweat from blushing so much. Did she really just say that out loud? Was that the wrong thing to say? Was he looking for another reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he laughed. It started slow and then grew louder, happier. Like he hadn't laughed in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea...How happy it makes me feel to hear you say that.\" Said Alex, he wiped a few tears from his eyes. \"I thought I was just being stupid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I feel the same w-way about you...Since the start of the year, I-I've had a crush on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now I really feel stupid for not knowing that...\" Replied Alex, rubbing the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey just looked at each other. It didn't feel wrong to stare at each other anymore. It didn't feel like stealing as it normally did. They felt obligated to, like if they turned away the other would vanish before they looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Want me to walk you home?\" Offered Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quietly grabbed her hand and lead her out of the alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you wearing gloves? Your hands are padded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah....It's cold out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to borrow my coat then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's a-alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat looked up at the moon and smiled. \"Everything's alright...\"</span></div></div>",

In big green letters it read \"3:17 AM\", and as she had done the last six times she looked at the clock, Cat sighed and rolled over in her bed. It was going to be a sleepless night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was both a bad and a good thing, on one hand she didn't have to go around hiding in a ridiculously over-sized coat in the middle of spring but on the other she didn't get to see Alex. Her thoughts were still buzzing through what had just happened hours ago in the dark alley, she was trying to sort out all of her emotions before daybreak like a traveler trying to pack up for a flight that left in fifteen minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she really just admit to Alex that she had a crush on him? Did he love her too? Had she just been dreaming the whole thing or was this all part of the mutation she had been going through? Perhaps she was losing her mind altogether...She wouldn't be surprised with all that had happened this past week, maybe the strain had gotten to her and she just snapped without even knowing it. Especially with that surreal dream she had just the other night involving the mirror. But then again, maybe this was karma. Maybe dreams did come true and finally things were going her way. She did wish into the coin to \"win over\" Alex after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was only one way to find out, wait until tomorrow. Cat groaned and sat up again. The clock read \"3:24 AM\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ, do you ever sleep Leonard? Even the little girl's out despite being blindfolded in the dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't been in maximum security prison before, have you Vale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I had only been in the joint a few days until you busted me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell leaned back in the ratty armchair they had found behind in the alleyway. \"Imagine a room completely lit up, like you were standing in the middle of an open field on sunny midday. Now imagine that, only it being three in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell laughed as he took off his fedora. \"Nah, the brightness I could handle. When I was a kid we were lucky enough to even get light. No, it was the noise. The constant hum from the lights that burned on you. The sound that you can hear if you still your breathing long enough. It's enough to drive you insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The noise from the lights kept you awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Essentially. But I didn't mind, I probably wouldn't have fallen asleep anyway. Too much planning to do. Too much on my mind...Since then though I haven't been able to have a decent night's sleep. My body wouldn't allow it until my mind has been put at ease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell closed his eyes in thought then frowned. \"What's your story anyway Vale? What were you in for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was involved in several muggings around town, I'm not some lunatic like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell ignored that last part. \"Just the muggings? They don't throw you in the bin for a few simple muggings, speaking from one thief to another. You would have had to do something involving blood to get treated like a real criminal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny Vale sighed. \"I...Killed a woman. I just wanted her purse. She screamed. She wouldn't shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes as if trying to remember that moment in time. \"Someone would have heard her. Someone would have caught me. I couldn't get caught then. Too much mattered and...God...She looked just like her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVale stopped his tale for a brief moment, bringing a hand to his eyes. He choked slightly in a sob. \"Nothing mattered though...After that I tried robbing another girl, she cut up my face.\" He motioned to his scar. \"I'm going to kill that bitch...Because of her...She can't stand the sight of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxwell smirked. \"Tsk. It pains me to see a big man cry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off Leonard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit, why don't you get some rest? We got a fun job ahead of us tomorrow at the school, if you're still interested in tagging-along that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I'm after that bitch...And I have a feeling if I stick around with you I'm likely to see her sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it. Nightie night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat groaned as she dragged her feet to her locker. Her mind didn't let her get a wink of sleep at all last night, and Tandy who usually had a cup of coffee that she might have been willing to share was nowhere to be seen this morning. She was probably just running late, but it certainly didn't help with Cat's mood. At least she could hide inside her coat and fall asleep without the teacher knowing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could barely hold the weight of her textbooks she was feeling so out of it. Stumbling around, she made her way to her first class that day. Unknowingly she bumped right into...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a sunny morning in Parthenon city, the first day of Carolyn Elson's Junior Year at High school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn was a black haired girl with cerulean-gray eyes, svelte with an impressive bust she was easily the hottest 6 year old at her school. Carolyn was also a rather popular girl, mostly due to her status as a cheer leader. While she could be vapid at times she wasn't a rotten girl, but she could get bossy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked in, a clique of best friend wannabes and some old cheer leaders from last year said hi. Carolyn waved to them and smiled. She recalled that try outs were in a few weeks and that she'd be helping to pick those who did and didn't make it onto the team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to think about what kind of girls would be trying out this year when she bumped into an old friend of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry there...Kim?\" she said in shock. Kim was Carolyn's best friend since middle school. She had always been a tall, frizzy red headed girl with freckles peppering her face. Kim Sullivan also was in shape the last time Carolyn saw her, but this was no longer true. It was as if she had her body weight practically double. Kim now had a pudgy frame to put it lightly. Her entire body was caked in fat, and the large top she wore showed just a little bit of her massive belly, and showed signs of tightness. The large capris the girl wore must've been around size 46 at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Carry. Long time no see!\" Kim said. \"I missed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kim....What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know how my dad is a food connoisseur? Well during the summer he took me and my mom with him on the job and we got to eat at a lot of really good food from some five star restaurants. The people who worked at those places were so nice they even gave me free meals if I asked.\" Kim said in excitement, but a few moments later she looked embarrassed. \"The thing is though I kinda noticed that I gained a few pounds...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few was putting it lightly, but Carolyn said nothing. \"Well it's not that noticeable. I bet no one will say a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's good because I was thinking of trying out for the cheerleaders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were?!\" the raven haired teenager asked her friend. Kim nodded her plump head a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We didn't get to hang out over the summer like we used to so I kinda wanted to use this as a make up. I've even practiced all the school cheers I saw you guys do at last years games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we were talking about changing the routines, so you may want to hold off...\" Carolyn said, not wanting her friend to embarrass herself. Too bad Kim was never good at taking hints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay. I can learn the new ones then.\" she said as the bell rang. \"Oh that's the class. I'll talk to you later ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty. Bye Kim.\" Carolyn said waving before parting ways with her friend. Inside she felt a twinge of disgust and pity for her friend. To a girl like Carry her physical image was very important. If Kim hadn't eaten so much over the summer Carolyn would've thought her friend would be a shoo in for the squad, but because of her weight it was less than likely. The team already had it's heavy girls for the pyramid and other routines, but even they were barely pudgy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'How could Kim have let herself go like that?</i> the teen thought as she shuffled to class with the myriad of other students. She would rather die than be fat. She never really liked overweight people, more than likely because of her mother. Dianne Elson, to Carry there would be no one more embarrassing to have as a mother. Obese, divorced, and working a boring office job, she was everything Carolyn never wanted to be. <i>Well maybe I can help Kim lose the weight...I won't let her get that bad.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he entered Mr. Hanse's class. She looked about and saw some familiar faces and some new ones. Among the old students here was David Parker, a handsome well built guy that Carolyn liked. He wasn't on any teams, but he did go to the games. So far he was single too. Maybe Carolyn would make her move after class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe late bell rang and yet Mr. Hanse didn't show. The class began to talk idly, about the missing teacher, break ups, tv, and petty fights between classmates, when a young looking man came in and wrote his name on the board. He couldn't be more than five years older than the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning. My name is Mr. Edwin Garner.\" he said, \"I'll be taking over Mr. Hanse's class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me Eddy.\" said a new boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Garner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah. Well what happened to Hanse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Hanse retired all of a sudden. I was called in to take his place for the time being.\" Mr. Garner explained. This was odd considering Mr. Hanse was only in his forties. \"In any case class lets begin our Physical Education class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the odd goings on Carry wasn't bothered until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shortly after that the class headed to the locker rooms and changed. Since it was their first day Mr. Garner decided to have some fun with gym exercises. Of course Carolyn was wearing the school's signature blue and white shorts and shirt with a picture of a pelican on it. She seemed to be one of the few students wearing this ensemble as the others were in their own home brought clothes mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Garner then walked out before the class and lead them through warm ups and other basic stretches. Carolyn found them simple enough, she had been used to it from cheerleading exercises. From there they went on to fitness tests.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These exercises are to determine your general strength level and to see how I should pace the class.\" Mr. Garner explained. \"We'll start with some sit ups and push ups and move to track and other events.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn was basically unperturbed by this, but moaned and groaned with the rest of her class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they started push ups she found it almost effortless. She managed to do sixty without even breathing heavily, her muscles feeling fine. No one seemed to notice except Mr. Garner who merely wrote on a clip board. A similar effect occurred with sit-ups, then when she ran the 500m dash she finished in school record time. This was the only thing that didn't go unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeze!\" said Leo, a track team member. \"Steven Tyler didn't even go that fast. You ever think about joining the track team?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn was a bit embarrassed. Steven Tyler was the school's top athlete, he was also a practical all star. Although she was flattered she was also embarrassed, cheerleaders weren't supposed to be that athletically gifted. Carolyn wasn't even muscular so she wondered how she had managed to do so much so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just felt so powerful, she had no idea why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have good genetics.\" Mr. Garner said to her from seemingly nowhere, bothering her. \"Genetics are an odd thing. They give some of us the extra edge we need to succeed and survive, but they can also have negative effects. What we make into positives or negatives are entirely up to us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words he had said were still in Carry's brain as the class bell rang. Almost the entire rest of the day was uneventful, but during lunch she saw David sitting down at a table by himself. She decided to take a seat by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey David,\" she said calmly as she came by, her heart fluttering. \"Mind if I sit by you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" he said, not rudely or in a friendly tone. His voice just seemed blank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...did you enjoy class earlier?\" she asked as she ate some salad. The boy shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fine, I think you did well though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! That means a lot.\" she said, \" I was worried you'd think I was a freak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should you care? Ultimately what makes you happy matters most, not someone else's opinion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, but I still feel like I was on the spot. Especially the way that sub talked to me at the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was about to say something back when Kim's voice rang out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Carry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy set ginger then waddled her way over to the table and sat down just as David was starting to open up. Carolyn was exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Kim...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you over here and thought I'd sit with you.\" she said, already eating the burger off of her tray and smiling. She then looked at David. \"Oh hey David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Kim right?\" he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" she confirmed. \" It's been a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has.\" he said before standing, \"look I've got to go to the library. See you two later maybe.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you.\" Carolyn sighed. The 16 year old girl tried her best not to blame her friend.David was barely opening up, but he had at least spoken before Kim showed up. Carolyn was still annoyed as she heard her friend smack on food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Carry, you and him seemed pretty friendly. You like him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, kinda.\" Carolyn said blushing. she saw Kim use her old snicker whenever she was right. It was so odd seeing that obese version of her friend use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it. I must've totally killed the mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe just a little.\" Carolyn admitted, her blue eyes consoling, \"But just wait a bit next time ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Kim agreed as the girls shared a laugh, unbeknownst to either a few of the other popular girls saw this and came to the conclusion that Carolyn was pitying Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed and the school day ended. After a long  bus ride home Carolyn arrived at her home. It was a boring suburban house that her mom struggled to pay for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out her house key Carry went in and saw that everything was neat, yet no one was home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down she saw a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Carry, I'm working late tonight. I made dinner for you, and there are snacks in case you are still hungry. I will call you when I get off.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Love, Mom</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn sighed and just went to her room to get some of her books covered and other first day assignments in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It felt as if she had never had lunch in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{i'}I guess I should have something to eat.' she thought to herself. She made her way into the kitchen and looked in the fridge and pulled out the other salad she had made. She quickly finished it, yet it did little to alleviate her hunger pangs. Even so she did her best to ignore them, but about an hour later she could hardly take the burning sensation any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to see what her mother had made she saw that there were six steaks, some mashed potatoes, and some green beans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well I guess I can have one steak today.'</i> she thought as she prepared a plate and ate. She was amazed by the flavor, it had been a long time since she had eaten anything her mother had made. It was refreshing after all of the cold uncooked vegetables and virtually bland pieces of cold cuts. She finished the meal and was quite pleased, yet she found herself wanting more. She walked over to get more, but it was so fast it seemed as if she was running. It hardly bothered her since she just wanted more steak for now. Carolyn also added more vegetables and potatoes to her plate and finished them in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, after the process continued to repeat itself Carolyn had finished every bit of dinner, and had even eaten a few brownie snack cakes her mother had made. She felt nice and full, but at the same time guilty and surging with some unknown force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the clock she saw that it was six, about time for her shower. She went up stairs, still moving faster tan normal, and found herself there at the door in no time. When she tried to open it though it started to compress under her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" she gasped. \"Doorknob metal must be cheap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring this she went inside and undressed, she was concerned about her bloated belly after the meal. It was quite large and for some reason there was extra flab around her midsection. It made no sense. Hours earlier her figure was trim and neat and yet flab had materialized out of nowhere. Now she was feeling self conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Damn it! Tomorrow I'll have to exercise a bit more. Still If I'm so athletic why do I have this fat on me?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she took a quick shower and changed into her pajamas, which felt a little tighter than usual, only annoying her further and making her more determined to lose the weight, her stomach was even poking out against the material, and the bottoms were really snug on her backside for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching tv for an hour or so and writing the day's events in her private journal she went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that night Carry felt odd. Her breathing pattern grew off and her clothes more constricting. For some reason she felt like she was going to burt out of her nightwear. Eventually she unconsciously tore them off, but that wasn't enough as her panties felt as if they were lodged into her backside and her bra was no longer intact, having burst mid-sleep. The only thing that made Carry bother to wake up was the need to relieve herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she entered the bathroom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her stomach was expansive, so much so that her top rode up and barely contained her impressiveli engorged mammaries.<br>\r\nIn addition to these she had a huge pair of thunder thighs and a massive rear. All around she was fat, but it seemed proportioned. Still Carolyn was flabbergasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" she yelled loudly, beyond appalled. This had to be a dream.

She knew no one who could give her answers and had nothing that could fix her, plus she was tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe...I'll take a nap.' she yawned. 'I'll deal with this tomorrow.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she walked with a slight waddle back to her room, when she opened the door though it nearly tore off the hinges. It shocked the now plus sized girl, but fortunately it'd pass for being useable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gingerly laid on her bed which now seemed small and creaked under her weight. After a while she was snoozing restfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Carolyn awoke groggily and saw herself back to normal. She blinked in surprise, but was relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a dream...\" she began when she saw that her clothes were stretched and ripped in places, and her door was still in bad shape. \"Or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still worried about what had gone on, but decided to worry about getting to school first...After she got some breakfast. Going through the fridge she saw little that was readily available, so she decided on a couple apples. She also had to prepare a salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carolyn arrived at school not long after all of this went on. She was still disoriented from it all...Her incredible appetite, her newfound physical abilities, and now suddenly becoming fat last night. It was like some kind of surreal dream...She hardly believed that it had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day progressed as it had yesterday, but Carolyn didn't run into Kim and ate a large breakfast at school. This time no fat appeared on her body though after she ate, to her relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started out on PE again for her starting class, which was merely a lesson on basic warm up exercises. Mr. Garner was still subbing and aside from that nothing interesting happened. After that she attended Geometry and towards the end of class she began to feel odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then noticed that her clothes were becoming tighter and tighter, her flesh expanding and becoming flabbier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh not again!</i> she thought. Her first impulse was to run somewhere and hide. Immediately she saw the Lost and Found area and went in. It was unattended. She heard a noise that signaled that her clothes were ripping. Quickly she stripped to preserve them and sighed when the changes were done, both from relief and exasperation. \"Great. Well now what the hell am I gonna wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later she saw that the lost and found box was open. She was against taking clothes people had lost or discarded, but it was either that or go around nearly naked as she refused to stretch out her clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRummaging through them she found some jeans, mismatched shoes, old faded shirts, and a stained jacket before finding an acceptable outfit. She discovered a large black blouse with a pink heart on it and some large matching sweatpants. They were XXL sized and not very fashionable, but she still put them on. They were snug as well for some reason, but at the very least most of her body was covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she had clothes she was considering going to her next class, but then she'd have to explain all of the changes in her body and no one would believe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I better just leave for now...I'll just go out on town for now and tell everyone I was sick tomorrow.'</i> she thought as she packed her things into her backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the room and waddled uncomfortably as she exited the school, not many people paid attention to her, but the ones who did either didn't look too long or recognize her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was out she began to worry about what was happening to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What if I just keep getting bigger and bigger until I can't move any more? Then how am I supposed to cheerlead?'</i> she thought, before another thought struck her. If she was stuck like this she couldn't cheerlead because she would be kicked off the team. As she continued to worry she bumped into someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Sorry...I didn't see you there.\" she said apologetically. She had bumped into a man who seemed to be in his twenties, he was medium build and looked less than pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you can't see much over your fatass stomach bitch,\" he replied roughly looking her over. Despite his evident disdain there was something of an attracted look in his eyes (mostly evident after he eyed her breasts). \"Still if you're so sorry you can pay me back a couple of ways...Starting with your wallet. I'll tell you what you can do from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No way!\" she told him angrily, after scowling the man drew a pocket knife and waved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't a request. Now do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReacting from shock Carolyn automatically punched at the man. She heard a noise and felt the hit connect. The man was knocked onto his back groaning. The black haired girl was shocked, but relieved when she saw him get up, she was worried that he was seriously injured because of a crunching noise she heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relief disappeared when she saw him stand shakily and cough up some blood, teeth coming out with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell?!\" he shouted clutching his mouth with his free hand. He looked at Carolyn and was torn between trying to retaliate from anger or run for safety. He chose the former and rushed her. \"You freak! I'll make you pay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Carolyn had no reflex, but ran. The man chased her still, but within a minute she managed to get far away. When she stopped running she was near the city limits, before she was in the center of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Damn...That was scary...At least I got away from that asshole.'</i> as she composed herself she discovered it was nearly the end of the school day, she had to get back there or she'd miss the bus. Still getting on still looking different would be awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to get back now?\" she asked herself when a male voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can offer you a ride home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around Carolyn saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Mr. Garner, what was he doing this far from the school? Being a sub it was possible that he clocked out early, but his talking to someone who was an apparent stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you need a ride or not Carolyn Elson? It would be no problem for you to run back like that, but it'd raise suspicion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn was beyond shocked, this teacher had managed to recognize her very easily, and he wasn't even slightly surprised by her change in appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you can recognize me?\" she asked pointing a plump finger at her bigger figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhat. It's not that difficult if you really look for key features in your face. You might want to go with a mask or something to hide part of your face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?!\" Carolyn asked, getting more and more confused. \"You're not making sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain in a more private place.\" he said calmly, \"I doubt you'll believe me at first, but it is the truth...That is if you care to hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Carolyn made her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll go with you.\" she said sighing and managing to squeeze into the vehicle. For a long time they rode in silence until Carolyn's stomach growled. She was mortified...Being overweight and driven around by a teacher she hardly knew didn't help things either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, eat this.\" the dark brown haired teacher said, handing her a triple layered bacon cheeseburger. It was still warm and fresh. \"It should hold you for the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" she said gratefully. Normally she would automatically turn such a fatty food down, but she was too hungry to care. She quickly began eating it and spoke with her mouth semi-full. \"So you know why I suddenly got so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It's a super power.\" Mr. Garner said calmly. The blue eyed girl had no such composure<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super power. Well the fat is a side effect. You see super powers do exist, and so do heroes and villains, but it's not exactly like the comics. Heroes are born through heredity. There are no aliens from dying planets or radioactive spiders who bite people and give them powers. You have to be born with it and it shows itself as the person nears adulthood. You're one of those lucky few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, some heroes can fly and read minds, I can just turn into a ball of lard. I'm super lucky.\" she replied sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only so you can keep your abilities running. When you activate your powers your physical abilities reach superhuman levels. If my estimations are right your strength and speed levels are ten times what a normal person in an adrenaline rush would have, and you have other increased physical abilities I can't figure out yet. Your body just needs a lot of energy to maintain that kind of strength so your body stores large amounts of fat which reveals itself when your powers activate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So because I'm so powerful I have this fat on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and an increased appetite. Still as you've expended some energy you've gotten thinner than you were before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at herself Carolyn did see that her new clothes were much looser than before despite her still being much larger than she previously was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. But can I cut it on and off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea yet, but I do know something.\" Mr. Garner said, finally they neared the school and he entered the parking lot. He put his car in the designated area and looked at her with his gentle green eyes. \"As odd as it is, you have a gift. A gift you should use wisely. Your powers aren't anything to laugh at and you could do the world some good if you decided to use them to help mankind. Of course you aren't obligated to, but it's something to think about. Either way if you have questions I'm more than willing to answer them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Thank you Mr. Garner.\" Carolyn said gratefully. She was pretty overwhelmed by what he said, and slightly confused, but at least she had an idea of what was going on. \"Say...How do you know so much about heroes anyway? And are there villains too if there are heroes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course there are villains as well, but you're going to miss your bus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you didn't answer-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will some other time.\" he said re-starting his car and backing it out. \"Until then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he drove off, leaving Carolyn to her own devices.</span></div></div>",

It had taken awhile but she finally managed to get back to normal, thank God, and make it back before her mom got worried.  She was fortunate enough to get to the girl\u2019s room and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she returned though she did indeed see her heavyset mother, a woman of at least 320 lbs. She had the same cerulean eyes as Carolyn, and there was some facial similarity between them, hidden by layers of facial fat and four chins. She was holding her cell phone in her hand and looking worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh Carolyn, thank goodness you\u2019re home!\u201d she said, \u201cWhere were you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh\u2026I had to finish a test after school.\u201d Carolyn lied quickly, \u201cSorry I didn\u2019t get a chance to call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn\u2019s mom managed to waddle over and give her daughter a hug, but Carolyn hardly felt she needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou should\u2019ve called. I thought you might\u2019ve ran into trouble\u2026.Parthenon City has some shady people and I was worried that you got raped or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMom! I was fine, nothing like that happened!\u201d the teenager countered, not letting her mother know something of that nature nearly happened. \u201cAnyway can you let me go? I have homework.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlright. But be careful from now on sweetie.\u201d Her mother said, sounding a bit wounded.  \u201cBy the way I\u2019m ordering pizza tonight. I know you probably don\u2019t want any but on the one in a million chance you do what do you want on it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cErr\u2026I\u2019d actually like one whole one for myself. With everything on it please.\u201d Carolyn said, her new hunger was making her want more and more food\u2026Probably to store more calories for her power. \u201cAnd a soda or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat? Aren\u2019t you worried about ruining your figure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey, even cheerleaders can splurge every now and again.\u201d She countered, semi playfully. \u201cAnyway I\u2019m going to go now. Bye mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Carolyn trudged up to her room and laid in bed, worrying about her new issues.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could just give her teachers a sick note and make her work up, but this whole being super strong, and super fat, deal was bugging her. She wouldn\u2019t mind it so much if she could just be her regular self, but all that flab and fat surrounding her body when she really tried to use it\u2026It was less than ideal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u2018I could just not use those powers\u2026But that would be a waste.\u2019 She thought, \u2018Mr. Garner did say I could help people and I know I can, especially after the way I dealt with that jerk with the knife. I do have to learn more about Garner though, he didn\u2019t answer my questions and he acts like a suspicious guy, even though he was nice earlier. Either way...I think I\u2019ll give this thing a shot.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn made her decision uneasily at first, but as time passed she became more confident with her choice. She knew she\u2019d need a costume and a name to start off with before she gave this thing a try, but it would come to her in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor now some channel surfing.\u201d She said watching tv. She flipped through channel after channel until she stopped on a bra add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the handy dandy Super Bra, guaranteed to fit any woman of any physique.  From thin to plus sized this amazing bra stretches to fit it\u2019s wearer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the word physique stuck with Carolyn. It sounded original and referred to any body shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt doesn\u2019t exactly mean fat and it sound kind of cool\u2026\u201d she murmured to herself. Before she could go on she heard the doorbell ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCarry! The pizza\u2019s here!\u201d her mom bellowed. With no second bidding she jumped from her bed and went to get her meal.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a man standing at the toilet. If it was just the fact that Carolyn was alone, this would've startled her. If it was just the fact that she had never seen this man before, she would've shrieked in shock. If it was just the fact that there was a guy using the bathroom when she was supposed to go, she would've flinched, shut the door, and paced anxiously outside the door before she continued her morning ritual of lathering her smooth skin up with soap--and urinating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the three elements put together put her in a stunned silence.  She stared blankly at the fedora wearing man, who casually glanced at her, and flashed a casual, off-handed smile. \"Mind closing the door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn nodded, shut the door, and began walking away. It was only after she took fifteen steps away that she realized how odd what just happened was, the fog of shock dissolving.  She sprinted back into the room, tore the door nearly open--nearly ripping it off its hinges--and shouted \"Hey!  Who the hell are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn't answer at first, instead making sure to completely relieve himself before zipping up his pants, turning, and sighing. He was dressed in a nice business suit, rather odd all things considered. \"Sorry, long trip. Couldn't hold it a second longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long trip from where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn chose not to continue this meandering conversation. \"Okay, asshole, you got ten seconds before I throw you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't recommend that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm here to grant your deepest desires.\" The man drew closer, grinning, \"How would you like to have men fall at your feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. How would you like to be the strongest person at your school, and leave everyone drooling for a chance for you to caress them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds nice, but I don't see how--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I told you that, when school starts, everyone will want a chance to hold you, especially that guy you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo easy to be true. \"What's the catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the cost is you'll have to be fat. Really, it's not that much of a catch, seeing as how it won't matter, but it's something you don't like, so the higher ups told me I had to take something away because--let's face it--this is a too-good-to-be-true offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat? She'd be the very thing she hated, but then she might get to be held. She hadn't had all too many guys interested in her, and even less she dated. There were always other girls who put out more than her, or did more to allure the eyes of men. Actually, oddly enough, even some of the nerds and outcasts got more love than she did. \"Is it possible for me to have a trial version of all this before I decide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trial version? Like those free 30-Day AOL trials? I don't see why not. What do you say? Interested?\"</span></div></div>",

Eric was around the age where boys enter puberty so wasn't all that surprising that he would have a wet dream.  Only this wet dream wasn't about a particular girl he liked.  Eric turns his gaze to a photo of him and his best l friend David, and proceeds to blush and tear up.  He and David have been best friends since kindergarten and have done almost everything together.  However about a few years ago Eric found he would have certain feelings running through his head whenever he was around David.  And even though he felt like he should be attracted to girls (as he had previously thought of himself as straight) he found that he just couldn't get himself to feel attracted to any of the girls at school.  He did, however, find himself increasingly attracted to David.  It was about a year ago when he realized that he was in fact gay and had a crush on his best friend.  However he couldn't bring himself to give in to his feelings as David was straight and he was afraid of losing his friendship with David.  However over the past year these secret feelings of his have been boiling inside of him.  And for the past month he has been having erotic dreams about David.<br>\r\nEric was still crying as his mom entered the room.  \"Eric, it's time to get re -\".

His mom responded \"Sweetie, boys your age go through this.  You should talk to you father about this.\"  She continued \"what's her name?\".  Eric took a breath and hesitantly said \" It's... not a girl I like\".  He held the photo and pointed at his best friend as his mother stood in astonishment.  Eric then teared up more and screamed \"I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE\", he thought \"I NEED HIM!  I WANT HIM!

You feel yourself begin to grow in height, tipped off by a stretching in your muscles and bones which are now coated in blubber. Your body throbs with magic energies, you hold your engorged gut, trying to keep it from getting any bigger. \"Nub, NUUB!\" you blubber and moan, but to no avail. The genie's white teeth glint wickedly, reflecting the magical light that surrounds your sandbox. You feel your small penis and testicles fade away into your fatty body as it is replaced with a small crease. \"Huh?\" you grunt, reaching down into the recesses of your tighty-whities to investigate what has happened. Your fingers emerge from your underwear, sticky with some sort of fluid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to grow, now nearly twice as tall as your friends. You shirt and pants rip off completely, revealing a very corpulent, nine-year-old girl in tighty-whities. You hips begin to widen even faster than the rest of your body as your body matures to that of a twelve year old. You feel hair tickle your meaty shoulders as it continues to grow. Bangs begin to obscure your vision in addition to the tears that already do. Unbeknown to you at first, as fatty man-breasts had already covered your chest, breast tissue begins to form on your chest as your body turns thirteen. However, as you turn fourteen and fifteen your breasts expand and swell quickly to the size of your hands, and then you shoulders. They bounce and jiggle on your fat chest, resting playfully on your enormous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour underwear rips off your fattening body as your hips reach the size of those belonging to an obese sixteen-year-old girl. You breasts continue to fatten up and swell rapidly as your physical maturity reaches the ages of seventeen and then eighteen. Now substantial cow tits dominate your upper torso, each around the same size as your chubby head. You nipples have matured greatly, reaching the size of soup can lids and protruding erect in the cool September air. Your hips and breasts and belly continue to plump as your body reaches the age of twenty, then twenty-one, then twenty-two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your thighs, thickened to a size suited for an immense female body, rub together as they increase in diameter. Your legs seem like two immense pillars of smooth, plump fat. The calves of your legs have formed cankles where they meet with your feet, their flesh very plump and taught. At your knees, great creases have formed over and under your kneecaps, reaching around to the backs of your legs. Your breasts are far larger than your head now, firm bags filled with water, rest heavily atop your immense, round belly that continues to swell, like baking dough, covering more and more of your outstretched legs. Your ass has lifted you up several inches higher than your height alone could have done, as each fat cheek is pressed below you. Your hips and love handles are slightly wider than your full, round shoulders. Your round, fatty love handles bulge outward as they rest on your curvy hips, leading upward toward your curved back blubber rolls. Your arms are fat and full, rings formed in the fat around your wrists while dimples and creases appear at your elbows. Your shoulders, as aforementioned, are increasingly round and full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hump of fat has formed behind your neck, decreasing its natural height and causing your shoulders to slope downward from your collar. Jiggling breast fat reaches all the way up to where your collar bone would be visible. Plump rolls of breast tissue have formed under your hairless armpits, reaching back to top the rolls of back fat made by the two rolls of your gut and the inner tube of your love handles. You can feel sweaty pubic hair tickling the underside of your belly where the excess bulk hides your mature vagina. You feel your thick, soft hair cascading down from your head and reaching down past where shoulder blades would be visible if not for your overabundance of flesh. You have to keep pushing your bangs aside as they are now reaching your near-invisible jaw. Your face is round, but not as excessively fat as the rest of you. Although, there is a soft double chin forming slowly under your face, right now it has only manifested in a crease under your chin, indicating a softer neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie, becoming feverish with power, decides to....</span></div></div>",

Your eyes, though red from tears, are piercing and alluring, surrounded by dark, thick eyelashes. Your lips are plump and full and would have a pout even if you were not sobbing. Your nose is defined, straight, and has a slight perk at the tip, making it look just a little bit piggy. Your face is round and sweet, with plump cheeks that would still retain much of their collagen without the extra fat that continues to amass all over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes just long enough to glimpse red mist floating toward your groin. A warm feeling rises up from your vagina, heating up your obese form. You begin to sweat, beads forming at the base of your hairline, in your hidden armpits and in all the creases in between all the huge rolls of fat that riddle your buxom frame. As you continue to grow hotter, you have to open your mouth to breath, as your weight demands this. Your adipose chest billows and throbs up and down with each heaving breath you take. Blood rushes to your face, making you blush with sexual heat as sweat runs down your enormous curves, causing the growing rolls of fat to squeak as they jiggle and rub against one another. You have an urge to rub your pussy, to jam something in it. You forget that your friends are there as you grow hotter and hornier. You let out a high, feminine gasp, without knowing quite what you are doing, you begin to squeeze and massage your expanding, enormous teats in your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's, uuhh, what is this, ooh, this feeling,\" you moan aloud, in a voice pitched lower than yours was originally, but unmistakably female.

Your whole body quakes and quivers with your motions, sweat pooling in your belly button and running down your breasts. Some layers of your hair become matted and stick you your back, neck and face. With a loud \"OOooaaaahhh,\" you orgasm for your first time, sticky liquid pulsing and flowing out of your baby-maker. You take your hand out and suck the fluid off your index finger, \"mmmh, salty,\" you say in a strangely matter-of-fact tone for the circumstances you are in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice your friends, the one who was crying is now also staring, confused and scared at the enormous heap of meat that was once his five-year-old, male friend. You feel strangely embarrassed of your nudity and cover your nipples with your hands. Suddenly, the genie draws you attention with a grunt, \"You still have one more wish, my dear,\" his white teeth show once more between his luminescent blue lips. You place your hands on your jiggling midsection as your figure continues to fatten up and fill out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to wish for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, just before your swelling breasts and gut block your vision of the genie entirely, you see him turn his gaze towards your friends. You sit lie there for what seems like forever, all you can do is feel yourself continuing round out and spread across the grass. A bright flash of light signals the departure of the genie into the ether. You let out an exasperated sigh as you realize you will not stop gaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you see the faces of two fully grown men peering down at you. They are naked, and they resemble your friends somewhat. You notice their penises grow erect, but as of yet you cannot quite figure out why. They themselves look down confusedly at their members, each one about six inches long. You remember your urges of minutes prior. \"Help me up,\" you demand. The two men grab your fattening arms and are only able to roll you onto your hands and knees. Slowly, you belly begins to pool on the ground under you and you can even feel the tips of your nipples being tickled by the grass. Staring at their male appendages, you get that strange feeling in your groin again, heating you up. You point to your vagina, moving your spare tire of a belly out of the way for the men to see. \"One of you, like, can you put your penis in here,\" and suddenly a wave of desire washes over you, \"like, now!\" Forgetting for a moment that just moments ago you are all boys of five years, you smile as you feel strong hands grip your thickening love handles. The enormous penis pains you slightly, but in a surprisingly good way as it slides into your extremely tight pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one quick thrust, you feel something inside you burst, a warm liquid flowing out of your vagina at the same time. You open your mouth in surprise, beginning to regret this last move. The other man, taking advantage of this, puts his dick into your wide open mouth. You let out a muffled, \"Mwhum!?\" The two men begin to pulse into you regularly from both sides. \"Num, pwuff shtumph!\" you attempt to shout, trying to get them to stop, but they cannot hear you. You now feel the ful fronts of your breasts resting weightily on the grass, you belly continuing to spread over the turf. You feel the placement of the rear man's hands move further apart as your hips continue to plump and widen. Your arms now have rings in the elbow joints as the upper parts have thickened to the size your thighs were before your first orgasm. You feel a distinct double chin forming under your jaw now, moving further out than your chin. You have nearly no neck, your shoulders, too, are now only slopes of dense fat and blubber. Your ass cheeks, each the size of beach balls, quiver with each driving up given by the men. Your thighs, parted as they are to support your expanding girth, begin to touch under your vagina, each one now an unmistakable thunder thigh. You feel rings now forming at your ankles and your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel as if you will explode, by sexual tension or fat you cannot tell, when suddenly the boys release simultaneously into your vagina and down your throat. At the same time you begin to have your own orgasms, each hitting your like a brick wall of pleasure. All three of you remain in the same position for a few moments, eyes closed, your body packing on the pounds all the while. Soon though, the boys withdraw, you lick the front man's member as it leaves to get one last taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men help you to stand up. You wobble for a few steps, but soon find your footing. Though you are inches shorter than the men, your hulking form seems to dwarf them. One of them notices a dribble of milk that escaped your teat during the orgy. Before you can react, he wipes it off your nipple with his finger and tastes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

Your weight is just nearing the two-hundred pound mark when the concentrated magic penetrates your juicy lips and forces its way to your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, your body begins to jiggle and throb violently.

You begin to hyperventilate in panic, with each inhalation, several pounds of jiggling adipose flesh out your once small, male form. Within seconds your body bulks up to two-twenty, two-thirty, and then two-forty. Your belly, swelling out of control, jiggles outward, pinning your elephantine legs to the sand. Your ass swells to the size of beach balls and beyond, pressing against the plastic frame of the sandbox. Your breasts balloon outward, swelling to the size of your plump, flabby arms. They heave and jostle with the staggering amount of milk and fat that the skin contains, the nipples now as big as your hands.  A fat double chin swells out from under your chubby face, your lips swell and fill with collagen as your cheeks grow rounder and plumper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour weight amplifying greater and greater, from two-forty to two-sixty and then to two ninety, you pulsating body threatening to pass the three-hundred mark. Now unmistakably obese, you begin to vocalize your worry, shrieking at the top of your lungs. \"Stooooooop!! Too faaaaat!!!!\" you wail, clutching at your fat in a vain attempt stop your body from fattening up anymore. Three-ten and then three-twenty, your corpulence ruptures the plastic sandbox on three sides as your porcine, adult hips and ass take up more volume. \"I just wish it would stooooop!!\" you cry, your body billowing and swelling outward by the milisecond, fatter and fatter, wider and wider, thicker and thicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Genie takes this to mean...</span></div></div>",

Your body stops throbbing and jiggling outward, your meaty body resting quietly and heavily on a pile of sand. The genie's magical aura having faded, you begin to take in your surroundings. You first notice the broken sandbox, concluding from the pain in your hips and rear that you were the cause of its demise. The sun is very hot on your weighty flesh. You begin to sweat profusely and cannot help breathing heavily from your mouth due to your size. The moister makes you aware of every cavernous fold in and around your chunky body. You sense hair in your groin, matting against your fleshy underbelly and the creases where your massive thighs meet your crotch. Sweat runs down the bulges and rolls of your sides from your hairless underarms. The inner layers of your hair, thick and heavy as the rest of you, sticks to your back and your pudgy face. It has grown to be lower than your rolls of breast fat on your back, the bangs sticking your your shoulders and double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to try and get up, your obese upper arms rippling as you place your meaty hands on the ground on either side of your immense hips. \"Ooohh, so heavy,\" you complain as you lift your ponderous girth slowly from the sand. Gravity reveals the true extent of your midsection. Your belly still stretches out almost as far as it did when you were sitting, but it also reaches almost to your knees. Looking down your side, you make out rings of blubber that almost envelope your kneecaps as well as rings in the fat at your \"cankles.\" Your breasts, each twice the size of a pillow, are just barley able to remain firm on top of your hefty gut. Sniffling and beginning to tear up once again, you whimper, \"I want my mommy.\" The phrase very strange in the voice of a grown--or in this case--an overgrown woman. But since you only have the experience of five years, the irony is lost on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brush the sand that has stuck to your sweaty ass and thighs with your hands, your whole body jiggling slightly as an effect. \"What am I gonna do,\" you ask aloud. Gazing at your perspiring tits, with their pink nipples as large as your fat face, you notice the lamp lying innocently on the ground before you. You bend over and pick it up, taking a huge amount of effort to bend over your bovine torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill with the absent mind of a five year old, you... </span></div></div>",

Usually met with laughs and giggles as you would streak across the black top, you are confused at all the blank stares you receive from boy and girl alike. Thinking for a moment as you jiggle past the jungle gyms and on to the basketball court, an idea pops into your head. Seeing the face of the fat kid in your grade, you recall that the bullies would always pick on him and everyone would laugh. \"Maybe I'm not fat enough,\" you ponder, \"maybe they'll laugh if I gain more weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as the thought reaches your brain, your body begins to bulge and swell outward, growing heavier and weightier. As your body thickens, a crowd begins to form around you, forcing you to stand still. Since the other children cannot feel it happening like you can, they only notice your gain a minute later. Some kids take even longer to notice as this gain is not nearly as severe as any you have already experienced. You can tell when kids notice, their eyebrows shooting higher than they already are, immediately whispering to whomever they are next to. Some kids run <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a small hand, instantly clammy with your sweat, place itself on your thickening rear as you jiggle outward, now three-thirty-two pounds. \"Wow,\" a small voice gasps, \"she really is getting fatter you guys,\" more gasps and whispers follow. You feel more hands on your ass, soon the children directly in front of you build up enough courage to place their hands on your increasingly plush midsection. The cool hands slapping onto your ass send a strange new feeling through your fattening figure. Your sweating increases as you feel your temperature rising. You breathe more heavily from your mouth, sweat slicking your skin. You feel al the little hands slipping on your sweaty, fat belly. A small voice yells, \"Oooh, slippery,\" her hand smacking your fat and causing it to wobble tremendously. You feel your chest growing slowly heavier and more full of liquid atop your sagging gut. Your own hands dangle at your hips and are soon met by widening, sweaty fat. Your inner thighs grow especially warm with sexual heat, immense thunder thighs rippling and squishing together as they become even thicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy a strange impulse, you slide your fat palms over your amassing gut until your hands hold the fronts of your swelling teats. \"Mmmmh,\" you moan softly, slowly beginning to squeeze and massage your fat, sweaty tits. You vaguely hear a few confused voices, \"hey, what are you doing? What is she doing,\" the voice asks, another voice responding, \"I dunno why don't you ask her,\" the previous voice shouting in reply, \"I just did!\" Now well over three-fifty pounds and continuing to gain weight, you continue to massage your expanding titties. As your arousal grows, your nipples begin to lactate. Warm milk trickles down your already moist belly, wetting a few of the hands that continue to grope, squeeze, and slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of the more adventurous children lift your swelling belly and peak into your meaty nether regions. \"Eeeew,\" squeals one girl, \"it's all hairy!\" \"Really?\" asks another, \"yea, come see for yourself,\" you feel more hands under your fat gut as more children, their curiosity growing, begin to investigate for themselves. \"Hey, stop shovin',\" shouts one boy as he is pushed, the top of his head rubbing against your vulva. \"Mmmooaahh,\" you moan loudly, a few of the timid kids leap backward. One of your hands ventures to the point of contact, still radiating an intense pleasure. You venture into yourself with your middle and index fingers, arching your gelatinous back and moaning loudly as you reach the sweet spot. More squeezes, more slaps, more jiggling, your weight reaches three-sixty-four. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a voice, though your eyes are closed, you can hear the pitter-patter of feet on the pavement as children run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who does the voice belong to?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You, hearing this as a potential salvation for your predicament, recall your new abilities and decide to grant her wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking deeply, you begin to emanate a mist that seems to evaporate off of your sweat. Soon a fog envelopes the crowd. Suddenly the fifth grade girl shrieks, \"my chest!\"  Gazing up from your squat position, you see the girl's breasts beginning to grow underneath her polo shirt. The crowd steps back as her bosom continues to multiply in volume. Large breasts are a very odd sight, indeed, especially on a fifth grader. You think it would look better if she were older, immediately, the girl begins to grow taller as well. Soon, the girl's hips begin to follow her breasts, growing wider and fuller. In a few minutes, the fifth grade girl now appears a very buxom seventeen year old with a very skimpy outfit. Her shirt only barely containing the large boobs within, and her skirt only just covering her bottom, which it fits like a second skin. The girl, entranced somehow by the sight of her growing chest, shoves her hands under her shirt and squeezes her tits tightly in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You see the crowd fixing its gaze onto the newly made model. Sucking in your breath, you begin to move your swelling body away from them. Waddling away, you see some of the boys trying to remove her clothes. You lift up your gut briefly to rid some of your creases of the heat and sweat that seems to accompany your weight gain. Now able to think more clearly, you manage to halt your expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around another corner, you see that you have only jumped from the frying pan into the fire. The sign above the entryway ahead of you indicates that you are now entering the high school campus. You do not fear molestation, as you are not yet even familiar with the word. What you fear is getting beaten up, since that is what big kids do to little kids. Remember, though you have the body of a three hundred seventy pound woman, you are still a five year old boy in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, the high schoolers do not get a recess, only a slightly extended lunch. The entrance, as you walk through it, seems to lead to the football field. You peek around the corner, feeling more skin press against the wall with every second that passes. You tiptoe out onto the grass, your flesh jiggling and bouncing with every movement. Passing the bleachers, you hear a voice, \"Psst, hey,\" the voice whispers, it sounds female, \"they got you too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to face the voice. At first you see only darkness under the bleachers, slowly a figure emerges. It is a very fat, white girl dressed only in an enormous black bra and panties. Glancing at her and back at yourself, you note that though she is rather obese, she is not nearly as heavy as you. The girl adjusts her glasses, \"oh, they took your underwear too, ouch,\" she folds her arms across her broad girth, \"those cheerleaders can be real bitches sometimes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, you can only reply, \"Bi..tches?\" The girl raises an eyebrow, \"yea, that's what I said,\" she moves closer to you, looking you up and down. \"So,\" she begins again, \"where'd they throw your clothes?\" Trying to deflect the question, you ask, \"where'd they throw yours?\" The girl motions to the highest row of bleachers above you. You see some fabric, partially translucent in the sunlight, billowing from the spot the girl points to. \"Why don't you just go and get it,\" you ask timidly. The girl shoots you an incredulous glance, her short, reddish hair rustling just above her shoulders, \"because then I'll only be visible to the entire school,\" she points to a building across the field. The large, brick structure is taller than any you have seen around the elementary campus. Huge windows line each story, all of them looking out directly toward the bleachers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the girl sees that you understand, she continues, \"yea, if I go up there, I'll be committing social suicide.\" You don't understand the last couple of words and continue to stare at her blankly. She smirks, \"well, I guess I should be glad I at least got to keep my undies,\" her tone changes to one sounding more puzzled, \"by the way, you don't seem to care much about being naked, you aren't even trying to hide your boobies.\" She points to your voluptuous breasts, \"come to think of it, I don't think I've ever seen you before, are you new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResponding more automatically than truthfully, you say, \"yea.\"  \"Cool,\" she smiles at you, \"it'll be refreshing to have another lady of lard who I can identify with,\" she says, patting her belly which jiggles somewhat. Now that she is in the sunlight as well, you can see sweat condensing on her chest, rolling down her deep cleavage. Apparently staring at your breasts while you ogle her, she begins again, \"girl, those tits are gi-normous,\" she continues to comment, drinking in your whole figure, \"how did you get so big anyway?\" Noticing the rudeness of her remark, she stammers, \"well, in my case, it just happened during middle school,\" her hands rest on the underside of her belly, \"the weight packed on and I just can't seem to shake it off,\" she smiles up at you again, \"it only jiggles when I try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head turns and her face goes whiter than it already is. Following her gaze, you see three girls, all dressed in similar outfits. Three pairs of short shorts and three tank tops, each containing a beautifully matured, teenage girl seem to glare at you both with their bright colors. Breasts sit snugly in their tight confines, thin bands of skin peek from beneath the shirts' hemlines, plump thighs emerging from their tight shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look,\" says the one in the center, \"it's fatty,\" her gaze falls on you, \"and it looks like miss piggy found a friend she couldn't fit down her throat.\" You do not like these girls, however beautiful they may be, they give you a cold feeling with their presence. You hear a muffled cry, glancing next to you, you see a tear rolling down the fat girl's cheek. \"Oh no,\" says the girl on the right, \"is fatty gonna cry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you have to do something, you begin to grow a seething hatred for these girls. You do not like that they make your new friend cry, you like your new friend. She seems to radiate a unique kind of beauty to your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

Your anger gets the best of you and you charge forward, yelling, \"I ... hate ... bullies!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour enormous girth jostles and bulges as you run the short distance to the bullies. Too stunned to move, the girl in the center only screams as you slam into her with your belly. You feel her lithe body sink into your doughy flesh, her head sliding in between your teats, before she bounces back, landing on her rear several feet in front of you. The two other girls charge toward you. The first one reaches you, attempting to slap you in the face. You back up in surprise and she misses, instead ending up groping your left breast. She looks at her hand, astonished, as it slides off the plump, slippery surface. The other kicks you in the stomach, but you don't feel it very much. Her foot sinks into your flesh, and then is propelled back outward, causing her to tumble onto her back. You find yourself growing exhausted at this small amount of work. Your entire fatty body is shiny with sweat, your breasts jiggling with each heaving breath you take. The girl you slammed into with your meaty gut blindsides you with a kick to your side.

Your knees buckle with embarrassment, you try to hide your belly with your cylindrical arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" he begins in an inquisitive tone, \"you're a fat girl,\" but then he bursts out laughing, \"hahaha, that's the funniest thing ever, you're so fat!\" Then he suddenly gasps, \"and you have cooties!\" He begins to guffaw again, rolling on the ground.

You fall onto your rear, each cheek reaching the size of a bean bag chair as you flesh out nearly ten pounds a second. You shout and wail, \"Nooooo!!' as your body grows rounder and even more obese. Three-fifty, four hundred, four-fifty, and five hundred. You are pinned down flat on your back as your body rises like dough in an oven, immense tits ballooning along with your titanic belly, thighs as wide as two normal-sized women. \"W-why?\" you whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Twisting and gyrating your fat laden pelvis against your hands, your vagina begins to leak a clear, whitish fluid that runs down your fatty inner thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments...  </span></div></div>",

You can feel soft hair cascading down your back fat, twisting and bouncing youthfully. You can feel your body continuing to fatten and plump, but the urgency and violence of moments prior has passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what seems like forever, you stand there, growing. You breath slowly, mouth open and eyes shut. Finally, you feel your change subsiding and you open your eyes slowly. Your house is empty. You look at the clock. It has been almost a half an hour since you got home. Luckily your parents do not arrive home until much later. You will not dare look down. You are almost too afraid to accept what has just transpire and you stand there a few more minutes looking at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of looking, you decide it is less terrifying to feel what your body is rather than seeing it. Trying as hard as you can to pretend that your hands are caressing another person, you begin by flattening your palms at your thighs. They feel smooth and as you rub them slightly, they ripple and jiggle together. Sliding your hands up in unison, you feel the crescendo in your shape as your thigh flesh meets with your butt. Placing your hands firmly on each cheek, fingers spread wide, you move them side to side trying to fully visualize how wide and plump your rear is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing upward, your hands rest on your juicy love-handles. They are so big that your palms are almost parallel to the ground. You move your hands forward, gliding along your blubbery belly until they reach the gaping hole of your belly button. Your midsection has become so obese, you realize, that your belly has been forced into two sections, a top and a bottom that are divided by a slight crease that runs from your belly button to the top of each hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow comes the part you feared most, not only are you fat, you remember, but you are a fat girl. Moving your hands up over the enormous hemisphere of your gut, the presence of two enormous, fatty orbs. \"Tits,\" you sigh, \"I fucking have tits,\" you close your eyes for an instant as you instantly become ashamed of your new voice that you had almost forgotten about. Opening your eyes again, you feel a sexual shock as your plump digits meet your large nipples. They harden and your already immense teats swell ever so slightly. With a shudder, you squeeze your titanic bust. You feel the breast fat displacing all the way up and out to your shoulders and even under your armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rip your mind off of your new endowment and continue your investigation of your body. Your hands travel over your porcine breasts, following their slight curve up to your neck. It feels rounder and plumper than before and you can tell that it almost hides your rotund jaw. Crossing your arms over your breasts, your hands rest finally on your rounded, sloping shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally decide to...</span></div></div>",

Deciding to go to the bathroom, you begin to walk in the quickest direction. You try to take your mind off of your rear as you feel each cheek alternating bounces. On top of this, your hips sway and jiggle your belly and unrestrained breasts around as you walk as well. It is as if each step sends your entire form jiggling and rippling juicily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally enter the bathroom and close the door behind you. The full length mirror is on the back of the door and your turn around slowly, sure and also unsure of what to expect. You gasp at what you see, hands shooting up over your round face. In the mirror, gasping back at you is an incredibly obese, yet somehow incredibly attractive, female version of yourself. Though your gut does take center stage, your gigantic hips and immense bosom are well proportioned, nonetheless. On top of this, your eyes seem bigger and deeper than they were when you were a boy and your nose looks smaller and more effeminate to you. Though you cannot see your mouth anymore with your hands over it, you had a glimpse of a very sexy plump-lipped orifice. Your hair, soft and full-bodied, curls and billows over your shoulders, bunching up again on the almost flat plateau of your erroneous bust. Some locks fall over your face and, at the moment, one eye is completely covered by a luscious slant bang. On one side of your head your hair is behind your ear and you can observe that your ears shrank slightly, rounding into a more feminine shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to find it easier to look at yourself and even work up the nerve to look down, though all you can see are two big breasts and a couple nipples. Upon final observation, you discover your skin seems to be slightly paler and more even toned than it has ever been as far as you can recall. Your hands now lowered, clutching your ponderous gut, your eyes are drawn to your meaty teats. the deep pink areola in contrast with your white breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grow more intrigued with yourself, finding yourself more and more attractive each second. You decide to step onto the scale, bringing it in front of the mirror so that you can see the numbers and not just your own, obese torso. You weigh in at about two hundred and fifty pounds, almost at two fifty one. Looking up again, you catch yourself smiling and immediately scowl in disbelief at yourself. \"But I don't want to be fat,\" you murmur, almost pouting, \"that's the last thing anyone wants,\" you squeeze and press your bosom again, \"especially a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then...</span></div></div>",

Navigating your way to your dresser, you begin to search for something that might at least cover your privates. All you are able to acquire, however, is a button down flannel shirt. The sleeves are tight, but not too tight and they just pass your elbow. You find that you can button up only three buttons in the middle of the shirt before it becomes to hard. You bite your lip as you groan to try and button the next ones on either end, but they will not reach. The shirt does fall a few buttons lower than your bust, but your belly spreads them wide apart. Your nipples, pressed up against the soft fabric, send tingles through your body and you have to take a moment to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirt makes you feel a bit slutty in a daisy dukes way as it pretty much shows your entire bust except for your nipples. You grow embarrassed at this new thought. You do not realize it, but a devious grin creases your plump face while you ponder this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to search for something to cover your rear because your belly already hides your vulva. None of your pants fit, and the ones you manage to get up past your knees only rip as you attempt to fit the fabric around your hairless, plump thighs. You come to realize, more so than you ever could by simply looking at a scale, how truly fat your are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to look in your mother's dresser while realizing, almost joyfully, that you are a much larger woman than she. Sifting carefully through the panties, so as not to disturb their organization too much, you come across a pair that seem to be made mostly of elastic and almost look like male briefs. With clenched teeth, you apprehensively slide the panties around your massive behind. With a sigh of satisfaction, you let the panties snap onto your rump. Gazing backward into the mirror in your parents' bedroom, you see that the underwear, like the shirt, barely covers anything and most of your hindquarters are plainly visible. But the clothes you found will have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuppressing a slight smirk, your gaze falls to the drawer of braziers, all of which are much to small for your vast bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBouncing merrily downstairs, your breasts almost coming out of their new holdings, you glance out the window... </span></div></div>",

Trying to ignore the bursts of pleasure you were feeling, you take a glance at her and see that she is almost unrecognizable. Her body had swollen with fat. Her gut was round and soft, sagging against yours. Her once petite breasts now hung with accumulated weight. Most of all, her small bottom had exploded out, extending behind her in a generous shelf. Her hips were spread wide and her thick thighs gripped your sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere moments she was nearing your size, her body pressing down heavily on yours. Her eyes slowly opened and she began to draw away from your thick nipple...</span></div></div>",

She frowns at the effort it takes and looks down at herself noticing her growth. She is roughly the size you are, you'd guess, though her breasts were maybe half the size of yours. By the way you could feel it spreading across your thighs where she sat, it was easy to guess that her ass was massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my - what happened?\" she gasped. \"I-I'm fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, you are. Like me,\" you can't help but grin. You blush. \"You look amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh, you r-really think so?\" she questions. To answer her, you grab her large breasts and pull her back down. She yelps at their new sensitivity. You simply laugh and kiss her passionately. After a moment, you two break away and she climbs off of you. You heft yourself to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, lets go weigh your fat ass,\" you smile and slap her massive rear. She jumps, surprised, but giggles and leads the weigh to the bathroom. You can't help but stare at the hypnotic wobbling of her colossal caboose. When you make it to the bathroom, you both simply stare at your reflections. She was nearly your size, still a bit smaller though. She was still rather busty, but most of her new fat sat on her round belly, like yours, and her wide hips, thick thighs, and bulging ass, giving her a glorious pear shape. You, on the other hand, were still quite a bit bigger with most of your gain having focused on your breasts and belly. Your massive bust wobbles with each breathe, dwarfing the rest of your features and hers. You notice that a strange, milky substance is leaking from your teats.<i> Am I lactating?</i> but before you can investigate, your lover interupts you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she giggles. \"Can you read the scale for me? I can't see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you smile. You walk over to her and bend over to peer under her belly at the digits. Your massive breasts hang low and swing like heavy pendulums, threatening your balance. To steady yourself, you reach out and grab a handful of her ass meat. \"Any guess?\" you tease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell!\" she laughs, bouncing excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"322 pounds,\" you tell her. Her jaw drops and she stands there blankly for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3-322 pounds?\" she repeats. You nod. \"Oh my god...I'm so huge...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs her breasts and jiggles them for a moment. Then, she slowly moves down the curvature of her belly and to her wide hips before feeling behind her. YOu just smile, remembering how you hand done the same earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? How does it feel?\" You ask her. She hesitates and then smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful. This feels just so perfect,\" she says and kisses you briefly before pulling away and looking you over quizically. \"How much are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, honestly. I was 250 but that was before you got here and two gains ago,\" you pinch one of your side rolls with one hand and look at her seductively. \"Is it my turn to get on the scale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just nods excitedly, stepping off. Yo wait for it to re-zero and then step up on the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" you ask her. She excitedly bends at eh waste, not having the balance issues you did with her much smaller breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow,\" she giggles and looks up at you. \"372 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there a little shocked. 372 pounds. In a single afternoon, little over an hour, you had not only gone from male to female but gained 220 pounds. The love of your life had rejected you, made a move on you, sucked on your fat tit, and gained nearly 150 pounds herself. This was turning out to be pretty weird day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything however, you heard a phone ring and panic rose in your chest. Your love saw the look on your face and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. That's just my phone. I'll be right back,\" she said waddling out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the phone stop ringing and her talking to whoever it was and turned back to your reflection. You hated to admit it, but you were getting used to this. Plus, it was totally worth it if you got to be with that dynamite gal. You noticed that your breasts were still leaking. Every twenty second or so, a fat drop of milky liquid dripped from your round nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do? </span></div></div>",

You can hear her skinny jeans creak and groan as her hourglass curves amplify and her figure goes from slim to chubby to fat.</span></div></div>",

She squeals in pain as the button fly on her skinny jeans tightens to the point where the buttons begin to pop off. The first to go flying far to the left and right, but the third shoots straight for you and bounces off of your left tit, leaving it quivering as it bounces off. She closes her eyes shut in embarassment as her pants begin to slide down her thickening legs, leaving only a very tight-looking pair of pink panties to hide her vagina. Her upper arms, growing fuller and pinker as she continues to grow hotter, sweatier, plumper, begin to strain the fabric of her short shirt sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sight makes a warm feeling emanate from your groin and you move both hands under your gargantuan belly toward your own vagina. Sher throws her head back, eyes closed, her hair flying gracefully to fall down her back. She gulps in air, and her body surges outward as if the air she is gulping in is added as fat to her body. Her fat belly rises like baking dough, fatter and fatter still. Her jeans now in a heap around her ankles, you can see plainly her bare legs thicken until they touch at her inner thighs with continuing layers of blubber. Her originally shapely ass has ballooned outward, each cheek almost twice its original volume. She moans again, groping her breasts as they expand evermore with fatty, jiggly tissue. Her panties split and snap off and for an instant, you can see her vagina and her pubic hair before her throbbing belly fattens over her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves her hands off of her tits and reaches down to caress her widening fanny. Her breasts, as if they know her hands have left, seem to expand outward faster and fatter. Her once loose, tunic-top is now tightly stretched around her enormous breasts. You find, embarrassed, that you are reassuring yourself with the fact that they are still not close to the size of your own bovine teats. You can see a crease forming under her chin as her neck thickens and her jawline fades away. Her shirt begins to tear near her full, round shoulders. She gasps with surprising satisfaction as only her bra is left on her blubbery body. Her eyes open slowly and gaze out from her fattening face dreamily as the hooks of her bra rip from their fabric. She holds the bra to her breasts for a moment before removing it, tossing it carelessly down to the floor and revealing her breasts in all their fatty glory. Her gain slows and you judge that she is about as fat as you were after your first gain this afternoon, not as fat as you, but still pretty heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're really gonna have some fun,\" she says huskily, her voice cracking at the low pitch she chose. She strides elegantly over to you, she pulls you up gently until you are standing face to face, and she begins to kiss you, starting at your nipple, she moves up slowly along your neck until she reaches your mouth. She pulls you close by your thick arms and your feel your blubber collide ecstatically with hers. Your breasts press together and your bellies rub and jiggle. You reach down and squeeze her rear while she fondles your immense tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon...  </span></div></div>",

About then a nurse came in and seemed to be pleasantly surprised that I was awake, and went to get the doctor. My body felt different in a strange sort of way. As I started to get up the doctor came in and told me to lay back down. He started asking me different questions on how I felt and all that, then left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe explained that the car accident caused very bad damage to me so they had to use parts from a donor to fix him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the only donor that was compatible happened to be a girl about his age and they programed some stem cells to fix the damage that was caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander got out of bed to go to the restroom, but as he passed a mirror in the room, he noticed that the image reflected wasn't him. It was that gorgeous brunette that looked like him put female. He couldn't believe my eyes, and began to feel my body to see if what he was seeing was real. From head to toe, it was this girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went on into the bathroom trying to figure things out as he goes to pee. At first he stood there and lifted the gown, but I noticed that wasn't going to work. Awkwardly he put the seat down and sat down on it. He began to relieve himself which felt so different, especially when he was finished. He felt very wet down there and was compelled to dry himself. He then went back to his bed and laid back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hours he learned that his identity has been changed and his name is now Alexandra Taylor Christiansen and that he has been unconscious for three weeks and in the three weeks they had changed everything with the governments help everything from birth certificate, driving licence, passport down to qualifications to his bank account even the name on the apartment paper work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day later they cleared him to go home, with nothing more than some scrubbs a nurse gave me.

Talk about feeling like crap and along with bleeding to go with it.

Fortunately the job wasn't that difficult for him to learn, since it dealt with mostly a cash register and hanging up clothes. It was nice that the people he worked with are welcoming. For the most part he is doing a good job and went home without much social interaction with his co-workers. Then he got invited out for a meal by a few co workers, It was a really fun night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he has pretty much tackled everything that came his way since becoming a woman. From panties to PMS I was getting better at it everyday, but there was one thing that started to creep into my mind, and that one thing was sex. Now he hadn't even masturbated as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander or Alexandra as it is now started thinking about it but just laughed at himself as he isn't interested in it right now... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he's sure a co-worker is interested in him... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the co-worker? </span></div></div>",

He told her there was no way he could do that, but she tried to press the issue. Before long it seemed that she gave up, until he came over to purchase a new shirt at the register. Of course she made sure he was the one who rang him up, but not before playing matchmaker and clueing him in on that fact that Alex was staring at him earlier. After an awkward silence he spoke. He said his name was Jake and that he was free Friday night if I would be interested in a date. Alex didn't know how to react at first but of course my matchmaking friend Abigail went ahead and sealed the deal for Alex by giving him his name and number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said cool and that he'd pick me up at eight.
