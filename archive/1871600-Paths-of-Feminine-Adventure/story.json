They were walking past a teen girl's clothing store, and they had the nasty idea of sneaking into the changing room to see the girls changing.  They walked in and went to the dressing room, which was empty, which was odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jake, doesn't this room seem a bit off to you?\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, let's just get into a room and we can wait for the girls to show up.\" Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked into a room, that curiously already had clothes in it.  They inspected it and noticed that it was a full outfit.  It was a bra and panty set, a pink mini-skirt, tan pantyhose, a pink sleeveless peasant top, and pink open toe heels.  Suddenly they hear someone coming.  Jake hops on top of the seat so that it looks like there's only one person in there.  A girl knocks and the boys jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need any help in there miss?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan, in his best girl voice says \"No, I was just making sure I like the colors\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, take as much time as you need, I'll be right here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, we can't leave unless one of us distracts her by dressing like a girl\" Jake says. \"You have longer hair and a slenderer figure, you should do it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you owe me big time\" Evan says as he dresses himself in the outfit.  Feeling ridiculous, but at least looking like a girl he leaves the room to show the salesgirl, you notice that her nametag says Julie. \"How do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great, you know your friend can come out too\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you lurking, who do you think cleared the room and left clothes in there?\" she says as Jake walks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, uh um...\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, now you and your friend have two choices, you can either comply with what I tell you or I cal security and you get arrested\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's fair\" the both of them say dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, would your friend like to get dressed, or shall he get a different punishment?\"</span></div></div>",

I could dress you up like your friend here, or perhaps I could dress you up in something else. Im thinking, something with a lot of ruffles and laces. Ooh! Maybe even a diaper! You'd look great in one of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake gulped. \"Can't you just let us go? We promise to be good from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl rolled her eyes. \"Oh how daft do you think I am? You say you'll be good but you don't mean it. I'm gonna give you guys the whole treatment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake groaned. \"Oh damn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I think I'll decide this on a coin flip. Heads, like your friend, Tails, get dressed like a sweet little girl.\" She dug a coin out of her pocket and flipped it into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake hope with all his might that the coin would be struck by lighting. Or better yet, the girl.</span></div></div>",

You read it carefully, then your made up eyes open wide as the cursor hovers over the \u2018OK\u2019 button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWarning! There is already a file named \u201cmale_victim_original_form.psd\u201d in this location. Saving will overwrite the original file. This action can NOT be undone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cursor hits \u201cOK\u201d, and you feel a wave of electricity wash through your body, tickling and prickling you this way and that. The cursor clicks the file menu again, scrolls down, and clicks \u201cClose\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, you are back in your room. You aren\u2019t alone, however, as the massive pink frilly gown has come along with you, along with the towering pink beehive hairdo. Now in control of your body, you grab the dress in disbelief, and feel the thick soft layers squishing in your hands. You reach up and let out a gasp as your hands bury themselves in a thick maze of soft pink hair. The smell and taste of makeup is wafting from your face, and you look down at the incredible mass of the dress surrounding you for several feet in every direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you get your bearings, you try to find a zipper to free yourself from the gown. Your hands fly around the huge pink cloud, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be an opening anywhere. You grab the top of the bodice and try to yank it down, but its attached to your skin and pulls on your chest just as hard. The giant hairdo is no different, you might as well be trying to pull your own hair out by the roots, none of it comes loose or loses its style, no matter how hard you yank at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first bit of sunlight starts coming in through the window, and you realize the computer had you trapped all night. You hear the front door open - it\u2019s your roommates, they\u2019ve gotten off night shift and are home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey dude, are you awake?\u201d You heard one of them yell up at you. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be late for work again if you don\u2019t get up!\u201d The sound of their footsteps coming up the stairs has you in full panic mode.

Unfortunately, your door's lock has been useless for years. One quick throw of the shoulder, and you'll be on display. Instinctively, you retreat, eyes widening as you think about how they're going to react to you dressed like this. As you move away from the door, you try your hardest to ignore the strange, ticklish sensation of this pink nightmare's petticoats on your otherwise naked body, although as you once again come to a stand still and the skirts rustle against your backside, you find it extremely difficult. The sickly-sweet smell of your makeup is getting overpowering, but when you try to wipe it off with the back of your hand, you get nothing, not even a smear of lipstick. Your eyes widen even further as you try again and again, with no better results. You're snapped out of yet another attempt, now almost clawing at your face in desperation, when the noises outside your door gets loud enough to remind you that you only have seconds left before your roommates open the door and see you dressed like a drag queen Disney princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe the combined smell of the caked-on makeup and the sensation of underskirt on bare legs is starting to make your palms slick with fear, and the nearing sound of pounding footsteps isn't helping. Gripping the soft satin covering at the front of the dress's overskirt with both hands, you lift it so that you can better move (trying your hardest not to think about what you're doing looks like). It hits you immediately, turning your stomach to ice: you don't know where to move to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands starting to shake, you whip around, your new hair moving with the motion in a way that makes your skin crawl as you search for any way out of your current situation. Trying to ignore the fruity taste of your newly-feminine lower lip as you chew on it in panic, you stare wide-eyed at the open window. It's second story, yes, but is a fall any worse than being seen like this?</span></div></div>",

You see a flash of what looks like a thin pane of glass appearing in front of you, and the cursor quickly moves up to the top menu and clicks on \u201copen file\u201d. A huge list of images appears, with thumbnails revealing all manner of clothing. You barely have time to look at any of them as the cursor double clicks \u201csuper_cute_raver_girl.psd\u201d. A big white panel opens up beside you, and you can\u2019t see through the back of it. However, you do see the cursor select a large portion of the panel and click \u201ccopy\u201d, then move over top of you. You struggle against the invisible force holding you in place, but you can\u2019t move an inch, and you watch helplessly as the cursor clicks \u201cpaste\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are hit with a tingling surge of electricity, and suddenly feel yourself crammed into something incredibly uncomfortable. Your eyes widen at the sight of what has appeared on your body - a ridiculous raver outfit, complete with a poofy crinoline, big fluffy pink boots with baby blue stripes running around them, as well as a huge fluffy pink hood with a thick white trim and perky animal ears popping up on top. A thick glittering blue wig flows out from under the hood, which flows down your shoulders and around a tight corset top. Your legs are wrapped in a pair of striped tights, which disappear into the thick volume of your fuzzy boots. Again you try to move out of the panel, but you have no control over your body and are frozen in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in shock as the cursor quickly opens another file, and does the same select/copy routine, and moves over top of your face. When the cursor hits \u201cpaste\u201d, you see a ghostly eyeless colorful face appear in front of you, complete with sparkling blue eyeshadow, huge thick lashes and glittering pink lips. It looks like the face of an overdone drag queen, and you see the cursor click \u201ctransform\u201d in the menu bar, and begin squishing and stretch the face in front of yours. The face moves closer and closer to you, resizing this way and that until you\u2019re looking perfectly though the eye holes, the face sized exactly to your own. The cursor moves over to the layer menu and selects \u201cMerge Down\u201d, and you let out a scream as the face slaps against yours and sticks in place. You blink your new thick eyelashes in a panic, and the smell of the thick raver makeup is now all around you. Your lips taste like big pieces of candy, and you can feel the thick foundation caked on your skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought this couldn\u2019t get any worse, the cursor moves over the the layer panel once again, and clicks \u201cMerge Down\u201d on the outfit\u2019s layer. You feel another shock, this one much more intense, and the outfit seems to feel even tighter on you than it was before. There is now only one layer left, and it\u2019s you looking like a drag queen raver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cursor seems satisfied with how you look, and moves up to the file menu, where it clicks \u201cSave As\u201d. A menu pops up and it selects \u201cmale_victim_original.psd\u201d. A dialog box pops up that says \u201cWarning! Overwriting this existing file cannot be undone. Are you sure you wish to proceed.\u201d You yell out a loud NO as the cursor clicks on OK, and the outfit suddenly feels even more cozy than it did before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cursor clicks \u201cclose\u201d, and suddenly your room comes back into view and you have control over your body once again. You stumble and trip in your big boots, and fall to the floor. The sparkling blue wig falls around your face, and the fur of your outfit fluffs and ripples as you hit the floor. You put your hands down and find them lost in a cloud of crinoline, and you get to your feet as quickly as you can in your fluffy boots. Looking down, you can see the outfit has clearly come with you, and it\u2019s definitely not the most comfortable ensemble in the world. The corset is squeezing you tight, the big fur hood is already feeling too hot, and the room is quickly filling with a sickeningly sweet smell of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking in horror and confusion, you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The door, usually locked shut, is slightly ajar, allowing Alex a chance to peek inside. He sees Ted on a phone call, looking a bit distressed, talking to what he soon discovers is one of his employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda, this is awfully short notice. You can't give me two weeks?...\", he pleads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short pause of explanation from the other side of the phone, Ted sighs heavily, saying only, \"Don't worry about it. I'll figure something out.\", and hanging up the phone. Alex is ready to back off, sensing Ted's frustration, just after Ted notices him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?... oh, hello Alex.\" Ted exclaims, still not so agitated to properly greet a regular customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter, Ted?\" Alex quizzes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed only sighs again, rubbing his temple, \"I just had one of my summer help quit to travel Europe for the summer.\" he says. \"Replacing her will be tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's eyes light up, and he jumps at the opportunity, \"Actually Ted, I was looking for more work myself... maybe I could take the job?\", he says with a smile. What great timing, he thinks to himself... this could be his lucky day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed has to stop himself from rolling his eyes at the young comic fan... seems like all of his customers would like to work there, he thinks to himself. Even still, a possible solution to his problem has fell into his lap; it'd be silly not to at least consider it. \"Okay Alex. Sit down with me for a minute, let's have an interview.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's excitement is palpable; he can barely contain how excited he is that he's being given a chance. As he sits for the interview, Ted starts with his first and most important question...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any retail experience?\", he asks matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to a bad start, Alex ponders... \"N-no. I work with customers now and again, but I mostly do backstock and inventory control at where I'm working right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\", Ted murmurs. The interview continues... but Alex fears that it was over right then and there. Ted gets so many people asking to work for him at a comic store, it's likely that he can afford to be picky, even in tough spots like this. Ted inquires about his comic and gaming knowledge, to which Alex feels is his strongpoint. However, he grows nervous over the course of the interview, and stumbles to express points about his hobbies that he can normally talk about for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen finished, Ted thanks him for his time and says that he'll get back to him if anything opens up, but Alex can already feel like he blew his chance. Even still, as he's feeling a bit desperate, he decides to outright ask...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... did I get the job?\", he asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, \"I'm not sure you are the best fit for what I'm looking for, to be honest Alex. Working a sales-focused retail job is a bit different than what I think you are used to, and to be honest, Linda was my best salesperson; I can't replace her with just anyone. I need someone with experience, and someone who can talk naturally even to strangers. Not to mention, it didn't hurt that Linda was attractive; she had energy and a lot of customers came just to see her. A lot of my regulars will be expecting me to replace her with someone similar. I know it's not completely fair, but it's the truth that in this line of work, women have an advantage in sales.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex nods along, hoping to keep cool in case Ted changed his mind, and then leaves him to look over other applications in the backroom. With nothing but time on his hands now, he simply wants to sit around and mope.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dejected and depressed, Alex takes a seat at a table and simply slouches into his chair. After a moment of wandering thought he glances at the tabletop to see a deck of black cards. \"Enchanter\", they read on the deck box; this is the same game the man from before was playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looks around to see if the heavy set fellow is still here, but he can't seem to locate him. Curious about the game, he takes the deck into his hand and looks it over... the man DID invite him to try it, after all. Opening up the deck reveals a myriad of different cards with descriptions and finely drawn images on each one. Most of the cards have some sort of fantasy character on them and some text describing what the card does. After further investigation, he finds that each character card has a task that they are suited for, and the players use their three-card hand to find the best solution to the task they are given, either by the game or by a game master. The characters do not typically use combat prowess to solve problems like other games, but are expected to role play and talk their way through most problems. He figures that is where the \"Enchanter\" name comes from. Whoever manages to complete the most tasks successfully wins the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the design intriguing but possibly too free-form, he decides to give it a try and draws three cards for him to use in a mock game. Without a game master to officiate, he draws a scenario card; this card shows the players what it is that they need to do with their character cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping the card over, it reads \"Experience: Grow your character's talents to new heights\". This inadvertently upsets Alex... having just been denied a job for lack of experience, he is hardly in the mood to hear about the virtues of it. Regardless, he takes a look at his hand and reads over his cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst is the Barmaid card, with an image of a busty brunette holding several glasses of ale. The Barmaid is skilled at cooling tempers in tense situations, and auto-succeeds any Flirtation checks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly is the Songstress card, with an image of a lithe Elven girl with long blonde hair. Playing her magic harp invigorates her allies, making her an unlikely but invaluable ally on any adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly is the Harlot card, with the image of a curvaceous redhead woman. The Harlot is a master of seduction, and uses her guile and charm to gather information, get close to a target, or just have a good time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...hurm.\", Alex mumbles to himself. It is like this game is mocking him, expecting him to gather experience for a bunch of female characters, when he was just turned down a chance to get experience himself partially because he was the wrong gender. As if in defiance, Alex decides to try out a test run, as if to say to whoever watching that he can gain experience as well as anyone. Reaching into his hand, Alex decides to play...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laying the Barmaid card on the table, Alex begins to think up a scenario in which a barmaid would get better at her trade. Realizing that without other players to run his idea by, the game falls flat, and he feels silly for even trying to play it alone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...it is then that he notices that the text on the card is different from before. Perplexed, he looks more closely at the card's wording.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTask: Stay in character and perfect the Barmaid's craft.<br>\r\nSuccess: +1 Luck<br>\r\nFailure: 1 year in Prism<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what the hell?\", he exclaims, certain that the card did not say that before. What exactly is this game, he thinks to himself. But before even he can even wager a guess, the area around him dims, until his surroundings are pitch black. Falling down to his behind, Alex finds that his chair has disappeared, including the table, the cards, the entire comic book store, all consumed by darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...?\", he says with fear. \"HELLLOOOOO!?\". The echoes of his screams soon die, but he is not in darkness for long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area illuminates again quickly, but his eyes have little trouble adjusting. Alex finds himself inside a humble bedroom with stone walls, with dim candles to illuminate the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to panic, Alex starts to look around frantically to find a way out, or better yet a way back home. Finding a door to his left, he starts to move toward it, but is distracted by the loud \"CLOMP\" of his shoe on the stone floor. Looking down in curiosity as to why his sneakers sound like that, he finds that he cannot see to his feet because of the two large mounds on his chest, snuggled tight in a leather corset around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...WHAT THE?!\", he proclaims, grasping at the globes in a panic. He is relieved to find that they are not real, and after a quick check over himself he finds that, despite his apparently female attire, he is still 100% his normal male self. Upon further inspection, he finds that he is wearing a short sleeved-blouse with large puffs on each shoulder, with the aforementioned corset holding it and his faux-busom in place, as well as a skirt and petticoat that extends to just above his knees. The loud sound on his feet would be the short-but-heavy heel on his new, feminine shoes, with white stockings running up each leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to panic, Alex comes across a mirror in the room, and rushes towards it (at least as much as he can rush in his new heels). The reflection he sees startles him; on top of his head is a deep brown wig with strands of hair framing his face, the rest of it tied into two buns on top of his head. His boyish face is made up with various make-up; mascara, rouge, light brown lipstick, and dark eyeshadow... he recognizes his face as his own, but to a stranger his face appears to be that of a sultry young woman. From the neck down he is dressed in what can only be called the attire of a bar wench, his brown leather corset tightly covering his white blouse and just barely holding in his very large, very stuffed bra. A white apron covers most of the blue skirt adorned on his waist, matching nicely with his white stockings. If he didn't know the \"woman\" in this reflection was him, he might find her very attractive... a terrifying thought to Alex right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving to take all this in is quite a shock to Alex, who is now taking stock of his options...</span></div></div>",

For a time he'd even entertained the thought that she liked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed walks past Alex's corner, not noticing him, engrossed in a phone conversation as he drags his fingers through his hair. A moment later he returns, pacing towards the counter. \"...are you sure you can't make it... you'd be doing me a huge favour... not even for triple time?...yeah, no, I get it. Bye,\" he finishes rather bluntly, hanging up with a jab of his thumb. He rings another number and continues to walk up and down the length of the small shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Cassie, hi! Listen you- ... you're in Madrid... not back until tuesday... nevermind. Have a good holiday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues to burn through his phonebook in this way until his endless footfalls push Alex's patience over the edge. He clears his throat loudly and Ted looks up. \"Sorry, Alex. Didn't see you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staffing trouble?\" Alex asks half-sympathetically, wishing Ted would just leave him to the peace and quiet and the solace of his comic book world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody is busy,\" Ted groans. \"We're supposed to be having a big comic book release this afternoon and I just assumed Linda would be around to fit into the costume.

You think Linda filled out those costumes all by herself? The costumes are foam padded <i>and</i> she wears a push-up bra underneath. Don't tell anyone, but she's barely even a B-cup.

Turn around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe obliges. \"What are you going to- hey!\" Alex shrieks as Ted grabs his boxer shorts and pulls them down around his ankles. Even worse, the store owner's hand slips between his legs, cupping his manhood and pulling it back between his buttocks. Alex tries to pull away but in the confines of the store room there is nowhere to go. \"Get the hell off me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to feel a little weird,\" Ted says casually, ripping off a strip of tape with his teeth and taping the penis against the underside of his buttocks with one...two...three strips of tape. He stands back up and Alex whirls on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. The. Fuck!\" Alex stares in open mouthed shock from Ted down to his crotch, flat now that his penis has been tucked away between his legs. He grips the edge of the tape and pulls, trying to free his trapped, uncomfortable penis, but tears of pain fill his eyes as the adhesive threatens to rip out his pubic hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could hardly have catwoman sporting a boner in the middle of the shop floor,\" Ted states firmly. \"There's no place to hide a bulge in a catsuit that tight, so this will have to suffice.

That means you won't be chickening out on me. Now put this on,\" he says, thrusting the rubber suit into Alex's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn closer inspection, the suit is heavily padded - the buttocks, hips, and breasts already filled out to womanly proportions. He grudgingly unzips the back, sliding his bare feet into the legs. It is a tight fit and he wriggles and teases the material for several minutes until it is up to his waist. The elastic material stretches taut, moulding itself against his flat crotch. It is an effective illusion, he has to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad,\" Ted says, visibly relieved. \"This might work after all. Give me a twirl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alex turns, he hears Ted give a low whistle of approval. Twisting his head, he sees his rear sticking out behind him, enhanced by the foam padding that hugs and lifted his butt cheeks. Even though he knows its him, he feels his trapped penis straining to become erect within its adhesive prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, let me zip you up.\" Ted begins to tug the zipper closed, sealing the suit around his torso. It's like trying to close an over-packed suitcase, but Ted assures him that the additional corset will hold in and conceal his masculine tummy. Alex begins to worm his arms into the sleaves. The cold, unyielding suit seems to fight against him at first, but as his fingers slide into their final positions the material clings to him in a way not at all unpleasant. It is almost like it is hugging every inch of him at once.</span></div></div>",

You sigh and start to put it down, but for some reason, you don't.  Instead, another idea pops into your mind.  Smiling deviously, you take the package to the counter and pay for it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, at home alone, you open the package and look at its' contents.  Blue boots, red cape, and of course, the white bodysuit with the infamous \"boob window\".  What you hadn't counted on were the fake silicone breast pads that fit into the costume.  It makes sense though, not that many real women have the exaggerated figure that Power Girl has in the comics.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the costume on the bed, laid out, while you take a shower.  For some reason, you decide to shave your legs and color your already short hair blonde.  This takes time, but it looks pretty good when you're done.

You didn't want to, but after what he just did you felt you couldn't just leave him high and dry....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go out with him,\" one of his friends said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he had your back, not easy to get a man like that.\" another friend piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said, \"Just one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy burst into a wide smile. \"Thank you, you won't regret it, I'm Terry by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Veronica,\" you blurt out, not sure where you go the name from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Vera, where would you like to go?\"</span></div></div>",

I'll give you a hundred and fifty for all of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're stunned, this wasn't just ignoring criminal behaviour, this was actively taking part in it. Is she a cop? Or would that make this entrapment? What did that term even mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can try using them yourself of course, but better that the person leaving the paper trail is someone you don't know. Cash in hand right now is a pretty good deal, unless you're suddenly having a pang of conscious and want to give it all back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a snap decision and accept her offer. \"Great\" she removes a couple of plastic embossed cards from the wallet. From her own wallet she takes out several notes, stuffs them in \"your\" wallet, and hands it back to you. You check the money and its the right amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've still got your ID, I'll give it back when it's ready.\" She leaves the booth and you follow. She grabs the photos from the output tray. Gradually you walk to where you were originally waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And by the way, Terry doesn't know of any of this, same in your case I imagine. Let's keep it quiet for both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and at that moment Terry arrives with a big tub of popcorn.

The only minor glitch is when a phone in your purse starts ringing, but you quickly move forward to turn it off. Terry meanwhile didn't make many actions. As much as he probably enjoyed the movie, it wasn't exactly the right sort to put the moves on a first date on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a great climax, the movie ended. Getting to your feet, you stumble on the high heels, forgetting that they were there, but Terry catches you, and practically carries you by the arm out of the theatre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great movie,\" he says, \"wonder what happened to that guy at the end though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sequel bait,\" you reply, remembering to keep your voice feminine, \"I'm sure he'll show up again in the next movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings are winding down. and you try to think your next move.

He's ignored all the truancy letters sent to your house, barely talks to you when you're in the same room, and will sometimes eat out when there's nothing left in the fridge, leaving you to literally scavenge for yourself. It never seems malicious, just that he's living is own life and just happens to have his brother's son hanging around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, your uncle is bound to have some reaction if he sees you like this; then again would it be that hard to sneak past him if he so rarely is on the lookout for you anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Terry's words focus on the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, um, I was just thinking about heading home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, need a lift?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I am going to meet my parents.\" You try to say in a high pitch voice and it actually works. From what you could feel this women may have thought you were some 5 year old girl who was happy that school was finally over. Probably thought that you had just gotten out of kindergarten. And you did really look like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress was very tight and didn't help to show any of your age. It pinks polka dots were sprinkled with sparkles it seemed like and the how on the back tied it toghter. The Mary Janes also were a bit cramped and seemed to be rather high topped but you could manage for now. Thy white high knee socks actually extended almost the top and almost bristled the panties. But they were scratchy and felt like they were more designed to latch on to something. The Mary Janes felt a little less clumsy with them on but nothing compared to the panties. Well they were actually more of a girls princess dream. For being white they sure seemed to have a lot of pink princess stuff on them. Your manhood had never been the biggest thing ever and it was actually embrassing being finished with puberty. The panties if seen would be viewed as a it was a developing princess loving 5 year old girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok dearie just be safe. Also I like that little dress of yours. Your little cute 5 year old body really shows it off. Just make sure to get your parents permission. Oh wait here can I help you. The dress needs a little change.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says and she reaches to the back of what you thought was a fake bow. But no it seems to be a real silk bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok honey just turn around and ok that's perfect. This will make that little dress much more cute on you little body. My soon to be 21 year old daughter who I had when I was around 29 loved cute little dresses like this one. Why I remember that she would wear the same things and I eventually leaned a few tricks with them.\" She says as she unwraps the bow and starts to tie it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here honey just bend over a hit for me okay here we go! Now bend back toward me please.\" The women takes the bow and pulls on it as hard as she can. Well bending it seems the dress started to give you a much more girly features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ophhh\" you say in a little pain. The women notices it but only seems to tie a bit harder and then starts to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey remember pain is beauty and this is the best part! Don't you want all those cute young boys to notice you and kiss those plump lips? Ok honey here comes another need for bending. Just please bend down and let me pull a bit harder\" she quickly says giddy it seems remembering all of the past fun she had with her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tip down and the women pulls down super hard. The dress tightens even more and you feel it blow in the wind showing off your panties right to the women. She notices this and starts to, it seems, think of old times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to call you Princes cutie or huneybunches ok? That underwear you have on remind of a pair my little girl used to have. She loved princesses and would ask every time I was with her to do this little tie. Ohh I remember those days! The tie I used to do would take some time from 30 minutes to an hour but she loved it. And now she is a CEO of a multimillion dollar company and only at 21! Huneybunches can I please do the full tie for you? Please just for an old lady? Well since you didn't respond that means yes! Your parents really don't mind. But ok let's focus on the tieing part. This bow is long enough since it is double looped\" she says pulling the how back to show you. \"So that means to get the perfect tie it probably will take around an hour.\" She says full of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually hmm this one seems to be specially made. It's actually 4 times lopped in a tie so I actually will need you for some time. But your parents don't need you now. Oh well I remember this one time where it was my one child's prom and I spent such a long time on that tie! That thing was around 3 times lopped and looked kinda like this and it took me over 2 hours! That is such a short time isn't huneybunches. You see the secret really is in pulling on the tie very hard and a lot of bending and having to fit right into the tie. What really takes up the time is getting the knot really tight. From what I remember was that I was reading something in a magazine and they gave you all these steps for these types of bows.\" She says moving you getting you ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok from what I remember, which is all of it, there are around 300 steps. Yeah I know only 300 hundred and the time range of completion was around 2-5 hours. Of course 5 hours is only if you mess around. Ok so step number three, your going to have jump up well I pull on the bow. Now remember if it starts to really be painful think of a cute little boys lips that will be smooching you after they see your adorable little self.\" The women says and you start to reflect on what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2-5 hours! That was long and even longer with all the to true your getting her. But you didn't want to make the women angry and she basically had you under her control right now. Then you remember the purse you had! Someone had moved into the stall while you with the women and must have taken it. Now you also had lost your wallet, phone, credit cards, money and ID. Long story short, you really had no place to run. Then the women starts to urge you to move. You had to remain silent this whole process or you could go to jail. And with the wind knocked out of you there really wasn't any noise for you to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok cutie let's move to a changing stall to make this a bit more private. Just let me get the key to my office and we can get one. I do own this place so no worries and think of all of the boys wanting to peck those lips while we do this. My daughter used to always want buys attention and eventually she did get one. Ok so here we are this is my office and where we will be getting you ready for a big boy to come along and kiss those plumps lips.\" The women says slowly pushing you into the office, which is huge, and also she pulls hard on the knot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok honey so now I can really start to help you out. So the next step involves you pulling up your dress so I can tighten the knot a lot more. Actually I will need to do it and all you need to is hold it up\" she says pulling up your dress and forcing you to hold it. The panties which you feared are on display for everyone to see but only the women notices them and with embrassing results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well honey my daughter used to have a pair just like those! She always did love princesses and all of that stuff. Ohh I also like the knee high socks you have! Ohh and the Mary Janes! You are like my daughter! She loved all of this stuff. It it was pink and cite then she would wear it. Ohh that reminds me. I used to have this special pair of knee length socks that my girl would wear. They actually would reach up to your panties and my daughter did say the pure cotton was very itchy but remember that eventually your get a good loving husband! Well your a bit young for that but let's try and get your first kiss soon! I'll be back very soon! Stay right there and hold the dress up.\" The women says going into what looks like a storage closet but you actually see is a walk in dresser. Never did you think that you would end up like this holding up a dress for a women obsessed with the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh honey I found some Mary Janes to go with these high socks. Ohh and I found my daughter old panties! They have a special little place for the socks which seem to reach your panties.\" The women says walking out with the objects. The panties princess infested and pink covered, the high socks seemed to be hand made from an itchy looking cotton. The Mary Janes are much higher in heel size and the women starts to speak up.\" Ok honey just get these panties on and as you do I will get ready for the dress.\" The women says backing away. You slide the panties on which are also handmade from cotton and then the high socks. Both make you itch all over and once you get them on the women comes back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok princess cutie stop scratching that and let's get ready. I have the magazine right here and there is actually 350 steps and the time estimate is between 4 to 9 hours. Now that much longer but think of the boys.\" You two start and the women takes....</span></div></div>",

As she walks away, you start m   f lrseat you out youthationsitueththinking of a plan on how to get away from her, but before you made your plan to get away, you decide to look in the mirror to see what you now look like.

Upon seein yourself, you decide to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really me.\" Upon now hearing yourself speak, you are surprised to hear that your voice sounds a little more higher and younger. Caught by the surprise in your own voice, you pay no attention at all when the woman comes back and starts brush out your hair, making it more feminine. As you know that you now have no place to go, you decide to tell the woman something that she needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me miss,\" you said as you speak up to get her attention,\" but I lied to you when I said that my parents were coming for me. I do not know where my parents are.\" As soon as you said this, the woman suddenly turns you around and starts to give you a hug, one in which you surprisingly return back. As she continues to hug you, she speaks up in your ears getting your attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, I did not know that you are a lost child. I have to call an Amber Alert immediately.\" As she was about to make the call, you stop her by speaking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do not do that. Instead, I was wondering if maybe you can take me with you,\" you said with chance  of hoping to escape from both her and the situation that you accidentally put yourself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, I would love to take care of you, but I am almost an old woman. I can't possibly take care of another child, but my daughter has been hoping for a child and it seems as if you are granting her wish. I can't wait to tell her the good news. I am going to call her and tell her of the good news, but before I do tell her, I want to sprinkle you with some of my supposedly magic pixie dust that I always put on little girls like you.\" As she does that, you feel yourself starting to change more than usual. You feel yourself getting shorter, your hair much longer, and you feel that your skin is more smoother than usual. Knowing that you are now trapped, you embrace with what was about to happen to you.</span></div></div>",

Understand?\" She said looking at the blond girl two to your left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blondie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond girl replied \"Yes Ma'am<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe moved to the short girl between you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ma'am\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand then lastly to you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire?\" she said with a grin. the girls giggled beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ma'am\" You replied, knowing she was just messing with you, trying to get you to quit, it would take more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate continued \"Now each of you will have a 'Big Sister' known just as a 'Big' who help you get used to life here, and since we have a special pledge this semester I'll personally be Claire's big.

It wouldn't reflect well on us or on you if you quit before the semester's over, after all the work you did, you convinced the Dean to agree to it, what would he think of you or us if you quit.\" Kate replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't thought of that, the Dean had given permission for you to do this, not that he had much choice, he wouldn't be pleased if you quit, not that you had any intention to \"okay that makes sense, but why would I want to quit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? have you not realized yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"realized what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those rules we went over... they don't just apply to the girls, they apply to all pledges, your not exempt just because your a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? you've got to be kidding me, I'm not gonna do any of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you will, its in the contract you signed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to realize why she didn't seem to be so against this, she was going to enjoy it. \"No way, I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll what?\" she whispered now that the other girls were finishing up \"Quit? No you signed a contract, you won't be getting the deposit back, it went towards your dues, and if you do still decide to quit, I'll throw you out of here, Citing sexual assault, you'll be expelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!

You step out of the shower and get a scare, Kate is waiting for you in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on you wrap the towel around your chest\" she says, sliding it up to cover your non-existant breasts and sets it to hold itself there. \"Now let me make sure there's no hair left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate proceeds to go over your legs and chest with a razor shaving what didn't get washed off earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There all done\" Kate says, \"And we still have an hour and a half left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only sigh \"So what's next?\" You manage to say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you can still speak, good to know, and I'll show you\" She takes your hand again, leading you back to your bedroom, there she shows you a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open it, you should've known, breast forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With these you'll have <b><i>real</i></b> breasts for an entire month at a time, at that point, we'll have to re secure them, now put on your new panties so you can take the towel off.\" She says holding out a pair of pink boyshort panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begrudgingly take them and slide them on under the towel and slowly take the towel off, red with embarrassment. Kate's been rubbing a glue onto the breasts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate smirks, noticing only a small bulge in your panties \"Doesn't look like you're that big, which is good.\" She presses the two forms to your chest and tells you to hold them for 1 minute<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're waiting, she's picking makeup's and nail polishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after the longest minute of your life Kate tells you you can let them go, You're suddenly aware of just how much they weigh when they're pulling straight down on your chest, its very uncomfortable<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I understand why girl's wear bras\" You say somewhat lightheartedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, yeah, you'll learn a whole lot more about girls this semester.\" Kate replies let me pick you out a bra, trust me other than them kind of digging into your shoulders they're much more comfortable then going bra-less.\" She hands you a matching pink bra, with a bit of lace around the cups and shows you how to put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she hands you a white and pink T-shirt with the Greek letters for Delta Delta Delta on it, it had a V-neck, so even after you put it on, you could see your cleavage. \"this will take some getting used to\" You mutter to yourself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate then has you put on a matching pink and white skirt, with a small Delta Delta Delta on the hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow sit over here and let me do your makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou comply and spend the next 45 minutes with Kate showing you how and having you attempt to do your makeup, while she does your nails, false 1/4 inch nails, pink with white french tips. while your toes are just pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally with only 10 minutes til 7, Kate hands you a pair of white two inch heels, and has you do a few practice steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a moment too soon\" Kate says, as the clock says 7, Kate turns you to a mirror, You have to honestly admit, you pass as a girl, you can still recognize yourself, its not some magical transformation, but its not bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're blushing bright red again, not ready to have to face all the other girls like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon don't be a wuss, you're dressed identically to the 9 other pledges out there, and honestly you might be prettier than a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... doesn't help you know\" You reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, just thought you should know\" she giggled. \"C'mon she says taking your hand and leading you into the Dining room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marley University was an odd school, aside from the fact that it was far away from any town, and had a town surrounding the campus, which has everything a student would ever need. It was a private high school where all the students boarded, and usually reserved for the more well to do of the state it was in, but they also had scholarship programs and the school had a pretty good mix of students, aside from a surplus of males in the student body. That is where you come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked up to the gates of the school, with your bags in tow. You had gotten a full scholarship for the next three years at this school. You weren't that attached to the public high school, and since this school had the highest college acceptance rate, you jumped at the opportunity. Your parents couldn't make the trip up, but that's cause of how far it was civilization. You walked through the gates and up to the main building in the middle of campus. You went to the main office and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come.\" a voice from behind the door said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked in and saw a pretty fancy office. It was nothing like the one at the public school you went to the year before. You wondered if this was where the tuition money went when you were snapped out of your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" the woman at the desk asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, I'm a new student. John Harper.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, we were expecting you. You'll be in the Onassis Wing of the Dormitory. Room 436.\" she said, handing you a key. \"Your class schedule should already be in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" you said and walked out of the office and towards the dormitory. You struggled with your bags and dropped one on the floor. As you went to pick it up, a girl walked up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New arrival?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Natalie Chambers.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John Harper.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need help with these?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What wing are you in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Onassis. Room 436.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cool! That's the same wing as me, our rooms are close too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They dorm the boys and girls that close to each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're not really a stickler for stuff like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued talking about the school until you got to your room. You opened the door and saw a pretty basic room. Bed in one corner, desk in another, closet and set of drawers, The walls were a pale red, that was almost pink, and your schedule was laid out on your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie walked over and picked it up, scanning it, before handing it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! We're in the same English, Science and Gym classes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. I was hoping I'd have friends in some of my classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, why don't I give you the grand tour of Marleyville when you're done settling in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you then,\" she said, leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set up all of your stuff and lay down on your bed. This was going to be a good year, you could feel it.</span></div></div>",

According to the map, the Campus Union Building is close to the center of campus, so you head there first. The distance on the map was deceiving and after about a half hour of walking, you're only just over half-way there. A few minutes later it starts to pour out of nowhere. Since you're closer to the Union Building than to your dorm, you decide to finish your way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, you're drenched from head to toe. It's a big building, from the entrance you can see a food court, a viewing area with a large TV, a study room, and a row of pool tables, in addition to lots of places to sit, but there aren't many people there. You see a few people playing DnD at one of the tables, and a group of girls all wearing wildly different clothes. It looks like one of them noticed you, but you're not sure. There's soccer playing on the TV so you decide to watch until the weather's shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you new here?\" A girl asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm here for orientation,\" you answer and turn to face her.

Wearing a striped shirt and pink blazer, something about her smile, and how she sits, tells you that she's in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Mia.\" The next girl says shyly. Even seated you can tell she's a good bit shorter than the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final girl introduces herself, \"I'm Yuki.\" With her name, you'd expect an accent, but as far as you can tell, she's fully American.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a seat.\" Olivia offers, and you join them. \"What are you planning on majoring in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure, I think Physics.\" You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, Mia's a physics major,\" Olivia mentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I might be TAing one of your classes.\" Mia quietly states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you a Grad student?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm working on my Ph.D.\" She says with some more confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you researching?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both have a conversation about her research, she seems excited to have someone that's interested, even if you don't understand much about it. Your conversation is cut short when you get a phone call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou excuse yourself and take it. \"Hello Sean, this is Hannah from the front desk. I'm sorry but we're closing the desk for the night, and no one brought your luggage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, well, thanks for the call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, have a good night.\" She hangs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to the girls, visibly disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong,\" Olivia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, someone took my bags when I was checking in... and the desk just called, no one brought them by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we were about to go, but...\"</span></div></div>",

You follow the main group, and walk into a fairly large living room, with three matching couches, a coffee table, and a very large TV. There are a school flag and a couple of nice paintings on the walls. The girls all take seats on the couch, and you join them. You wind up next to Mia. You can tell she's significantly more comfortable than she was in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliva comes back in with two bottles of wine, and six glasses. \"You're over 21, right?\" She asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" You say with enough doubt, that she should be able to tell that you're really not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" she sets all 6 glasses on the table and pours them. One for each person, including you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get a bit of randomness we roll a die to determine who's turn it is. The last person to go picks the truth or the dare for the next person. I'll be 1, Sarah is 2, Yuki is 3, Anna is 4, Mia is 5, and you're 6.\" The order is just based on where everyone is sitting, so it's easy to remember who's what number. \"There are some other house rules, but we'll go over them as we go through the game... The first roll determines who picks for the first person to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls a 3, and hands the die to Yuki, who rolls a 4. \"Truth or Dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dare,\" Anna responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imitate a celebrity until we can guess who you're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, alright,\" Anna says in a clear McConaughey. But no one says anything. You stay quiet since they have to know what she was going for. \"Wasn't that good enough.\" She says, trying to maintain the voice, but failing. \"That's the only line I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stays quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... The fact is, the law says you can't touch... but I... uhh... I think I see a lot of rule breakers in this house tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close enough, McConaughey,\" Sarah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to let you get away with the most generic line ever,\" Yuki explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, glad we watched Magic Mike last night, or I would have been screwed.\" She rolls, \"Sarah, your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would be the worst person in the room to date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Olivia, you're too damn bossy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls, and the game continues, as you all work on the wine. You've all had a few glasses when Anna rolls your number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's your celebrity man-crush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lie, every guy's got one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... If I had to pick... Chris Hemsworth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good answer,\" Yuki pipes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll a little too hard, and the die falls off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now for a house rule. If the die falls off the table, you and one other person both have to do a joint dare.\" Olivia explains. \"Roll twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll a 5 then a 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit,\" Mia swears under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means, I pick the dare, and Mia has to do it with you.\" Sarah, who had drunken at least half a bottle herself, explains. \"And just as an FYI, these are generally among the bigger dares.\" She whispers something to Olivia then to Yuki and they both nod with big smiles on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sean, Mia, you're the same size. Switch all of your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just do it.\" Mia says, \"I'm not losing because of you. Follow me.\" She leads you down a hall to the bathroom. \"Get in the shower, draw the curtain, and <b>Do Not Look Out Here.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as she says, then begin stripping down to your boxers. As you remove a piece of clothing, you toss it past the curtain, and she does the same. Luckily for you, she was just wearing skinny jeans, a blouse, and a feminine sweater. The jeans are tight against your groin, but otherwise, it's not too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm changed, you?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out.\" She offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back, Anna tells you \"That looks good on you Sean, you should wear something like that more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do the whole dare?\" Sarah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What underwear do you have on?\" She asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine,\" you say confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you're learning the second house rule. If you don't go all the way through with dare, you have a last chance not to lose, a double or nothing.\" Olivia explains. \"The darer, in this case, Sarah, adds a new level to the dare, if you do it, you don't lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Completely switch clothes... here.\" Sarah orders with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if I wa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia grabs your arm, \"I don't lose.\" She says with an intensity you haven't seen in her yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" You quickly pull off Mia's clothes and stop for a second before taking off your boxers. It seems so strange that you're about to show your junk to 5 college girls. You aren't sure if it's the alcohol speaking, but you decide to follow through. Mia's bra comes off and you see her breasts. They aren't big, but they are very well shaped and you begin to get hard. You look away and try to take your mind off it when she tosses her panties at your feet. You pull them on, and the constriction keeps you from getting a full boner. Next, you take her bra and pull it on. The clasps give you hell for a minute, but you eventually get them. After that, the rest of the outfit is easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, my turn.\" Mia states. She rolls a 6.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not your night,\" Sarah chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dare.\" You say. Thinking Mia won't make it bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been too creative with these...\" Mia trails off. \"Actually, this will be good. Let Sarah do your makeup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou down the rest of your 4th glass, \"Go for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mia.\" Sarah laughs. \"Now wait there, Shawna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hurries off and comes back with a box. \"Close your eyes.\" After you've closed your eyes, you feel a sponge move across your whole face, then a brush on your cheeks and a smaller brush on your eyelids. You feel a strange feeling on your eyelashes, then she gives you your next instruction, \"Purse your lips.\" You feel what is clearly lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done,\" Sarah tells you. You grab the die, and as you begin to roll. Anna puts a mirror in front of your face and when you see your reflection, you drop the die. Once everyone's laughter subsides you roll for your partner and darer, getting a 5 for Mia again, then a 3 for Yuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makeout.\" Yuki dares without a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and put your lips on Mia's lightly kissing her. She places her hand on the base of your head and pulls you in, returning the kiss vigorously. You pull yourself in tight, and reach around her, pulling her close. Her tongue slides into your mouth, and you return the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you're good,\" Yuki tells you, but Mia doesn't stop, so you don't either. After just a little bit longer, she takes her hand off and pulls back, giving you a quick peck before returning to her original spot with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I think that was a good ending.\" Olivia says. \"I think we can agree Sean won.\" Everyone nods, Olivia tops off all the drinks but yours and they down them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's...</span></div></div>",

She was possibly the most well known person in all the land, and yet her beginnings are known to no one. The mysterious Montclair simply appeared one day with no fan fair at all. She mostly would keep to herself, except for once a year. On that day she would invite every noble house that you could think of to a gathering rich of food and music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so I heard. At the time, I went by the name Drake. I was a cutpurse of slight stature, my hair long and dark, my body lithe and flexible. I had been on the street for a long time and had hear stories of Montclair's parties. Aggravatingly, the rest of us were not invited so I had never been able to see what it was like, at that time. The rich and pampered would wine and dine while I was left to rot in filth. That was going to change, and I had a plan how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was able to sneak past the guards at the main gate using a bit of guile and bit more exploding powder that I had purchased from one of my contacts. It cost me everything I had, but when I succeeded in my endeavor, I told myself, it would not matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI circled to the western side of Montclair's Manor and began climbing a great deal of ivy that had grown up the side of the building some time ago. After a few minutes, I had scaled the wall and entered a nearby window. In hardly anytime at all I had made it straight to Montclair's bed room, which I was sure would hold many jewels that she must have collected in her greedy little life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart jumped for joy when I spotted the ruby sitting on her bed. The size of it alone would be enough for me to afford all of the little sins I had been dieing to indulge in. All I had to do was leave the same way I came in and no one would have any idea what had happened.</span></div></div>",

I didn't bother to talk, instead I lunged at her. I figured, if I could knock her out I could just scamper away back down the ivy but things didn't go that way. Before I got anywhere near her, I froze. I couldn't move. There was this light buzzing sound in my ear, like a bee was flying near by and I felt a sort of pressure all around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't a very nice thing you just tried.

I watched it hang in the air, just like me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening,\" I said to myself, in complete shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely, isn't it?\" Montclair gestured to the ruby. \"You must have gone threw a lot of effort to take this.\" A peculiar look appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I have so much already. It would be selfish of me to keep this when you obviously want it so dearly.\" She smiled, I didn't like it. \"In fact, you should come to my ball. Yes, that would be delightful. First however, you are not properly dressed for such an occasion. Don't worry though, I can help you with that.\"</span></div></div>",

The lingering black mist of what used to be my dark clothes changed, turning white. As if it was alive, some of the mist coiled around me like a serpent.  Montclair's arms waved in odd patterns and her face was strained. Whatever sorcery was going on, it was apparent that she was in complete control. The mist solidified into what appeared to be ladies' silk underthings, but they were on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA corset squeezed my middle, creating a womanly shape out of my form. My own flesh was pushed into the cups that were meant to hold a woman's breasts which created a startling illusion that I had breasts of my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the mist changed, this time from white to pink. I was fully engulfed and, like before, the mist turned solid. This time, however, it left me wearing a pink gown and heels along with a band placed on my unruly hair.

Montclair was breathing very hard as she looked at me. The beauty she was had was tarnished. Her face wrinkled her hair a bit out of place, with grey strands sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing,\" she smirked. She lifted her hand and the ruby began to shine as the ruby's chain wrapped around my neck. I tried to rip it away but instead, my hand just casually stroked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my stance shift and I tried to shout out,\"What did you do?\". What came out wasn't a shout but a soft girlish whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought that I'd place an enchantment on that ruby to make sure you behave yourself at my ball,\" said Montclair breathing more normally now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You crazy witch, I'm not going to your ball!\" was what I attempted to scream but I was shocked to hear myself say, \"oh I'm so excited, I can't wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMontclair chuckled, \"Now, now. You must contain your excitement young lady. If you don't, you might scare away the boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that would be terrible,\" I felt myself say weakly. This was a nightmare. As much as I tried, I could make myself speak the way I wanted. It was then that I felt my body start to slink out of the room, my hips swaying side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" I heard Montclair say behind me, \"I'm sure your will have a magical night.\"</span></div></div>",

The sound of the heels echoed in my ears with every step, unnerving me in a way I could never express.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI entered the ballroom through a pair of double doors and walked down a flight of stairs. The ballroom was enormous and filled with music. The room looked all the larger by the scarcity of guests. That must be what happens when you keep a tight invite list. I was standing on the dance floor for only moments before a young nobleman asked to dance. I did my best to shout something vulgar but all I heard myself do was giggle instead and I took his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch of the night was the same. I was on my feet dancing close with nobleman after nobleman, with no rest. It was frighting and embarrassing how many men wanted to dance with me. They would hold me and whisper things into my ear that made me want to gag. I desperately wanted to leave this place and try to forget this ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the 18th dance or so, all of the music stopped. The quite was only for a moment before the main door burst open and trumpets sounded. Walking with an air of confidence was Prince Hammond of the Forester family line accompanied by a small entourage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were on him when he gestured to the pianist to resume playing.

No, the honor is mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the worst thing to ever have happened to me. We danced and swayed together the rest of the night, the prince and I. As much as I hate to admit it, he was an excellent dancer. It was a relief to have a partner that didn't keep stepping on my toes. Luckily, he was also a gentleman and his hand stayed only in appropriate places, I'm mean, if I was a girl that is to say. His arms were strong, yet gentle and he smelled quite pleasant, in comparison to the rest of the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask the name of my lady?\" Hammond spoke.<br>\r\nAfter a pause I was forced to respond,\"Elisabeth, my Prince,\" Where that name came from, I'll never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHammond smiled at that and just looked into my eyes. As much as I wanted to, I couldn't look away from his dark eyes. We gazed into each others eyes and that's when it happened. I saw it coming but I couldn't avoid it.

It was disgusting but at the same time...it was kind of nice, that is, it wasn't as terrible as if could have been. I felt myself melt into Hammond and wrapped my arms around his neck, pulling him toward me. The kiss was short and Hammond pulled back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, that was improper of me I..umph,\" Hammond attempted to apologize but my lips silenced him as I pulled him back to me. I mean to say, the ruby made me pull him back to me. He made no further attempts to break that kiss, and it felt like it went on forever. Slowly it became more passionate and I heard myself release soft moans of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the kiss ended, we were both grinning and breathing heavy. A glance to my side revealed a disheveled looking Montclair wearing a forced smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I barrow her for just a moment my Prince?\" She said curtseying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...of course,\" Hammond apprehensively replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMontclair took my hand and dragged me away as I continued to look back at Hammoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little harlot,\" She quietly hissed at me, \"I go to all of this trouble for you, I clothe you, I invite you here, and this is how you repay my kindness?\" With that she touched the ruby gathering a small light to her finger. Then I felt like a puppet whose strings were cut. I was free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I...I'm sorry. I promise I'll leave and never come back,\" I pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late. You can't seem to keep from worsening your situation. I just wanted a little fun at your expense but you simply can not behave.\" With that, she touched her glowing finger to my forehead and I felt those strings retie. <br>\r\n\"And how about a minor illusion to keep this all between us?\" she growled while waving a hand around me. I only later discovered what the charm did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was...\" I started to say but she cut me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time, Prince Hammond is waiting,\" She sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shooed me away and I quickly minced back into Hammond's arms.

Not wanting to end the discussion, Michael pressed forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, hear me out. I know it's crazy but I don't have a lot of other options.\", he pleaded. Just moments before, Michael returned from the funeral of his grandmother. Michael's grandmother once owned one of the largest automotive company in the United States. While the company was sold off some time ago, she was still the heiress to a gigantic amount of wealth, and in her will she declared Michael the sole benefactor of her entire fortune and estate, much to the chagrin of his other family members. In her will was an unusual amount of terms and conditions for him to receive his inheritance, chief among them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I going to find someone to marry who won't just try to take half my money and run?\", Michael explained. Chris stopped changing channels just long enough to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's even legal? Withholding your inheritance if you aren't married? It sounds like something out of a soap opera.\", said Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I looked into it with a lawyer. If I don't get married in six months, I lose the inheritance to my step-sisters, case closed.\", he complained. \"I'd rather die than let those jackals take Grandma's money. They never liked her and were just counting the days until she left them a fortune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's say I go through with this... don't you think it would be strange if you suddenly appeared with a boyfriend, saying you're ready to get married and settle down with your friend from college?\", Chris pointed out. The two of them have been good friends since meeting at University, and had just become roommates not 6 weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing...\", Michael hesitated. \"I have to get married in Grandma's home state, and they don't allow same-sex marriage there. For this to work... you'd have to pretend to be a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris stared blankly at Michael, \"...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long moment of silence, Chris said simply. \"I stand corrected. THAT is the worst idea I ever heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hear me out! You're not a huge guy, and standing next to me you're kind of short...\". Michael was a bit forgiving to his friend's ego; Chris was a thin guy and stood about 5'6, 120 lbs, while Michael was 6'0 and 185 lbs of lean muscle. \"I think with a little work, you could pull it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris, just a few words away from a seriously bruised ego, lashes out, \"So what, I look like a girl?\", he huffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing his friend's frustration, he backs off slightly, \"No, no... not without some work you don't.\" Michael tries another tactic before giving up; an appeal to cash. \"Look, there is a lot of money for you in this. My lawyer already drew together a prenup; if you go through with this, you're looking at making 10 million dollars. After taxes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What.\", was his only reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rules of her will state that I have to be married for six months. After that, we get a clean divorce, and you make away with the easiest 10 million you'll ever make.\", Michael explained. \"I get to keep most of my inheritance, and you become a millionaire.\" Chris blinked at the word 'millionaire'... he really liked the sound of that. Feeling like Chris was on the verge of changing his mind, Michael pressed forward, \"You have to appear at the wedding and maybe some family get-togethers, but you'd spend most of the time hiding out of sight playing video games on the estate. You can quit that job you hate, pay off your student loans, do whatever you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris rubbed his chin in thought for a moment, before asking something that had been bothering him, \"So... why do you want ME to do this? Why not ask someone else... like an actual GIRL?\". A small part of Chris' mind regretted mentioned the idea... maybe he just lost a chance at 10 million dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael explained, \"I don't have many friends, especially ones that are girls. All the ones I know are married or in serious relationships. Even if they weren't, you are probably still the only person I could trust with this... and besides...\", Michael stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris blinked, feeling extremely awkward during Michael's long pause, \"Uhhhh.... besides 'what'?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I have to just give money away like this... if I have to choose someone to have their life changed for the better... I guess... I'd want it to be you. That's all.\", Michael stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was quiet for what seemed like an eternity, before Chris finally scoffs. \"Tsk, what a lame thing to say.\", he mumbles, not wanting to express the appreciation he has for his good friend after his admission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another pause, with the television spewing commercials in the background, Michael asks again. \"So? Will you marry me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkward pauses come to an end when the two of them share a laugh at Michael's choice of words, but even still, Chris needs to decide whether or not to help his friend.</span></div></div>",

For what?\". His face goes cold after he can imagine the answer right after proposing the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Training to be a girl, dude.\", Michael says matter-of-factly. \"You have to learn to look and act the part for when you need to be in public... if you aren't convincing, there is no point in doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris starts to have second thoughts... he had imagined this would take next to no effort at all, but this kind of sounds like work, not to mention embarrassing. \"I don't know man... maybe we could just, not be seen together until the wedding? We could call it a love at first sight thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael scratches his forehead, \"There's nothing in the will that says I can't just show up with a bride and get married, but... if it's suspicious, some of my family members might dig deeper into finding out who you are. That could be bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...COULD BE?\"</i>, Chris thinks to himself. \"I think that'd be more than just 'bad'\", he says, \"but I want to limit just how much time I have to spend dressed like a girl to a minimum...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael thinks it over and leaves the decision to his friend, \"You're the one under the most pressure here. I'll leave it to you. Either we announce a wedding in a few months and that's it, or I introduce you as my longtime girlfriend to deflect suspicion.\"</span></div></div>",

Finally satisfied with her work, she capped the tube of lipstick and set it on the counter with the other items.<br>\r\nShe picked up tweezers and plucked a couple of more hairs from his eyebrows. \"I didn't give you a full feminine eyebrow, only pulled a few to make them neater.\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"And why aren't' you practicing your voice?\" She added.<br>\r\n\"I was trying to think about it before I attempted a female voice\" Chris explained.<br>\r\nGwen grabbed a bath towel and wrapped it turban style around his hair.<br>\r\n\"ok, so lets hear what you came up with\" She asked.<br>\r\nChris leaned forward so Gwen could continue to wrap the towel around his head, and cleared his throat. In his best high pitch voice said, \"Hi I'm Christina Mullens.\"<br>\r\nThe voice wasn't great, but it could work for now. Gwen had Chris repeat the sentence a few times in a softer tone so that they couldn't hear them through the door. It made a world of difference with the whisper. His voice sounded more sultry.<br>\r\nChris explained, \"I used to take an acting class and was in a few of the school plays when I was younger, I think the problem is that I don't feel this part. In the play if I were to play a monster, I had makeup on and I could get into the part. But this part, I don't believe\"<br>\r\nGwen stood Chris up and turned his body to face the mirror. \"Well, you better start believing\"<br>\r\nChris saw his reflection for the first time since Gwen started weorking on him. Only staring back at him was a woman's face, A pretty woman's face.<br>\r\n\"Oh man, this is getting crazy!\" said Chris as he continued to stare at himself in awe.<br>\r\n\"Well this is only the beginning so you better get used to it, oh and talk as a woman from now on, you need to practice!\", she said as she started putting the makeup back in her purse and cleaning up the bathroom sink.<br>\r\n\"Oh,...right.\" Chris corrected himself by switching to his female voice. \"What about boobs?\"<br>\r\n\"Well we have no women's clothes in here now but here....\" Said Gwen as she looked around the bathroom and spotting Michael's robe.<br>\r\nShe wrapped in around Chris, and it engulfed and swalled him up. Chris now looked and sounded the part of Christina.<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" Gwen asked while turning the bathroom door knob.<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" Chris replied in his girly voice.<br>\r\nGwen walked out first and announced..\"Here is Christina!\"<br>\r\nMichael's eyes widened as Gwen and the new woman emerged from the bathroom.<br>\r\nMichael's parents both stood up from the couch <br>\r\nChris approached them.<br>\r\n\"Finally I get to meet Michael's parents\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, she saw her sons fiancee without a ring on her finger and thought of \"that\" ring to give her.<br>\r\nChris looked down at the floor as Gwen continued.<br>\r\n\"Michael's dad, same thing. Just met you, yet gave you hist credit card so that you could have a relaxing day doing what all women around the world enjoy doing...pampering themselves.<br>\r\n\"Now if they made these spur of the moment decisions to someone they just met, don't you think they're going to want to be a part of this wedding? Probably includes shopping this Michael's mom and sister, and that fateful day when you go wedding gown shopping. Don't you think Michael's mom is going to come into the dressing room and help you into that wedding dress? You're going to have to have some kind of shape if they are going to see you in a bra and panties. There are moments that are going to pop up where you will have to look, dress and be the shape of a woman. I think the best way would be breast implants. That way no red flags would pop up and no one would have a reason to question why there are two oranges in the dressing room with you.\"<br>\r\nChris heavilly sighed, and looked up again. He looked at Michael. \"Look man, I don't think I put that much thought into what I was getting into, and maybe you didn't either. I thought this would be just like an acting job like I did in the plays when I was  younger.  I hate to say this, but maybe I'm not the guy for this job.\"<br>\r\nChris leaned forward on the couch and folded his hands together and gain deeply sighed.<br>\r\nMichael ran both hands through his hair. He was moved by Gwens' story and himself began to question if this was the right thing to do and fool his family like this. <br>\r\nHe turned away and then turned back towards Chris.<br>\r\n\"I'll throw in an additional five million\"<br>\r\n\"DEAL!\", Chris quickly replied. He stood up and hugged Michael.<br>\r\nThey all had a good laugh.<br>\r\n\"So this is it, no turning back now. Once I put these papers into the system tomorrow morning Chris goes on hiatus and Christina Mullens is born.\", explained Gwen.<br>\r\n\"Well, Im still not entirely sold on implants\", Chris explained.<br>\r\n\"Yeah isn't there something else that could be done, I mean can't we used implants as a last resort? What about hormones?\" Asked Michael.<br>\r\n\"I'd do that, doesn't that gradually give you breast growth? It's not like I'd end up with a large C cup or anything.\" Said Chris.<br>\r\n\"Although my husband has access to estrogen. They have to be perscribed and they only do that for transitioning patients who want to be female.\" explained Gwen. She grabbed her purse and the papers with Christiana's signiture on it anfd walked for the door. \"let me see what I can come up with. Hold tight, I'm going to run around for awhile, make some stops and I'll come back here at around 10ish.\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you coming back tonght?\" Asked Chris.<br>\r\nGwen smiled, </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This time Michael was the one rollignn onto his back and stirring on the couch by the noises her heard. He rubbed his eyes and stretched. Slowly he sat up  and focused his eyes. He saw two people standing near the couch.<br>\r\n\"Well it's about time...\" Gwen stated. \"We werent sure if you were going to sleep the whole night through.\"<br>\r\nHe looked and saw Gwen, but next to her was another woman. Slightly familiar and with sudden rush of a memory jog. realized that this was Chris, or rather, Christina.<br>\r\n\"Geez, how long was I out?\", he asked.<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's like 3am. We've been going now stop for about 5 hours.\" Chris explained.<br>\r\nMichael stood up and finally got a good look at Chris and realized what he meant. \"Wow! He said.<br>\r\nGwen smilied, \"I know, right?\" <br>\r\nShe put her hands on Chris' waist and pushed him closer to Michael's view. <br>\r\n\"Let me give you a quick run down of what we accomplished tonight before I go so that this one can get a somewhat decent nights sleep.\"<br>\r\nMichael looked around the apartment for the first time and saw bags and bags of department store clothes all over. Clothes and accessories, including a few purses and make up cases lined the counter.<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the mess, I promise to swing by tomorrow and fix  your place. But lets get down to buisness. Christina, your fiance has been a model student, She has learned how to sit properly, walk in a heel, and I think we have the voice as good as it's going to be.\" Gwen explained and then pointed to Chris.<br>\r\nChris jumped into character and in a whispery hight pitch said, \"Hi, my name is Christina.\"<br>\r\nMichael couldn't believe what he heard. He had to admit, it was pretty good. <br>\r\nGwen continued to talk. \"I did a little shopping and picked him up some basic clothes, probably about 3 days worth, including underware and bras. What he's wearing right now, this simple jeans and t shirt is what he's going to wear for tomorrow's salon trip. <br>\r\nI put his hair in a scrunchie sitting high on his head, basic foundation, some cheek color. I didn't over do his eyebrows, I just kept them neat. He's got clip on small hoops in. and some foam padding in his bra and some other foam padding along side his waist to give him some kind of shape.<br>\r\nChris got tired of being the center of attention and walked over to the table where he had a Capri Sun juice pouch. He walked taking small steps and with a little bit of a wiggle.<br>\r\n\"I'm really impressed! This could really work.\", Michael explained.<br>\r\nChris interjected, \"And Gwen found this cool foam padding that she thinks we might be able to get away with instead of the whole \"hormone\" topic.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I said it might work, I'm still not completely sold on it. Lets just see how involved Michael's family will be in wedding preparations and then we can decide how far we're going to take Christina.\" Gwen explained.<br>\r\nGwen said this while wrapping things up. She grabbed her purse and threw it over her shoulder. \"we've gotta call it a night though, because I have to go into work in the morning and then meet you at the salon at around 1pm. I'll make an appointment from work, then pick you up at about 12:45. It's right around the corner from you guys and it's a really nice place. But you have to be ready. That means this outfit, your purse. It's very important that you remember your purse and don't worry too much about makeup. They are going to be giving you the spa treatment, so they will take care of everything.\"<br>\r\nShe walked towards the door.<br>\r\n\"You did really good, I think this is going to work. We're going to be very rich after this is all over! Oh and Michael, you owe me $875 for the clothes and makeup\", Gwen smiled handing Michael a handful of receipts. <br>\r\nMichael's mouth opened wide.<br>\r\n\"See you guys tomorrow!\", was the last thing Gwen said and then closed the door behind her.<br>\r\nChris walked to the bathroom. He left the door open as he started to remove his makeup the way Gwen showed him earlier.<br>\r\nMichael walked into the bathroom doorway and watched, \"You know I appreciate this?Not many people would do something like this for their roommate.\"<br>\r\nChris was calm and cool, \"Oh yea man, no problem. I mean, I'm not going to lie, I was a little concerned at first and then direction this whole scheme was taking, and how I was thrown into this right away, but tomorrow will be a breeze. I'll get a massage, take a mud bath and get pampered. I'm a little more concerned about tomorrow night, because the spotlight will be on me and I have to be on with this. It's going to be nerve racking, but I know the money is going to make everything better. Then hopefully your parents will go away for a few months, Gwen saiid she'll help you make some wedding decisions, then in six months comes the Big Show! But for now I just want to focus on one day at a time.\" He continued as he began splashing water on his face after using a sponge to remove the makeup on his face.<br>\r\n\"Well, don't forget, I'm here too. So we're in this together.\" Michael replied.<br>\r\nChris started to remove his t shirt. He pulled it half way up to his bra and then tried to hurry Michael along, \"Ok, man, well I'll see you in the morning.\"<br>\r\nMichael got the hint. \"Oh,...right. Ok\" He said backing up feeling a little weird. \"Night dude.\"<br>\r\n\"Night!\", Chris replied. Once Michael was out of his doorway he removed his top revealing a stuffed bra against his skin. He undid the clasp and let the foam fall to the floor. Lastly Chris pulled out the scrunchie from his long hair and let it fall to his shoulders.<br>\r\nMichael the whole time watched from his dark doorway. \"Damn\", he thought. \"This is going to be a long six months\" and then he closed his door for the night.<br>\r\nThe next morning...Chris woke up....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning at Gwen's government clerk job, she had just finished entering all of Christina's information into the computer. She quickly reread through everything and checked for correct spelling and dates to make this legit. One wrong move and this could backfire in their face. It all looked good, all she had to do was update the file and press enter. Which she was about to do, but her secretary entered her doorway.<br>\r\n\"Hi Gwen, I just finished up those other files. They are researched and filed so if we are audited we should be in good shape.\" said her secretary Stacy.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Stacy, I appreciate it. Can you do me one more favor? I need you to make an appointment at my usual salon on Main St. for two.\" Gwen explained.<br>\r\n\"Two?\" replied Stacy.<br>\r\n\"Yes, my friend's fiancee. Remember Patrick Bridges? well he's getting married to a nice girl name Christina. She's been through some rough times and relationships before Patrick, and she hadn't had an opportunity to pamper herself in a long time, so I thought I'd get her all girlied out for a day.\" replied Gwen<br>\r\nGwen hadn't noticed because she was distracted by Stacy but she put her elbow on the keyboard. The computer beeped, and Gwen looked down and then at the computer screen. The screen read. \"FILE UPDATED\"<br>\r\n\"That's terrible! Was the realationship an abusive one?\" asked Stacy continued.<br>\r\nGwen tried to hurry Stacy along now because she wanted to make sure everything was ok with Christina's file. So she rambled on \"Well, not abusive, but she was told how to dress and she had to tone everything down for this guy. Basically dressed her as a nun.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, that's terrible! I'll make the appointment right way.\" Stacy said as she left her doorway.<br>\r\nGwen heavilly sighed. Immidiately her attention went to the computer and the Christina file. She read through everything. \"Ok, this looks good\" She muttered to herself. Ok, ok\" she continued as she scrolled down. But something caught her eye.<br>\r\nShe looked at Date of Birth.<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute.\" She thought. She took out a calculator and did the math.<br>\r\n\"OH SHIT!\" She thought.<br>\r\nShe smirked, \"Well I guess worse things could have happened.\"<br>\r\nThat was it, the file was updated and Christina Mullens was a real woman. The right agencies had just gotten emailed about Christina Mullens and Gwen knew that The Motor Vehicle Agency would be sending out a licence renewal form, and her new social security card would be on the way to Chris' address. Everything was moving right along.<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the other room Stacey was on the phone finishing making her boss' appointment at the salon, for two.<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm still holding. Oh that's great! Yes thank you so much, I'm really sorry it was last minute but it was really important. The girl really needs this. She came from an abusive relationship. Her ex basically controlled everything she did and was never to show off  her body. She needs the full day salon process.\" Stacy paused to listen to the woman at the salon. <br>\r\n\"Oh that's wonderful! Well I personally haven't seen the girl yet but by the sounds of it she sounds like a mess. I'm sure she could use a little electrolysis on her eyebrows and face. Thank you so much. yes, 1:15. I will tell them.\" and then Stacy hung up.<br>\r\nStacy looked through her phone numbers and came to the number she wanted to call.<br>\r\nOn the other end of town a woman wearing a white doctor's coat answered the phone. \"Hello Dr. Jen Reynolds\"<br>\r\n\"Hi Jen? It's Stacy over at the county office.\" She replied.<br>\r\n\"Hi Stacy, how are you?\" the doctor replied.<br>\r\n\"Great! Hey, I know you guys aren't close or anything but did you know your brother was getting married?\" she explained<br>\r\n\"What? No! I had no idea. Where did you hear that?\" Jen asked<br>\r\n\"My boss Gwen, who is friends with Patrick just told me, Her and his fiancee are going to the salon today down by your office at 1:15.\" Stacy continued.<br>\r\n\"That little shit, he's trying to fulfill the wishes of my grandmother's will and get married so that he can claim the whole inhertance, this whole thing has got to be a sham. Thanks for letting me know Stacy, I'm going to have to pay this little gold digger a little visit. Thanks for letting me know Stacy, I'll talk to you soon.\" Jen said as she hung up.<br>\r\nLater at just about 1 pm Chris woke up by the sound of a ringing phone. He felt around his side table until he found the phone receiver and picked it up.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" He pretty much whispered into the phone.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! Chris? Are you just waking up? Oh my God it's 5 minutes until 1. Your salon appointment is at 1:15!\" Gwen yelled through the phone.<br>\r\nChris sat up in bed and jumped out. \"wait, my appointment? What about you?\" he asked<br>\r\n\"I\"m hung up at work. I'm not going to be able to make it, but you have to go.\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"Oh man!!! I don't want to have a girly day without you there, it's really weird. I'm not comfortable with this, I'm going to just cancel.\" Chris explained nervously.<br>\r\n\"So, you're just giving up all that money because you don't want a relaxing day at the spa? Great!\" Gwen asked.<br>\r\nChris pulled the receiver away and acted like he was going to punch the phone but put it back up to his ear.<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine...ok, I'm up. I'l go.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Just remember everything I told you, do a light makeup because they're going to do a full makeup anyway. The nails, don't forget to tell them you want your nails done because you are newly engaged and you want to show off the beautiful engagement ring.  Throw on the jeans and tshirt, put your hair up and you should be good to go. Now go!\" Gwen explained. \"If you need me for anything, call me.\" She finished and hung up.<br>\r\nChris hung the phone up and then walked to his closet, he opened it and then pulled out the women's jeans and tshirt top. <br>\r\n\"Well, here goes the longest day in my life.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jen sat in her silver Lexus convertable on Main St. just a few parking spaces down from the salon that her girlfriend Stacy told her that her brother's fiancee was going to be at. She had Stacy on the phone giving her updates.<br>\r\n\"So, you're postitive that Gwen is going to be a no show?\" she asked into her cell phone.<br>\r\nStacy was on the other end \"Positive. I heard her calling this Christina chick and telling her that she wasn't going to make it. But she got pulled into a meeting right away so she didn't tell me to cancel her salon appointment.\" <br>\r\n\"So the salon appointment should still be for two women?\" Jen asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I made the appointment myself and supposedly this is her first time at a salon because her ex didn't let her wear makeup or do her hair and things like that. Why? What are you going to do?\" Stacy asked.<br>\r\n\"Well I think I should get to know my future sister in law a little better so I'm just going to tell her, that Gwen sent me in her place. I'll act like I know everything about what's going on with the engagement, then after a couple of facials and hairstyles once she's gained my trust. She'll tell me everything about their little plot to get married according to the wishes in my grandmother's will and how they are going to be billionares, and then. Busted! I destroy her, Gwen and especially my brother.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, you're so evil Jen. Well if youre going to do that I should tell you that when she was on the phone with Christina, she called her CHRIS the whole time, so to make this more believable like you are in on the plan, you might want to stick with that.\" Stacy said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Stacy, That's good to know..this little wench is going to see first hand just how evil I can get.\" Jen while speaking looks in her sideview mirror and see's a dark blonde with a ponytail walking in the direction of the salon and her car. She looks at the clock phone on her dashboard that reads 1:17<br>\r\n\"Oh, man. I gotta go. I think my little salon date just got here.\" Jen said hanging up the phone.<br>\r\nJen let the girl pass and gave her a look over to make sure this was Christina.<br>\r\nShe noticed the girl was in jeans and a purple tshirt. She seemed very self conscious and kept looking around, almost embarrassed. She was really thin and looked to be about the same height as Jen. She wore open toes sandels on her feet. She held onto a small white clutch purse. Her hair in a ponytail and sunglasses on her face. She looked at the stores on Main street as she passed them and then saw the salon. She timidly stopped at the window.<br>\r\n\"Showtime!\" Jen said to herself.<br>\r\nChris stood outside the salon and took a deep breath. \"Showtime!\" He said to himself.<br>\r\nJen closed the door of her car and took her sunglasses off, put them in her purse and approached Chris. \"Chris? Christina?\"<br>\r\nChris jumped at the sound of someone calling his voice. Especially an unfamiliar woman's voice. He turned around and saw Jen approaching him. He pointed his finger at himself, and mouthed silently, \"me?\"<br>\r\n\"That's your name, right? You're Chris?\" Jen asked realizing that Christina was scared of her agressive attitude.<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah?\" Chris tried to think who this woman was. Even though he was scared he had to stay in character so he remembered to speak in a woman's voice.  He hated this though, here he was somewhere that he didn't want to be, dressed as a woman and now he was acknowledged by another woman that he didn't know. What was going on? He began to panic, hyperventilate, and sweat.<br>\r\nShe got to where Chris stood and grabbed his hands. \"Relax sweetheart, Gwen sent me\"<br>\r\nChris breathed a sigh of relief that although this is still embarrassing being a man dressing up and acting like a woman in public, <br>\r\nat least he wasn't going to be alone.<br>\r\nChris smiled, \"Oh thank God! You scared me, I thought I was going to have to do this alone.\" Chris replied looking around and still speaking as a woman.<br>\r\n\"I'm Jennifer, I'm friends with Gwen and Patrick. She told me everything that's going on and I'm here to help, and for support.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\nChris felt a little better about the situation. \"Sorry that I jumped about a story high. I thought Gwen only wanted to keep everything between me, her, and Patrick? I didn't think she wanted to bring anyone else into this\" Chris explained.<br>\r\nJen thought Chris was still being vague with this, but if she acted, and played along like Gwen had told her everything, she was sure Christina would blab away and reveal that this was all about the will and the money.<br>\r\n\"I can play this game\" she thought.<br>\r\n\"She wanted to just keep you 3 in the mix, but she was really upset about not being able to be here for you, being this is your first time, she ended up opening up to me and told me everything. I said that I would go down to the salon and put your mind at ease.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I appreciate this so much.\" Chris said in a girly attitude and voice and then leaned in closer and sort of broke character and said in a whisper \"You gotta do a lot of the talking in here for me cause I'm so llost on this girly stuff.\"<br>\r\n\"Well that's why I'm here, girl. Now let's get inside and make you beautiful!\" Jen said going for the door and opening it and holding it for Christina.<br>\r\nChristana walked in scared and immidiately looked around...there was a lot to look at. The salon was deceiving from the outside. It looked small from the brick front. Once inside the room opened up into a different stations. Chris noticed rows of women under hair dryers, another wall had salon workers washing some women's hair, there was an upstairs that had a sign that read massage.<br>\r\nThere were different smells and colors everything also. Chris thought he was in too deep. <br>\r\nJen watched Christina taking everything. She turned around and faced Jen and whispered, \"I can't do this. We're going to have to think of something else.\" <br>\r\n\"Don't panic Chris, you can do this. I'm here with you. Just take a deep breath in.\" <br>\r\nBoth Chris and Jen took a deep breath in. <br>\r\n\"Now let it out.\" They both released their breath.<br>\r\n\"This isn't helping\" Chris whispered. \"I'm going into panic mode.\" <br>\r\nA woman at the counter appeared and asked if she could help them.<br>\r\n\"You've got this, don't panic, you've got this.\" Jen said, then walked up to the counter. <br>\r\n\"Hi, yes, we're a little late, we have a 1:15 appointment under Gwen.<br>\r\nThe salon receptionist looked at her scheduling book and saw their appointment. Next to Gwen's name it read , full treatment for abusive relationship woman.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, we've been waiting for you. We have a wonderful afternoon planned for you both. Two more women appeared to take the women into the salon. \"Now which one is Gwen?\" asked one woman.<br>\r\nJen spoke up, \"I'm Gwen's friend and this is Christina\" She then pointed to Chris and said, \"she is the one who needs the full treatment.\" <br>\r\nThe women smiled and one put her arm around Chris and said, \"Come with me honey, I'll take good care of you.\" <br>\r\nChris turned around with a fear look on his face as Jen smiled and waved to him.<br>\r\nThe woman walked with Chris and directed him to the stairway. \"We thought we'd start you out with a wonderful relaxing massage., how's that sound?\"<br>\r\nChris repeated words he just heard in a trance, \"Wonderful and relaxing. All the time Chris remained in his Christina character.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be able to see my friend after this, right?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"You bet.\" the woman replied while climbing the stairs. <br>\r\nWhen they got to the top of the stairs they entered a room. The inside opened up to a desk where a stack of towels were. The woman grabbed one and then slid open a closet door and relvealed a row of large soft fuzzy robes. She took one out and measured it up to Christina and found a perfect match. She handed both the towel and robe to Christina and pointed down the hall. Go to the 2nd door on the right and get undressed and then lie on the table. I'll be in about five minutes.<br>\r\n\"Chris listened and walked to where the woman had said and opened the door. He went inside and saw a dimly lit room, a massage table in the center room, and a small room that looked to be the size of a dressing room in a department store.<br>\r\nHe went inside the room and began undressing. He slid the women's jeans off. He took them off so fast, he didn't realize that his cell phone hit the floor and the battery had come off the back of it.  He was more concerned about whether or not he should keep the panties that Gwen made him wear on.  The more he thought about it, he had his member tucked away inside so tight that if he undid that tape job, this might get real painful.<br>\r\nHe undid the clasp of the bra and when he did the foam \"breasts\" that he had inside the cups fell to the floor.<br>\r\nHe heard the woman enter the room. \"Are you ready Christina?\" she asked.<br>\r\nChris quickly gathered the foam breasts and slid them inside the pant legs of the jeans so the woman wouldn't see them. He threw on the robe and exited the dressing room.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Im sorry. I'm just a little nervous being this is my first time.\" He said in a timid woman's voice.<br>\r\n\"Not to worry miss. We'll take good care of you.\" She replied as she patted the massage table telling Chris to lie down on top.<br>\r\n\"You are going to love this, and then right after this we can...</span></div></div>",

He had been in this position for the past 45 minutes.  A large light was above his face. Goggles were placed over his eyes and a technician worked steadily across his face with an electrode needle carefully zapping away at his face. The techinician worked on his upper lip and was just finishing up his chin.<br>\r\nHe had enjoyed the massage that he received when he first got to the salon. he thought to himself, but this was pretty boring. He had no idea what electrolysis was or what the zapping was but the salon technicians wanted it done, and said that it was part of his package, so Chris didn't argue.<br>\r\nThe technician that worked on him finally put down the needle. \"We did a thourough treatment on your upper lip but your chin area just needed a little cleaning up so we took care of that. We suggest that next time you come back that you have this worked on again. A few more treatments and you should be looking beautiful and not have to worry about this again.\" The technician explained.<br>\r\nShe turned off the above light, and made the back of his chair rise so that he sat upright again.<br>\r\n\"There will be some redness, but we'll take care of that with some cooling methods and once we do your makeup, you will look great.\" She explained as she placed a cool cloth over his face. <br>\r\n\"Next we're going to send you over to our eyebrow specialist and makeup artist, Molly, who's going to give you some wonderful brow shaping. After that we're going to wash and style your hair and then you'll return to Molly for a full facial makeover.

Getting some nails, but someone had signed him up for a full salon treatment. Chris felt a little wobbly, he had been lying on his back for awhile and his face was tingling like crazy. But mostly after hearing all that, he didn't want to rush over to the next techincian. He just wanted this to end. \"How am I going to get out of here .\" Chris thought to himself as the woman led him into a small area in another room. \"Eyebrow specialist? This can't be good.\" he continued to think.<br>\r\nAnother woman greeted him and sat him in yet another chair. A familiar face sat in a chair next to his where a makeup artist was working on Jen's face. \"Looking good, stranger.\" said Jen.<br>\r\nChris saw that Jen had her hair done and commented on it. \"I love your hair.\" he said in his Christina voice. He sighed a little relief, at least Jen was next to him. She would help hm. She knew what was going on with Patrick's plan so he knew she wouldn't do anything that was permanent, at least he assumed all this.<br>\r\n\"Hi sweetheart, I'm Molly, what beautiful facial features you have.\" said the technician as she put a floral smock aroudn his neck. <br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Chris replied in his Christina voice.<br>\r\nIt was true, Not only was Chris a short male, he also had slight feminine features. He had been told this growing up but of course he had never done anything to highlight these features and bring out the woman in him, that was until now. This was one of the reasons that Michael knew that this plan would work, he knew Chris would be able to pass as a woman.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take care of those bushy brows. Do you know if you want a full arch, a medium arch or what?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Uhh, as little as possible\" Chris said again as Christina but then he looked at Jen for a little help.<br>\r\nThe technician got out some tweezers. \"Ok, you want them on the thin side.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no, that's not what I meant.\" Chris thought. but the technician had already started on one side of his face.<br>\r\n\"I think a beautiful,not too thin arched brow\" Jen said. \"Our little Christina has never had a full makeover and basiclaly lived a sheltered life in a bad relationship, so she needs to be as girly as possible to start enjoying her new life with her new fiance\" Explained Jen. Jen thought the story that Stacy told her was true, so that's why she explained it. Chris sat there with his mouth opened wide wondering why Jen would say something like that. <br>\r\nMolly comforted Chris. \"It's ok, honey. Everyone here knows about your abusive relationship that you went through and how you never had a day at the salon like this. So we're going to make sure your day is full of lots of pampering.\"<br>\r\nChris couldn't believe his ears. \"Why would Jen say something like that? \" He thought. \"I know she wants me to pass as a woman, so she must have come up with a backstory to help me along. Great, just great...next time she could have let me in\" he thought.<br>\r\nMolly looked like she finished with one side and then started to tweeze the other side of the eyebrows. Chris thought again to himself. \"Well at least she doesn't seem to be taking too much off, this won't be too bad.\"<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Molly put the tweezers down and went over to another table and grabbed a container. <br>\r\n\"Ok honey, Now that I've got them cleaned up a little, lets wax those suckers .\" She said.<br>\r\n\"OH NO!\" thought Chris.<br>\r\nShe started to coat around one of his eyebrows with the wax. She set a strip over it and pressed down firmly<br>\r\n\"Now honey, this is going to be a little painful, but I promise once it's over we have one more to do and then I'll send you both out to have your hair washed and set.<br>\r\nQuickly she pulled the strip off. Chris jerked back in the chair and held in a scream. The pain was terrible, he couldn't understand how or why women would do this to themselves. But here he was amongst them, being treated just like any other woman and no one saw anything other than a woman.<br>\r\nHe looked down and in Molly's hand was the strip and on the strip was a good portion of his eyebrow. He wondered how much remained above his eye. <br>\r\n\"Chris, it's the price we pay to be beautiful\" said Jen<br>\r\nMolly immediately started putting wax around his other eyebrow. \"Ok, honey, I have to even them out, then a little more tweezing and I promise they will be..\"<br>\r\n\"Beautiful?\" Chris interrupted and finished her sentence.<br>\r\n\"Of course honey, we aim to please.\" She replied.<br>\r\nAgain she laid a strip over the wax area above his brow, and pressed down.<br>\r\n\"Ok honey, here we go.\" <br>\r\nChris dug his fingernails into the arm of the salon chair and held tight. Immediately she pulled again on the remaining strip. Once again Chris jumpped in his seat, and leaned back, fighting the urge to scream bloody murder. He muffled his cries again.<br>\r\nBut felt his eyes water as he closed them. <br>\r\nOnce he opened them again, he again saw another strip containing most of his eyebrow hair.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are going to love these when I get through with them.\" Molly said as she once again grabbed the tweezers and worked on a few stray hairs.<br>\r\nChris' eyebrows were worked on a little longer with the tweezers then Molly pulled over another side table which Chris notices had different makeup on it. <br>\r\nShe coated his eyebrows with the mascara wand. Then she began to remove the floral smock around his neck. Jen was also just removing the apron around her neck. Jen was finished getting her hair and makeup done and only needed her nails done.<br>\r\nMolly placed a mirror in Chris' hands. Slowly Chris brought the mirror up to his face. His eyebrows were now nicely thin and slightly arched. He no longer had a male eyebrow, his eyebrows were unmistakenly female.<br>\r\n\"They look wonderful\" Jen commented. The two women were escorted into the next room. It was both for hair and nails.<br>\r\nJen watched as the woman took Chris towards the hair washing area.<br>\r\nShe was escorted to the nail technician and was seated. Immediately the woman started working on her hand.<br>\r\nJen's phone rang, she looked at who it was and answered it quietly.<br>\r\n\"Hi Stacy, what's up?\" she asked into the phone.<br>\r\nStacy on the other end excitedly asked her about Christina. \" How's it going? What is she like?\"<br>\r\n\"Theyr'e giving her the star treatment, so the little princess is getting pampered. Did you find out any dirt on this chick, or what?\" replied Jen.<br>\r\n\"I'm still looking for stuff on her, but I did find out something interesting about Gwen, and it could work to your advantage....\"explained Stacy.<br>\r\n\"Well tell me, cause I have to bring this bitch down.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\nWell it turns out, ....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gwen was just finishing up her conversation with her husband on her cell phone. She still sat in the empty board room where the meeting had taken place which decided that she was going to work in Washington DC for a month and get their files transferred into their new system using a special scanning tool which made it a snap to load. She had been part of the development committee so she was one of four other employees chosen to go.<br>\r\n\"It's a good oportunity and we're supposed to meet with President Obama during our stay to show them that our software is flawless. I know honey, but I'll probably be able to come back for a little while.\" explained Gwen on the phone to her husband.<br>\r\nIt wasn't unheard of that Gwen traveled with her government job. She had always taken weekend trips paid for by the government to set up different cities with new file software. The longest she had been gone was a week in NY, but this was by far the longest.<br>\r\n\"We are leaving day after tomorrow. Yes, I still have the dinner tonight with Michael's family and then tomorrow night, I'm all yours. Ok, babe, I love you too. I'll see you soon.\" Gwen said, and then hung up her phone.<br>\r\nBefore putting the phone back into her purse, she checked the time, and then she check her text messages. She realized Chris still hadn't called her. \"It's almost 4:15. Chris should be home from the salon by now. All he was getting done were nail extensions, a massage, and a facial.\" Gwen thought. She dialed his number again. It would be the 5th time that she would dial his number and the 5th time that his phone would go straight to Chris' voicemail.<br>\r\n\"Damn Chris! What could be so important that you couldn't call me!\", she said aloud.<br>\r\nMeanwhile across town.<br>\r\nChris once again held a handheld mirror up to his face. He again glanced at his reflection and again didn't see the man that he once was. He had just finished getting his hair washed, colored and styled. The stylist had made his hair the lightest blonde color that Chris had ever seen. In fact the hair was now almost a white color. It was also styled into a women's cut that gave his hair a lot of body and waves. \"Don't you just love it?\" The stylist asked. <br>\r\nChris again whimpered as he continued to stare into the mirror. \"Oh yeah, it's really something.\" He replied not showing too much happiness. The stylist explained everything. We started off with a color change. We colored your hair and got rid of the dark blonde and decided to go with a beautiful platinum blonde color. We then gave your hair some volume, instead of just the ponytail look that you've had it in for so long. We kept it long but gave you a beautiful layered cut with heavy side swept long bangs.<br>\r\nJen noticed Chris' unhappiness being that she was only sitting a few chairs away. She was getting her nails done. They were finishing up her second hand. \"Why do you look upset\" She thought to herself. A woman having a day of pampering should be a little happier than she has acted.\" she continued to stare at Chris. \" Then when she was getting her eyebrows done, she shot me a look of death when I told the specialist about her abusive relationship. What is really going on here.?\" She continued to put more and more pieces of the story together. \"I will find out your secret Chris, I know Gwen is a part of it and my stupid brother.\" She continued.<br>\r\nThe tv in the corner by the nail station was on the Ellen show but quickly went to commercial. \" The Wayan's brothers star as two disgraced cops who go undercover as two white women in the comedy White Chicks, tonight on TBS, very funny\" <br>\r\n\"I will figure out your secret.\" Jen continued.<br>\r\n\"Now lets get you back over to Molly so she can do your makeup\" Said the hair stylist as she helped Chris once again to his feet.<br>\r\nChris was in a daze and walked like he was in one too. This was getting to be too much. Chris frantically and nervously thought as he was led back to Molly's makeup station. Was he in too far? Sure it was a lot of money at stake, but after every chair he's visited at this salon, the more and more he was becomming a beautiful woman. <br>\r\nThe more he thought about it, he put together a plan in his head.  After tonights dinner with Michael's family he was going to have to do some serious transforming back into a guy. He would have to undo everything that was being done today. He figured he probably wouldn't see Michael's parents again until closer to the wedding so he would have enough time to convince Michael to tell his family that they were just going to elope. He couldn't stay in this charade for 6 months. This had to end.<br>\r\nChris was once agian greeted by Molly who once again put the floral apron around Chris' neck.<br>\r\nMeanwhile back with Jen at the nail station. She picked up her phone as she was just finishing up. <br>\r\n\"Hi Stacy, it's me.\" She said into the phone.<br>\r\n\"HI, how's it going?\" Stacy asked.<br>\r\nJen gave a deep sigh. \"It's driving me crazy because I know there's a scam going on here, I just can't prove anything. This girl is just too perfect. She's got the looks, the personality, and everyone loves her. But why would my brother wait to mention her right after the reading of our grandmother's will which leaves him her entire fortune if he gets married before 6 months. I have to bring my brother and his wench fiancee down! Did you find out anything? Jen angrilly spoke.<br>\r\nStacy grabbed some papers that Jen heard through the phone. \"I pulled up her file, but reading through everything, I just can't see anything about this woman that would scream SCAM! She's on the up and up Jen. You might just have to accept this.\" Explained Stacy.<br>\r\nJen's phone rang at that moment. I have another call, I'll call you back. <br>\r\n\"Hello? Dr. Jen Reynolds.\" She answered.<br>\r\nThe other end of the phone was a familiar voice.<br>\r\n\"Oh hi daddy! It's great to hear from you? Tonight? 7:30, Why? What's going on tonight?\" She replied. On the other end of the phone her father was explaining the family get together tonight which was going to introduce Michael's fiancee Christina to the whole family. \"Oh really? So you and mom have met her already. Well, I'll have to see if I can get off, I'm really swamped at work. I have a nose job to perform tonight so I will have to get back to you. She hung up abruptly on her father. <br>\r\nSteam shot from her ears. Now she was pissed.<br>\r\nOne of the salon employees approached Jen after she hung up her phone. She held a department store shopping back in her hands. \"Hi Dr. Reynolds?\" The woman approached the doctor cautiously after overhearing her phone conversation. \"I just wanted to give this to you.\" She continued as she handed the bag to Jen.<br>\r\n\"what's this?\" She said as she looked at the bag from the Dazzle Me store at the mall.<br>\r\n\"Well the girls and I at the salon wanted to get this gift for Christina. It's a dinner dress and shoes for her for a nice night out. We guessed on the size. She did look to be about the same size and height as you, so we just went for it and bought her this. Could you make sure she gets it?\" Jen said nothing.<br>\r\nJen just looked at the bag and then up at the woman walking away.<br>\r\nAnother hour passed and Jen sat in the waiting room watching the televison. It was just about 5:30 when Jen looked up and saw Christina approaching her.  Still with an expressionless look on her face, Jen had to admit with her hair, makeup, and nails done, she looked absolutely beautiful.<br>\r\nMany of the salon staff gathered around to see her as she came out from the last station, the nail station. Her nails had french tips on the end and they looked gorgeous with the antique engagement ring on her finger. Her makeover was complete and she looked like a new woman.<br>\r\nChris couldn't believe his day. He just wanted to get out of her as fast as he could. All he had to do was get out of the robe, put his other clothes back on and pay. The salon worker then explained that they all chipped in to buy her a dress for a special occasion. Jen put the bag in Chris' hands and Chris opened the bag and pulled out a beige sleevless lace dress.<br>\r\nHis eyes opened wide as he stared at the garment. He had walked in here wearing women's jeans, but still he felt like they were just regular jeans, but now they expected him to wear a dress out of here. This is just getting crazy.<br>\r\nUnder the dress were a low heeled shoe. <br>\r\nHe didn't know how to react. He couldn't do this for much longer and now he had to parade out of the salon not only looking like a fasion model, but now he had to dress like one. \"Thank you very much\" Chris said as Christina.<br>\r\n\"Can you help me get dressed Jen?\" Asked Chris<br>\r\nJen really hated this, she didn't like how buddy buddy Chris was with everyone, including her parents. Now she had to also pretend once again to be the friend of Gwens who knew all about Chris. She just wanted to punch her in the face at this point.<br>\r\n\"Sure, lets go.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\nJen and Chris both entered the dressing room where Chris went behind a screen and removed the robe he had on. Jen stood on the other side of the changing screen and watched Chris place the robe over the top of the screen. <br>\r\n\"Ya know,\" Chris started in a whisper. \"You could have backed me up a little out there\" Chris continued.<br>\r\nJen got a surprised look on her face. \"Help you? With what? You had everything under control.:\" Jen replied.<br>\r\n\"I don't know what I'm doing, this is all new to me and you go and create that story about me being in an abused relationship? What did that have to do with anything?  Hand me my panties, please.\" He reached out for the panties he wore into the salon. Jen put them in his hand. She bit her tongue because she didn't want to say or do anything wrong, but she still didn't understand what Chris was talking about. If he wasn't new to being treated girly and he wasn't in an abusive relationship then what was going on? What's the big secret? Chris came out from behind the screen and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Can you go through the bag with my jeans in it for me? Chris still spoke from behind the screen. <br>\r\nJen sighed as she fished through his bag and found his jeans and tshirt balled up in the bag. She took the jeans out.<br>\r\n\"Uh, I think the girls would like you to come out in the dress that they just bought for you, why do you want the jeans?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't want the jeans to wear, I just need those stupid breast forms inside the pant legs. I shoved them in there when I first got here. I didn't want the massuse to see them.\" Chris explained to a still clueless Jen.<br>\r\n\"Breast forms?\" She asked? She had her hand up a pant leg, and pulled out a foam imitation breast, just as Chris came from behind the changing screen into her view. He wore a pair of panties that Gwen had bought for him in his size and that's all he had on. Jen looked up at a shirtless Chris and finally realized what the big secret was.<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" She gasped.<br>\r\nChris didn't know any better, Jen had just told him hours earlier that she was Gwen's girlfriend and she had been told the whole story by Gwen about the charade they were trying to pull off. So when she screamed, Chris jumped.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"  Chris asked. Jen stared at Chis in shock. In front of her stood a person with a woman's made up face and hair and but bellow the neck was all male. She realized that Chris stood there wondering what she was gasping about. She had told him that she was part of her brother's plan, so she didn't want to give away, at this point that she really didn't know he was a guy.<br>\r\n\"OH, I swear I saw a spider.\" She covered.<br>\r\nChris looked down around the floor for a spider but saw nothing. \"It's such dim lighting in here, how can you see anything? He replied<br>\r\nHe hooked the bra behind him, and then put his hand out as Jen put the fake breasts into his hand. <br>\r\nHe carefully fit them into the cups of each bra and adjusted them to look the same size and level.<br>\r\nJen walked over and helped him straighten them up. Inside she was filled with excitement as she finally knew what the plan was and how they were going to beat the requirements of grandma's will. <br>\r\nShe took the new dress out of the bag and held it by the top for Chris to see. She unzipped it and handed it to him.<br>\r\nChris looked great to Jen. Not only because he could easily pass as a woman, but because he was looking like he was hating every moment of it.<br>\r\nShe watched him step into the sleeveless mini. After he was in, she turned him around and zippered him up. She again faced him towards her and again adjusted his breast forms. The dress had a low neckline, but they could still pull it off without showing any boobs. \"I don't know how you girls do this.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Well, your'e doing great Chris.\" As she handed him the matching low heeled shoes. <br>\r\nChris sighed and stepped into them, and tried to lean over to hook the strap into the buckle.  \"This is going to be embarrassing, Gwen had me try on a couple of dresses when she was giving me a crash course in womanhood, but we decided that I could just be a woman who perfered to wear jeans instead.\" Chris explained. \"I feel so cold, it feels so drafty down there.\" He continued.<br>\r\nJen figured that she better try and help boost his confidence, because otherwise he would give up this charade, and give up the money and Jen wouldn't have the oportunity to blackmail them all as she was plotting to do.<br>\r\n\"Try not to think about it, and just think that you have the jeans on. Try not to focus on it being a dress on your body.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say, you've dressed like this your whole life. This is my first and hopefully last day dressing like this for awhile. At least until the fake wedding draws closer.\" Chris explained.<br>\r\nJen's eyes grew wide. \"No, you can't think like that Chris. If this is going to be believable, you have to really get into the part. Try and make it as believable as you possibly can.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Now you sound just like Gwen.\" Chris replied.<br>\r\nJen smirked as she thought, \"I've got to keep this plan going, so that I can get some money out of this deal too.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I agree with her, I think we should do anything posibble to make people feel and believe that you are the woman that Michael is going to marry. You can't show up for one family meet and greet and then disappear for 5 months. We have to make you confident with this so we can pull it off without any problems.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\nChris made a whinning face \"You look great, now lets pay and get out of here.\" Jen said.<br>\r\nAs they walked out of the dressing room Jen felt something hard in the bag with his clothes. It was Chris' phone and the battery had come off the back. She quickly put it in her purse and followed Chris out to the salon area again.<br>\r\nChris and Jen walked back up to the front counter. Chris learned fast to walk in a dress. He still felt a little weird that he was wearing it and that it was so cold. A group of the salon workers had gathered. They all clapped for Chris as he approached. <br>\r\nChris turned really red in the face. Jen saw this and smiled. <br>\r\nChris opened his purse and pulled out the credit card that Michael''s father had loaned him.<br>\r\nHe handed it to the woman.<br>\r\nShe looked at it and asked, \"And who is Michael McCarthy Sr. to you?\" <br>\r\nJen turned and looked hearing her fathers name and realizing it was his credit card that was going to be paying for this.<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me.\" She thought.<br>\r\n\"That's my father in law. He said the spa day was on him.\" Chris replied.<br>\r\nThe woman smiled and swipped the card.<br>\r\nJen put on a fake smile as Chris signed the recipt and took the card and recipt and put it in his purse.<br>\r\n\"We're going to need to keep up on this look Christina so we're going to make you another appointment for a week from now. That way we can finish the electrolysis on your face and Molly had said she would like to zap some of your brow area, so that we can keep the shape their in permanently.\" The receptionist explained.<br>\r\nChris heard this and still wondered what the heck electrolysis was? But just smiled and took the appointment card she handed him.<br>\r\nJen walked with Chris to the door as she held his arm close and finally explained what electrolysis was.<br>\r\nThey opened the door to the outside and Chris yelled.<br>\r\n\"IT'S PERMANENT HAIR REMOVAL?\" PERMANENT?? LIKE IT WON'T GROW BACK?\" Chris yelled.<br>\r\n\"Shhhh, keep your voice down, you're sounding like a guy.<br>\r\nChris paced in front of the salon. He was freaking out over everything. He held the hem of his dress and looked down. \"Oh my God! This is getting unbelievable! He tried to look at his reflection in the glass. He again was reminded by the glass reflection that his eyebrows were thin and arched and he wore makeup on his face. He also saw the inside of the salon and the girls were watching him have a fit.<br>\r\n\"Walk with me.\" Jen said as she finally got Chris away from the window. \"Too many people over there.\" <br>\r\nThe pair walked a few buildings down and stood by Jen's car. \"Look, it's not terrible that this happened. So what, you got some hair removed on your face. How much did you enjoy shaving everyday anyway.\" <br>\r\nChris smiled a little \"Yeah, I know..\" He sighed. \"I guess this is just getting a little too real.\" He replied.<br>\r\n\"It's for a lot of money, right?\" Jen replied.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's about 15 Million\" Chris replied. <br>\r\nJen tried to keep her cool as she finally heard how much Chris would be getting from her grandmothers inheritence.<br>\r\n\"Well then I think you should go into this full speed ahead. Lets do what's necessary to make this real. You have a lot of people here to help you, including me. Once everything is over, you go back to your old life and you'll be....\" She swallowed hard. \"15 million dollars richer.\" \"Thanks Jen, I appreciate you going with me, It really was a strange experience but it was cool that you were there.\" Chris replied.<br>\r\n\"No problem, hun. I'll see you soon.\" Jen hugged Chris and gave him the bag with his tshirt in it.<br>\r\nShe watched Chris walk down the street until he turned the corner.<br>\r\nOnce out of sight, she quickly took out her phone and dialed Stacy.<br>\r\nStacy answered and all Jen said over and over was, \"It's a guy! It's a guy!!\" Stacy tried to control Jen and calm her down but Jen had wanted to scream those words for about the last half hour.<br>\r\n\"I don't understand?\" Stacy said over Jen's screams. Jen finallly got ahold of herself and explained, \"The scam is that Gwen and Michael are helping their friend CHRIS to impersonate as the woman CHRISTINA, and be Michael's fiancee. They must have faked all that paperwork about Christina and are planning to have a wedding to fulfill the wishes of my grandmother's will. Once they are married, they get a divorce, Christina disappears and Chris appears as a wealthy friend of Micheals. They're all in on it.\" <br>\r\nStacy gasped! \"Gwen must have forged thos documents and made Christina a real girl, Oh my God, I finally got this girl and I can get her fired and take her job.\" Stacy started to get excited.<br>\r\n\"You can't do that. We have to let them go through with this plan.\" Jen said.<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" After all this and you're going to let them decieve the governement and a will that will give them an unbelievable inheritence?\" Stacy couldn't believe what she was hearing.<br>\r\n\"I have to let them, how else will we get our money?\" Jen said.<br>\r\nStacy was again confused. \"Our money?\"<br>\r\n\"If we blow their cover now and bust them, we don't see any money. BUT, if we let them have this little charade and they go through with it, get the inheritence and then tell them that we're going to reveal to everyone what they did unless they hand over the inheritence to us. Then we will get everything. And all we have to do is keep quiet.\" Jen said.<br>\r\n\"You are so evil\" Stacy said. \"But you're just going to let them have their little plan?<br>\r\n\"I'm also going to help them.\" Jen continued.<br>\r\n\"Help them? How?\" Stacy asked.</span></div></div>",

Then by the time of the wedding, he should be more woman than man anyway, and my brother can have a beautiful wedding ceremony as he gets married to his beautiful bride. Then when they're ready for payday, we blackmail them for the whole will\" Jen explained.<br>\r\n\"You are terrible\" Stacy laughed.<br>\r\n\"Oh my dear, you'll have a part in this little charade that I have to explain to you. Can you meet me at my office later? I have to head there now seeing that I took the whole afternoon off.\" Jen continued.<br>\r\n\"I will. I'll be there once I leave here.\" Stacy replied. \"See you soon.\" And then both her and Jen hung up.<br>\r\nLater, back at Chris and Michael's apartment. A stunned Michael stood over Chris who was sitting on the couch.<br>\r\nMichael paced behind him and kept glancing at his friend and roommate. Only he didn't see any trace in his friend or roommate any longer. <br>\r\nSitting properly in the beige minidress. With one leg crossed over the other. Sat a gorgeous woman straight out of the salon. Her healed shoe bounced off the other leg rapidly. Both arms were crossed across a scooped neckline that showed minor clevage.<br>\r\nOn top of her head was platnum blonde hair, and it looked full of volume as it hugged her neckline. The face was made up with light makeup and day colors. Her nails were adorned with french tips which looked beautiful with her engagement ring. Her lips outlined and a beautiful pink shade covered her lips. Her eyebrows were think and slightly arched, and two diamond studs in both ears.<br>\r\nChristina was her name.<br>\r\n\"You said they're permanently arched that way?\" asked Michael timidly. He knew Chris was livid and didn't want to set him off even more.<br>\r\nChris looked straight ahead. \"I was set up man. I was all set for whatever Gwen was going to have set up for me. Which she explained would be a massage, makeup and nails. It turned into this.\" He pointed to himself.<br>\r\nMichael walked to the fridge and got out two beers. He opened both of the twist off tops and handed one to Chris. <br>\r\nChris saw the beer in front of him and he grabbed for it right away.  He brought it to his painted lips and downed more than half the beer in 10 seconds.<br>\r\nFootsteps approached the door and suddenly someone was knocking on the door and slightly opening the door of their apartment. <br>\r\n\"Hey guys, where's my girl? How did she do?\" Gwen peaked into the apartment as she followed the door opening.<br>\r\nGwen saw Michael standing and the back of a woman's head on the couch. <br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. Is this a bad time?\" She asked.<br>\r\nChris immediately got off the couch. \"A bad time?\" He started to get loud. \"A BAD TIME? Does this look like it's a bad time?\" he continued to raise his voice as he got closer to Gwen.<br>\r\nGwen's eyes opened as widely as they could as she reallized that the woman turned out to be Chris.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Chris. You look amazing!\" She replied to his rants. \"Tell me everything they did? Did you ask for all this, or did they decide for you?\"<br>\r\nSteam was coming out of Chris' ears as Gwen tried to make light of the situation that had transformed Chis into looking like this beautiful creature.<br>\r\n\"Why would I ask for all this? Did you see my eyebrows? Did you notice how thin they are? Did you know I learned a new word today? ELECTROLYSIS!\" Chris fumed as he flaired his arms as he spoke. He took another swig of his beer bottle.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, you had electrolysis done? That's brave.\" She replied as she took a closer look.<br>\r\nMichael just stood there taking little sips of his beer watching the two \"females\" go at it.<br>\r\n\"I didn't know what electrolysis was, they don't explain it to you. They just think that a woman is going to know what that is, so they put it in a way that just sounds so normal.\" Chris explained and then changed his voice to a female's voice to impersonate one of the salon workers. \"We're just going to clean up those eyebrows a little and then we'll zap your upper lip a little so we won't have any problems.\" <br>\r\nGwen put on a conforting face. \"I'm sorry I bailed on you Chris. I had my secretary make the appointment and I guess I told her that I wanted the salon girls to take good care of you.\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they sure took good care of me alright.\" he added. \"Molly the eyebrow collector really waxed the shit out of me.\"<br>\r\nGwen chuckled as Chris glared at her. <br>\r\n\"Well look, Michael upped your take in the will so this will make up for that.' Gwen explained.<br>\r\n\"You're damn right it will.\" Chris took another swig of the beer.<br>\r\n\"I have some documents from work.\" She sat at the couch and opened up a folder that she had under her arm.<br>\r\nChris sat back down on the couch. Once again, both friends noticed how Chris sat properly as a woman.<br>\r\n\"By the way, where did you get the mini dress?\" She asked.<br>\r\nChris scoffed,\"The girls at the salon had heard that I was in an abusive relationship so they all pitched in for me. That's also why I got the \"Special treatment\". He added.<br>\r\nGwen's eyes opened widely again. \"Oh geez, I guess I may have mentioned something like that to my secretary and she must have explained that to the salon.\" Gwen explained.<br>\r\nChris shot a look at her again. Michael interupted. \"You said you have some documents?\"<br>\r\nGwen dug through her folder and pulled out a social security card, and a birth certificate. \"These are yours and for the driver's licence we'll have to go down and have our picture taken. I have you set up for a renewal so you won't have to take the test again.\" Gwen explained.<br>\r\nChris looked through the papers. It felt weird that this imaginary person had come to life and was now going to be him. He looked through everything and said, \"I can't wait until this is all over.\" He said as he looked down at the birth certificate. \"Wait a minute\" he said.<br>\r\nHe read the date on the line that read Date of Birth. His eyes grew! \"YOU MADE ME 21 YEARS OLD?\"<br>\r\nGwen got an embarrassed look. \"oh yeah, I meant to tell you that.\"<br>\r\n\"How could you do that to me? How can I play younger? This is nothing but a nightmare!\" Chris ranted again.<br>\r\n\"I was trying to fill everything out but then I got distracted by my secretary and I mistakenly hit the wrong date. So now Christina is 21 years old.\" Gwen explained.<br>\r\nChris covered his face. He couldn't believe how this started out as a little charade and was escalating into this extravagant hoax.<br>\r\nChris put all the papers together on the lap of his dress, \"Well, I was going to bring this up later, but I want to say this now. Tonight, we are telling your family at this dinner meet and greet that we are eloping. There isn't going to be a huge wedding! I'm not going to live like this for 6 months. I will get all glamoured up again when everyone meets us down at the city court house in six months from now and they watch us get....you know.\" Chris explained but couldn't come out and say married. \"But I'm not doing this full time.\" He continued to try and look tough but still looked very feminine in the process.<br>\r\nGwen said, \"I think I'm going to agree with you.\"<br>\r\nBoth guys turned their heads surprised by Gwen's reply. \"What?\" They said in unison.<br>\r\n\"I just got the order from work that  I am going to be shipped out to Washington DC for a month or longer, so there's no way we'd be able to keep up appearances and I wouldn't be there to coach you.\" She explained.<br>\r\nChris listened intently. \"Oh, I know your'e torn up about it babe.\" She said to Chris as she put her hand on his knee.<br>\r\nAs far as the salon goes, the one treatment of electrolysis might have gotten some hairs, but you really have to go for a few more treatments for it to take full effect. The eyebrows will grow back in if they were just waxed. I think this is too much and I won't be able to be there for you.\"<br>\r\nThe salon booked me another appointment, so I\"m just going to blow it off?\" Chris asked. <br>\r\n\"You want to go?\" Gwen asked<br>\r\n\"No, but everyone was pretty cool, oh and Jen was a big help.\" Chris added.<br>\r\nThe two just dismissed the Jen refference as a woman at the salon. <br>\r\n\"Well, we'll get back in touch with them before the wedding and have this done again, meanwhile after tonight, you can get back into your jeans and smelly tshirts.\" She explained.<br>\r\nChris smiled from ear to ear. This was a good plan. He would just have to get through the one night now passing as a woman and then starting tomorrow he was back to his old male self. Of course it would take awhile before his face returned to normal and his hair needed a good cut, but at least he didn't have to pretend anymore.<br>\r\n\"When do you leave for Washington?\" Michael asked Gwen.<br>\r\n\"I leave tomorrow night, so my husband and I are going out for the day. Work gave me the whole day off, so I will not be around. So I guess this is goodbye for awhile guys.\" Gwen said.<br>\r\nBut first....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night of the party was here. Gwen, Chris and Michael all practiced how and what they were going to say for a couple of hours at their apartment. They got everything down pact, from the moment of arrival to kissing everyone goodnight.<br>\r\nChris was trained some more in proper women posture, and speech. His smile and how happy he looked to everyone. That was the most important.<br>\r\nAnother important features which wasn't covered that much the first outting, but really needed to shine here was chemistry. Chris and Michael both practiced how to stand together, hold each other and yes even kiss.<br>\r\nThey weren't passionate kisses of course. They wanted this to be believable but not over the top make out sessions.<br>\r\nMicheal practiced how to peck close to Chris' lips so not to mess up Chris' makeup and how to have Chris' reaction to the kiss, like it was the best feeling and how Christina looked to be so much in love with Michael. <br>\r\nThey decided to keep their hands locked for most of the time, that would show how close they are and also show to Michael's family that maybe Christina was a little shy.<br>\r\nThey pulled up to the fancy restaurant and vallet held the door open for Michael who was wearing a nice suit. Another parking attendent opened Chris' door.<br>\r\nChris slid his legs out of the car first and by that time Michael had come around to lend his hand and have Christina close to Micheal. Christina pulled her purse on her shoulder. They locked arms and walked to the door.<br>\r\n\"God, this is so uncomfortable man.\" He whispered, but still smiled as he gripped Michael's arm. Micheal was bigger, more muscular and taller than Michael and at this moment Chris really felt smaller.<br>\r\n\"Just keep walking, we're almost at the door.\" Michael whispered back.<br>\r\n\"It just feels like a million peope are staring at me.\" Chris continued.<br>\r\n\"It's all in your head man. You look just like a woman and that's exactly what everyone is looking at. You'll be fine once we get a few drinks.\"<br>\r\nChris pulled open the door and released his arm around Chris' arm and let Chris enter the resturant first.<br>\r\nIt was a beautiful steak house. Very fancy. It was close to their home but definitely not a place that they would stop at. It looked like a burger alone would cost $25. Chris became well aware of his heel clomping on the marble floor.<br>\r\nRight away Michael's father met them. <br>\r\n\"Hello again you two.\" Michael Sr kissed Christina on the cheek and gave her a hug and shook Michael's hand. Christina opened her purse and returned Michael Sr's credit card as Christina thanked him for the day at the spa. <br>\r\n\"You look so beautiful!\" He commented.<br>\r\n\"Everyone is here, we're just waiting for you. Gwen also just got here.\" He explained as they walked towards the back and into a low lighted aread. The area had a long table and at that table were about 25-30 people.<br>\r\nChris was blown away, he couldn't believe that so many of MIchael's family came out for the meeting of Michael's fiancee. \"He bashfully waved to the whole table.<br>\r\nMichael on the other hand dove right into the room and gave hugs to his aunts and uncles and cousins. He realized that he left Chris at the door opening but his father had already grabbed Christina's hand. He pulled her to the front of the table and clingged his fork onto his glass of water.<br>\r\n\"Everyone! Please take a moment and help me introduce Michael's beautiful fiancee to the family. We've had a rough time lately with the passing of grandma, and it hasn't been an easy time for anyone. But once we learned about Michael's engagement we decided to turn this around and celebrate the newest family member. This future Mrs. McCarthy. Christina!!\" He finished his toast.<br>\r\nThe whole table clapped. Some women got up immediately and gave Chris hugs and looked at Chris' engagement ring., as did a lot of the guys. <br>\r\nChris thought, \"I guess Gwen was right to have the nails done because everyone's looking at the hand with the ring.\"<br>\r\nFrom that point on the night moved and Chris' head was spinning. He was introduced to a dozen aunts and uncles and then cousins. There was no way he was going to remember all thos names.<br>\r\nMichael kept him with a beer in his hand at all times. It helped, but Chris still watched how much he drank. He didn't want to get smashed and say or do anything stupid, so he stayed slightly buzzed.<br>\r\nDinner also helped keep Chris' buzz to a minimum. He sat at the head of the table next to Michael and Gwen and seating next to  Michael's parents.<br>\r\nAfter dinner seats were traded. Chris, Michael and Gwen basically sat in the same seats as others had made their way over to the couple for small talk.<br>\r\nMany relatives asked where Chris grew up and went to school and what she did. Chris thought, \"It was good we talked about all this before we got here\" <br>\r\nGwen knew family would ask a lot of questions so they made a back story for Christina as far as what town, and school  she attended. <br>\r\nChris bartended some nights he hated it because the bar patrons really didn't tip the guys so well. They thought about it before hand and thought that was a fitting job for Christina also, so they just kept it the same.<br>\r\nAll in all Michael's fiancee, Christina was a hit. The family did seem disappointed about the couple decision in getting married at the local courthouse, but everyone understood that the new couple didn't want to make a big deal out of things. Chris was the most glad. That meant his time as Christina would only be tonight and then in another 6 months. Then they would all be rich! The plan was going great!<br>\r\nThe night was wearing down, many relatives had left and only a few remained. Chris was talking to Micheal's mother who was asking if she could at least come and visit to take her wedding gown shopping.<br>\r\n\"Oh that would be lovely.\" Gwen added, adding a few more shots at Chris' already pain.<br>\r\nHe shot her a look.<br>\r\n\"Aw mom. Even though I would love that. Gwen is going to take good care of me as my Maid of Honor.\" Chris explained.<br>\r\n\"I understand sweetheart.\" Michael's mother replied. She did seem disappointed about it.<br>\r\nGwen saw this and interupted. \"Well, how about as we're making a decision, we send you picture updates as she's trying on the dresses.\"<br>\r\nChirs shot another look at Gwen \"Yes, we'll do that for you mom.' Said Chris.<br>\r\nThe night had come to an end and Chris thought, \"The torture is over.\"<br>\r\nThe two roommates unlocked the aprtment door and walked into their house.<br>\r\nThey did a quick celebration dance but realized how tired they both were.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to bed\" Chris said. \"This has been a long day, and I'd like to just forget everyting.\" He continued.<br>\r\n\"Well man, I do appreciately you doing that for me. We're going to thave a lot of money once this is all over. Thank you again for doing this.\" He finished up.<br>\r\n\"No problem man.\" Chris replied. \"I hope we're sleeping in cause I'm not setting my alarm.\" Chris continued.<br>\r\nHe walked into his room and shut the door.<br>\r\nHe plopped on the bed, still in the mini dress and full face makeup.<br>\r\n\"I'll just worry about it in the morning.\" He thought. \"I'm really beat\" <br>\r\nHis mind raced a little but all in all he was happy that this was over. He passed the test. He could pass as a woman and they were going to be rich.<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and was out.<br>\r\nThe phone was ringing in the house. Chris opened his eyes dazed and confused. He looked around for his phone but couldn't find it. He realized that it was the landline in the other room.<br>\r\nHe groggilly dragged himself out of bed and into the other room. He passed the clock and noticing that it was 10 am.<br>\r\nHe got to the phone and picked it up.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris pulled his long hair back and put the phone up to his ear. In a raspy, broken up voice he said, \"Hello?\" into the receiver.<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm looking to speak with Michael McCarthy, is he at home?\" The woman on the other end of the phone asked.<br>\r\n\"Hang on\" Chris replied as he cupped the phone, \"Miiichael, phone.\" Chris couldn't believe how much his throat hurt. He grabbed at his throat. He thought back at the night before and how he talked in a high pitch all night and plus all the drinks, he much have hurt his vocal cords because now without really even trying, he sounded like Christina<br>\r\nHe heard no reponse so he walked to Michael's bedroom door and pushed it open, but there was no one in there and his bed was made.<br>\r\nChris spoke back into the phone, \"He's not at home right now. Can I take a message\" He couldn't believe how soft and feminine his voice was.<br>\r\n\"Is this Michael's fiancee?\" The woman on the phone asked.<br>\r\nChris pulled the phone away from his ear and mouthed \"OH SHIT\" before finally regaining his composure and bringing the phone back to his lips to speak.<br>\r\nThis time before he spoke, he cleared his throat the best that he could and sounded more pleasant. <br>\r\n\"Why, yes it is. Who am I speaking with?\" He asked in a still raspy but whispery female voice.<br>\r\n\"This is Jill Parks I have been asigned to the estate settlement for Michael's grandmother Estelle, how are you today?\" Jill asked in a confident one word sentence.<br>\r\nChris tried to take in the information Jill had just given to him, \"I'm fine, thanks. What is this concerning?\"<br>\r\n\"As I've said, I've been asigned to the case of Estelle's estate. I know the terms that were requested in the will and I know that they pertain to Michael and clearly you are his fiancee, so I am to assume that you and Michael are going forward to marry within the six month time frame and receive the full inheritance as stated in Michael's grandmother's will?\" she asked.<br>\r\nChris swallowed hard. Having all this thrown at him after waking up only minutes before, he had to think hard about this. He didn't want to mess this up.<br>\r\n\"Yes, we are going to be married in about 5 1/2 months.\" He said.<br>\r\nHe heard Jill write something on paper as she listened. \"Ahh, ok, very good  Can you please state your full name for me?\" Jill again asked.<br>\r\nChris replied slowly, \"Christina Mullens.\"<br>\r\n\"Excellent, now that will be in early July then I'm guessing? Beautiful backless gowns feel so wonderful in the summer heat, and is there a date set yet?\" She continued.<br>\r\nChris paniced. He didn't have a date set but he had to say something to this woman so that this would all seem believable to her.<br>\r\n\"Yes, July 4th weekend.\" Chris painfully answered while freaking out around the room. He watched his dress fly about as he realized he was still wearing it.<br>\r\n\"Very nice, ok.\" Jill replied.<br>\r\nChris was getting a little frustrated and frankly to him it felt like the woman was harrassing him for information.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what is your job again? Why do you need this information?\" Chris asked with a sort of attitude now.<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, I have been asigned to see that all of Estelle's holdings go to it's rightful owner, this is an extremely large amount of money and before the full sum get handed over to Michael and yourself, we have to make sure that there is no wrong doing here and that everything is on the up and up. It is my job to see to it that this isn't a scam.\" explained Jill<br>\r\nChris listened intently and got a chill after that was all explained.<br>\r\nHe didn't say anything he was still processing everything.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Christina? Are you still there?\" Jill asked.<br>\r\nChris came out of his trance. \"Yes, I'm sorry I'm here, I was making tea\" Chris walked to the kitchen and banged the teapot on the sink to sound like he was doing just that.<br>\r\nNothing phased Jill as she continued  with her grilling. \"Now Christina have you started on any wedding plans as of yet?\"<br>\r\nChris again paniced. \"Well, we were starting and then we had Micheal's grandmother pass, and then we were going to start again once everything got back to normal, so we're just again starting.\" Chris explained.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you had to stop, but it's exciting to be able to start again, and with that kind of time frame you're going to have to plan fast. Halls can get sold out fast, gowns will take time to hem, along with the bridesmade dresses, picking out a DJ, a photographer, it can all be such a whirlwind for a young bride like yourself. You should get a wedding planner.\" Jill explained all the while making Chris more panicky.<br>\r\nHe felt like an elephant was sitting on his chest as she spoke. This woman was making him freak out but not letting him get a word in.<br>\r\nFinally he butted in. \"Michael and I have decided that we are going to elope, so all this talk about halls, and bridemaids don't apply to us. We thought it would be less stressfull and then we were going to talk about starting a family.\" Chris explained feeling like he was really sticking it to this woman, Chris thought. \"Who was she to call up and ask all about our lives and what exactly we were planning.\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, then am I to believe that you have decided NOT to get Estelle's full inheritence?\" Jill asked surprised.<br>\r\nChris was confused for a second, \"Well I thought Michael would receive the full inheritence if he was married within 6 months and married for another 6 months after that.\" Chris continued. <br>\r\n\"Oh that's not entirely true. Yes, you have to be married in 6 months and live together married for another 6 months, so the inheritence wouldn't actually be Michael's until about a year from now.\" Jill had repeated what Chris had stated to her.<br>\r\n\"Ok?\" Chris replied puzzled.<br>\r\n\"But, the will states that the bride that Michael chooses has to have a planned wedding ceremoney, with most if not all of the family in attendance. WIth bridesmaids, First dances, pictures,  and with a reception to foloow, finally at least a weekend getaway as husband and wife.\"Jill said.<br>\r\nChris was in shock and stood holding the phone with a frozen expression.<br>\r\n\"It says all that?\" Chris asked<br>\r\n\"Indeed Christina, it says a lot more. I'm going to make copies and then send them over by courier today. Once you receive them then we can make our plans.\" Jill said.<br>\r\n\"make our plans?\" Chris asked <br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to be there and be a part of all this so that I can keep records of everything. Consider me, the wedding planner's wedding planner. I'll be in touch.\" Jill hung up the phone.<br>\r\nChris stood in shock.<br>\r\nOver on Jill's end of the phone, she hung up the receiver, only it wasn't Jill. It was Stacy who had just called Chris and scared him to death. Jen was right next to her as they both had a good laugh.<br>\r\nThey were in Jen's doctor's office making the call.<br>\r\n\"You were perfect!\" Jen said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I think I really freaked him out.\" Stacy replied. \"You sure we're going to have time to do this before Gwen comes back?\" <br>\r\n\"Gwen won't return for about a month if not longer, this is the last thinkg that's on her mind. As far as she knows Chris and Michael are going to elope so there's nothing for her to race back here for. Meanwhile, that will be just enough time to get Chris started on some wedding plans and his path into womanhood.\" She explained.<br>\r\nStacy thought a minute. \"But what if he's calling Gwen right now? Aren't you worried he'll explain things to her and we'll have no time for anything?\" <br>\r\nJen picked up Chris' phone that she had taken from his spa day. She turned it on and opened it to \"Contacts\" And then dialed \"Home\"<br>\r\n\"That is why I'm going to call him now,\"<br>\r\nChris heard the home phone ring again. He hadn't moved much after hanging up, he was still trying to take the conversation he just had in.<br>\r\nHe picked up the receiver and put it by his ear again. \"Hello?\" Again he spoke in a cherry female voice.<br>\r\n\"Hey salon buddy! It's Jen!\" She said as she looked at Stacy and gave her a thumb's up.<br>\r\nChris went into panic mode again and talked in his regular, still raspy voice. \"OH my God Jen, you'll never believe what just happened. I'm in such big trouble. I don't know what to do. I'm going to need some help.\"<br>\r\n\"Slow down, what happened?\" Jen said<br>\r\n\"A woman from Michael's grandmother's estate called, I think she's a lawyer. She is going to make sure that we're doing nothing wrong and that we'll get married in accordance to the will. They want us to have a church wedding and dresses and the works!\" Chris explained in a panic. \"What am I going to do? You gotta help me!\" He pleaded.<br>\r\nJen covered the phone as Chris talked to keep from laughing. <br>\r\nThen she came back on the line and said...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Will you be calm?\" Jen asked.<br>\r\nChris sighed and caught his breath as he began to breath normal again. \"Yes, I'm calm, go ahead.\" He replied.<br>\r\n\"Now this first part, we'll call this the good news\" She started.<br>\r\n\"Oh God, there's bad news?\" Chris started again.<br>\r\nJen sighed,\"Chris, you promised.\" She waited until Chris relaxed again.<br>\r\nChris was silent again. \"Sorry\" was his reply.<br>\r\n\"Ok, the good news about this is that everything is fine, we're going to be fine. Right now, no one suspects anything, right? As far as this estate woman knows, Michael and his fiancee will be married in 6 months and then they will live together for another 6 months after the wedding as they already do and then they will receive the inheritance. There's nothing to worry about, we have all the paperwork that backs up Christina Mullens existence and so far there are no red flags for the estate people to question. Sounds good, right?\" Jen explained trying to ease Chris' mind in the beginning and make it sound like there will be nothing to worry about. <br>\r\nStacy listened to Jen talk to Chris and work her magic. She high fived her as she talked and a few times the two women tried to cover their laughter.<br>\r\nJen put her hand up and made the \"calm down\" sign with her hands.<br>\r\n\"Chris, are you still with me?\" She asked.<br>\r\nChris cleared his throat, \"Yes.\" <br>\r\n\"Ok, now the bad news.\" Jen started again. \" Remember your plan of Christina disappering after Michael's family dinner and not reappearing for 6 months?\"<br>\r\n\"yeah?.\" Chris replied lightly into the phone.<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not going to happen. Christina has to be in the picture and I'm afraid she has to be in the picture more than we planned.\" Jen said while smiling at Stacy.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Chris asked hesitantly.<br>\r\nJen covered the phone trying not to reveal her big smile as she explained this to Chris. If she wanted to sell Chris on this, she had to show the emotion and conpassion and sympathy to what she was about to explain to him.<br>\r\n\"Christina has to be a full time woman, ...you, are going to have to be...a full time woman for us to pull this off.\" She explained.<br>\r\nChris looked down at his body still wearing the dress from the night before. \"What are you saying?\" Chris asked.<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to make you a passable woman and hire a wedding planner. How much money do you have in savings?\" jen asked.<br>\r\n\"Uhh, I guess roughly $8,000.\" Chris replied.<br>\r\n\"Good, we're going to need it. Just remember, anything you spend will be fine because when all this is over. You're looking a lot of millions.\" She continued.<br>\r\n\"Why do we need the money.\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"In order to pull this off, we need to make weekly salon appointments, a new female wardrobe, makeup, a wedding gown, a reception.\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"Oh God!\" was all Chris could say. <br>\r\n\"Let me ask you this? Do you want to call this whole thing off now and walk away from this?\" She asked.<br>\r\nChris paused trying to think about the question. He knew they were already in this deep by starting this charade, the false papers and identity and him masquarading as a woman. He knew they already have gone pretty far, but he wasn't sure just how much further they should take this.<br>\r\n\"Well now I'm starting to get scared. I haven't really thought about it until now and all this stuff you're talking about plus I'm going to be watched by some estate woman...I'm not sure I can do that.\" He replied.<br>\r\n\"I need to know right now if we're going forward with this and make you a millionare or forget it all and get out while we can.\" She replied.<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I should talk to Michael.\" Chris replied nervously.<br>\r\n\"No Chris, we need to figure this out right here and now if were going forward with this. We have a lot of work to do if we're doing this, and I\"m going to have to make some phone calls to get us started. I need to know.\" She explained.<br>\r\nChris went into panic mode and didn't know what to do, he paced as they talked and his mind raced. He passed by a mirror that was in the hall and saw that he was still in full Christina makeup and his hair with all the hairspray and products in it held together pretty good. He stared deeply at his reflection. \"Be a woman full time?\" He thought.<br>\r\n\"I can't do this. I'm going to bow out now.\" He said quietly. <br>\r\nHe explected Jen to give some kind of reply or maybe another discussion but stood in shock as Jen's only word was, \"Ok.\" and then hung up the phone.<br>\r\nStacy also was shocked that Jen did this. \"Oh my God, what happened? He said no?\"<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" She replied smiling.<br>\r\n\"Well that didn't go the way I thought it would. I thought you said we were going to be millionares.\" She replied.<br>\r\nJen put the phone down on the table. \"We will be.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"But he quit. He's not going through with it, so that's it, isn't it?\" Stacy asked.<br>\r\nJust then Chris' phone buzzed again. The caller ID showed that it was Michael's home number which meant that it was Chris calling back.<br>\r\nJen put her finger up for Stacy to be quiet and she answered the phone.<br>\r\n\"Hello, Christina's phone\" Stacy giggled a little as Jen cupped the phone hopping Chris didn't hear her.<br>\r\n\"Hi Jen.\" Chris said lightly. He sighed.<br>\r\n\"What exactly do we have to do? <br>\r\nJen smiled, \"I'm so glad you called back Chris, everything is going to be alright.\" Jen replied trying to sound sympathetic to the situation. \"This is what he have to do.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jen and Stacy were still at Jen's office finalizing their plans. Stacy was going to dress formal with buisness suit and all and appear to be the estate lawyer Jill Parks. She was going to make a surprise visit at Michael's and Chris' house later tonight. Jen was trying to prove to Chris that he had to always stay in his feminine role as Christina Mullens and this was a good way to do that.<br>\r\n\"I'll talk to you later.\" Stacy said as she walked to the office door and walked out of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill was by the main reception desk and was approached by one of the other doctors that were in her practice.<br>\r\n\"Hi Jen. It looks like we have a full bill today. Mrs. Farrow is coming in for her nose job you have her scheduled on your roster for 2 pm. The first of our transgender women will be coming by to start on her hormone recplacement treatment, I can take care of that. Dr. Mack also has a transgender woman on her roster who was supposed to get her throat shave and vocal surgery might not have it done so soon because she is performing this week and wants to look her best. Not sure what that means, but, ok\" The doctor explained.<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right.\" Jen replied looking at the time. It was only 12 so she had some time to run her errands.<br>\r\n\"I am going to run out and pick up some things for a friend. I will be back in time for Mrs. Farrow, but if she does come early and I'm not back yet, just have one of the nurses prep her and get her numb. I should be here shortly after.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\n\"Ok\" Said the other doctor as Jen walked out of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made it to her car and reached in her purse for her car keys, she felt Chris' cell phone buzzing. She looked down at the caller ID and saw that it was Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly grabbed some tissues that were in her purse and wadded them up. She put them over the reciever and answered the call.<br>\r\nIn a muffled deep voice she only said, \"yeah?\"<br>\r\nMichale laughed on the other end, \"Dude, did I wake you?\" <br>\r\nAgain she spoke muffled, \"yeah\"<br>\r\n\"Aww, man I'm sorry. I guess after last nights performance you've earned a good nights sleep, and now we don't have to worry about your disguise for another 6 months. I just wanted to tell you that I went with my parents to my grandmother's house. My mom wanted to go through some things in the attic and get the house straightened. I'm going to take the rest of the week of my berevement leave from work and help them out. I should be back later this week.<br>\r\nJen's eyes widened, and she put one arm in the air in triumph.<br>\r\n\"Uh huh\" She muffled into the phone again.<br>\r\n\"See ya buddy\" and then Michael hung up.<br>\r\nJen unlocked the car door of her Lexus and started it up. She thought, \"This is going so much better than planned.\"<br>\r\nShe dialed Michael and Chris' apartment number.<br>\r\nIt rang a few times until Chris finally answered in a nasaly, raspy voice.\"Hi Jen.\"<br>\r\n\"Hi Christina.\" Jen jabbed at Chris. <br>\r\n\"Ha ha\" He replied.<br>\r\n\"Did you take a shower yet, wait...why do you sound nasaly?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, since I started doing the Christina voice it's really been sore a lot more and now I think my alergies are acting up.\" Chris explained.<br>\r\n\"Well that sucks,  ok just come to my office downtown at around 2ish and I'll take care of you. RIght now, I'm going out to buy you a few wardrobes.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"I fogot you were a doctor. Hey, but why do I need a few wardrobes?\" Chris whinned.<br>\r\n\"Because silly, a woman can't be seen in the same outfit a few days in a row. You're going to need a bigger wardrobe. I'll spring for the first few and shoes, but you or MIchael are going to have to buy the rest.\"<br>\r\nChris sighed in the phone.<br>\r\n\"Ughh, this is going to be so expensive.\" Chris again whinned.<br>\r\n\"Well, sweetheart, get used to it cause Christina needs a lot of stuff.\" Jen replied \"Now did you shower?\"<br>\r\nChris looked down at his body which was covered by a towel along with another towel wrapped around his head. \"Yeah I just got out.\"  he said.<br>\r\n\"Ok, dress in the same jeans and blouse like you did that day of the salon and then come down to my office around 2, then wait for me while I finish up a patient and then we have an appointment with a friend of mine.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"What kind of appointment/\" Chris asked <br>\r\n\"Well, as it turns out..you and Michael are really late with wedding plans, so a friend of mine has agreed to help you get caught up to where you're supposed to be on your wedding checklist with only 6 months left.\" She explained.<br>\r\nJen could hear Chris sighn on the phone again. \"Look just be at my office by 2 ok and we'll take it from there.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll see you then\" He replied.<br>\r\n\"And remember, work on your voice.\" She replied as she smiled and hung up the phone.<br>\r\nChris hung up the phone and went back into the bathroom.<br>\r\nHe removed the towel off of his head and let his platinum blonde dyed hair fall to his shoulders. He blew his hair dry and combed through it as he did.  It was really easy to do. After he got it somewhat dry he pulled his hair back and tied it in a high ponytail.<br>\r\nHe looked in the mirror at his hair and face. With the work that they did at the salon, his eyebrows thinned and high dyed, without makeup he still had a woman's face.<br>\r\nBelow his neck though he was still male. <br>\r\n\"Well, I better get a move on.\" He said as he picked up a bra that was on the bathroom counter and put it on. Inside the bra cups he put two of his socks. He undid the towel that was tucked and held around his waist and let it fall. He then did as Gwen showed him and \"concealed\" his penis. He pulled it between his legs and then took some padding that Gwen has given him and placed it over his penis. He ripped off a piece of medical tape and taped the padding between his legs. <br>\r\nNext he pulled up the pair of panties that Gwen left him. They matched the bra which was a plain white style.<br>\r\nHe finished getting dressed by buttoning the blouse and then pulling up the pair of women's jeans. Now not only was his face looking female, his body was matching.<br>\r\nHe slipped on a pair of sandals that were by the bathroom counter.<br>\r\nHe looked in the mirror and sighed. \"Six more months of this.\" <br>\r\nHe looked down at the bathroom counter and saw all the makeup that was there. He started on his face, just like Gwen had shown him. <br>\r\nAfter about 45 minutes, once again Christina Mullens' reflection stared back to Chris.<br>\r\nChris stood there and looked at himself. He couldn't believe the perdicament he was in. He was going to be stuck like this for the next 6 months. He did have to admit, even though he had no desire to be a woman. He sure did make a convincing one.  He even laughed at how he looked at himself from different angles in the mirror, just like a woman.<br>\r\nHe practiced saying his name in his female voice. <br>\r\n\"Christina Mullens, Christina. Hi, I'm Christina. Hi I'm Michael's wife Chrisina.\" He held out his engagement ring and long nails to the mirror,\"Yes, we just got engaged. We're getting married in 6 months.\" He repeated the same dialog over and over again. <br>\r\nAfter awhile he got bored with that, and sat and watched a little bit of tv. Time just wasn't moving that fast and when he looked, he realized he still had over an hour to go before he was meeting Jen.<br>\r\n\"God I'm bored\" he thought. \"I gotta get out of here.\"<br>\r\nSeeing that Jen's office was just downtown near the salon where they worked on him, he could walk. He had nothing else to do so he decided to leave now even though Jen still wouldn't arrive there for another hour.<br>\r\nHe locked the apartment and walked onto the sidewalk.<br>\r\nHe put a little sway in his walk like he was shown. He did feel more confident being in jeans than in a dress. It just felt better because he was used to the jeans and the dress was so foreign to him.<br>\r\nAfter about a 10 minute walk he reached the doctor's office where Jen worked.<br>\r\nHe walked in and saw the reception area. He picked up a Woman's Day magazine on a rack off the wall and sat down with it. He crossed his legs like a woman and flipped through.<br>\r\nThe receptionist looked out into the waiting area and saw Jen, just as one of the doctor's noticed Chris too.<br>\r\n\"Who's that out there?\" <br>\r\nThe receptionist took another look at the woman in the reception area,\"Well, it isn't Mrs. Farrow so it has to be...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The receptionist slid open the waiting room window and peeked out. \"Hi, can I help you?\" she asked in a sweet voice.<br>\r\nChris looked up from his magazine and said in his Christina voice. \"HI, Dr. Jen told me to meet her here, I'm a little early though. I was a little hesitant to come early, but I'll just sit here and read some magazines until she gets here. She's got something she was going to give me, a shot maybe.\" Christina explained.<br>\r\nThe receptionist smiled and the Dr who was listening in the back butted in and poked her head through the window.<br>\r\n\"Actually sweetheart, you're with me today. I'm going to start you on your shots. You can come on back.\" she said.<br>\r\nChris put the magazine back on the rack, and hesitantly made his way to the back room.<br>\r\nHe followed the Dr to one of the rooms.<br>\r\nAs they entered, she patted the top of the examination table and told Chris to have a seat.<br>\r\nChris sat down, but still very nervous. \"Are you sure this is ok? Jen told me she would take care of me.\" He spoke in his Christina voice.<br>\r\nThe doctor smiled at Chris. \"You have nothing to worry about, Jen told us all about you and that you were coming.\"<br>\r\n\"Everything? So you know?....you know about me?, Chris asked.<br>\r\nThe doctor smiled again. \"Yes, we know.\" She continued to talk as she prepared some things on a table. She had a file chart opened too.\" I have to say, you do make a very convincing woman.\"<br>\r\nChris was kind of relieved that he didn't really have to keep up the womanly mannerisms,  but at the same time he was also a little pissed that Jen had told some people that she works with. \"I don't want everyone to know\" He thought.<br>\r\nThe doctor turned around and faced Chris. \"Can you remove your clothes please and put on the gown right here? I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\nShe said as she left the examination room.<br>\r\nChris raised an eyebrow and thought this was kind of weird. \"Why am I getting undressed and in an examination gown for an allergy shot? Dr's do everything the hard way.\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\nHe sighed and once again undressed. He placed everything neatly in a pile next to him and then he put on the green surgical gown. The back was open but he tied it shut and sat back down on the examination table.<br>\r\nHe stared at everything around the room. He saw the typical Dr office things. There were syringes, tongue depressers and all sorts of Dr things. One big syringe stood out. It was the one she was getting ready while talking to him. She had placed it on top of the file that she walked into the room with. <br>\r\n\"I wonder if that's my file.\" He thought. \"But why would I have a file?\" He leaned off the examination table a little to see if he could see the name on the file, but just as he was looking, the Dr reentered the room.<br>\r\n\"That's great!\" the doctor saw that Chris put the surgical gown on and was again seated. She picked up the file and pen and stood in front of Chris.<br>\r\n\"Now, have you taken anything else? This is your first shot, correct?\" She asked.<br>\r\nChris nodded and spoke in his male raspy voice. \"Yes, I'm not on any pills.\" <br>\r\nShe wrote down on the file.<br>\r\n\"..and you're health has been good?\" She asked.<br>\r\nChris nodded again, \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n\"..and are you a smoker? <br>\r\n\"No, I'm not.\" Chris replied.<br>\r\nThe Dr grabbed a tongue depressor and asked Chris to open his mouth. \"Your throat is very red, and you sound like its scratchy. You haven't had any work done, to your throat or vocal cords, have you? <br>\r\nChris thought that was a weird question, but did put his hands up to his throat. \"My throat is really sore and scratchy, I think it's from a mix of perfecting my female voice and a mix of alergies acting up.\"<br>\r\nThe Dr again wrote into the file. \"DR Mack's patient was a no call/no show today, I can have him look at your throat, see if he can take care of the problem, then you wouldn't strain your vocal cords anymore and everything would sound natural.\" The Dr explained.<br>\r\nChris thought about it, \"He could make it so it wouldn't hurt anymore making the voice?\" <br>\r\nThe Dr nodded again. \"Yes, the whole prceedure would take a few hours and then you'd have a day or two of minimal pain. After that, you would sound wonderful.\"<br>\r\nChris again thought out loud. \"That would be great to not have this pain everytime I made the voice, but I really don't think I have time today. Can I make an appointment for another day?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"Definitely. You're going to have to come back for more checkup and another shot. I can schedule you again and maybe we can kill two birds with one stone.\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"That would be great!\" Chris replied.<br>\r\nThe doctor continued asking Chris more questions, some were a little strange he thought. Then she got into a full blown conversation about feeling better after the shots and how he would probably mellow out and he might feel a little sick at first. She comforted him and told him it was all normal. She brought up changes in his body but at this point Chris was tired of hearing about some stupid allergy shot and finally she closed the folder and set it back down. Chris saw that it was about an hour later.<br>\r\n\"Ok, the nurse will be here in a few moments, and she'll give you the shot.\" She held out her hand and shook Chris. \"It was a pleasure meeting you, I'll have your medication perscription and next appointment card ready for you at reception. I'll see you soon, and congratulations!\" She said as she walked out of the examination room.<br>\r\nChris again made a puzzled face. \"This is the strangest doctor's office I've ever seen.\" He mimiced the doctor. \"Congratulations! Congratulations on your allergy shot! Happy allegy shot\" He continued to mock until he made himself laugh.<br>\r\nThe examination door opened again and in walked a middle aged woman in a floral top. She was the nurse who was probably going to give him the shot.<br>\r\nShe smiled and said, \"Hi\"<br>\r\nSHe walked right over to the table and looked at the chart. She picked up the syringe and took the cap off of the needle.<br>\r\n\"Could  you stand up and then lift the gown up and bend over please?\" She asked.<br>\r\nChris did as she asked. He faced the wall and hiked up the surgical gown so that his rear was facing her. <br>\r\nThe nurse took the needle and plunged it into Chris' hip and pushed the contents of the needle into him.<br>\r\n\"There we go, you can get dressed now and you should be feeling better right away.\" The nurse said as she took his file and the needle and walked out again.<br>\r\n\"Damn\" Chris thought. He wanted to see what the Dr was writing in the file. He was hoping she would leave it. Chris started to get dressed.<br>\r\nMeanwhile out in the reception area Jen walked through the door and up to the receptionist.<br>\r\n\"Hi, did Mrs. Farrow come in?\" Jen asked.<br>\r\nThe receptionist nodded, \"She is here and waiting for you in your main office.\" She replied.<br>\r\n\"Oh good, thank you.\", She started towards the back and she ran into the doctor that just took care of Chris.<br>\r\n\"Hi Jen, did you get your errends taken care of?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"I did. Did any of our transgender patients come in?\" Jen asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I just finished with her. She is a beautiful woman already, and I gave her the first shot of her female hormones. I can't wait to see her body develop. I'm just getting her perscription ready and I'm sending her on her way. Mrs. Farrow is in your office waiting for you to start.\" She explained.<br>\r\nThats great!\" Jen said as she entered her office.<br>\r\nJust as she closed the door, Chris opened the door of his examination room and walked out dressed again in his female jeans and blouse.<br>\r\nHe walked to the receptionist and she gave him his perscription. It had a lot of scribbled things on it that Chris couldn't make out and an appointment card which was for next week. <br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Chris said and then sat back in the waiting room..<br>\r\nChris realized he didn't have his purse and Jen had made it a point to him to look as passable as possible and he knew she would critique him for forgetting it. <br>\r\nHe left the Dr office and started walking back home.<br>\r\nWalking down the street he seemed to feel al ittle better. He could breath a little better, but that wasn't really it, he felt happier for some reason. <br>\r\nHe was a little tired thought. <br>\r\nA few minutes later he reached his apartment and unlocked the door. He walked in and saw the purse Gwen had given him. and picked it up.<br>\r\nHe looked at the clock and saw that he still had a little time before he met Jen, so he was going to sit for awhile.<br>\r\nHe turned the tv on and sat on the couch. He took off his sandals and curled up on the couch. His hip was really sore from the shot, he thought.<br>\r\nThe next thing he knew, he fell asleep.<br>\r\nHe knew this because he was being woken up by someone knocking on the door. He was startled but got up. <br>\r\nHe remembered his female voice and got to the door. \"Who is it?\" Christina asked....</span></div></div>",

Along with the shot today, he was in a little pain.<br>\r\nJen fished through her purse and pulled out Chris' cell phone. <br>\r\n\"Here's your phone. Oh and there was a message from MIchael that he is staying with his parents at his grandmother's house for the week, he should be home towards the end of the week.\" Jen explained as she immediately began going through the bags that she brought over.<br>\r\n\"Does he know what's going on with the esate woman? Or me dressing as Christina full time?\" Chris asked.<br>\r\n\"No, cause he only left a message. Look, he'll find out soon enough. We've got everything under control here, I don't want him to panic.\" Jen explained trying to not have Chris call her brother about this.<br>\r\nShe quickly changed the subject back to the women's clothes. \"I kind of went overboard on some of the stuff, but it was just too good of a deal to pass up. I ended up getting you 10 pairs of underware. Both bras and panties. <br>\r\n\"Damn! That's a lot of underware.\" Chris was shocked by the number that Jen had bought.<br>\r\n\"You can never have enough panties.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\nChris rolled his eyes while Jen through something silky at Chris. This is for nighttime. <br>\r\nChris held the garment up to his body and saw that it was a purple satin nightgown. Holding it up, he saw that it only reached down to his knees. <br>\r\n\"It looks so small.\" Chris stated.<br>\r\n\"Well it's to wear to bed, so there really shouldn't be too much to it.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\n\"To bed?\" Why would I have to dress up going to bed?\" Chris asked puzzled.<br>\r\nJen stopped unloading the shopping bags and looked at Chris.<br>\r\n\"Chris, we've gone through this before. Our whole conversation the other night. Didn't you take any of that in? You have to play the part of a female for the next year. You never konw who is looking, or watching. Especially nosey lawyers who want to bust you on fraud and send you to jail.\" Jen threw that last line in to scare Chris a little.<br>\r\nChris' eyes did widen when she said that. He just put the garment in the pile with the rest of the clothes.<br>\r\nJen continued.\" OK, I ended up getting you 8 outfits, skirts and blouses, 2 dinner dresses, 1 mini dress. I got you 5 pairs of shoes. 2  are sandals, 2 heeled, and 1 pair of ladies sneekers. I got you 3 different purses. 1 is formal, the other two just to carry everyday stuff.\" Jen just continued to unload these never ending bags. She took out makeup cases, jewelry, ladies sunglasses, scrunchies for the hair, nail poish, perfume. Chris couldn't believe how much Jen bought.<br>\r\nJen pulled a garment out and held it up to Chris' body frame. \"This I absolutely love, we need to start using it everyday if we want to see any results. It's a corset. It's going to give your body that hourglass look. It's the real deal, not like those plastic insert ones. This one could really shape your body. In fact I want you to start on it tonight under your outfit.\"<br>\r\nChris looked at it. He's seen pictures of corsets before but it was definitely his first time holding one, let alone going to be wearing one. \"Oh man, I'm gonna hate this, it's so heavy!.\" he said.<br>\r\nHe looked over the piles of clothes and woman's accessories thrown all over the couch. \"This must have cost a fortune. I can't afford all this.\" Chris' response was.<br>\r\nJen grinded her teeth. She knew once this whole thing was over. Both Chris and her brother were going to be millionares. She thought to herself, \"Oh you can afford this.\"<br>\r\nBut said out loud, \"Just pay me back once you get the inheritence.\" She replied.<br>\r\nChris was still in awe of all the stuff but was quickly brought back with Jen rushing him.<br>\r\nShe picked up a pair of panties and matching bra and grabbed a skirt and a top and handed it to him. \"Comon, you gotta get changed, we have to go see my girlfriend. She's going to be your wedding planner, and she said we've got a lot of work to do.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\nChris was still a little tired and sore and made a whiny face and voice. \"I don't wanna change again. Can't I just wear what I have on?\" <br>\r\nJen gave Chris a look, \"Chris the whole neighborhood has seen that outfit twice within a days time. I think we're burning it after today. Lets get you in that corset.<br>\r\nJen had Chris strip and reluctantly he did right there.  Jen put the corset around his waist and Chris stood there feeling foolish.<br>\r\n\"This thing is really hot and heavy Jen, do I have to wear it.\" Chris whinned.<br>\r\n\"Oh God yes, better get used to it cause it's going to be worn everyday. Now hold still.<br>\r\nJen began to tighten the laces in the back. Chris could feel it constrict his breathing and he was really uncomfortable. <br>\r\n\"Jen, I can't do this, you gotta take it of.\" Chris said cringing for air.<br>\r\n\"If it's tight it means it's working. I need to get it a little tighter.<br>\r\nJen pulled the laces even tighter as Chris moved his body around to fit the position that Jen was placing it in with this thing on. His back was arched and because of the pain, Chris walked on his tip toes. His chest was pushed out and it did look like he had breasts up top.<br>\r\n\"Almost there.\" Jen said still pulling and tightening.<br>\r\nChris was just about to bust and finally Jen was satisfied that the corset was tight enough.<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" Was all Chris could get out. \"I can't function in this.\" He screamed. <br>\r\nJen noticed how Chris complained about the corset but also realized that he moved with a little more poise while he was tight inside the corset. She noticed how Chris stood on his tip toes because of the pain. She had an idea.<br>\r\n\"Hold still a minute. She dug through the pile of clothes and came to the boxes of shoes, she opened the boxes until she got to the pair that she wanted. Jen pulled out a pair of navy blue high heels and walked up to Chris' feet. Stop into these.<br>\r\nChris could barely look down but Jen guided his feet into the heels and tightened the strap across his foot. WIth the corset on and the hight heels she saw, that he was shapely and looked amazing.<br>\r\n\"See how your hips look shapely and your chest sticks out. You have a beautiful figure with this on. I think we lost a few inches.  I'm changing my mind with outfits, you're wearing the dress tongiht\" Jen explained as she handed Chris a matching navy blue dress and pushed him towards the bathroom.<br>\r\nChris angrilly grabbed the dress that Jen had handed to him and went into the bathroom.<br>\r\nJen sat on the couch and took out her Iphone. She glanced to see if Chris was coming and she quickly sent a text to Stacy.<br>\r\n\"Are you coming over, as Jill?\" She sent<br>\r\nAbout two minutes later Stacy sent a reply text. \"I'm parking the car now.\"<br>\r\nJen smiled<br>\r\n\"Jill\" the estate woman would accompany them to the wedding planner and Chris will freak out even more with how girly I'm going to make him and this wedding.\" Jen thougth to herself.<br>\r\nJen text back, \"Come to the door in exactly 10 minutes and knock.\"  \"OK\" Stacy text back.<br>\r\nJen got up and got a wine glass, she went to the fridge and poured herself a glass.<br>\r\nShe called into Chris, \"How are we doing Christina?\"<br>\r\nFrom the bathroom Chris once again whinned. \"I can't breath Jen.\"<br>\r\n\"You have to adjust your breathing in the corset, you'll get used to it. Just put the dress on and come out.\" Jen said.<br>\r\nA few minutes later Chris walked out of the bathroom. <br>\r\nJen couldn't believe her eyes. <br>\r\nChris' features, made him a beautiful woman , but now he had the body of a godess too. He had a beautiful hourglass figure thanks to the corset and it added to the illusion. She would train Chris body with the corset so that he would have a beautiful figure permanently by the time he put on a wedding gown. <br>\r\nJust then there was a knock on the door. Both Chris and Jen froze.<br>\r\nChris spoke in his womanly voice. \"Yes? Who's there.\" He said through the door.<br>\r\nThe voice on the other side of the door said, \"It's Jill Parks from the estate of Estelle.\" Stacy answered as Jill.<br>\r\nChris' eyes grew with fear. \"OH MY GOD!\" He mouthed to Jen.<br>\r\nJen acted scared also.<br>\r\nJen grabbed Chris' hands and whispered for him to relax.<br>\r\nChris couldn't breath as it was in this corset but now with the added pressure of Jill at the door, he was  mess.<br>\r\nJen quickly scooped most of the clothes up on the couch and put them back in the bags as she went along. She ran into the other room. When she came back in to grab some more clothes, she saw Chris still standing there. \"Well answer the door already.\" She said.<br>\r\nChris popped out of his trance just as Jen grabbed the last of the clothes and ran into the other room. Chris opened the door.<br>\r\nOn the other side was Stacy. She was dressed in a woman's buisness suit. She had on a pin and said her name, but in this case the pin read \"Jill\"<br>\r\nStacy extended her hand and shook Chris' hand.<br>\r\n\"Hi, I\"m Jill Parks and you must be the lovely bride to be Christina.\" Stacy explained.<br>\r\nChris shook her hand and put on his female voice, and said, \"Pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\nJen entered the room and immediately shook Stacy/Jill's hand \"Hi, Dr. Jen Reynolds. Nice to meet you. I hear you're going to tag along with these wedding plans so that everything is on the up and up, right.\" Jen said<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have to make sure that Christina and Chris are happilly married and not put up to do this, or forced into  a marriage that they didn't want.\" Stacy/Jill explained.<br>\r\nJen smiled, \"Well I\"ve known these two for awhile now and they are very happy together. As a matter of fact, we're on our way to the wedding planners buisness right now if you would like to join us.\" Jen said.<br>\r\n\"I would like that a lot,\" Stacy/Jill said. Chris's eyes went into shock as her heard that Jill was coming with them. <br>\r\n\"God help me\" Chris thought to himself as he grabbed his purse off the kitchen counter and walked out the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jen and Jill had sat at a table for 2 and 1/2 hours already. Christina started out sitting between the two women, but soon after had decided on standing.<br>\r\nOn top of the table were piles of pamphlets, and brochures and catalogs of different things a bride needed for DREAM WEDDING.  As a matter of fact, that happened to be the name of the company that was going to plan Christina and Michael's wedding. <br>\r\nIn front of the two women were patterns of table clothes, napkins, sitting on top of catalogs of local restraunts and halls that had wedding packages, next to those were catalogs of bridal gowns and tuxedos, and pamphlets for local bands or DJ's for wedding, and so on and so on and it just looked like a never ending pile of papers.<br>\r\nThe wedding planner was an older woman maybe in her late 40's. She just returned from the back room with even more brochures.<br>\r\nShe saw Christina standing behind Jen and Jill at the table. She noticed Christina's eyes were huge and she was bitting on her long French tip nail.<br>\r\n\"Darling, you shouldn't bite on such beautiful nails. You look so nervous. Why don't you come sit with the other women.\" The wedding planner asked?<br>\r\nJen and Jill turned around in their chairs and stared at Christina.<br>\r\nIt was true, Chris was in a trance because of the whirlwind of wedding activity in front of him. It was a lot to take in and it felt to him like he was having a nervous breakdown.  It wasn't a random person's bridal wedding that was being planned. It was <i>his</i> bridal wedding that was being planned. It hit him all at once that he was going to be a bride.<br>\r\nTwo other reasons caused Chris to not sit down. One was the shot he received in his hip earlier and the other reason was the corset that was constricting his breathing.<br>\r\n\"I'm good.\" Christina replied.<br>\r\nJen turned back around to the table. \"I think we have everything just about picked out anyway.\" She held up a restaraunt brochure for Christina to see. \"This is where we're having your reception.\" <br>\r\nChris got a quick glimpse at the restaraunt before Jen pulled it away and held up another brochure.<br>\r\n\"These are your wedding invitations\" <br>\r\nAgain Chris blinked and Jen had pulled the invitation sample away.<br>\r\nShe continued to rush through things that she had picked out for Christina's wedding. Chris was thankful though because he didn't really know patterns or anything about planning a wedding.<br>\r\nThe wedding planner had taken all the brochure's and pamphlets from Jen after she had shown Chris and placed them into a big binder.<br>\r\nOnce she showed Chris everything, the final brochure was placed into the binder. <br>\r\n\"I will keep this binder here for you and you can come in and look at it anytime you need to. We are up to date and the only thing we have to plan now is making an appointment to try on wedding gowns.\" The planer said.<br>\r\nChris' eyes bulged out like they did a lot lately. \"Already?\" He said out loud.<br>\r\nEveryone turned to look at Christina.<br>\r\n\"Well my darling, you do need to know what you will be walking down the aisle in. We will need to have it fitted and then maybe resized depending on how much your weight fluxuates in 5 months.\" The wedding planner explained.<br>\r\nJen tried to cover up what Christina blurted out.<br>\r\n\"What she means is that, we are in the process of getting Christina down a few sizes so she thought she had more time to fit into a gown.\" Jen said.<br>\r\n\"Oh darling, like I said we can make adjustments to the gown up to weeks before the wedding. It is my job to have everything perfect, and you, my dear are going to be a beautiful bride.\" The wedding planner said as she put her arms near Christina's waist.<br>\r\n\"Now what days are good for you my dear? The planner asked and once again Chris had a blank look on his face. Inside his head, he was freaking out.<br>\r\nJen again stepped in for damage control.<br>\r\n\"Well, we are planning on another salon trip to get a facial peel, Christina has some waxing she needs to get done and I would like to have her hair styled up for our day of trying on the wedding gowns. I would say, maybe this Friday?\" Jen looked to Chris for assurance, but Chris was no help.<br>\r\nThe wedding planner wrote down the date and Christina and Jen's name on her appointment book and planned to meet them at the bridal gown boutique on Friday.<br>\r\n\"Very good then, the last thing I need from you my dear is your signiture here.\" The planner said as she produced a contract for Christina to sign.<br>\r\nChris moved the best he could over to the table. He took small steps but it looked like he was just walking sexy. His back was stright his chest and rear stuck out of the tight dress. He looked over the contract and signed it at the bottom, Christina Mullens.<br>\r\nTHe planner looked at the signiture and put took the copy off the back of the contract and put it into Christina's binder.<br>\r\n\"Ok, I will need a check on Friday for half of the money so please make the check out to \"Dream Wedding.\"<br>\r\n Chris snapped out of his trance long enough to hear about the price. \"And what exactly is half?\" Christina asked in a little voice.<br>\r\n\"Well we sitll aren't sure about number of guests, and this isn't including the bridal party which you haven't given me yet. Also not included is your wedding gown, brides maids dresses and tuxedos. Half of what we have now is...$7500\" The wedding planner explained.<br>\r\n\"Wait, my whole wedding is going to cost $15,000?\" Chris replied in shock<br>\r\n\"If not more, lilke I said I didn't add in the gowns or tuxes.\" The planner said.<br>\r\nChris was just about to have a heart attack, Jen grabbed her arm and pulled her toward the door. \"We'll have half the money on Friday, we'll see you at the bridal boutique then.\" <br>\r\nJill followed the two out the door.<br>\r\nThe ride home was pretty quiet and Chris just spent most of the time staring out the window.<br>\r\nTHey finally pulled into Chris' driveway and the 3 women exited the car.<br>\r\nRIght away Jill wrote something on a piece of paper that she had pulled out of her purse. What Chris couldn't see was that Stacy was only scribbling lines on the blank paper. Jen and Stacy had practiced this because they knew Chris was gong to be too freaked out to plan a wedding so everything was going according to plan. Jen going along with the plan said, \"Is there a problem Miss Parks?\"<br>\r\nStacy replied, \"Well I'm just notiing the activity the went on today and I'm making a note about how Miss Mullens seemed distant and not interested in the planning of her own wedding.\" <br>\r\nChris spoke up as Christina, \"That's not true? I'm just overwhelmed. I'm excitied about everything.\"<br>\r\n\"You do have a funny way of showing it. Christina, in order for me to report back to the board a good report that everything is legit and you are a happy bride, you have to appear as a happy bride. Otherwise I will assume to believe that this wedding is a farce, and a sham. Michael will get no inheritence and we will investigate further to see if any fraud has taken place and perhaps some jail sentencing.\" Jill explained.<br>\r\nJen and Christina both listented intently and had their mouths open.<br>\r\n\"I can assure you Miss Parks that I am in this wedding both body and soul. There's no need for investigation. I'm just really tired and out of it, but I promise that I will be in better spirits on Friday for the dresses.\" Chris really turned it on with hopes of proving to the estate lawyer that this engagement was legit.<br>\r\n\"I hope so, but I'm not going to see you Friday next, I am going to the salon appointment with you both.\" Jill replied.<br>\r\nJen smiled. \"Absolutely, we will be at the place on main on Wednesday. We will see you then.\" Jen said.<br>\r\nJill turned and got into her car and drove off.<br>\r\nChris and Jen walked up to the apartment and went inside. Chris threw his purse on the table as Jen noticed some mail on the floor from the mail slot. She picked it up and looked at it.<br>\r\nChris sighed.\"Oh man, this is really a lot. Everytime something new happens I can't help but freak out.\" Chris explained.<br>\r\n\"It's really showing too.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\nChris got defensive. \"I can't help it, I've never pretended to be a woman before and I've never planned a wedding. Everything we do, and everything we talk about and once I actually start processing it in my head, I freak out. I mean, Michael and I are really going to have a wedding ceremony and be \"Married\" in a church in front of his family and friends and it's really freaking me out!\" <br>\r\n\"Well, there's a lot of money riding on your performance, so you have to turn it up and play the part of a happy bride or they'll be no money and possibly some jail time. I will pick you up something that will calm you down. I'll bring it over tomorrow, now let me help you out of that dress and into your nightgown.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\nChris and Jen both removed the dress and Chris turned around. He stood there as he kicked off the heels.<br>\r\nJen started putting the nightgown over Chris' head. <br>\r\n\"W-Wait, what about the corset?\" Chris asked.<br>\r\n\"No way, that's staying on.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\nChris freaked out. \"I can't sleep in this.\" He stated.<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to get used to it. You will, I promise. By mid week you'll be alright.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\nChris took a big breath in, \"yeah, there's no way I can sleep in this.\"<br>\r\nJen laughed, \"Well it's not coming off.\"<br>\r\nChris tried pulling at it but he couldn't do at and was too tired.<br>\r\nJen put the nightgown over his head and fed it down to his knees. She walked with Chris to the edge of his bed and then pushed him slightly backwards. <br>\r\nChris collapsed and scooted up to the pillows. He thought, there was no way he could convince Jen to let him take it off, so why try. Plus he was tired. He had a rough day and he swore that shot really irritated his hip. He felt weird all over but he thought it was just the allergy medicine working.<br>\r\n\"Get some sleep, we have some things to do in the afternoon.\"<br>\r\n\"What things?\" Chris replied.<br>\r\nJen held up a letter addressed to Christina Mullens...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris walked out of his bedroom in a liight blue babydoll nightie. He walked into the kitchen and poured some water into the teapot and placed it on the stovetop and turned the burner on. <br>\r\nHe grabbed two pieces of bread and slid them into the toaster and pulled the lever down. He lifted up and sat on a barstool that was in his kitchen at the countertop. It had just been common for him to sit ladylike lately and that's exactly how he sat. He crossed one leg over on top of the other. <br>\r\nOn the counter in front of where he sat was his purse. He opened it and pulled out a hair scrunchie. He pulled his long hair back into a ponytail and put the scrunchie in it.<br>\r\nHe took a mini calendar and noted that today was Wednesday, today was his salon day. He looked back at the previous days that passed and saw what a busy week he's already had. One day said \"Driver's License\", Saturday, Jen and the wedding planner spent the whole day mailing out the wedding invitations to Michael's friends and family, he skipped to Friday, which of course was his appointment at the wedding gown boutique. That was the day Chris was really dreading. <br>\r\nHe put the calendar down and took out his women's wallet that he recently purchased on a shopping trip and opened it up. One lone card sat behind the plastic . It was a driver's license. He chuckled a little while he examined the card like he had done so many days now since he's had it. The name said Christina Mullens Sex: F Height: 5' 6\", Age: 21. The picture was of a beautiful platinum blonde staring straight ahead into the camera with a blank look in her eyes and a slight smirk on her madeup face. Chris could hardly believe the picture was of him.  In fact a lot had happened since Gwen and Michael both disappeared and boy did he have a lot to tell them. He knew they'd be in shock at how feminine he looked so fast.<br>\r\nThis is exactly where he said he didn't want to be, living his daily life as a woman. But now he was trapped, as long as Jill Parks was in the picture and she seemed like she was going to stick around for awhile.<br>\r\nHis toast popped up and he got off the stool and grabbed a paper plate. He put both pieces of toast on the plate and got some butter out of the refrigerator. As he closed the refrigerator door he saw his outline in the refrigerator and was once again reminded of the corset on his body. His waist was small and his chest stuck out. <br>\r\nChris sighed, grabbed a knife and buttered his toast he heard the tea pot start to whistle. He grabbed a mug out of the cabinet and turned the stove top off and got a tea bag from off the counter. He poured his tea, and brought both his mug and plate over to the barstool and again sat down.<br>\r\nHe hadn't had much of an appitite lately, he thought as he bit into the buttered toast. Even though he was starting to get used to it, the corset definitely constricted his stomach. Plus Jen wanted him to eat light up to the wedding gown day so he would look good when he tried them on.<br>\r\nChris had just taken a sip of his tea which burned his tounge a little when he started to sneeze. First only once, then 2 more back to back.<br>\r\nHe grabbed from a tissue and held it up to his nose. Then again 2 more times.<br>\r\nHe once again reached into his purse and dug around until he found the perscription bottle that he had gotten filled earlier in the week. He popped the top and took out 2 pills. He popped the two pills in his mouth and swallowed them hard. They got stuck without having a water chaser but he got them down.<br>\r\nHe sneezed again 3 times. \"Oh man, these stupid alergy pills are useless.\" He said to himself.<br>\r\nOnly it wasn't alergy pills that Chris had been taking . It was actually a female hormone that was perscribed to him. The doctor at Jen's office had mistaken him for another transgender patient and unknown to him had him in transition to becoming female.<br>\r\nHe was about to make an even bigger mistake as he grabbed the phone and dialed Jen's office.<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Dr. Reynold's office.\" answered the receptionist.<br>\r\nChris disguised his voice as Christina because he wasn't exactly sure who knew his secret at her office. He knew Jen did and the doctor who saw him last week, but to be safe he kept up the ruse.<br>\r\n\"Hi, I was in late last week, to see Dr Reynolds, but she wasn't there and you and another doctor spoke to me, and then that Dr. saw me. I don't remember what her name was.\" Christina started to explain.<br>\r\nThe receptionist thought for a minute. \"Oh right, the blonde. You saw Dr. Cox.\" She replied.<br>\r\n\"Oh great I didn't remember her name, anyway she gave me a perscription but I really think I'm going to need a higher dosage. Also she had mentioned to me about having something done to my throat, I would like to schedule that too. Would it be possible to see Dr. Cox this morning if I come now?\" Chris added in a cute almost pleading voice.<br>\r\nThe receptionist paused then said, \"I don't see anyone on Dr. Cox's schedule until 10, the other doctor's are off today so if you come now she can fit you in.\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"That's great! I'm going to get dressed quickly and I'll be right over.\" Chris said as he hung up.<br>\r\nAt the Dr's office Dr Cox approached the receptionist. \"Was that a cancellation?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"No, actually our transgender friend is coming back, she says she needs a higher dosage of pills and would like to set up an appointment to have a  tracheal shave.\" The receptionist explained.<br>\r\n\"Oh that's great, and I think she also inquired about her vocal cords being worked on if I recall.\" Dr. Cox replied.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Chris had thrown on a pair of jeans and a low cut women's tee. The corset made it look like she had nice breasts with this top on. He didn't really do his makeup much just a little lipstick. He was still meeting Jen and Jill at the salon at noon and he knew they would wash his hair and do his makeup there. He grabbed his purse and was out the door.<br>\r\nClose to 15 minutes after making the Dr appointment, Chris arrived at the office.<br>\r\nHe was greeted by the receptionist again.<br>\r\nChris didn't wait long as Dr. Cox opened the door and told Chris to come back to the examination room. Dr Cox once again led him down the hall with a file folder in her hand.<br>\r\nThey ended up in the same room he was in last time. He again was told to undress put the gown on and sit on the table.<br>\r\nDr Cox left the room briefly while Chris did this and minutes later came back into the room.<br>\r\nChris had the gown on but he had kept the corset on because he couldn't take it of himself.<br>\r\nDr Cox with pen in hand and file open asked, \"May I ask what name you are going by as of now?\"<br>\r\nChris fished for his wallet in his purse and took out his new driver's license. \"Christina Mullens\" he answered.<br>\r\nDr. Cox looked at the llicense and smiled. \"You pass so well, it's hard to believe that you weren't born a woman.\"<br>\r\nChris made a sour face, \"Thanks..I think.\"<br>\r\nDr. Cox looked up from the file. \"I didn't mean to offend, I hope I didn't upset you. I know what you're going through and passing as a woman isn't an easy task.\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I didn't take offense, but it does seem to be getting easier each day.\" Chris explained.<br>\r\nDr Cox handed the license back to Chris and looked up from her file. \"What can I do for you today?\"<br>\r\n\"It's those pills doc, I need a stronger dosage.\" Chris said.<br>\r\n\"Well it has only been about a week since you've been on them, you should give them a chance to work.\" The dr explained.<br>\r\n\"I know, I guess I just want results right away. WIth that, and the sore throat I've been having. I feel sore and itchy on my chest, ughh, I'm just a mess.\" Chris replied.<br>\r\nDr Cox dug through the drawers of the desk and pulled out a body tape measure.<br>\r\nShe noticed the corset. \"Oh, you're doing some corset shaping too? That's probably the soreness. I can give you some cream that you can rub on the sore areas at night.\" She said as she got behind Chris and started to unlace his corset.<br>\r\nMinutes later Chris breathed a heavy sigh of relief as once again he could breath as the corset was removed.<br>\r\nThe doctor wrapped the tape measure around Chris' chest and then wrote the number in his file. He then wrapped the tape meaure around Chris' waist and wrote the number in his file. <br>\r\nAfter writing down some more things she continued writing on a piece of paper and said, \"Your body is progressing along. I think I could give you a stronger perscription. But you have to take the dosage that it says, don't take anymore.\" She explained as she handed him a perscription.<br>\r\nChris looked at the perscription paper again, but it was all scribble to him.<br>\r\n\"Now as far as quick fixes, there are some cosmetic things we can help you with. WIth the nose we can have some work done on it.\" She explained.<br>\r\nChris listened to her say that and immediately thought she was talking about a deviated septum. He would love to have that done to his nose, he thought.<br>\r\nOnly while he thought about that he failed to hear Dr. Cox explain how they could make his nose smaller and turned upwards and he immidiately said he wanted that operation done.<br>\r\n\"Ok, I could make an appointment for you. I also hear that you wanted the throat worked on. It's still bothering you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Definitely, I think making the female voice has really irritated it, Ahh, to be natural again, that would be perfect.\" Chris explained not even realizing the doctor thought that Chris wanted his vocal cords worked on to sound like a natural woman.<br>\r\n\"We can definitely schedule that. Of course results vary with it. But it would probably hurt for about a day or two and then the pain would be gone.\" She said meaning that once his throat was shaved the healing process wasn't long<br>\r\n\"Sign me up!\" Chris said as he pulled out his small calandar from his purse. The Dr made his appointment for the throat first and scheduled him for next Saturday. Then she put him down for his nose work.<br>\r\nAfter the appointment Chris decided he had enough time before the salon day to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris was just getting home from the pharmacy. He had gotten the perscription filled and wanted to get started on this dosage right away before he started another sneezing fit.<br>\r\nHe poured a cup of water and popped the top off the perscription bottle. He produced two large pills in his hand and swallowed them with the water chaser. <br>\r\nHe heard the door start to open, and quidkly tossed the perscription bottle into his purse. He knew it was Jen but he didn't want her to know that he was going to her office behind her back for help with his allergy. \"Morning doll face.\" She said as she entered the apartment.<br>\r\nQuickly he shot Jen a look and greeted her with a pleasant but fake \"Morning.\" back.<br>\r\nShe noticed that the corset was next to his purse and that he was already dressed. <br>\r\n\"You took it off?\" Jen questioned.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I took it off just now. I did sleep in it so don't get your panties all in a bunch.\" He replied.<br>\r\n\"I hope so\" Jen said as she grabbed it again and straightened it up, brushing some hairs off of it. \"Lets get you relaced and ready for our appointment.\"<br>\r\nChris took off his tshirt and threw it to the couch. Jen looked at Chris' chest and saw a slight puffiness. \"It must be really cinching his chest\" She gigled to herself. \"I'll have to make it tighter\" She thought.<br>\r\nChris again made a face. As he turned around after Jen wrapped the corset around his slim body. She began tightning the laces and really pulled hard. Chris was already used to this routine as Jen has done this just about everyday for him since she bought it.<br>\r\nHe still threw in his remarks \"THAT'S ENOUGH JEN\" as she pulled the laces tight.<br>\r\nOnce again he felt everything constrict as she pulled and laced harder.  He held on to the countertop for dear life and air as Jen squeezed his body to it's limits.<br>\r\nFinally satisfied, Jen finished and had Chris turn around. His body had a perfect hourglass shape. Now get dressed and lets head over to the salon. You won't need any makeup cause they'll take care of that.\"<br>\r\nChris was putting his shirt back over his head which was harder with the corset on. <br>\r\n\"What am I having worked on today.\" Chris asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, we have to definitely get your hair styled today. I want them to put it up for Friday's wedding gown day. But I want to see a few styles before we pick one.\"She explained, while she picked up the piece of cold toast on the plate and took a bite.<br>\r\n\"more than one style?\" Chris whinned.<br>\r\n\"Yes my dear, I want to see a few styles. But think of it this way, with Jill there seeing you try a few hairstyles, that will probably satisfy her and detour her away from any feelings that you aren't into this whole wedding planning.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\nChris still made a face as he went into the bedroom to grab his sandals. He continued to talk from in there.<br>\r\n\"Well, can we please stay away form Molly's station today? I don't want any more electrolysis done. If they remove anymore hair from my face permanently, I'll never look like a man again once this is all over.\" Chris explained.<br>\r\nJen smiled from the other room \"Ok, we'll stay away from Molly.\" Jen knew that wouldn't happen but she wasn't going to tell Chris everything that she had in store for him today. <br>\r\n\"Don't forget your check book.\" Jen called into the other room.<br>\r\nThat was another thing Jen had Chris do on Monday, she went with him to open a checking account in Christina Mullens name. He first withdrew all the money he had in his \"Chris\" account, then they went to another bank and deposited it all into Christina Mullens name. This way he could pay for things using the bank card he was given or write a check. <br>\r\nChris hated how everything that was his was converting into Christina's life. Chris hoped that things were only this hectic and spotlighted on Christina up until the wedding. Once the wedding was over, he could somewhat get his life as Chris back and would only have to dress as a woman again for special occasions, like on Thanksgiving or next Christmas. Then after 6 months of living together, they could announce a divorce but not until Michael gets that big 'ol paycheck from his grandmother's esate. <br>\r\n\"That's what it was all about\" Thought Chris.<br>\r\nChris came out of his bedroom with his check book in hand. He slipped it into his purse, grabbed his keys and locked the door.<br>\r\nThe two women made their way down to the mainstreet and only minutes later walked up to the Salon entrance.<br>\r\nSitting in the waiting area inside Jen immediately noticed Stacy. She gave her a smirk as Stacy got up and greeted the two women. <br>\r\n\"Hello miss Parks.\" Chris said in his Christina voice.<br>\r\n\"Oh please Christina, call me Jill.\" Stacy replied.<br>\r\nChristina couldn't stand Jill but he knew he had to keep things pleasant and play the part of a happy bride.<br>\r\nThe three women approached the receptionist. Jen spoke, \"Hi, we have an appointment for 3.<br>\r\nThe receptionist remembered Christina and smiled at her, \"Hello again. You look so beautiful today, we're going to take good care of you.\" She explained.<br>\r\nChris got a little red in the face \"Thanks\" He spoke in his womanly voice.<br>\r\nThe 3 women were led into a changing room and we're each given a robe with sandals, and a bag to hold their clothes and purses.<br>\r\nIt took the women minutes to change and all appeared again in their fluffy robes and sandals on their feet.<br>\r\nThey were next led to a room with 4 examination tables. They were told to lay down and they were going to start thier European deep cleansing facial, which also included an extraction, facial massage cleansing and ending with a nourishing mask.<br>\r\nAfter they lay down, 3 salon specialists got right to work. \"Just close your eyes and relax\" The woman whispered into Chris' ear.<br>\r\nHe did so and she was right, it was very relaxing. It didn't hurt and he was just glad that it wasn't the skin zapping that was happening to him. He felt really good and was about 1/2 hour into the treatment when the woman who was working on him tapped his shoulder.<br>\r\nChris opened his eyes and saw the woman put her finger to her lips and make the \"shhh\" motion. He looked over at Jen and Jill and saw that they had the masks covering their faces, but Chris didn't get that part.  The woman helped him off his exam table and led him out of the room.<br>\r\n\"There's nothing wrong\" The facial specialist said. \"I just didn't want to apply a mask to you because I was told to send you to the teeth whitening station. \" She explained.<br>\r\nChris was at first scared but the relieved that he was just going to go to the next station. At least things were moving along here. He just wanted this day to end. Unlike real women, he didn't want a day of pampering, and hair done, and facials. He would rather watch the playoffs at home which were still going on. <br>\r\nThe woman led Chris to a salon style chair and after he sat, the woman reclined it back. She then filled up a cup with mouthwash and told Chris to rinse and spit.<br>\r\nChris did like he was told. Just like the dentist. The woman opened his mouth and looked at his teeth. \"They already look great, but we'll get them white, shiny and beautiful with your smile.\" She said.<br>\r\nTHe woman prepared something behind Chris while he continued to rinse his mouth and spit. Minutes later the woman appeared in front of Chris with a mouth guard that was covered with the whitening solution.<br>\r\nCarefully she placed the guard into his mouth and aligned it on his top and bottom teeth, slowly she had Chris close his mouth.<br>\r\n\"Now bite down, don't open your mouth and don't move your jaw. Actually don't move your head.\"<br>\r\nChris sat there for a few minutes wondering how long he would have to keep this in his mouth and keep still. The specialist was preparing something else behind Chris but approached with a tv remote. \"I'm sorry, this might be awhile, but I don't want you to be bored.\" She said as she turned on the tv that was in the upper corner by the ceiling. <br>\r\nChris remained still, he only moved his eyes when she turned the tv on and he started watching a talk show that was on.<br>\r\nMoments later the specialist appeared before Chris again, she had on a surgical mask, and gloves. She sat on a stool next to him and wheeled over a little tray that was out of Chris' view. Chris' eyes widened and he made a face.<br>\r\n\"Just relax darling\" The specialist said as she took a needle and injected it into Chris' bottom lip. Chris flinched a little as he didn't expect the prick in his mouth. <br>\r\nShe stood up and again did some stuff out of his view.<br>\r\nChris tried to turn and face her but couldn't. Instead he just made a moaning voice so she would look. <br>\r\nA few minutes passed and the specialist came back over into view, \"Oh good, you should be feeling numb now.\"<br>\r\nShe sat back down and grabbed another needle. Before Chris could grunt or squirm, she had injected the needle into Chris' lips. She repeated the prcess a few time. A few tears rolled down Chris' face.<br>\r\n\"What the hell!\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\nMinutes later the specialist got up again. \"Ok, your collegen lip injections are finished. The filler I used should keep them beautiful and plump, but we'll have to keep up treatments.\" She said as she walked out the door.<br>\r\nChris couldn't believe what just happened. \"Collegen Lip Injections? How the hell did that just happen? I'm going to have Angelina Jolie mouth. This can't get much worse.<br>\r\nChris heard the specialist come back into the room, only it wasn't the specialist that just injected his lips. It was the electroysis specialist from last visit.  She wheeled over her tray.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stacy and Jen sat under the hairdryers for the past half hour. They watched a soap opera that <br>\r\nwas on one of the many tv's that lined the room.<br>\r\nIt had been a few hours since they've been there. They had their European facial's done but Jen just realized that it was the last time she saw Chris.<br>\r\nShe was sure they would cross paths after the got their nails done, then again maybe after their hair wasing, makeup applied? but here they were having their hair dried and they haven't run into Chris once. <br>\r\n\"I wonder if he left\" Jen thought as she looked around the room of hairdryers. <br>\r\nJen looked at Stacy.  After a minute Stacy looked at her and worded a puzzled \"What?\" to Jen.<br>\r\nJen looked around, and then worded back to Stacy, \"Where's Chris?\" She asked<br>\r\nStacy shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\nJen's hair specialist walked over and checked the time on Jen and Jill's dryers and turned them off and lifted them off their head.<br>\r\n\"Jen you'll be with our stylist Stephanie and Jill you'll be with Rebecca.\" The specialist said.<br>\r\n\"Can you do me a favor? Do you know what happened to the third woman that was with us. Christina? We haven't seen her and we're hoping that she was still here.\" Jen asked.<br>\r\nThe specialist stopped walking and turned around. She looked around the room and spotted Christina under a hair dryer in the far corner. she pointed, \"She's over there. She asked for a private dryer away from everyone, said she had some thinking to do.\" <br>\r\n\"Can we have a few minutes.\" Jen asked the woman.<br>\r\nSHe nodded and walked away.<br>\r\nJen and Jill looked to where the woman pointed but still didn't see Christina. They saw one woman in the corner. She was in a white robe like they were. As they walked closer, they saw her hands sticking out from under the robe's arms. Long pink nails sat on her fingertips and her toes were painted the same color.<br>\r\nHer face was beautiful and smooth. Her makeup was flawless. Light foundation, a soft pink lipstick rested on her thick plump lips. Her lashes long and curled and just a dusting of eyeshadow above them. The eyebrows were soft and thin and neatly arched.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God Christina!\" Jen said as the women approached their friend.<br>\r\nChristina looked up from her dryer and noticed the two women. She had a panic look on her face and looked like she wanted to cry, but put on a happy smile when she saw Jill.<br>\r\n\"Hi girls!\" He said as Christina.<br>\r\n\"You look amazing! What did you do different?\" Jill asked.<br>\r\nChris swallowed hard and looked up again. \"They injected lip colligen into my lips to make them plump.\" Chris replied and he had a hard time saying it.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, your lips look fantastic. They look a little swollen but I'm sure that will go down a little in a day or so.\" Jill expressed.<br>\r\nChris continued, \"Then..\" He paused and tried to regain his composure. \"Then they did another treatment of electrolysis on my lips, chin, cheeks and\" Another short pause and swallow...\"brows.\"<br>\r\n\"They permanently arched your brows? See that's the way to go, then you don't have to worry about stray hairs or unwanted growth. Well, they did a wonderful job, and you look amazing.\" Jill continued.<br>\r\nJen tried to hide a smile with her hand and then asked Jill if she could talk to Christina for a few minutes.<br>\r\nJill walked off to find her stylist and get her hair finished.<br>\r\nJen leaned over and sat in the salon chair next to Chris' hairdryer.<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you won't have to worry about shaving.\" Jen tried to make light of the subject at hand.<br>\r\nChris shot her a look of death. \"How do I go back to being a guy with these arches? They permanently thinned them to this!\" Chris exclaimed as he pointed to his face.<br>\r\nJust as Chris' meltdown came to an end, another hair specialist came over and turned off Chris' hairdryer.<br>\r\n\"Ok, doll. You're finished. Now I understand that we're doing a few bridal hairstyles today?\" She asked.<br>\r\nChris who was ready to go home, was about to say that except Jen spoke first.<br>\r\n\"Yes, that would be great!\" Jen said.<br>\r\nChris shot another look of death to Jen and the two women followed the specilist to the stylng chairs. <br>\r\nJen pulled back a little and leaned in to talk to Chris again, \"You better put on a happy face for Jill, I think she's taking notes.\" <br>\r\nChris rolled his eyes but saw Jill already in a stylists chair and put on a big smile as he walked up.<br>\r\nThe two women were seated in a stylists chair and Jen's stylist approached and began working on her hair. <br>\r\nChris sat and waited for a few more minutes when his stylist finally walked up. She walked up with two other women.  <br>\r\nThe first woman spoke,\"Hello and welcome to my salon. I am Jackie. We have heard about you Christina from your last visit here. Everyone fell in love with you and your story of hardship and we couldn't wait for you to come back. We wrote in to TLC channel \" Bridal Makeover\" and told them all about you and your abusive relationship and how you fought your way back. THey were very interested with your story and wanted to be a part of your upcoming wedding.  They would love to follow you for a few months and film your wedding preparations and just get all the emotions of a happy bride in a loving relationship with a man she loves. Is that something you think you would like?\" The owner asked.<br>\r\nChris sat there with his eyes widened and thought, \"You've got to be kidding me\"<br>\r\nThe woman from TLC cut in and said, \"We will pay for anything that we film. Like today's salon treatment. We filmed some of your spa day.  Like when you were under the dryer in the corner away from everyone and you had tears of happiness roll down your cheeks. That was touching. Our viewers are going to love that.  We added those special treatments to your spa day, the teeth whitening, eleyctrolysis, and colligen in your lips to make you feel like a woman should feel. A woman that never had the chance to  experience these feelings because she was always verbally abused. We want to get moments like that. We already spoke to your girlfriend Jen here, and she tells us that you are trying on Wedding Gowns on Friday. We would love to pay for your gown. Then we hear your fiance returns from a trip this weekend. We would love to capture the reunion and treat the both of you to a romantic evening. <br>\r\nChris couldn't believe what was happening. He didn't want to be on a tv show dressed like this. What if someone saw him and recognized him. He couldn't get married on tv in front of millions of viewers. He had to tell them no.<br>\r\n\"But I'm not getting married for 6 months.\" Chris said.<br>\r\nThe producer explained. \"We understand that. We will cut and splice it all together. Once we piece all this together it'll look like it was all a months time before the wedding.\" <br>\r\nJen jumped in and said, \"This is all so wonderful. My girl is still a little in shock with all the attention and how nice everyone has been, but we think this is great.\"<br>\r\nCHris turned and couldn't believe Jen just did that.. But before he could say anything the woman from TLC waved to the entrance of the salon and the camera crew of the show walked over, along with a man. <br>\r\nThe producer once again explained. \"You my dear are in for a treat. We have in our salon just for you, the famous hair stylist Armando. He is here for you to make your hair beautiful.\" The owner of the salon explained. \"Now, if everyone will take thier places, we'll start with Armando approaching Christina's chair, and Christina remember to look excited and surprised. Ready, in 3, 2, 1 and action.\" she said.<br>\r\nChris just sat there as the camera crew got in their places and then Armondo approched Chris' chair.<br>\r\n\"Hello Christina, I'm Armondo. I'm here to make your hair beautiful for your wedding day.\" He explained.<br>\r\nCHristina smiled a big fake smile but a tear fell down his cheek at the same time.<br>\r\nThe producer gave Chris a thumbs up she thought that was perfect for the show.<br>\r\n\"Lets try a few styles and then you and your friends could tell me what you would like.\" Armondo explained and then got to work on Chris' hair.<br>\r\n He took his time and explained everything he was doing as he did it.. He would put the hair up or to the side. He would do it all up to a certain sytle which took a lot of time, then film it. Then wash it again and style it in another style. They did this 4 times altogether when they finally decided on the 2nd style Armando had done. So once they washed his hair this last time, they restyled it into a beautiful updo. One that Armando explained could hold the bridal vail well. <br>\r\nIt was about 6 hours later when they finally filmed Chris expression of seeing his hair and getting a great reaction.<br>\r\nFinally the producer yelled \"CUT\" and finally wrapped things up.<br>\r\nChris was exahusted, and so were the other girls. They spent the whole day there with only one hour and a half break for a lunch.<br>\r\nThey ordered salads for the girls but Chris was a little too upset to eat, so he only picked at his.<br>\r\nHe was now more tired than anything.<br>\r\nThe girls all took their clothes and changed in the dressing rooms then they walked back into the receptionist area.<br>\r\nThe producer was true to her word. She paid for Chris and his friends salon bill.<br>\r\nThey thanked them and then said they would see them on Friday.<br>\r\nJill also said her goodbyes and told Christina that she had a better day than the other day. <br>\r\n\"Ill write that in my report.\" Jill said. \"I'll see you two on Friday also.\" SHe said as she walked away to her car.<br>\r\nChris and Jen again walked back to Chris' apartment Chris didn't say much as he couldn't believe the day's evenets. There was nothing really to say. Jen was bursting inside. She knew Chris was pissed and she knew he had every right but this was just too good.<br>\r\nThey got to the apartment and Chris unlocked the apartment door.<br>\r\nThe mail was once again on the floor and Jen picked it up again. <br>\r\nChris threw his purse on the table and then collapsed on the couch.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" Jen said shocked while looking at the mail.<br>\r\n\"what's wrong\" Chris asked.</span></div></div>",

He sat up and looked at the clock.<br>\r\nThe clock read 2 pm.<br>\r\n\"2 pm? on Thursday? Did I really sleep that long?\" Chris thought out loud. \"Hello?\" He called out into the apartment.<br>\r\nHe pulled the blanket off of him and he was wearing a peach colored nightie. Under the nightie he was again tightened into the corset. \"Why don't I remember changing?\" He thought to himself. <br>\r\nHe tried to remember back to the night before but he just couldn't. He relaly had to pee though.<br>\r\nHe got up and went into the bathrom. He opened the lid of the toilet and started to pee. <br>\r\nThe mirror was facing him and he was quickly reminded of what he looked like. He immediately thought that If anyone had walked in on him right now, they would see that a woman was peeing standing up.<br>\r\nHis hair was still styled up and as he put one arm up to it, he felt how stiff with hairspray his hair was. He saw how thin and arched his brows were, and then remembered the electrolysis that was done on them to permanently keep them that way.<br>\r\nAs he flushed the toilet he washed his hands and looked at his long pink nails and then looked at the engagement ring on his finger.<br>\r\nThen a memory triggered in his brain. \"Oh no! The TLC show!\" He thought as he started to get chest pains.  \"I gotta put a stop to that.\" He thought. He remembered that he freaked out about that last night and then Jen had given him a pill to take. That must have knocked him out. <br>\r\n\"Oh, right..my pills. \" He thought as he ran for his purse and opened his perscription bottle. He took out two large pills and poured himself some water and downed his daily estrogen.<br>\r\nIn Chris' mind he thought the pills were allergy medicine and he thought they were working because he wasn't sneezing or having any sniffles. <br>\r\nChris put the perscription bottle back into his purse and saw a note on the counter. He read it to himself.<br>\r\n\"Hey Christina,<br>\r\nI had to run to work and get a few things out of the way. On my way home I have to pick something up that I'd like to try out. Hang out and I'll be by a little later.\"<br>\r\nLove,<br>\r\nJen<br>\r\nThen Chris noticed the mail from yesterday sitting on the counter. Then he went into a panic mode again as he realized what freaked him out so much last night.<br>\r\nHe shuffled through the letters until he came to wedding RSVPs from guests. There were only two but his eyes widened when he realized who the two replys were from. <br>\r\nOne envelope was from his parents. He quickly opened the letter. and pulled out the RSVP.<br>\r\nIt said the they would be there. Next reply card was a note from Chris' mom and dad. Chris read it out loud.<br>\r\nCongratulations Michael to you and your bride. We are going to be in town next week and we would love to stop by and meet your fiancee and take you both out for the day! We already set something up with your parents so we will see you next week.<br>\r\nChris looked down and slowly brought up the other wedding reply. He opened it and pulled out the reply card. It was from his ex girlfriend. <br>\r\nChris and Shannon had gone out for 5 years. They were going out while Chris was in college. Shannon was 4 years older than Chris and wanted things a little faster than Chris did. Chris wasnted to still go out and have fun with her, while Shannon was looking to settle down and get married. Shannon ended it with Chris when she realized they wanted different things.<br>\r\nShannon's note fell out of the enveolope.<br>\r\nDear Michael and Christina<br>\r\nCongratulations on your wedding! Im driving out with Chris' parents next week with my boyfriend. Can't wait for you to meet Brian and I can't wait to meet Christina. See you next week.<br>\r\nLove Shannon<br>\r\nAgain Chris' heart felt like it was going to burst out of his chest.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! What am I going to do?\" Chris began freaking out.<br>\r\n\"My ex and my parents are coming to see me next week, and I'll be dressed as a woman!\" He kept reapeating out loud.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!, what am I going to do, What do I do?\" He kept saying.<br>\r\nHe went to the refrigerator and took out a beer. He quickly twisted off the cap and downed half the bottle.<br>\r\n\"I have to run away!\" He thought. \"I can't face my parents dressed like this!\" He continued to say.<br>\r\n\"Who invited them anyway?\" he continued to freak as he again took a log sip of his beer.<br>\r\nJust then Jen burst into the apartment door.<br>\r\n\"Hey babe!\" she announced as she walked in carrying and large tote bag. \"I didn't think you were every going to wake up.' She continued.<br>\r\nChris shook his head as if coming out of a trance and said, \"We gotta call this whole thing off.\" <br>\r\n\"We can't do that, you know that.\" She replied.<br>\r\n\"We have to!\" Chris replied in a panic.<br>\r\n\"Actually what I have in this bag is going to save us.\" Jen said.<br>\r\nChris stood there waiting as Jen went into the tote bag.<br>\r\nShe pulled out.</span></div></div>",

I think we need these for tomorrow's gown fitting. Plus, now you're going to be involved in this Bridal show, we have to make your body as womanly as possible.\" <br>\r\nChris made a face. \"Yeah, thanks for that, by the way. How could you agree to all that? What if someone recognizes me on tv. I can't risk that.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll be fine. It's not going to air until after your wedding anyway and by that time,  you'll be on your way back to being a man, so you can just laugh it off. In the meantime, the more the show films, the more you don't have to pay.\"<br>\r\nChris thought about it. It was true. If they were filming up until the wedding, it wouldn't air for a long time so he shouldn't worry. But then another thought entered his head.<br>\r\n\"Well what about my parents and my ex coming to the wedding and coming here in a couple weeks to see Michael and meet the woman he's going to marry. You don't think my parents or a girl I went out with for 4 years is going to recognize me? Who invited them anyway?\" Chris rambled on.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure when we gave the wedding planner Michaell's address book, your parents were in there and your ex was too. It was an accident.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, an accident thats going to destroy this deal.\" Chris replied.<br>\r\n\"All the more reason to wear these breast forms.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\nChris picked up one of the breast forms. He noticed that it was heavy. Jen pulled his nightie over his head and started to unlace his corset.<br>\r\nChris did realize that he would need something that looked realistic as he went wedding gown shopping. He would probably have women in and out of the dressing room with him, so he needed to play the part of a woman and be as passible as he could. Especially to Jill.<br>\r\nJen took the breast form out of Chris' hand and standing behind him, she put it up to his chest.  \"I think these will look perfect. Didn't you say you haven't seen your parents or girlfriend since you've grown your hair long? Now after being styled and dyed, and with your face made up and eyebrows shaped, you've got those big plump lips now not to mention you've got that female voice down perfectly, you really don't look the same since this whole things started, I really don't think they'll recognize you.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\nChris looked down at the boob Jen held up to his chest. It did look real \"Ok, lets do it.\" Chris said as he sat on the couch ready to get a pair of breasts.<br>\r\nJen looked at him funny. \"Uhh, we're not doing it here.\" <br>\r\n\"What? Well then where are we doing it?\"Chris asked?<br>\r\n\"We're going down to my office.\" I have the tables you can lay on and the chairs that recline, and frankly that's exactly how I need you to be while I attach these to your chest.\" Jen explained.Chris started to panic again. He couldn't go to Jen's office, he would surely see Dr. Cox and she would tell Jen that he was getting allergy medical treatments behind her back. \"How about I lay on the bed? It would just be like the reclining chair.\"<br>\r\n\"No, now get in there and find something quick to wear and lets get down there. I have to have these breasts perfect for tommorrow's fitting.\" Jen demanded.<br>\r\nJen and Chris entered his bedroom. Chris immediately sat on the bed as Jen slid open his sliding door closet and started going through his clothes. Once lined with guys shirts and such. He looked at how it was now lined with floral dresses and light colored skirts. <br>\r\nJen turned around and saw Chris just sitting on the bed \"Comon and help me, you have to learn what things work together.\" <br>\r\nChris got off the bed and stood next to Jen as she removed a few hangers and held them up to Chris' body. She did it a few times until she decided on a white Side Peplum Dress. <br>\r\nChris put his bra and panties on first as Jen once again wrapped the corset around his body and started lacing it tightly again.<br>\r\n\"Ughhh, I'm not going to miss this once I have those breat forms on.\" Chris said.<br>\r\nJen laughed, \"Are you kidding? You're still wearing the corset. In fact it's going to make those breasts shine!\" She stated.<br>\r\nChris cringed as Jen laughed and tightened the laces.<br>\r\nOnce satisfied, Jen helped Chris into the dress.<br>\r\nShe helped Chris toward the mirror and then did some quick makeup on his face.<br>\r\n\"Now grab your purse and lets go.\" She said as Chris quickly grabbed his purse and the apartment keys, locking the door they went to the street.<br>\r\nAs they walked, Jen explained, \"Now, my firm doesn't allow us to do work on or have a relationship or personal friendship with any patients so you are going to go in there before me. Tell them your name is Christine, you're a transgender patient of mine that I'm appliying breast forms to today. I'll call them and tell them I'm running a little late.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\nChris interrupted. \"Whoa! Wait, how long are you going to be before you get there?\" <br>\r\n\"oh I don't know, I'll go grab a coffee and a biscotti and I'll stroll in 20 minutes after you.\" Jen explained as they turned the corner to the main street and approached the doctor's office.<br>\r\nChris thought, Little did Jen know, the office already knew about him. He had seen Dr. Cox a couple times for his allergy. He could waste a little time talking to that hot receptionist as he waited for Jen.<br>\r\nThey arrived minutes later at the dr office.<br>\r\n\"Now don't forget to use your female voice you hang on to the breast forms and I'll see you in a little bit.\" Jen said as she started walking away.<br>\r\nChris walked intot he doctors office that he has frequented a lot lately. The receptionist smiled and her eyes lit up as she recoginized the patient. <br>\r\n\"Hi Christina. How are you?\" she said.<br>\r\nChris approached the window that she sat behind and said, \"Hi\"<br>\r\nShe looked down at her appoinment book and glanced through it, \"I don't think you have an appointment with us today hun.\"<br>\r\n\"no I know. I'm actually meeting Dr. Reynolds here in a little bit but I'm early again, She's going to do my breasts.\" Chris explained.<br>\r\nDr Cox happened to be walking by the window. \"Hello Christina, did you say Dr Reynolds was working on your breasts today?\"<br>\r\n\"Hello doctor.\" Chris replied. \"Yes, she is coming in a little bit.\" He said in his Christina voice.<br>\r\nDr. Cox got furious. \"Christina is my patient, she has appointments with me. If anyone was going to do her breast augmentation it's going to be me\", she thought to herself. \"Well, comon back into my office Christina, I'll help you out.\" She said as she opened the door to the patient room.<br>\r\n\"Oh Dr. Cox,  you've already done a lot for me, Dr Reynolds said she would be here soon. I couldn't ask you to do this for me.\"  Chris explained. Chris did like Dr Cox workng on her more than Jen. Jen was helping him with everything, but she seemed to enjoy getting him more and more feminine. She especially loves the corset tightening.<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly dear. Comon back and I'll take a look at you.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Ok\" Chris replied. Chris like Dr. Cox's bed side manner a little more than Jen and if Dr. Cox wanted to glue best forms on his chest, he was fine with that, he thought. He picked up his box of breast forms and followed the doctor.<br>\r\nChris followed her back to her room and sat up on the exam table, he put the box of breast forms in the corner with other similar boxes.<br>\r\n\"Ok, dear, you know the drill. Take off your clothes and put them in this bag. I'm going to check out your body a little just to see what's happening and then we'll get started.\" Dr. Cox explained.<br>\r\n\"Oh can you unlace me first?\" Chris asked, pointing to the corset back.<br>\r\nDr. Cox approached Chris and unlaced the corset from the back.<br>\r\nWhen she was done, she said she would be back soon and then left the exam room.<br>\r\nChris got out of his dress and took off the corset. He then took off the bra. He looked around and this time Dr. Cox didn't give him a patient gown to wear after he got out of his clothes. He kept the panties on so he wouldn't be completely naked.<br>\r\nHe hopped up on the exam table.<br>\r\nDr. Cox was grabbing the \"Christina\" File of the other transgender patient that never showed up. She opened the file and saw that it was written in there that Christina was getting B CUP breasts. She came back into the room with the file.. \"Oh my dear, we're gong to go into the other room with the surgical gurney. That way the room is already prepped and we can go from there.\" She explained.<br>\r\nChris didn't think anything of it so he got off the exam table and followed Dr. Cox into a bigger room. <br>\r\nThis room was definitely a surgical room. It had an operation table, next to it was a smaller table with scalpels and different surgical items.  <br>\r\nThere was the IV drip, and all kinds of other devices that beeped and had monitors.<br>\r\nShe patted the operating table. \"Comon down\" She said<br>\r\nChris reluctently sat down on the table, he pulled his legs up and lay down flat on the table.<br>\r\nDr Cox started squeezing Chris' chest. She felt around, \"You do have some tissue built up. It looks good, we can start.\"<br>\r\nChris hadn't noticed the receptionist had come in and was on the other side of Chris. \"Hey!\" he said as he recogized her standing there. \"You're an assistant too?\" He said.<br>\r\nShe shook her head as she grabbed Chris' wrist. \"That's great! I thougth you were just the receptionist.\" He replied and then suddenly was pricked in the wrist by the woman.<br>\r\nChris finally noticed what she was doing and had inserted an IV drip into his arm.<br>\r\n\"All this for breast forms\" Chris thought.<br>\r\nDr Cox walked towards Chris and injected something into his arm.<br>\r\nChris started to feel funny. <br>\r\n\"Now just relax and don't worry about a thing.\" Dr Cox explained.<br>\r\nChris started getting dizzy as he tried to focus and listen to the doctor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jen sat in the coffee shop on main. She was a few blocks away from her office. <br>\r\nShe had been nursing her large coffee and scone for the last 15 minutes and was in no rush. In fact she kind of felt good not having to rush somewhere. <br>\r\nJen was using her time to do some serious planning about how everything was going to pan out. She thought as she wrote some notes in a notebook. <br>\r\nAt the top of the page she wrote: \"Things to Prepare For\" Then she started jotting things down that she needed to take care of in the coming weeks.<br>\r\nThe top of her list she wrote, Michael and Gwen's return. Obviously, she has been playing a big part in transforming Chris into Christina with the pair away, but she knew that she had to disappear once they returned. <br>\r\nMichael's return was going to be sooner than Gwen's but she couldn't let her brother know that she was involved in this, not yet.<br>\r\nShe took her phone out of her purse and dialed Stacy.<br>\r\n\"Hello Miss Jen\" Stacy answered from her office at work.<br>\r\n\"Hey Stacy. Is everything taken care of?\" Jen asked<br>\r\n\"It is, I have exactly what we need downloaded and ready for you.\" She explained in code.<br>\r\n\"Great. I will stop by later. I'm taking care of our \"girl\" today.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\nStacy laughed. \"I can't wait to see her tomorrow. She is going to be a knockout trying on those wedding gowns tomorrow. We're not going to pick one right away, are we?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh God no! She's definitely going to get the FULL wedding experience. We'll have her try on at least two-welve dressed.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\nThe two laughed and then they hung up.<br>\r\nJen smiled thinking about how this blackmailing plan was going to come about. Stacy had gone into Gwen's files and took a screen shot of the Christina Mullens file and how this mysterious woman appeared out of nowhere. That along with the fact that Christina Mullens is really a guy will make her brother give her and Stacy the family fortune or else Gwen, Chris and Michael will do some hard time in jail.<br>\r\nJen was thinking everything was going perfect. She took a big sip out of her coffee and looked at the time. It was now about a half hour since she dropped Chris at her office, she should be getting back now.  She saw someone standing at ther table from her side view. She looked up and standing there was Michael.<br>\r\nFor a minute she paniced. Her brother was back so she wouldn't be spending that much time with Chris, but then seeing him enraged her so she thought she would bust his balls a little.<br>\r\n\"Hey Sis! Long time no see.\" He greeted her.<br>\r\n\"Hello dear brother.\" Jen replied and then kicked out a chair for him.<br>\r\nTHe two were being as sarcastic as they could be. In reality they couldn't stand each other. <br>\r\nMichael did sit though.<br>\r\n\"So where have you been?\" She asked playing like she didn't know.<br>\r\nMichael smiled cause he knew she had to be nosey about what he was doing.<br>\r\n\"I've been at grandma's house with mom and dad. We're going through some stuff that mom wanted and getting some paperwork.\" He replied.<br>\r\n\"Oh, trying to get as much as you can out of the old bag even after her death, huh?\" Jen replied.<br>\r\nMicheal made a face. \"It's not like that at all. I visited grandma every weekend. I took her to church and lunch every Sunday, which is more than your twice a year visit.\"<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa, bro, you  don't have to explain to me, it's no secret you were her favorite. Don't feel like you have to justify anythign to me.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying, it wouldn't have killed you to spend a little time with her. Maybe things would be different.\" Michael replied.<br>\r\n\"You mean then I woulld be the one who would get a billion dollars if I got married in 6 months? No thanks, I've been married before and thank God I'm not anymore.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\n\"Well grandma just wanted the best for us, she didn't really care for your ex and neither did any of the family. We all told you he was after your money and you didn't believe us. You chose him over us, and that's why you didn't get a piece of the pie.\" Michael explained.<br>\r\nJen raised her eyebrows. \"Oh and you're going to fullfill her wishes and get married? I didn't even know you were dating anyone.\" Jen started to make Michael sweat.<br>\r\n\"Uhh, As a matter of fact, yes I am. She's my roommate Chris, mom and dad have met her and we are going to get married and get grandma's inheritence. It's either that or it just goes to the state. Once we have the money, we're going to help mom and dad out and then move out of our small apartment.\" Michael explained.<br>\r\n\"...and have kids?\" Jen threw that in there as she could tell Michael was already stammering telling her the story.<br>\r\n\"Well, that's proably years down the line.\" He replied.<br>\r\n\"Well Chris sounds absolutely darling. I would love to meet her.\" She said.<br>\r\nMichael broke eye contact and stared down at the table. \"Well, maybe sometime.\" <br>\r\n\"OH NO!\" Michael thought. \"I have to keep Chris and Jen away from each other. If she sees my roommate is a guy and then meets him closer to the wedding, she's going to know its him dressed up as a woman.\"<br>\r\n\"Well don't you guys live close to here? We should go meet her now.\" Jen said. She just wanted to see her brother sweat. She already knew the story and she also knew that Chris wasn't home.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not back home yet, I will be back on Sunday. I actually just stopped by work to quit and I'm heading back up to grandma's. Mom and dad are still there.\" Michael rambled.<br>\r\n\"Wait, you quit work already? You're pretty sure about this inheritence aren't you?\" Jen was surprised he quit. That made her even more angry thinking about how he wasn't going to work because of all the money he was going to get. <br>\r\nShe also thought about how much more he was going to be around and how it was going to be harder to feminize Chris with him there. She had to keep Michael away for longer. And she knew how. \"STACY!\" She thought.<br>\r\n\"You should go see mom and dad at grandma's, you can follow me up.\" Michael said. He was thinking of ways to keep Jen away from his apartment.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like that's going to happen.\" Jen replied as she sipped her coffee and stood up. She grabbed the rest of her scone and threw it into a nearby trash bin.<br>\r\n\"mom and dad were going to move that Victorian period Armoire and some other pieces of furniture tomorrow, they were thinking of giving you a call if you wanted it.\" Michael tried to sweaten the pot.<br>\r\n\"They're throwing it away?\" She said suddenly interested.<br>\r\n\"Donating it.\" Michael replied.<br>\r\nJen's eyes grew wide and was pissed. \"Oh hell no! That furniture is mine.\" Jen angrilly said.<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want to come up to grandma's house. It's 4 hour ride. You can follow me up, stay the night and then we could remt a truck tomorrow. Do you have anything going on tomorrow?\" Micheal asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh shit the Bridal gown appointment\" Jen thought. \"I'm going to have to reschedule it.\" She continued to think.<br>\r\nShe could rescedule the appointment with Chris for the following week. That's the same week that Chris' parents and ex girlfriend are coming. She laughed in her head as she thought. \"I could just invite them along for the wedding gown appointment. Chris would love that.\" <br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll follow you. I have to swing by my house and grab some overnight clothes and cancel some appointments tomrorow, but everything should be fine. I'll see you up there.\" She said.<br>\r\nMichael was relieved that Jen dropped the subject of meeting his fiancee and was now going to be far away from here for a couple of days.<br>\r\nJen got to her car and unlocked it and got in. She took out her phone and dialed the wedding planner and cancelled their appointment. She told the planner that Christina was very sick with a stomach virus and asked her to reschedule for the following Friday. She hung up with her and then she called Stacy.<br>\r\nShe explained to Stacy that tomorrow was cancelled but she may need Jill to make an appearance for Michael and her parents.<br>\r\nOnce she hung up with her, she lastly dialed Chris.<br>\r\nChris' phone rang and then went to voice mail.<br>\r\n\"Hi, it's Jen. Not sure why you're not answering but I'm going to need you to forget our appointment. I know it's been about an hour but just head home and I'll talk to you later. Also I had to cancel tomorrow. I'll explain everything later.<br>\r\nJen hung up and headed toward her grandmother's house.<br>\r\nMeanwhile Chris was just opening his eyes. He didn't recognize the room that he was in. He was lying down but tried to sit up. As he did he realized that he had some pain around his upper body.<br>\r\nDr Cox entered the room. \"Ahhh, so glad your back with us Christina.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\nChris looked confused and grabbed his chest.<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes everything went as planned...</span></div></div>",

Everything was blurry. <br>\r\nHe could hear Dr. Cox talking to him but was also having trouble speaking.<br>\r\nChris pointed to his throat as he saw the outline of the Doctor standing before him.<br>\r\n\"I know, it really hurts right now. It will clear up in another day or so. While we were doing one procedure we figured we would take care of your throat at the same time. This should really clear up the scratchy feeling you were getting, and give you a more relaxing tone. I think you're going to love it.\" The doctor explained.<br>\r\nChris made a painful face and made a scribble movement with his hand.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you want to write something?\" Dr Cox asked and then looked around the counter top for a pen and paper. She grabbed both and handed it to Chris.<br>\r\nChris looked close up to the paper and started to write.<br>\r\nWhen he was finished he held up the pad so that Dr Cox could read what he wrote. <br>\r\nChris wrote down, \"I didn't think it was going to hurt\" referring to the breast forms that were to be glued to his chest.<br>\r\nDr Cox pulled down the sheet that covered Chris and what he could see was bandages around his chest area.<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll feel a  little discomfort and you have to keep them wrapped for a few days, then slowly they'll start to feel better. You ended up a full B Cup, they look spectacular. You can come back in a week and I'll make sure everything looks good, I also gave you another shot of your medication. I have another perscription for any pain and of course your usual perscription. Just stay up on that. I do see some good results from the pills you've been taking, everything is coming along nicely. Do you have any other questions for me?\"<br>\r\nChris thought Dr Cox was talking about the alergy medication again when she mentioned pills, so he pointed to his nose and gave a thumbs up to her symbolizing that he could definitely breath better.<br>\r\nWhen Chris pointed to his nose Dr Cox thought he was referring to the nose job that they had talked about.<br>\r\nDr Cox laughed, \"Lets get you healed from these procedure and then we'll see about having some other work done.\"<br>\r\nChris was confused by what the Dr said, but was thankful that his vision was strengthening again and he was able to see a litte beter.<br>\r\n\"You've been asleep for some time now, and seeing that you won't be driving, and you live around the corner, we're going to let you walk home and get some rest. I'll finish up writing your perscriptions and you can grab them on the way out. The nurse will be in to help you get dressed, I'll see you soon Christina.\" Dr Cox said as the nurse came in to help Chris out of the hospital gown. Chris stared down on his chest and saw two mounds covered in bandages that weren't there earlier. \"I guess I gotta get used to these breast forms and looking down and seeing them.\" Chris thought.<br>\r\nThe nurse helped him back into his light dress that he wore into the office. He couldn't take his eyes off his chest as the nurse zippered up the back. <br>\r\n\"I won't zipper it up all the way to the top so that it'll stay a little loose for you.\" The nurse explained.<br>\r\nChris thought, \"Instead of having the corset giving me the illusion of breasts he had these pretend breasts, they look so real.\"<br>\r\nThe nurse handed Chris his purse and then helped him to the reception desk again.<br>\r\n\"Here is your perscription and we'll see you again in about a week.\" The receptionist said.<br>\r\nChris was walking in a daze, he grabbed the prescription and put it into  his purse and walked to the door.<br>\r\nDr Cox came to the reception area.<br>\r\n\"You did a wonderful job on her breast implants Dr.\" The receptionist said.<br>\r\n\"I do hope that she likes her new voice also.\" Dr Cox replied.<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right, you did the vocal surgery and the trachea shave too.\" The receptionist replied.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Christina is blossoming into a beautiful woman.\"<br>\r\nThe women watched him leave.<br>\r\nChris was walking really slow still a little discombobulated from the drugs he was given.<br>\r\nHe was wondering why he was not getting to his house, but after awhile he realized that he was walking in the wrong direction. This did seem familar to him as he glanced in a shop window. When he looked inside, he saw a woman in there that looked like Jen.<br>\r\n\"Oh, damn. I know her\" He said to himself as he opened the shop door and walked in.<br>\r\nHe walked up to the woman in the shop who had her back to him and put his hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\nThe woman was starteld and turned around. It wasn't Jen but it was someone who recognized Chris.<br>\r\nUnknowingly, Chris walked straight into the beauty salon that he frequented many times already.<br>\r\n\"Christina!\"  Molly one of the specilalists that had worked on Chris before was the woman he thought was Jen. Soon, all the salon specialists were greeting Chris by the counter.<br>\r\nA few of the woman gathered around Chris as they saw that he wasn't talking. <br>\r\nChris pointed to his throat to tell them that he couldn't speak.<br>\r\n\"Oh you poor thing, well we know what'll cheer you up. Comon' and have a seat.\" The woman said as she walked with Chris to one of the salon chairs. Chris still woozy could do nothing but be pulled to a chair.<br>\r\nAlong the way there, Chris tried to pull away, but he was still really out of it, and before he knew it he was seated at one of the women's stations with a light above him.<br>\r\nOne of the salon women appeared above Chris as he was now laying back in the chair. <br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Veronica. I'm going to finish up with the rest of the electrolysis on your eyebrows and upper lip.\" She started to explain.<br>\r\nChris woozily held up his hands and wiggled his fingers like he did at the dr's office. He tried to get Veronica to give him a pen and paper, but of course, she mistook what he was saying.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you want your nails redone? We can do that too. Also one of the girls was talking about trying some permanent makeup on your lips and maybe some eyelash extensions.\" She continued talking away as Chris shook his head with his eyes wide.<br>\r\nVeronica interupted, \"Now honey, you're going to have to sit still while I do this.\" She said as she started the electrolysis on Chris' eyebrows.<br>\r\n\"As I was saying the permanenet lipstick will be a light shade of pink, So many women love the procedure and with your beautiful plump lips, it'll look amazing. Now just sit back and relax.\" She talked as she continued to zap away at Chris<br>\r\nChris' eyes were still widened and he started to whine.<br>\r\n\"Why me!\" He thought.<br>\r\nVeronica put the zapper down for a minute and picked something else up.<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry sweetheart, how about some music?\" She asked but without waiting for an answer she had already placed earphones on Chris' ears.<br>\r\n\"this way the timie will go faster, or you could just close your eyes til I'm done.\" She said as she pressed play on an ipod and Chris' earphones filled with country music.<br>\r\nChris saw her again pick up the lazer and continue once again on his eyebrows..<br>\r\nChris closed his eyes and wept.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was mid afternoon on Friday, Chris sat at the kitchen table once again sipping a tea with honey in it. His throat was really sore and it hurt worse every time he sipped the tea. He sat in his blue nightgown. It was soft and comfortable and that's exactly what he needed, especailly now with these breasts glued to on his chest. He looked down at his body and he didn't realize until now how he actually filled the chest in the nightie now. The breasts were still bandaged up and that made them stick out from his chest even more. He didn't realize that he unconsciously sat with his legs crossed, but he had been dressed as a woman for a couple of weeks now, it all just seemed normal.<br>\r\nHe tried to pull the top of the bandage so that he could get a better look at the breasts but they were wrapped up tight.<br>\r\nHe thought as he examined them. \"I wonder why she wrapped them up anyway? I guess so that they glue will stick.\"<br>\r\nAs he put his hands underneath the breast though, he didn't understand why they were sore. <br>\r\nHe was really in pain and he began to cry. <br>\r\nHe reached for his purse and pulled out two perscription bottles. He opened the lids on both very carefully as he really couldn't strain himself. He took out some pain pills and the other pills were his alergy aka estrogen. He popped them in his mouth and chased it with some hot tea which really burned and hurt his throat as it went down.<br>\r\nHe saw his phone blinking that he had messages. He put the phone on the counter and his the speaker so he could listen hands free. He really started crying from the pain as the messages started. <br>\r\nThe first message was from Jen explaining that the wedding boutique trip was off and rescheduled until next week.<br>\r\nChris found himself wiping a stream of tears that rolled off his cheeks. He started to get really emotional and he didn't know why. <br>\r\n\"I should be happy about this.\" Chris thought to himself as he still couldn't speak. \"What guy wants to go try on wedding gowns and get upset about not being able to?\" and the more he thought the more tears poured from his eyes.<br>\r\nIt's a good thing he finally checked his phone messages because he also got a message from Michael telling him about quitting his job and staying at his grandparents house with his family for awhile.  He told Chris to call him if he needed him.<br>\r\nChris chuckled a little before another stream of tears poured from his eyes.<br>\r\nHe again thought, \"Need anything? He thought about how so much had happened to him since he and Gwen have been away. Where would he even begin explaining the things that he's been through already. They had no clue that he was pretending to be a woman full time now. They didn't know about his salon trips and the electrolysis done to his face leaving him with permanently thinned eyebrows and smooth skin. <br>\r\nChris dug through his purse and pulled out a compact mirror. He opened it and looked at the results from his recent salon visit.<br>\r\nHe saw his large plump lips and now they had a light pink gloss over them that was his permanent lipstick. His eyes also had eyelash extensions attached to them, making them long and thick. He started to cry again as his face started to become unrecognizable. He was better off not calling Michael and just wait until he came home so he could see everything for himself and maybe together they could figure out this mess. First and foremost they had to figure out how he was going to get his face back to normal once this was over.<br>\r\n\"But with my voice out of commission, I can't call him anyway.\" Chris thought.<br>\r\nHe looked at his throat with the compact mirror. \"What did they do anyway? Remove my tonsils?\" He thought<br>\r\n\"Why don't I ask more questions?\"He laughed to himself.<br>\r\nChris got up and saw the mail on the floor and picked it up. There were more rsvp's for the wedding that he piled together and set them on the table.<br>\r\nSuddenly someone started knocking on the door. Chris got startled and tiptoed to the peekhole. <br>\r\nStanding on his doorstep was the TLC tv crew.<br>\r\nChris' eyes widened, \"Oh no!\" he thought. \"Jen must not have told them that today was off.\"<br>\r\nChris quickly ran into the bedroom and with as much strength as he could, he slipped the nightie off and grabbed a loose t shirt that he painfully slipped over his head and did the same with his arms through the arm holes.<br>\r\nHe didn't want the tv crew to see the bandages around his chest, they would surely question that. He threw on a pain of women's jeans and a pair of sneakers.<br>\r\nHe looked in the mirror and besides the redness from his tears earlier, his face looked pretty good. He grabbed a scrunchie and pulled his hair into a ponytail and ran into the other room.<br>\r\nNow he had to figure out how he was going to talk.<br>\r\nHe noticed a pen and pad that Michael kept near the phone for messages, and he grabbed that.<br>\r\nHe unlocked the door and opened it.<br>\r\n\"Hi Christina! I know we're a little early, but we wanted to get set up.\" The tv woman said as her crew of 3 came into the apartment.<br>\r\n The tv woman realized that something was wrong when Chris only smiled but said nothing, and he began to explain how everything was cancelled for today.<br>\r\n\"Oh you poor thing, did you lose your voice?\" She asked Chris.<br>\r\nChris nodded<br>\r\nSuddenly Jill walked through the door.<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone, Hi Christina.\" She said. \"Oh did I hear crorrectly? You don't have your voice? That's terrible.\" Jill continued as she addressed the camera team.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to say, that Jen had a problem that needed to be taken care of and had to go out of town, she rescheduled the wedding gown date for next week.\" Jill explained<br>\r\n\"Oh that's not good, but at least it'll give Christina a chance to regain her voice.\" The tv woman said.<br>\r\nChris smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n\"But, just because Jen cancelled doesn't mean that we have to waste a day of filming.\" The woman continued.<br>\r\nChris' eyes once again widened.<br>\r\nJill spoke up. \"I was thinking the exact same thing. I think we should...\"</span></div></div>",

She watched as the tv camera crew drove off.<br>\r\nStacy dialed Jen on her phone.<br>\r\nTHe phone was ringing briefly and quickly Jen picked up. \"Hey Stacy!\" <br>\r\n\"Hey Jen.\" Stacy began. Ok, I just wanted to let you know that I was all set to take Christina out tonight. The camera crew was never cancelled for the wedding gown boutique filming so they were going to come along.\" Stacy explained.<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right, I forgot to cancel that, so what happened?\" Jen asked.<br>\r\n\"Well it turns out that the camera crew felt bad for Christina because Chris lost his voice, so they decided it would be cruel to take him out if he couldn't speak, so they left and so did I.\" Stacy explained.<br>\r\n\"Lost his voice? Chris' voice was fine yesterday. I wonder what happened.\" Jen said.<br>\r\n\"Not sure, but he was dressed with his face all made up when we got there, but just couldn't speak\" Stacy continued.<br>\r\n\"Do you think he was faking it so that he didn't have to go out and you guys would leave?\" Jen planted the thought in Stacy's head.<br>\r\nStacy thought for a minute. \"Do you think? I'm not sure, he did seem legit.\" Stacy said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, but think of it from his point of view. Here's a guy pretending to be a woman and doesn't want to be filmed so he has to think of a way to get out of it. Faking laryngitis is a perfect solution.' Jen replied.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that's true.\" Stacy said.<br>\r\n\"Go up to his window and do some snooping. Peek in, but don't get caught, see what he's up to.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll go check it out. I'll call you back when if I find out anything.\" Stacy replied.<br>\r\n\"talk to you later.\" Jen said and hung up.<br>\r\nStacy started her car and then drove away from Chris' apartment. She drove around the corner and then once again pulled over and parked. She locked the doors and made her way back to Chris' apartment.<br>\r\nShe walked up the front stairs and saw that his light was still on.<br>\r\nThere were two windows, one was for the living room and one was in the bedroom. It was the bedroom light that was on so Stacy crept up to that window. <br>\r\nShe peered into the apartment by squinting her eyes and looking through the blinds but still she had a good view of Chris.<br>\r\nHe was just starting to get undressed.<br>\r\nChris was slowly taking off his shirt but it looked painful to her.<br>\r\nHe grabbed the shirt by the collar and stopped,  He stood there and took a deep breath and with one quick swipe he removed the tshirt from his body.<br>\r\n\"Well, that was dramatic.\" Stacy thought.<br>\r\nWhen Chris stood up right he was facing away from the window. She saw that it looked like he had something wrapped around his upper body. It looked like ace bandage.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of what looked like him being in pain, he turned and faced the window area.<br>\r\nStacy's eyes widened as she saw Chris' front was wrapped too, but sticking out from the wrap was clearly large breasts.<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Stacy thought.<br>\r\nQuickly she took out her cell phone and snapped as many pictures as she could before Chris finally turned around towards the bed.<br>\r\nShe saw Chris pick up a blue night gown. He tried to not raise his arms above his head because it looked like that's what was giving him the most pain, when he raised his arms.<br>\r\nHe placed the night gown opening at the top of his head and pulled down the gown. He straightened it and it reached a little passed his hips.<br>\r\n\"Oh I gotta send these pictures to Jen.\" She thought as she walked away from the apartment and back towards her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen was sitting in her grandmother's attic going through some old chests that were stored up there when her phone vibrated and  notified her that she had a new text message.<br>\r\nShe hit the download button and after about a minute, she stared at three pictures clearly taken from the outside of a window looking in. But she clearly saw a woman in her bedroom with ace bandage around her large chest. <br>\r\nJen's eyes widened when she realized that the woman in the picture was Chris.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" Jen said out loud.<br>\r\nImmediately Jen got out of the text message and dialed her office.<br>\r\nThe receptionist answered, \"Hello, Dr Reynolds office.\" <br>\r\n\"Hi, it's Jen. Is Dr Cox there?\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Hi Dr, yes hold please.\" The receptionist said and then put Jen on hold.<br>\r\nAfter about two minutes the phone picked up again.<br>\r\n\"Hello Jen.\" Dr Cox said with a sort of attitude<br>\r\n\"Dr. Cox, did you do breast forms on one of my patients?\" Jen said with a stern voice.<br>\r\nThe phone was silent. \" Your patient? Christina is my patient. And what are you talking about breast forms. You know damn well you send her in yesterday to have her breast implants done.\" Dr Cox replied also with a stern voice.<br>\r\nJen's face had a big grin on it. She cuffed the phone to hide her giggles.<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD! HE HAS BREAST IMPANTS!\" Jen thought.<br>\r\nAfter a minute to control her laughter she uncuffed the phone again, \"Well, she was my patient and I don't want you doing any more work on her.\" Jen said, again smiling while trying to sound mad.<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, she perfers me. I'm just waiting until her breasts and vocal cords heal and then we are planning on some facial surgeries.\" Dr Cox explained.<br>\r\nJen's eyes widened and again tried not to laugh.<br>\r\n\"Now if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to get some work done.\" Dr Cox said and then hung up the phone.<br>\r\nJen put her phone down and again had a good laugh.<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this. This is a dream come true.\" Jen thought. \"Not only was the plan working to make Chris into Christina, but now I can get rid of Dr. Cox out of my practice for negligence. WHen Chris realizes they are real breasts, and she messed with his vocal cords, not to mention any other things she's planning on doing to him,  he'll surely sue Dr. Cox and I'll finally be able to fire her.\" She continued to plan.<br>\r\n\"But I have to keep making Chris believe that the breasts are only breast forms glued to his chest. That way he won't freak out just yet. Then when everything comes out I won't get in any trouble because it wasn't me that did any permanent work on Chris' body it was all Dr. Cox.\" Jen started to laugh again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the next 4 days Chris spent in bed. He had been a wreck, both physically and emotionally. He was never one to slip into a depression so this was all new to him and he couldn't figure out what was wrong with him. The last 3 days he spent his days lounging on the couch in front of the tv. slipping in and out of consciousness. What concerned him most is that he had no energy and no appitite. His breakfast lunch and dinner consisted of a handful of pain pills mixed with his daily estrogen disguised as an allegry medicine.<br>\r\nHe lounged everyday in a large t shirt and sweat pants. They were the most comfortable and they caused him the least amount of pain. <br>\r\nChris had tried to throw on a pair of jeans but got upset at how tight his normal fitting jeans had gotten, so he never took the sweats off.<br>\r\nChris also had a sore throat. It had felt that way since the doctor worked on him last Thursday.<br>\r\nThis was the first day that the constant pain to his throat had lightened up and it actually felt better than it has.<br>\r\nJen had been texting Chris from her grandparents house. She wanted to make sure that he rested while his body healed. She made sure no one bothered him, which included the TLC people, and Stacy until she returned. She also didn't want him speaking so she started texting him.<br>\r\nThis morning was different then the past few. Chris sat up from the couch and took a deep breath. He stared down at his chest. He felt through the bandages and realized that the soreness wasn't as bad as it had been in previous days.<br>\r\nChris stood up and stretched. His balance was a little off as he hasn't used his feet too often in days.<br>\r\nHis phone started to buzz as he received a text from Jen.<br>\r\n\"Hey Chris, I'm on my way over. I've got something that will make your throat feel better and help your situation. Leave the door unlocked, I'm almost there.\"<br>\r\nChris made his way into the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror. Actually, make that \"herself\". It had been a few days since Chris had looked at himself in the mirror, let alone made his face up or done anything with his hair but he still looked like a very attractive female. His eyebrows were still thinly arched and had almost forgotten about the permanent lipstick, and longer eyelashes. He looked very pale even with his new permanent features. <br>\r\nThe thing that upset him the most was because of his lack of exercise, he was putting on some pounds around his hips. He realized this when he tried to wear his jeans. His legs went into the jeans but he could only pull the jeans just below his hips because they seemed wider.<br>\r\n\"I definitely need to hit the gym\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\nChris thought that this didn't make any sense as he lifted the large tshirt that he had been lounging in for the last 4 days and he saw that his stomach was still flat.<br>\r\nChris fiddled with his hair a little but being he hadn't washed it in a few days he couldn't make it look good so he pulled it back into a ponytai.<br>\r\nHe examined his face closely and didn't see any stubble or facial hair. The electrolysis had done it's job and made his face smooth and hairless.<br>\r\nChris started to get upset again. Then he took a deep breath and thought again about the money.<br>\r\n\"Gotta make this believable, so I gotta do what I gotta do.\" He thought.<br>\r\n\"This is all reversable, this is all reversable\" he kept running through his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Jen had just pulled up to Chris' apartment. She parked and then opened a <br>\r\nbag that contained a perscription bottle in it. The bottle had little written on it, but it did have Christina Mullens name that Jen had typed on it.<br>\r\nIt also had a long medical name that Jen made up, and in parentheses it said throat spray. 1 dosage every day.<br>\r\nJen knew that she couldn't come out and tell Chris that he had vocal cord surgery making his voice more feminine and shaving his adam's apple, so she had to make him believe that the medicine in the bottle would be the reason that his voice sounded female.<br>\r\nJen shook the bottle which only contained a mixture of honey,lemon juice, water and some of the numbing solution that some dentists use. Jen had put them all together into a fake mixture that she was going to introduce to Chris. She just had to make this believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of the car and walked up to the apartment and walked into the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina?\" Jen called.<br>\r\nChris entered from the bedroom and didn't answer her but made a face because she had called him Christina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen's eyes widened. She couldn't believe how Chris looked. She had not seen Chris since before his procedure and <br>\r\nHere he was looking more feminine then when she last saw him. She immediately noticed his longer eyelashes, and lack of facial hair, but the thing that shocked her the most was his shapely body. She had seen the pictures that Stacy had taken through the window blinds but now she was seeing this close up and couldn't believe that Chris had real breasts.<br>\r\nShe tried not to make a big deal about it.<br>\r\n\"Awww, still not talking?\" She asked<br>\r\nChris shook his head and tried to say something in a whisper. But Jen stopped him.<br>\r\n\"I have just the thing for you.\" Jen replied as she produced the perscription bottle.<br>\r\n\"This medicine is amazing. It soothes your throat and also tightens the vocal cords making your voice sound more female.\" She explained.<br>\r\nChris made a non believing face and he handed the bottle back to her.<br>\r\n\"No really!\" Jen replied as she left the room.<br>\r\nJen took the bottle and went into the kitchen and grabbed a spoon. She opened the top of the perscription bottle and poured out a large dosage onto the spoon.<br>\r\n\"Now come here and take your medicine.\" <br>\r\nChris walked over and took the spoon from her. Jen noticed his long finger nails.<br>\r\nChris smelled the spoon. It did have a strong lemon smell to it.<br>\r\n\"If we're going to fool a lot of people including your parents and ex girlfriend, then you have to sound the part.\" JEn explained.<br>\r\nChris thought for a minute. He had forgotten that his parents and ex girlfriend would be coming soon.<br>\r\nWIthout a second thought he drank the concoction from the spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't make a face but pointed to his throat as he felt the immediate numbing to it.<br>\r\n\"It feels weird, right?\" Jen noted.<br>\r\nChris nodded.<br>\r\n\"Ok, let it coat the throat and give it a minute.\" Jen explained. She was dragging this out but was really anticipating hearing CHris' voice since Dr. Cox had worked on his vocal cords.<br>\r\nJen poured a cup of water and told Chris to take a sip, and start to clear his throat.<br>\r\nChris sipped the water and then made a noise like clearing his throat. <br>\r\n\"Ok, now. Slowly try to say my name is Christina Mullens.\" Jen said.<br>\r\nChris was hesitant. He once again tried to clear his throat. He hadn't talked for days because of the pain, and now this medicine was suppose to make his voice sound feminine.<br>\r\n\"Comon' Chris, say your female name.\" Jen encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris looked at her and said \"Hi, my name is Christina Mullens\" Quickly Chris covered his mouth and his eyes grew wide. He noticed that Jen was as shocked as he was.<br>\r\nChris' voice was definitely higher pitched. It didn't sound high like sucking in helium, but maybe a octave lower than that. It was higher than his regular male voice.<br>\r\nJen thought in her head. \"Success! His vocal surgery had given him a clearly feminine sounding voice.<br>\r\nChris started to go into panic mode. \"Oh my God! Is my voice stuck like this, I sound almost like minnie mouse. What am I going to do?\"<br>\r\n\"Chris, calm down, calm down. Everything is going to be alright. The medicine is just doing it's job.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\n\"So if I stop taking it, my voice will go back to normal?\" he asked.<br>\r\nJen swallowed hard. \"Yes, but that's not what we want right now. Look, we have to make this believable. You have the looks down, and now you have the voice. We can work on deepening it a little.\" Jen continued to try and ease chris' panic.<br>\r\n\"Ease it how?\" Chris said as his voice was squeeky and high.<br>\r\n\"Just whispery. Just talk lower. Don't talk like your in a panic, talk quieter and slower.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris calmed himself down. He took a deep breath and then took another sip of water from his cup. He closed his eyes and said, \"Hi, my name is Christina Mullens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he had said it a little lower and quieter and it did sound like a natural woman's voice.<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes and both of them smiled.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! This is unbelievable.\" He said again.<br>\r\n\"Now we're gettting somewhere, and I'm sure it's better to be able to talk.\" Jen asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, you have no idea. After the breast forms were attached to my chest, I was kind of loopy and I made my way back to the salon.\" Chris began.<br>\r\nJen had a shocked look, but was laughing inside.<br>\r\n\"They attached eyelash extensions to my lashes, and did a permanant lipstick on my lips. She said it was a light shade, but look at them. Now they permanantly look like they're coated.\" Chris explained.<br>\r\n\"Well, we can look at getting all this reversed once you and Michael have the check, but that's only after the wedding. Now if there's going to be a wedding, you need that dress. So I\"m going to have to make an appointment with the wedding gown boutique again.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\nChris frowned.<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. Why don't you get in the shower and I'll call right now.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\nCHris finally started feeling good again, that is, until he walked into the bedroom and dropped his sweats to the floor, and removed his top. He looked in the mirror and saw that his body was starting to resemble a woman's. He had the larger hips and his upper body had breasts wrapped in a surgical pads. Not to mention the female face that he's stared at from the beginning.<br>\r\nHe tried not to think about it and put a water proof top on and started the shower.<br>\r\nMeanwhile Jen was just hanging up the phone with the wedding planner. She had made the wedding gown appointment again and it was this coming Friday.<br>\r\nShe dialed another number,<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are you please with the tone? She asked.<br>\r\n\"Very, in fact I'd like to talk to you about having more work done.\" Jen said, trying not to laugh.<br>\r\n\"There's still many surgeries we can do, We've talked aobut a nose job to give you a smaller nose, we can do your jaw, or your cheekbones, fat grafting.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\n\"I want it all! I want to be as feminine as possible\" Jen replied and then added a bubbly laugh.<br>\r\nDr. Cox laughed. \"Well, lets do one thing at a time. As far as your breasts, it has been a few days, but I just want to make sure there's no problems. Why don't you come down to see me as soon as you can. My next few hours are free, and I can see you, is that ok?\" Dr. Cox asked the fake Christina<br>\r\n\"Perfect, see you soon.\" Jen continued and hung up the phone.<br>\r\nJen thought to herself, \"This is perfect, Dr. Cox can get the bandages off and let those beautiful breasts breath. I'm real anxious to see them, and more anxious to see Chris in some low cut tops and tight dresses. He'll be a hit at the bridal boutique.\" Jen continued to think about how feminine Chris was going to be once this was all over.<br>\r\nChris' phone started to buzz on the table. He was getting a text.<br>\r\nShe picked up his phone and saw that it was Michael.<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy, I'm coming home tonight around 6 pm. Want to do dinner?\" The text read.<br>\r\nQuickly Jen text him back.<br>\r\n\"looking forward to it man, I have some surprises for you.\" She wrote back as Chris.<br>\r\n\"Cool. See you tonight man.\" Michael wrote back.<br>\r\nJen thought again, \"Everything is just falling into place.'<br>\r\nJen quickly picked up her phone and dialed the TLC people.<br>\r\n\"Hi this is Jennifer Reynolds, my friend Christina Mullens is being filmed for the new bridal show. She explained. \"Oh hi, yes I remember you.\" She replied as the woman from the show had also remembered her. She explained about Michael coming home tonight and it would be worth filming. \"Great I'll see you at 5.\" Jen hung up.<br>\r\nShe heard the bathroom door creek and Chris peeked out. \"Who were you talking to?\" he asked.<br>\r\nJen thought fast \"That was the office, they were just telling me about a patient. Oh and the receptionist said that Dr. Cox has nothing on her plate this morning and I was thinking maybe you go in and have the wraps removed, what do you think?\" Jen asked.<br>\r\nChris' eyes grew wide. \"Oh you think they would? That would be great! I don't see why they had to wrap them up anyway.\" Chris asked.<br>\r\n\"That was just so the glue would stick, you'll see. It'll be so worth it. They're going to look and feel just like real breasts.\" Jen explained trying not to smile.<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll get dressed and head down there.\" Chris said very excited and his voice sounded very high as he did.<br>\r\n\"perfect!\" Jen added.<br>\r\nAbout a half hour later with Jen's help, Chris was dressed. Chris still needed help getting dressed as it still caused a little pain lifting his arms over his head.<br>\r\nThey kept everything comfortable for Chris though. He had on a big tshirt and a pair of pink sweat pants.<br>\r\nHe wore a little makeup after not doing so for a few days, but actually a little was all he needed with his permanent lipstick. Jen put a little color into his cheeks, and some mascara for his eyes. She didn't do anything other than a ponytail for his hair,so they wouldn't waste any time. Jen had plans to book another hair appointment anyway before his wedding gown fitting. <br>\r\nHe carried a small beige purse that he had the strap hanging from his arm.<br>\r\nThe two women made their way onto main street and were coming up to Jen's office.<br>\r\n\"Ok, now remember,  ask Dr. Cox to remove the wraps. Tell her there is minimal pain but you're ready to see your breasts. Oh and also see if maybe she can book you to get that deviated septum worked on.\" Jen slyly added.<br>\r\nChris looked at Jen strange for a minute and wondered how she knew about what he had talked about with Dr. Cox.<br>\r\n\"I've been breathing really good lately, I'm not sure if that's necessary anymore.\" Chris replied.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you should so you wont have any problems. Just tell her that you want some nose work done next.\" Jen said. <br>\r\nChris looked around, \"I wish you were going in there with me. I hate doing this girly stuff alone.\" Chris commented.<br>\r\n\"Well, I have to make a few calls, but I'll see you soon enough. Now get in there and get those uncomfortable wraps off.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\nChris was on his way.<br>\r\nHe opened the door to the dr. office and was greeted by the receptionist.<br>\r\nImmediately Chris noticed how beautiful she looked. But was thinking really strange thoughts about seeing her this time. He thought about how good her hair looked and wondered if she got it done with the place he used a few buildings down. <br>\r\n\"Why am I concerned about who did her hair? She's a hottie!\" he quickly tried to change his attitude.<br>\r\nUpon seeing Christina come through the door. The receptionist smiled and was happy to see her.<br>\r\n\"I'll let Dr. Cox know you're here.\" Then the receptionist closed the window at her desk.<br>\r\nChris smiled and then sat in one of the waiting room chairs. He sat nervously with his legs together and his purse on his lap.<br>\r\nDr. Cox opened the reception area door and looked out. <br>\r\n\"hello Christina. How are we doing today?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Hello Dr. Thank you for seeing me.\" Chris replied in a controlled voice which wasn't as high as before.<br>\r\n\"I love the voice, I'm glad everything there turned out nice.\" She added as she held the door open for Chris.<br>\r\nChris followed her to the back.<br>\r\nDr Cox led Chris into one of the examination rooms. \"Ok, Christina dear. Slip out of those clothes, but this time I'm just going to have you sit in your underware on the examination table. I'll be back in a few minutes.\" Dr. Cox explained.<br>\r\nDr. Cox closed the door behind her and left Chris to once again undress but this time, he was just sitting in his underware. It was the Victoria's Secret soft cotton Panties that Jen had bought for him. <br>\r\nIt didn't take Chris long to undress as he only had the t shirt and sweats on at this appointment. <br>\r\nHe sat up on the table in just his purple panties and crossed his legs. His smooth hairless legs looked shapely as he followed his eyes up to his thigh. It looked very curvy and it looked like his ass had swelled slightly.<br>\r\nHe wondered what was going on and he hoped that the doctor had some answers.<br>\r\nSoon enough, the Dr opened the door again and entered with a chart and a cart with some surgical things on it.<br>\r\n\"Ok, Christina, lie back and face me please.\" Dr Cox ordered.<br>\r\nChris lay back on the table and bought his feet up to the examination table also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so now I'm going to cut through the wraps and bandages. I'm going to do it layer by layer. Looking from the top peeking down, I see very little brusing.\" Dr Cox explained.<br>\r\n\"Ok, dr. that's fine, I just want the bandages off.\" CHris said excitedly in a high pitch.<br>\r\nDr. Cox grabbed some scissors and slowly started to cut away at the bandages that wrapped around Chris.<br>\r\nChris watch carefully as he felt her cut a layer, he felt that he could breath better. It was definitely feeling less tight.<br>\r\nMinute by minute Dr. Cox cut through each layer of bandage that was wrapped around Chris' chest.<br>\r\nAs each one was cut, Chris felt a little more relief, until finally, Dr Cox cut the last wrap and removed it from over Chris' chest.<br>\r\nChris leaned his head forward and looked straight at his chest. His eyes bulged at the size of them.<br>\r\n\"Now Christina, I'm going to help you sit up. I want you to do this slowly. Then once your sitting up, I will test your chest for sensitivity.\" Dr Cox explained.<br>\r\nDr. Cox grabbed Chris' arm and pulled slowly. Chris helped also with little pressure. It still hurt to use any upper body muscle but if he went slow it didn't hurt as bad.<br>\r\nFinally the two got Chris sitting up.<br>\r\nChris looked down at his chest.<br>\r\nJutting out from his front were the two most beautiful, firm breasts that Chris had ever seen. It was a weird feeling looking down and seeing what looked like real breasts sitting on his own chest.<br>\r\n\"Wow! They look so real. I can't even see the part where the glue is.\" Chris thought to himself.<br>\r\n\"Ok, Now I'm going to test them for sensitivity.\" Dr Cox explained and then began touching Chris' nipples. <br>\r\nChris felt everything perfectly. He got a strange feeling as she pinched his nipple. <br>\r\nDr. cox started to explain to Chris things that he could and couldn't do, but Chris was just amazed at how real the fake breasts looked he was in a trance.<br>\r\nOf course unknown to him, they were his real breasts. He hadn't seen the incision that was made under his arm.<br>\r\nHe snapped out of it as he finally heard Dr. Cox again, \"Do you have any questions for me?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris heard Jen's voice in his head before the appointment what she had said, \"Well I would like my nose worked on, would it be possible to schedule something now?\"  Chris asked.<br>\r\nDr. Cox smiled. \"Of course, we'll do everything that we talked about. I can put you on the schedule for 2 weeks from now, cause We need you to take care of these first.\" She said pointing to his breasts.<br>\r\n\"Geez\" , he thought. \"The glue seems to be holding, what else is she worried about?\"<br>\r\nThe doctor was working on something at the exam desk, while Chris kept feeling his chest.<br>\r\nTHe doctor turned around and faced Chris. \"Ok, dear, lean over on your side and let me see your thigh.\"<br>\r\nChris did as he was told and leaned on the examination table to the side.<br>\r\n\"Might as well keep up with your shot while you're here. Everything looks beautiful.\" She added as she injected a needle into his thigh. Once again, Chris got his hormone injection<br>\r\nChris figurd the shots were working because he was breathing really well lately. <br>\r\n\"Now please stand, so that I can take some measurements.\" The Dr. said.<br>\r\nChris held onto the examnination table as he stood up. His whole center of gravity was thrown off with these large breasts finally free and adding weight to his chest.<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe how firm they were. The doctor wrapped a measuring tape around his hips, and around his chest.<br>\r\n\"You are really looking so much better Christina. How are you feeling?\" Dr. Cox added when she took the measurements and wrote them into her chart.<br>\r\nChris sighed. <br>\r\n\"I'm not going to lie, I had a rough week. With not being able to talk, to being in pain, and then finally talking and hearing my voice. The week had me really depressed.\" Chris spoke honestly.<br>\r\nThe doctor looked on as Chris spoke with concern. \"Well, it is normal with what you're going through have have depressing thoughts. It's not healthy, which is why I would like you to talk to someone. and I have the right person you should talk to. She's someone who specilizes in what you're going through.\" Dr. Cox explained.<br>\r\n\"What is she a shrink?\" Chris replied. \"What would I need to talk to a psychiatrist for?\" He added.<br>\r\n\"Well, she can talk about everything that's on your mind and help you adjust to the new additions.\" Dr. Cox replied while referring to Chris' chest.<br>\r\nChris thought that might be a good idea. \"I do have to have these breast forms attached for 6 months, maybe someone could talk to me and make me feel a little better about the situation.\" He continued to think in his head.<br>\r\n\"Ok, that would be great.\" He told Dr. Cox<br>\r\n\"I'll set you up with an appointment day after tomorrow.\" She said as she wrote down something quickly. \"Here is her address, she is really good. She'll really make things comfortable for you.\" Dr. Cox replied.<br>\r\n\"You can get dressed again\", she finished <br>\r\nChris pulled up his sweat pants again and before he could put on his t shirt the doctor approached him.<br>\r\nShe had a support bra in her hands.<br>\r\n\"This is so they'll feel good and also look good.\" Dr. Cox said as she placed the cups around each breast. She then connected the straps and just like that, Chris' real breasts were cupped in a bra.<br>\r\n\"They look amazing!\" Dr. Cox <br>\r\nChris put his tshirt on and Dr. Cox once again showed Chris to the reception waiting area.<br>\r\n\"Ok Christina dear, we'll see you in a couple of weeks. Just remember not to overdo it and enjoy.\" Dr. Cox said as Chris walked out of the office.<br>\r\nChris made it as far as the sidewalk, when he opened up his purse and took out his phone. He texted Jen to see where she was.<br>\r\nSeconds later, Jen texted back. \"Are you finished?\"<br>\r\nChris wrote back, \"yes, where are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Come to the salon, we're getting tanned today.\" She wrote.<br>\r\nChris rolled his eyes.<br>\r\nHe walked a few stores down until he reached the salon door. <br>\r\n\"This is starting to be routine..a doctor's appaointment and then the salon, dr appointment, salon.\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\nHe pulled open the door and entered the salon.<br>\r\nChris received the usual reception. Everyone knew him and were glad to see him.<br>\r\n\"Well if a large cable channel was fitting the bill everytime I walked in the place, I'd be happy to see me too.\" He thought as he smiled at the receptionist.<br>\r\nAnother women who worked on him before came over.<br>\r\n\"Oh Christina,  your lips look amazing. They turned out so well.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you.\" Chris replied.<br>\r\nFinally through the crowd Chris saw Jen and standing next to her was Jill Parks.<br>\r\n\"This sucks!\" he continued to think. I thought it was going to be Jen and we could talk freely, and now I have to turn on the charm.\" <br>\r\nChris walked over to Jen and Jill who stood up as they were waiting for Chris to arrive.<br>\r\nChris noticed that they already had robes on.<br>\r\n\"Hi Christina. How are  you feeling?\" Jill said.<br>\r\nChris smiled \"So much better Jill, nice to see you again. Did Jen tell you that the gown fitting is back on for Friday?\" Chris really turned on the charm so that Jill would see that he was excited about the wedding.<br>\r\n \"That's great! DId Jen tell you what were doing today?\" Jill asked.<br>\r\n\"I think we're getting a tan, right?\" Chris replied as Jen put a bag into Chris' arms.<br>\r\n\"Go into the back and put this on.\" Jen commanded.<br>\r\nChris was on his way to the dressing room. Well at least he would be able to put a robe on too. <br>\r\nHe opened the bag but didn't see a robe. Instead Chris saw a light blue women's 2 piece bikini.<br>\r\nChris held them up and both pieces seemed really small.<br>\r\n\"Oh you've got to be kidding me.\" He said.<br>\r\nMeanwhile <br>\r\n\"it took everything for me to not say something about his breasts! I can't believe they're real. I bet they look amazing. This plan is really coming along prefectly.\" Stacy sadi breaking out of the Jill character.<br>\r\n\"We're going to see soon enough. Wait til he comes out in the bikini. You'll get to see his curves.\" Jen replied.<br>\r\n\"What's the plan for the rest of the day?\" Stacy asked.<br>\r\n\"After the tanning, the stylist wants to lighten his hair some more. Then we go and pick up our dress for dinner tonight, and then back to the house for Michael's big return.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\n\"Now I'll be joining the TLC crew and follow their date, but you can't right?\" Stacy asked.<br>\r\n\"No, I can't let my brother see me. But you'll be there so that Michael will be thrown off. The best part of it will be that Chris won't be able to explain anything to Michael, only in bits and pieces until later. My brother is going to be so confused.\" Jen explained.<br>\r\n\"Aren't you afraid Chris will mention you to your brother?\" Stacy asked.<br>\r\n\"I guess we'll just cross that bridge when we get to it.\" Jen replied as she looked passed Stacey to see Chris exit from the changing room.<br>\r\nChris looked amazing in the small bikini. Both women stared at him. It was hard to believe that this was a 20 something male in the salon.<br>\r\nThe bikini showed off the breasts nicely. The top had the breasts popping out giving a nice clevage show.  The bottoms were small and had some fringe around the bottom. Chris looked like a young woman<br>\r\nChris was absolutely embarrassed. He had never worn something so revealing before. Now with the breasts he couldn't believe how hot he actually looked.. He had to pull his penis between his legs and tape it down in order to get the flat look on the bottoms of the bikini, and it worked nicely. <br>\r\nThe bikini was the only thing on his body, except for the women's engagement ring.<br>\r\n\"Wow! You look beautiful.\" Jen said.<br>\r\nImmediately a salon worker walked over and let the three ladies to the tanning boothes.<br>\r\nEach of them was given a pair of goggles and sunscreen.<br>\r\nJen and Jill dropped their robes and started to apply the sunscreen and Chris did the same.<br>\r\nEach of the women opened up their booth and applied the goggles to their eyes and laid down and closed the lid.<br>\r\nOne of the salon workers set the timer and told them she would be back soon.<br>\r\nSome time later, Chris was at the next station looking down at his beautifully tanned arm. He was at the dye station. The stylist was giving him more platinum for his blonde.<br>\r\nWhile one women set the dye on his head, another women worked on making up his face. She looked at him while holding a pallet of colors. She brushed a pink lipstick on his lips and some light blush on his cheeks.<br>\r\nChris couldn't believe he was getting another makeover. As he sighed and rolled his eyes. Looking past the makeup artist working on him, he saw Jill and Jen watching him and waving.<br>\r\nChris smiled largely. He didn't want Jill to think he wasn't enjoying this.<br>\r\nA little bit more later and Jill and Jen were greeting Christina again at the salon entrance.<br>\r\nChris was glad to be out of the bikini and back into his tshirt and sweats. His long blonde hair was very platinum. His face was flawless.<br>\r\nJen smiled. \"Time to get you dressed.\"<br>\r\nChris' eyes widened.<br>\r\nEven more later. Chris and Jen were in Chris' bedroom. Jen was putting two diamond earrings into each ear. She picked up a perfume bottle and squeezed it on Chris' neck.<br>\r\nJen turned him around to face the mirror with her.<br>\r\nChris as usual was shocked by his look. <br>\r\nHe was in a low neck red mini dress. His breasts were coming out the top. His hips showed off in the dress as it fit around his body snuggly. His newly colored hair was long and curley and came down his back.. On his feet were also red heeled shoes.<br>\r\nJill was out in the living room with the TLC crew who had just finished setting up. <br>\r\nA crew memeber knocked on the bedroom door. <br>\r\n\"He's just pulling up\" He said.<br>\r\nJen called out, \"Ok!\"<br>\r\nChris went into panic mode. He was just told about Micheal's return and now for the first time, Michael was going to see Chris. <br>\r\n\"Calm down, you're going to be fine.\" Jen said <br>\r\nChris sighed and then exited the bedroom. <br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\nMichael was just coming up the steps. Finally getting home, it was going to be good to relax and watch some of the game tonight. He put his key in the lock, opened the door and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Michael  entered the apartment he was immediately blinded by the camera lights. <br>\r\n\"What's going on? What happened?\" Was Michael's first response as he held his hand over his eyes to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera team pulled a light back and off Michael's eyes as he slowly focussed again.<br>\r\n\"Pull back a little, camera 2 zoom in on Christina.\" A voice said.<br>\r\nMichael still couldn't make out anybody as he saw an apartment full of cameras and people.<br>\r\n\"Cue Christina.\" One man said<br>\r\nChris took a deep breath and rushed into Michaels arms. <br>\r\nMichael was pushed back a little.<br>\r\n\"What the?\" He began to say as Chris immediately forced his lips onto Michaels and kissed him.<br>\r\nMichael opened his eye as he was being kissed to see who this woman was while his mind raced. \"Was I in the right apartment?\" He thought. \"Who is this woman?\" He continued to think. <br>\r\nThen as the woman still kissed him Michael's thoughts turned to thoughts of \"Who cares?\" As he quickly began to kiss Chris back pasionately.<br>\r\nJen peeked out of the bedroom and got a huge smile on her face as she saw Michael kissing his best friend Chris.<br>\r\nNow Chris was the surprised one as he opened his eyes and without thinking, his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael took this as an invitation for his tongue to enter the woman's mouth. As he more pasionately kissed Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris finally broke the kiss off  and leaned his head and massive blonde hair against Michel's chest.<br>\r\n\"Aaand Cut!\" The TLC director shouted.<br>\r\nQuickly camera crews began moving the camera's and lights out of the apartment.<br>\r\n\"Ok, lets give them a few minutes to catch up, Christina you've got 3 minutes. The limo just pulled up to take you two out to dinner. A camera guy and sound guy are going to ride with you, and we'll be following in our van. We'll meet you at the restaruant.\" The TLC producer explained as she was gathering up some final things.<br>\r\nMichael stared at the beautiful woman in front of him. Chris quickly turned his back to him. After everything he had been through, he was embarrassed for Michael to see him as he was.<br>\r\nMost importantly, he wanted the producer out of the house so he could quickly explain everything to Michael.<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\nThe producer saw Christina still holding onto Michael and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally gathered up all her paperwork for the show and opened the door and closed it behind her.<br>\r\nJust as quick as that happened, Chris pushed off from Michael's chest.<br>\r\nIn his high pitch voice he yelled which ended up sounding more squeeky than yelling, \"What the fuck dude! Tongue? Seriously?\"<br>\r\nMichael was getting slapped by this hot tanned blonde woman in this short mini dress. All he could focus on was her cleavage  as she continued to come at him with slaps.<br>\r\n\"Wait, hold on..I don't know what's going on!\" He tried to explain. \"I've been away\" He said as he tried to block the hits.<br>\r\nJen was peaking out of the bedroom the whole time, and tried to keep her laughter from revealing that she was still in the apartment. If Michael had seen her everything would be ruined.<br>\r\n\"I don't know who you are.\" Michael said and that made Chris' hits stop coming.<br>\r\nMichael had been slapped into the corner and Chris stood in front of him with his hands on his hips.<br>\r\nChris knew that he had changed a lot since Michael last saw him but couldn't believe that his friend still believed him to be a woman.<br>\r\n\"You're very beautiful.\" Michael said.<br>\r\nAt this point, with everything that's been done to him and all the hormones that have been injected into him, Chris looked at Michael and broke down crying. \"You asshole....!\" He began....</span></div></div>",

Now how am I supposed to let MIchael know what's going on without revealing to Jill that I'm really a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris quickly wiped the tears from his eyes. \"Hello Miss Parks, I was just saying hi to Michael., I'm so happy he's here!\" Chris explained and then once again walked over and grabbbed Michael around the waist.<br>\r\nJill saw the encounter between the two of them and knew that her timing was perfect and that Chris didn't have a chance to explain to Michael who he really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris again broke the embrace from Michael and walked once again towards the bedroom. \"I just have to get my purse and then we can be off. Jill, why don't you introduce yourself to Michael.\"<br>\r\nChris disappeared into the bedroom and hoped that Jill would mention the name Christina Mullens to Michael and then he would know that I had to pretend to be a woman and then he would know who I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was greeted by Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God Jen! This is a disaster! I can't get alone with Michael to let him know anything that's going on. Have I really changed so much that he doesn't realize that I'm Chris?\" Chris explained in a paniced high pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well with the electrolysis, the collegen in your lips, your breast forms and altered voice, I can't see why he would think you were Chris. But we can't break character now. Here's your lipstick, you have to fix your lips..\" Jen said as she handed handed the tube to Chris while she held his purse. <br>\r\nJen looked down into Chris' purse and saw a perscription bottle. It was issued by her doctor's office to Miss Christina Mullens, and as Jen read on, she saw that the perscription was for a powerful Estrogen.<br>\r\nJen's eyes grew wide.<br>\r\n\"Christina, how long have you been taking these?\" She saw Chris at the vanity mirror expertly putting on his lipstick.<br>\r\nChris looked over at what Jen was talking about. \"Oh, my allergy medicine? I've been taking that for a few weeks now.<br>\r\nI didn't want you to know that another doctor perscribed me medicine. I hope you're not mad.\" Chris explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen smiled an evil smile. \"I'm not mad at all. Are the pills working?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely, I haven't sneezed in awhile and I can breath easier too.\" Chris explained. \"Actually I haven't taken them today, I probably should before I go\" Chris continued.<br>\r\nJen handed the bottle to Chris as Chris disappeared into the bathroom for a cup of water.<br>\r\nShe noticed that Chris' body has looked softer and rounder in the ass lately. If Chris continued with the pills and with the other surgeries he was planning on having. He would definitely be too far away from ever being a man again. <br>\r\nThis was turning out perfectly.<br>\r\nAs Chris emerged from the bathroom, Jen quickly handed Chris the purse and adjusted his dress.<br>\r\nHis breasts were popping out of the top of the scoop neck mini dress he was wearing. He looked like a knockout.<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" The feminized male asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen leaned over and grabbed a perfume bottle and sprayed Chris lightly with it.<br>\r\n\"Go get your man!\" Jen said.<br>\r\nChris took a deep breath and exited the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack out in the living room of the apartment Michael stood. He was still waiting for an explaination.<br>\r\n\"Where is Miss Parks?\" Chris asked.<br>\r\nShe appeared again from the front porch where she had her phone attached to her ear. \"I'm here. I had to make a phone call, but we better get going. I'll be in the limo\" Stacy said as she walked towards the stretch limo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me what's going on. Is this a reality show? Am I on a blind date show? \" MIchael asked still clueless about everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had no time to explain anything to his friend as they were late already, so he lied. \"You were set up on a blind date by your friend.\" he explained.<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I bet it was Chris.\" Micheal's smile was huge.<br>\r\n\"Please,lets just enjoy this dinner and then I'll explain everything later.\" Chris said as the two walked out the door.<br>\r\nMichael stared at Chris' chest the whole way to the lino.<br>\r\nMichael opened the door for Chris and he smoothed his mini dress and slid into the car.<br>\r\nMichael followed and then closed the door.<br>\r\nThe car was dimly lit as saw that he sat next to Chris and across from them was Jill.<br>\r\nMichael again stared at Chris' legs and Michael rested his one had on Chris' knee.<br>\r\nChris felt weird, but knew that he had to keep this charade going especially in front of Jill. <br>\r\nChris slipped his fingers intertwining with Michaels as Michael smiled at his hand being held by a beautiful woman.<br>\r\nAs the two sat, smiling at each other Jill slowly removed a small baggie with a powder inside and poured it into a wine glass, She opened the wine and poured it. She handed the wine with the powder in it to Chris and then another glass to Michael.<br>\r\nMichael toasted and then intertwined his arms with Chris'. <br>\r\nChris got a panic look again as The two drank from their glasses with their arms wrapped together.<br>\r\nMichael once again got close to Chris and looked at his beautiful plump lips.<br>\r\nChris began to sweat as he knew what was coming.<br>\r\nMichael set down his glass of wine and then grabbed Chris' face and once again lip locked with Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy smiled an evil smile as she knew Chris wouldn't remember much of anything as he kept drinking the tainted wine.<br>\r\nMeanwhile the whole time Chris was being kissed by Michael, he prayed that Jill would say his female name. \"Please, Jill let Michael know that I'm really Chris!!\" He thought as he continued the make out session with his best friend.<br>\r\nMichael was enjoying Chris' lips but didn't want to spend the whole date<br>\r\njust making out with this beautiful woman.<br>\r\nAfter a short drive,  The limo driver pulled into a facy restaurant parking lot and parked, he opened the door and Michael walked out first and then held his hand inside for Chris.<br>\r\nHe slipped his legs out the door and kept his knees together and then slid out, standing next to Michael.<br>\r\nMichael held out his arm and Chris grabbed it, and the couple walked to the restaurant entrance.<br>\r\nThe TLC camera crew were waiting at the restaurant entrance and filmed Michael and Christina walking to the restaurant door. One of the lighting guys opened the door for them as the couple entered the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Maitre d welcomed the couple the the restaurant. He called a waitress over and they followed the woman to their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked through the moderately busy restaurant and finally to a dim lightened corner, she sat them at a table.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMichael held the chair out for Chris. Chris smoothed out his dress and then sat down.<br>\r\nMichael sat across from her.<br>\r\nThe camera crew were hovering right above their table.<br>\r\nMichael thought he better give a good show, so he immediately held Chris' hand.<br>\r\nChris nervously smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God you numbnuts, it's me, Chris!\" Chris shouted in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all Michael saw was a pretty smiling blonde staring at him.<br>\r\n\"You look very beautiful tonight.\" Michael said. This made Chris blush as did the cameras right in their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey saw where the two had sat down and at another table placed the two wine glasses from the limo down. She quickly opened her purse and poured another powder into the wine glass with the lipstick around the rim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to Michael and Chris' table and put the two glasses in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris' eyes lit up. \"Oh good, our wine.\" Chris said as he took a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA waitress came over with two hot plates and set them down in front of the two.<br>\r\nOn Michael's plate was a large cut of steak, green beans, and a helping of mashed potatoes.<br>\r\nMichael's eyes grew wide.<br>\r\nChris was starving and couldn't wait to eat. On Chris' plate was a large Grilled Chicken Ceasar salad, with a wedge of bread on the corner.<br>\r\nMichael smiled at Chris and Chris faked smiled back.<br>\r\n\"Well, there's always more wine.\" Chris thought and then took more sips.<br>\r\nChris watched as Michael dug right in to his steak and he asked if Chris wanted a bite.<br>\r\nChris smiled but declined.<br>\r\nHe pushed around the lettuce on his plate and ended up picking up a small piece of chicken and putting it in his mouth.<br>\r\nAfter he did, he had more wine.<br>\r\nAfter awhile, as he watched Michael eat his steak, the wine had started to hit Chris.<br>\r\nAt least he thought it was the wine.<br>\r\nChris felt really lightheaded.<br>\r\nThen everything felt like it was jumping. Chris was getting flashes of things happening but things become a blur....<br>\r\nOne minute he was walking hand in hand with Michael.<br>\r\nThe next minute he was making out with Michael in the back of a horse drawn carriage.<br>\r\nChris tried to control his head as he thought while he continued to make out with Michael. \"What's happening? I have to stop this.\" He thougth in one minute, but then next he thought, \"Mmmm, this feels right.\" <br>\r\nAgain, he blacked out and lost track of where they were. <br>\r\nChris soon felt like he was being carried and then he felt someone release him as he fell flat on a soft floor that felt like a mattress.<br>\r\nChris managed to open his eyes and focus as he saw Michael lowering the top of his mini dress, revealing his breasts.<br>\r\nChris laughed to himself as Michael grabbed hold of a breast and then lowered himself to kiss it.<br>\r\n\"Good luck with that.\" Chris thought. \"Wait until he finds out my breasts are.....ohhhhhhh.<br>\r\nSuddenly Chris felt arousal.<br>\r\nMichael ran his tongue over Chris' sensitive nipple.<br>\r\nThen suddenly once again...everything went black....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's when my eyes shot open.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael came home!\" I thought to myself, I turned over slightly, and Michael was spooning me with one arm wrapped over my waist, pulling me closer into him. \"Oh my god, what did we do last night, and how did I get THAT drunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to slip out of bed, and he pulled me in closer. So I shifted to face him, and started to slide his arm off me, and I could feel my breasts tingle against him.  This was all just so wrong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slipped out of bed, grabbed my cell phone and went to the bathroom.   <br>\r\nI had a slight head ache, so I drank some water, figuring it would help the hang over. <br>\r\nJen, I should call Jen.  I fumbled with my phone, and selected her number from recent contacts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the fifth ring it was picked up. <br>\r\n\"Chris?  It's 4 am what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen this is horrible, I must have gotten really drunk and I went to bed with Michael, and I don't remember what happened next\" I said in an almost panic.  Trying to figure things out, I was still in the skirt and panties from last night, but had woken up topless, to the best of my knowledge, Michael was completely nude.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And something must be wrong with these breastforms, because they feel so sensitive, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, Chris, Chris....\" Jen said trying to regain control of the conversation.  \"Slow down!\"<br>\r\nDammit, Jen thought.  Thinking quickly she continued, \"those breastforms are absolutely state of the art, that is why they needed to be glued on in a clinic. They have special semiconductor materials, that transmit pressure, heat, and other sensations to the skin below, it's really quite amazing what technology allows to be done, but unless they are malfunctioning and causing pain, there isn't anything to worry about, so are they causing you pain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to a doctor explain this helped calm me for some reason. \"Well no, I guess not\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are they functioning then?\" Jen asked, keeping control of the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they feel tingly, and explosive when touched and caressed, and a sort of warming sensation fills me when they get touched or brushed against, and I guess it feels sort of good.\"  I must have been turning twelve shades of red, as I had never felt so stupid saying something like this aloud before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, that means they are working perfectly,\" Jen said. \"I think you are having a panic attack, what allergy medication did you say you were taking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmmm, give me a second,\" I said looking for the prescription bottle, where was it again?  My purse, oh yeah.....funny how calling it \"my\" purse felt less weird now.  I grabbed the bottle, and went back to the dimly lit bathroom, and read a long scientific name \"cycla-esto-divafemarin\" I said, butchering the pronunciation I'm sure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, I know that medicine,\" Jen continued, \"it's really quite good, but a side effect is anxiety, which occurs more frequently when patients start having withdrawals. You probably are just experiencing a drop in the levels and it is upsetting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it twice a day\" I protested in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read the label, it says take 2-4 times daily as needed,\" Jen said, having seen the bottle in my purse earlier that night.  \"Clearly you should be taking it 4 times a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggggh, that's a lot of pills,\" I whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe you can have Dr Cox give you injections or a dermal patch that would release it slower without the pulls, if you ask, I'm sure we can arrange that. Now is anything else wrong, what happened when Mike realized it was you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmmm, I well I'm not sure, I sort of blacked out, I don't think I ever got to tell him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  But you said you woke up in bed with him, how didn't he?\" Jen asked prying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I well I guess I don't know how or why, but I...\" I was starting to tear up, why was I being so emotional?  Probably just the stress of the recent few days.  \"I don't know how or why Jen, believe me, but he was flirting with me at the restaurant, and it felt so good to not be seen as a freak and when he was kissing me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He kissed you????\"  Jen said with an evil grin (excellent she thought to herself)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....he did....and I, well I sort of responded back, and I guess he carried me to our bed, and it just felt so good, so well, nice and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you two went to bed together he must have realized that you're really Chris\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, it felt nice to feel wanted, and when he touched these damn breasts, something must have short circuited in my brain.  I....I....I don't know how to say this, but I think I might have blown him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sucked his cock!\" Jen exclaimed in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I don't know, but I think I might have, it just felt so nice so good, and I didn't want to ruin it, and I think I might have....yeah....just to prevent him finding out and ending it.\" I was now sobbing quite noticeably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris it's ok, it really is ok, it will be fine....this is our secret, and no one will ever know. \" Jen lied. \"Now I think you should take another pill, and get back to bed, we can figure the rest out tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmongst my sniffles, \"ok Jen, thank you so much for all of your help, and sorry I woke you up\" I said into the phone as I took another of the hormone transitioning medication from what I thought was the allergy medication bottle.  I got another glass of water, and gulped the pill and water down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" I asked myself as I stared into the mirror. \"Man, this isn't going to be easy money.\" I turned to walk out of the bathroom, and noticed for the first time that my butt had been getting a little flabby.  \"All this girl shit is taking time away from me exercising, I'll have to work in some gym time\" I thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I guess I can handle that tomorrow too.  I went back into the bedroom, and crawled back into bed with Michael.  </span></div></div>",

I didn't want to get up, but knew it had to be late. <br>\r\n\"10:14?\" I said looking at my cell phone. \"Ugggh, what a night..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put on a silky pink bathrobe with white lace trim. It matched a nightgown that I slipped on in the middle of the night.  <br>\r\n\"Michael?\" I called out...my feminine voice a little groggy, I figured I needed to apply more of the spray, so I went back to the bathroom.  After 3 or 4 sprays, and a tingly numbing feeling, I let it set for a few seconds, and gave a soft cough and called out in a clearer feminine pitch, \"Michael. Are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't hear a reply, and so I figured that I would just have to wake up and do part of my tedious morning routine and get started with the day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile across town:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you, I saw your new transgender patient  and a guy out on town last night,\" Jen was gossiping to the receptionist and Dr Cox. \"And I have to say that I'm really she found you as a physician.  She just seemed so comfortable and proud being all feminine!   And not to be immodest, but I saw them get into a limo and go home together, I think she is really happy with her treatments, and was just showing them off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm certainly happy for Christine, she did call and want to schedule a lot of procedures to help enhance her femininity, but I would rather she wait, why rush it, it becomes too much to do all at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's why I wanted to tell you about last night, I think I figured that out.\" Jen continued. \"You see, I found out the limo was part of a TLC reality show, they are doing an episode on TG marriages, and she probably just wants her wedding to be perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so sweet,\" the receptionist chimed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this could be good business for the clinic,\" Jen offered. \"If we can have her really convincingly transformed before the wedding, then it would be worth a small fortune in free advertising, and TLC might even pay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about all of this, Jen,\" Dr Cox said nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Dr, you said yourself she called and wants it all, and you can see how feminine she is whenever she comes in, and the first place she goes whenever she leaves is to that salon for a makeover,\" the receptionist said excitingly to the doctors looking at her.  \"It's my sister's salon, and I was there just the other day, and Christine was there to get a tan in a bikini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see!\" Jen said to help convince Dr Cox.  \"This is everything that she wants, and as her doctor, you should be trying to help her every way we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" Dr Cox said, grabbing the file to review it. \"She is on an awfully high dosage of hormones, she really needs a testosterone blocker, we can call her in and discuss that and see if she wants the other procedures, and if TLC will include mention of the clinic and our work, we can even waive the fees involved\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call her now!\" The receptionist said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another part of town:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Michael said to himself. <br>\r\nHe had woken up early, and knew that his almost perfect plan to inherit a small fortune was falling apart.  \"Where is Chris?  Why would he leave and not say anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had tried calling Chris's cell phone but never got an answer.  Then he started thinking to last night's craziness. He had been set up on a reality show date thing. It could only be two things, either Chris was chickening out, and had found a blonde bimbo to take his place, or else his sister was trying to foil the marriage by making it appear that he wasn't faithful to his fianc\u00e9.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were potentially bad, as it would mean he had lost control. <br>\r\nMichael called Gwen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwen, do you know where Chris is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I had to leave unexpectedly, but last I knew he was there, and keeping a low profile until the wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well last night I think he found a substitute, because this blonde was living in my apartment, and TLC was documenting it all for a reality show or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could be good news, with a real girl no one could invalidate your inheritance Mike,\" Gwen said, \"and you were asking a lot out of Chris, if he had second thoughts on it, this might not be so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't know it means we lose an awful lot of control,\" Mike said comprehensively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She might not even know how large the inheritance is, calm down Mike\" Gwen replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about all of this Gwen, money has a way of making some women into nymphomaniacs, and last night this girl was all over me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen, resisting the obvious sexist remark, \"don't worry about it until we know more Mike.\"  She then understood better why Mike came up with this hair brained scheme to begin with, as Mike clearly had trust issues with women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I just need to find Chris, and I hope he is ok\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the apartment:<br>\r\nAfter a long hot shower, Chris brushed out his hair and felt strangely happy and content.  For some reason he felt almost proud, he couldn't put his finger on it, it was sort of surreal, but he felt really quite good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he would be going out, and seeing the TLC crew for another day of wedding prep footage, and so he started on the make up. It was time consuming, but he had been getting a lot better at this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished, he saw a clock 11:30, if I have to take this medication 4 times a day, I'm over due again.  He took out another tiny white pill and a glass of water.  He gulped it down and lowered the lipstick ringed glass to the counter.  Why did he feel so happy today?  He couldn't understand it, but he smiled at the pretty girl's reflection in the mirror.  Yes the nose was a bit large and the edges a bit sharp, but he realized that they really would get away with all of this and be rich soon, which would mean he could then lose all the hair extensions and go back to being a man again...soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then his phone rang.   It was the receptionist at the clinic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christine?\" She asked in her peppy, upbeat voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Chris answered with his surgically altered feminine voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr Cox wanted to know if you could come in today, she wants to run some blood work and make sure everything is healthy, and she has some great news, that we selected your case for a fee waiver, so if you fill out some paperwork, we can serve you for free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" I replied a little stunned.  \"That's very nice, it's like a dream come true, would that include fixing my nose?\" I asked, wanting to clarify if the septum work would be covered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes silly, that and all your other surgeries\" she replied happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Wow, I'm thrilled, I know I'm going to need at least a few other surgeries after my nose,\" I said laughing, thinking it was an understood reference to the procedure to undo my breast implants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will take good care of you girl\" the receptionist replied laughing with me, but thinking we were laughing about other feminization surgeries together.  \"Well when can you come in, I can try to squeeze you in today.\"<br>\r\n\"</span></div></div>",

I was really hungry, and knew I should eat, but as I went to the kitchen the phone rang again.  \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina!\" Jill's voice said.  \"We got a lot of great footage of you last night, I'm finally becoming convinced that you were the right girl for this project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" I said in a not so thrilled manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if we could do a lunch and discuss more wedding plans?\" Jill asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmmm, I really can't because I have an appointment at 1 to uh, well to...\" I said not wanting to give up to many details.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The salon?\" We can meet there if that works for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not the salon,\" then I thought if I were getting my nose fixed, she would need to know anyway, and it would likely excuse me from more TLC sponsored date nights.  So I put on a smile and in an excited voice said, \"before my wedding I'm going to be able to get my nose fixed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you'll look so precious, now remember that will take a few weeks to heal and you'll have black eyes for awhile, I think it might interfere a little with our shooting schedule, but TLC wants your wedding to be perfect, and we can even pay any co-pays towards it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice,\" I said, wondering how I could be this lucky.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well can we at least talk a bit about the wedding then now?\" Jill asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" I replied, subjecting myself to about an hour of conversation on colors and music and flowers.  Then realizing I would be late I hung up the phone and went to the clinic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the clinic, I was a little out of breath.  I only had heels, and they were not easy to run or move fast in. The receptionist came around the desk and hugged me. \"Congratulations!\" She beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wedding?\" I asked stunned and disoriented, \"how did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist covered well, and said \"oh I meant about the free services, but a wedding, who is getting married?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing a smile that I was getting more and more used o wear, \"I am,\" at that moment Dr Cox came in and she also congratulated me and asked for the date, \"it's in a few weeks....his name is Michael....we were friends, then roommates, and then fell in love,\". Blah....blah....blah....I had been through this drill a few times recently, and had not realized how good of an \"actress\" I was becoming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you can come with me, we can get you started,\" Dr Cox said, and I followed her into the examination room. She drew some blood, and asked how I was feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well last night I had like a panic attack, but this morning I felt really good, and it has been so incredible having these sensations from my breasts, I never knew they could do that and feel this good, it really is a marvel of science,\" I said referring to what I thought were high tech breast forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll do that, you'll see\" Dr Cox said with a smile.  The receptionist/assistant had already taken the blood to be analyzed. \"But panic attacks could just be wedding jitters\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking that it was linked to my prescription, and when I took more it went away,\" I said wanting to sound more knowledgeable about medicines and withdrawal symptoms than I really was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is a strong dosage, and we could give you an androgen blocker, which would allow you to lower your dosage and it would be healthier in the long run,\" Dr Cox offered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, lets do it!\" I said, thinking androgen was a fancy word for allergens, and not realizing it was a testosterone blocker.  Dr Cox prepared a syringe and had me turn and lift my skirt, she injected it into my right cheek, and gave it a soft pat when she was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking pretty good there,\" Dr Cox said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed, I didn't think that I looked very attractive to girls while done up as I was, but who doesn't like being appreciated, I just smiled and blushed. \"Oh I heard that I might be able to get my medicine in a patch like for smokers or something, can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, and I hope you don't smoke, it could cause complications,\" Dr Cox said. \"But you could have a sub dermal capsule time release both medicines, they last about 6 months, and we would have to just monitor your levels, it is really convenient for people not wanting to take pills or shots for the rest of their lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both medicines, the blocker too!\" I said almost excited, I hated needles, and was looking forward to avoiding \"allergen\" blocker shots.  \"Let's do it too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Cox smiled, Jen was right, Christina clearly wanted to be as feminine as possible and as quickly as possible. \"Now we can try and squeeze the surgeries in before the wedding, but time is a huge factor, as I want you to have time to heal,\" and if you sign these forms, there won't be any fees, but we would like to use your case for some anonymous advertising if that's alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" I said grabbing a pen and signing the forms.  I knew that one of the surgeries would be to fix my nose and another to remove my breast forms....or so I thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to start as soon as possible, so I can squeeze you in tomorrow, but you can't eat for several hours beforehand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugggh, I'm already starved, all I had to eat was a little bit of a chicken Caesar salad last night about 6,\" I said disappointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Cox did some quick math, \"you're in luck then, we can prep you now and fix your nose and the su dermal implant, and I can hide it so no one will be able to find it,\" she said marking some notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" I said getting up from the table and going to the door to the surgical room.  I was about to take one giant leap into womanhood, and still didn't see it coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in another office at the clinic:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacey, this is going perfectly,\" Jen said into the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is here now, getting the works done to her, when done, she is going to sue Dr Cox and this whole business will be mine!  We will blackmail Mike and take the fortune away from them, and no matter what Chris does, I don't see how he will ever get out of wearing skirts and frilly dresses for the rest of his life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey (Jill) was laughing, \"I almost feel bad for her, did she really suck Mike's cock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so, and who knows, maybe when she is done, I'll offer her a job as a receptionist for MY clinic,\" Dr Cox said with an evil grin, \"it will be fun following her on this journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right,\" Stacey said with a giggle.  \"Well I have to get going, but will you be home for dinner, it's been awhile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugggh,\" Jen said feeling guilty, \"you're right, I'm sorry, this little project has gotten a little bit away from me, and I've been neglecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok,\" Stacey replied. \"I just miss you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I miss and love you two,\" Jen said to the receiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBye...*mwah*</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michael returned home.  He was a bit torn, he enjoyed all of the attention from the hot blonde, but if this was a Plan B, he needed some ground rules set, and he wanted to be sure she didn't take half.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into the apartment, and quickly realized no one was there. <br>\r\n\"Hmmmm, maybe it was only a one night date?\" He wondered aloud.  He went to the bedrooms and saw Chris's girly wardrobe, \"I got to find Chris,\" he said worried about his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't do much about it now, so he kicked his shoes off, opened a beer and turned the TV on to sports center.  He figured Chris must have freaked out after Gwen left.  Because there is no way that he would take off for two days if he was indeed laying low.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis phone rang, \"hello?\" He asked thinking it might be Chris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mike, it's Jen just checking in,\" his sister replied, smiling behind the receiver. <br>\r\n\"So when do we meet your blushing bride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must think I don't have anyone, but this only made Mike a bit more mad. Thinking that he would just pay the blonde more to do it, he said what the hell. \"Soon, we went on a date last night, and it was really quite hot, and the fact that a TV crew was filming it as a date night ambush show made it kinky and fun in all sorts of ways, I'm so glad I found her Jen, and we will be very happy, I'm just sad that not the whole family won't be there on my proud day.\" Mike said happy he was keeping his inheritance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she wanted you to settle down, and that's why the will was written as it was,\" Jen reminded him, knowing she was only helping convince Mike to continue on his plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the clinic:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Doctor, that was a long operation,\" the receptionist/assistant said to Dr Cox.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she wanted the works done and it just made sense to do it all at once,\" Dr Cox replied.  \"She is going to have some swelling, and will need to be under observation for the next 24 hours or so, and I know this isn't normal procedure, but we can pay you to stay here overnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering how she would ever be released today, it's ok, I can do that,\" the assistant said, \"I will just call you if she wakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if she wakes, I want to explain the procedures and how well they have been done, only a doctor should do that.\"  Dr Cox instructed the CNA who would be attending to the still unconscious Chris.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a lot of work, so she made some notes in the file.  <br>\r\nChristina Mullens, facial feminization surgery completed, nose reduced in size, and given slight up turn, brow line reduced, and chin reshaped. Liposuction reduced patient's waist size at least 3 inches, and probably 15 pounds or more, Christina would actually be svelte for a while now.  Lastly the subdermal release capsule had been inserted with the liposuction, and the small quarter sized capsule would never be noticed absent an MRI, but it would chemically block the production of testosterone while feeding a proper amount of female hormones, estrogen mostly, for at least six months.  This would continue to promote weight loss around the now thin waist, and added fat around the hips, thighs, butt, and breasts. And because it would bypass the liver, these effects would be done in a healthier manner and faster pace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the wedding is almost 6 months away,\" Dr Cox thought to herself, \"Christina will be fully healed and indistinguishable from most of the genetic girl bridesmaids in appearance\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost 7 pm, and she gave the assistant some strong pain medication, it would be a painful few days while Christina recovers, but she will be SO happy when she sees the results.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she thought...</span></div></div>",

It hurt everywhere, I opened my eyes and could feel bandages and medical gauze over my face.   My sides felt cramped, and then I moved.  It was like my body was on fire, I tried to scream out, but no noise came, and then just an agonizing moan and tears started flowing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant ran into the room, \"Christina, I know it hurts, but this will help,\" she inserted a syringe into my IV and the pain went away and I felt like I was floating.  Such a strange feeling, but at least my nose would be normal now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drifted back off to sleep, it was going to be a long night.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Across town</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had gone to bed, and he figured he would contact Chris's parents in the morning.  He knew he had to find his friend, and had to save his plan from falling apart, too much money was at stake.  He also didn't know Gwen would return, and didn't know how to contact his blonde date from the night before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd give anything to be in Chris's shoes,\" he thought, \"because he must be in a lot less trouble than I'm in right now.\"  With that thought, he went back to bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>In a quiet suburban house:<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey and Jen had spent the night making passionate love to each other.  They had been having so much fun at pushing Chris down his path of toward femininity, and it was just delicious to see two men, who thought they were so smart, and so powerful, and above the law....get what they had coming to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This game could come to an end now,\" Stacey warned.  \"When she wakes up, she will scream bloody murder, and if there isn't a wedding, then Michael isn't likely to get convicted for fraud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have that part figured out,\" Jen replied.  \"While Christina (said with emphasis on the \"Ina\") was in surgery, I made a copy of her file, and I've added some notes of my own.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was 5 am when Jen walked into the clinic.  This would be a big day.  <br>\r\nShe said hi to the assistant and asked how the \"special patient\" was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has been asleep most of the night, woke up once, I just gave her some of the pain medicine and she passed back out\" the Assistant had been tenderly holding Christina's hand off and on during the night.  \"She is so brave,\" she remarked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that she is, well you must be tired, she is in good hands with me, don't worry,\" Jen replied, ushering her assistant out.  Alone, with Christina unconscious, she was able to say for the first time, \"it isn't anything personal, it's just business, one day you might even thank me for all of this, but until then, I'm sorry, we have to keep pushing forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a doctor and a partner of a clinic that engaged in all sorts of cosmetic surgery had its advantages.  One was a ton of trial application packages for new medicines, and Jen had studied through the best reviewed and selected one in particular.  It was a regenerative dermal therapy drug, and besides the high priced cellular regenerative therapy, it was basically a steroid suspended in silicone, mineral oils, and vitamin E.  If taken in a high enough dosage, and applied regularly, it would reduce healing time by at least 50%.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking aloud, \"so that means it will only be 4-5 days until the liposuction pain subsides, and with luck only 2-4 weeks for the facial surgery pain and bruising to subside.\"  It was still a fairly long time, but she needed this to work, as she new the hypnotherapy, despite what Hollywood pretends, would never last more than 4-5 weeks, and even that might be a stretch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell first thing is first, so Jen applied the NuU healing cream over all the affected areas, being careful to avoid (for now) the incision areas.  Next she drew out a large syringe and filled it with an amber liquid.  This wasn't exactly a legal drug, but it was necessary here, it was an opiate derivative, not heroin, but something in the same family, rare, and very expensive.  She emptied the contents into the IV bag, allowing to to be slowly administered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis mind altering drug could not be taken indefinitely, but would be certainly strong enough to mask most, if not all of the pain. What was more important, it would also open up Christina's mind, and just enhance all of her naive and gullible qualities, which was essential if this hypnosis was ever going to have a chance to work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited an hour, hoping it would have started to have it's effect by now. Jen knew time was running out, and she needed to know whether it would be her, or Mike, that would be finding themselves in prison. With time running out, she woke Christina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina,\" Jen said repeatedly, while waiving an Epsom salt under her nose. \"Wake up, I need to talk with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris could hear a name being called, but everything was cloudy.  Finally a voice in his head pointed out it was \"his\" name, Christina, being called out.  So he opened his eyes, his head felt like it was just floating above his body, and his whole body just fell asleep.  \"It's ok, I've given you your throat spray,\" Jen said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, why am I still here after a nose job,\" Chris asked groggily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we had a problem, and you fixed it, Mike and Gwen and I are just so proud of you,\" Jen said supportively. \"You are so strong and brave, and wow only a true man would be able to have call their bluff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bluff, what are you talking about?\" Chris asked, but enjoying the flattery of his masculinity and bravery and strength, something he never before got much of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems that the TLC producers thought you were going to be too overweight to be on their program, and the footage the other night got them a little scared,\" Jen continued. \"And so when you came in for your nose job, you asked for some liposuction too, so the good news is no more love handles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did?\" Chris asked, still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here is your signature on the forms,\" Jen held one of the pages up for Chris to see, and indeed it was his signature.  \"And the best part, is you'll now only weigh about 140 pounds, and that means no one will ever suspect you aren't a real girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris knew and trusted Jen, she had been so helpful and supportive, that he just accepted the flattery and took credit for being so smart and creative.  \"Why does my face feel funny?\" He asked Jen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when they did your nose, funny things happen in surgery,\" Jen started to say continuing her lies. \"As you know you have several sinuses in your head, and they are all connected, well in your case, fixing your nose was creating dangerous pressures in all of the other sinuses, so they needed to be flushed and opened up a little more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it look bad and will I be permanently harmed by any of this?\" Chris asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may hurt now, and it might look bad with the swelling, and you will be on antibiotics, but no it won't look bad, you will just need to be patient with the swelling, and the good news is that this should really help fix your allergy problems, so yeah you have some swelling and yes your face will look a little different, but with a fixed nose and clear sinuses, you'll be a lot healthier, and when you go back to being a guy, you're just going to love the new you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So no more medication for the allergies?\" Chris asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Jen replied truthfully, as all of the hormonal therapy was being administered by a sub-dermal capsule for the next 6 months.  And by the time the wedding rolled around, Chris's body chemistry will have become dependent on continued hormones, as you can't realistically start and then just stop taking hormones, it was simply too dangerous to your body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Chris said, glad that he wouldn't have to take the pills four times a day anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So one last thing,\" Jen said, \"I know all of this has been a lot for you, and especially today, I just want you to focus on how you were so smart to ask for help with weight loss, and how great it will feel to breathe normally once the nose and facial swelling goes down, but in order to get this all covered, we are actually required to have a therapist help monitor you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shrink!?\" Chris asked confused again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina....you are under a lot of stress, you're planning for a wedding, and an inheritance, and now a TV show, and you've had surgeries, and it will be only natural for you to want to panic and freak out, but you need someone to help ensure you don't freak out. I mean that would be a lot for any girl, let alone a guy only pretending to be one, I think it can't hurt, especially as you've only had really just me to help you up until now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I guess you're right,\" it might be nice to just talk to someone else.   \"Who would it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A guy I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A guy, no way, I don't think I could say all of this to another guy, he would just judge me and I would die of embarrassment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy is harmless, it's free, and he is really very good and professional,\" Jen said dismissing my protests.  \"You'll see, I have him coming in today to meet you, in fact I think I hear him pulling in now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?????\" Chris asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ladies, I'm Doctor Marshall,\" a tall, but slightly balding man about 45 years old said from the door way.  \"Christina I presume?  Pleasure to meet you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in good hands Christina,\" Jen said leaving the room so the two could talk some more.  Dr Marshall gave Jen back the altered copy of Christina's medical file, and clearly had his own file started, he pulled a chair by Christina's bed and started.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And no, you have complete confidence, I would never tell anyone anything about you.\" Dt Marshall said, taking more notes...patient strongly desires to go stealth, and live as a woman without anyone knowing history, presents as a lovely dressed woman, and feels compelled to do so by nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do me a favor Hun, and count backwards from 100.\" Dr Marshall continued aloud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chris got to about 87, the Doctor's soft words were making him sleepy.....he knew he had to concentrate on things....but what were they?   Oh yes, that he had been brave to ask for the surgery and liposuction, that he would love how his face would look, and that he was normal....not a freak....but normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor's monotone voice was adding things to that list, but he couldn't hear them consciously.

The phone rang three times, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike, congrats, we are delighted you invited us,\" Chris's mom, Mrs Mullens said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congrats?\" Mike asked confused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the wedding, silly, I didn't realize you'd invite us, did Chris make you?  Is he in the wedding?\"  She continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm, yeah, I guess....ummm you got an invite,\" Mike said still confused, what the hell was Chris up to?   \"Well I wanted him the wedding....and I mean I <i>really</i> wanted him in it, but I sort of lost track of him when I left for family business.  Have you seen him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, and we haven't heard from him in awhile either,\" she said, slightly disappointed that Chris had to have the bride agree to invite his parents and not Mile.  \"This may make me sound crazy, but mother's always love hearing their children's voices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll have him call, but if he calls you first, have him call me, I need to know if he still wants to be in the wedding,\" Mike said, smiling at the double meaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, and thank the bride for me when you see her,\" and the phone hung up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Chris, one hell of a time to go MIA!\" Mike said putting the phone away.   Well time to look up the blonde chick from the date show, where was that TLC card...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi my name is Michael, and I'm the guest on the date show you just filmed the other night.....yeah the limo was great....very romantic, it really set the mood just right.  Oh thank you, anyway I was wondering.....what?   Oh my fianc\u00e9?  Yeah, she loves your program, and she set the date show up?   Oh I see.....yeah, I....i...I just thought it was the one time show for a date night, no I didn't realize it would cover the wedding too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Damn, Chris really gave the farm away, must have chickened out and bailed town, but only after offering half my money to some dumb blonde slut, and then set up this show so I could go back....what a selfish asshole, he'll get his when I see him next!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway, I was wondering when the next event will be taped, maybe we can do a Jack and Jill shower or something.....or no filming for 3-4 weeks?   Or a nose job and weight loss recovery period, yeah I guess that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Double damn, the bitch is already spending my money, she better plan on repaying me with plenty of favors if I'm going to pay for that shit)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....it's all covered?  Wow, do you know where that was being done?  No she didn't tell me, ok, I understand....well, I guess I'll be as surprised as you to see the end results, but she is my little love muffin, and I thought she was perfect just the way she was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike hung up the phone.  No Chris, No Gwen, and both TLC and Chris's parents were useless. They wouldn't even tell him where his fianc\u00e9 was having her nose done, damn, well I guess I better make the best of it.  He would just wait until this glorified hooker came home, and get her alone and work out the details of how much money it would take to buy her off.   Well, I'll wait until I fuck her good and dirty, and then I'll have that come to Jesus talk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike smiled, it would still work, not exactly as he planned, but it would still work. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I told him about our confused gender dyspeptic patient.   The one with extreme feelings of guilt and shame over his yearnings.   He is in there right now for his second session thinking this pre-op transsexual is feeling suicidal over the stress of her transition.   He called it feminizing reinforcement, and it works, but it takes time.    It's been about 2 hours already, and while I don't know all the specifics, I have peeked in a few times to see the progress.\" Jen answered, genuinely pleased and happy with the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wasn't Chris supposed to be released today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but now he has more time.   With Dr Cox out for today, we only need to note in the chart that we kept her patient here for monitoring for a day, and that we made routine observations.   Meanwhile, our friend will reprogram her mind into that of a young, joyfull bride to be, and he has 2 full days to do that as Dr Cox wasn't scheduled to be here tomorrow anyway.   So, that car trickery was a necessary step in our plan my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so when this is done, he will believe he is Christina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, Jen answered.   \"Hypnosis isn't a magic trick.   There will be strong conditioning, and it will all be in place, and Chris may or may not remember what exactly happened.   We told him it was a therapist, and we will stick with that story and continue with his treatments if this works.   If it doesn't, well, he was quite groggy and out of it, and there will be no record officially of what's happened.\"  Jen smiled, knowing that her hypnotist friend did indeed often work miracles.   She already had Christina's next four sessions withDr. Marshall scheduled, being quite optimistic about the expected results.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you peeked in?   What was it like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen smiled and said, \"Oh you silly beautiful thing you, you wouldn't believe you if I told you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Chris's room:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Marshall was a real therapist, and had long advocated the wonders of hypnotherapy.   But he also had previously had had a gambling problem and got into a lot of debt.   He lost his practice, and wound up returning to variety shows, but he kept his license.   He met Jen at such a show, the sort where the host hypnotized audience members into doing raunchy acts on stage.    They immediately became friends, and had had many crazy nights watching otherwise normal people get lost into a sea of base acts of all sorts.    But he was surprised to get her call to help a somewhat suicidal patient with her transitioning.   Seems the poor thing had already gone rather far in her surgeries, and was having second thoughts due to family pressures and the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had reviewed Christina's fake medical file, the one Jen had prepared for him.   It told the story of a lifetime of denial of transsexualism, and the utter shame that Chris had growing up.   It also told how happy he was to get his breast implants, and how wonderful he felt about getting married.    Jen had showed him the tape from the TLC program of his date with Michael, so he had no reason to doubt any of it.   Combined with the news of her parents not wanting to accept that their son was becoming their daughter as the file told, he knew why it was so important for Jen to reach out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen had told him how confused Christina felt, and how she needed to really stop the conflict within.   She had made her choice to become Christina, and it was time to let Chris go.   His first hour of therapy was focused entirely on that:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Christina...I'm a very happy girl\". He repeated this over and over at various intervals, getting Chris to repeat the same.   \"I like how my body looks, and I love the sound of my voice.\"----these suggestions were based off of the ideas he got from the file Jen had prepared that he read.   \"I love my breasts and like it when Michael plays with them.\"   For this, he got the entranced Chris to play with his own breasts, simulating what Christina's fiance was bound to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for the first hour.   It was exhausting for Dr Marshall, but he took this seriously.   The second hour was stranger than the first, but was necessary, as his patient's file indicated a strong impulse to suppress the attraction to men, and perform sex acts with men.    He thought this likely unnecessary, as he remembered seeing what he thought was a hot and horny woman all over that guy on that TLC program.   She didn't appear unwilling when they were making out in the carriage on television he thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, the file said it was necessary, so he got out lots of pictures of various naked men, As well as a very realistic 9 inch dildo that he put into Chris's hands.    For the next hour and a half Chris was told through hypnosis how beautiful the men in the photos were, and to pay careful attention to the strong muscles on their body.   How much he should want them to hold her tight in their arms.   How she shouldn't be alarmed when their dicks got hard.   That this only meant that she was being pretty for them.  She should want to feel pretty.   Feeling pretty is what made her happy.  She should want to do anything to make herself pretty, as that would make her happy.  Feeling a dick get hard only meant that she was very pretty, and therefore should make her very, very, very happy.   A hard cock was a reason for joy, and she should want it to always be hard.   Being pretty meant being happy, and she couldn't be happy unless she could make her mans penis get hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor got a little annoyed by this, he seemed to have to dwell on it as Christina seemed a bit resistant to accepting it.  He noted in his own file that the patient likely needed more mental reinforcement in this area.   He returned to the images a naked body builders, and kept Poor unsuspecting Chris's attention on them, this time focusing the attention on the cocks.   He now got Christina to use the dildo in her hand to simulate massaging a cock to make it hard.   He had done this many times in his stage act, making normal straight guys unknowingly give their best buddies a raunchy handjob on stage.    If it could work on drunk college kids that didn't want to do it to begin with, then it should work wonders on the mind of that beautiful girl in love from that horse drawn carriage he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hard cock is just a man's way of saying you're pretty Christina.   You want to be pretty.  Being pretty makes you happy.   You want to be happy Christina, you want to make that cock hard.   Making it hard will make you feel pretty, and that will make you happy.  Rub that cock in your hands slowly Christina...yes, up and down gently.   Now spit onto it Christina...very good...keep rubbing it, you want to feel pretty Christina, you always want to feel pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Marshall kept this up for over 45 minutes.   He had now spent almost 3 hours with Christina and had to leave, but he would return tomorrow per Jen's instructions to help Christina learn how to </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris had a lousy night of sleep at the clinic.   This was made worse by the lost time he experienced due to his hypnotist visit, but he was unaware of that.   He remembered Jen being there, was it a dream?   She had said he was smart, or clever...that was it.   He felt so smug and content with himself, and felt a twinge of conceit.   Jen was a very attractive girl after all, and while he once or twice suspected that she might be a lesbian, still was flattered in a way to have her around him during this trying time.   Yes, she was clearly smart and helpful, and a real trustworthy friend.   Maybe they could be more he thought, as he thought back on those compliments.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body still ached from the surgeries.   No more love handles she had told him, he looked at his body and saw that he looked thin!   Like sure, his fake boobs made him look quite pretty he thought to himself, but seeing his flat trim tummy made him feel...young?   No, that wasn't it.   He looked down and saw what looked like a tight little feminine waist, and thought...yes, KNEW...that he looked pretty!   Oddly, he smiled at that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he realized, yes...this is why she thought I was smart.   The wedding, the show, the dress!   Of course!   I am smart, I don't have to stick to some crazy diet, and I have a pretty body, one that's clearly getting attention from the lovely and probably bicurious Jen.   Hmmm...maybe I'll have a small fortune from this and a pretty girlfriend too!   He liked that word, pretty.   He smiled as he thought it, and looked at his achy body, thinking that at least he was pretty...or make that, pretty tired.   He looked at his night stand and saw his voice spray.   Score!   He reached over and gave himself a generous dosage, hoping it would disguise his male voice, which little did he know, he would never hear again thanks to his last turn upon the surgeon's table here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he fell asleep.   Dr. Marshall came in at 10am, and saw the groggy patient still in a daze.  That's for the best he thought.   Tired patients are usually more susceptible to hypnotic suggestion.  He spent the next hour telling the hypnotized Christina how delicious a cock would taste.   The salty musky flavor should always make her feel pretty.   That feeling pretty with a cock in her mouth would excite her, and how she should want a cock in her mouth whenever she felt like she needed to feel pretty, or happy.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went to work with the dildo.   He got Christina to lick it, then convinced her to do it again, but now smiling as she did.   Christina seemed quite unpracticed at it, which surprised Dr Marshall.   Based on the file he read, she supposed had been sucking cock since she was 16 years old.   So, he had to push the dildo himself deeper down into her throat.   No doctor or therapist would do this, but he had done it on a few girls at a few sex parties he had attended to the roar of approval of others.  This must be why Jen called him, because her repressed sexual desires stop her from properly satisfying a guy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, Chris's jaw was tired, and his throat was raw.   He had been gagging on that thick dildo endlessly.   It must have entered his throat about 150 times or more.   His saliviawas all over it, and he had no clue what he was doing.   Jen and Jill watched 5 minutes of this seeing the poor unknowing Chris have his throat raped by this dildo, and have no clue it was happening.   Listening, they heard Dr Marshall plead with his reluctant patient how he needed to get all 9 inches down his throat to feel pretty and be happy.   They laughed at this nonsense about how a dildo could make him feel pretty, but loved seeing the poor boy, if you could even call him that, be forced to take it deeper and deeper down his throat.   By the second hour, the dazed and bewitched Christina was taking the full length, and doing it with a sort of smile.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina felt the hard cock in her mouth, a hard cock meant she was pretty, this made her happy.   The pretty Christina smiled with the cock in her mouth and wanted to be happy.  She had to get the hard cock into her to feel pretty, and doing that would make her happy.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris's feminized body leaned forward, drawing the dildo toward her throat, instinctively swallowing, Christina felt pretty as the cock glided over her tongue and she smiled as best she could, with this beast fucking her mouth.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Marshall gradually pushed the dildo forward with steady pressure, pleased that Christina now was pulling it deeper into her throat.   He smiled when Christina's chin hit the prosthetic testicles on the dildo, and watched as she repeatedly bobbed her head on the shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good Christina!   You look so pretty right now, you are a ver, very pretty woman...and you look prettiest just like this!   You are pretty...and being pretty makes you happy.   You are very happy Christina...very, very happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Christina's head, she was happy that she was pretty...happy that she felt so pretty.   Happy that the cock of this man was proof that she was pretty.   She felt proud that she was pretty...proud that this cock was hard that was I her...proud, pretty, and happy...she continued sucking on that dildo happily, in this trance.   It had taken a long time, but she was happily swallowing every inch of that dildo, and feeling pretty as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside her room, Jen and Jill watched the amazing progress.  This session was almost over, and there's likely only be time for one more session later in the day, unless they could extend his time further again.   Dr. Cox would be back the next day when the clinic opened at 9:30am.  Still, even still, the past 12 hours saw the innocent Chris get his mind conditioned on how to suck a cock like a pro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is hilarious!\" Jen said with a laugh, watching Chris eagerly deep throat the dildo Dr Marshall held in front of his face through the window into Chris's room.   \"I could watch this for hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you feel at all guilty?\" Her lover asked standing beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even a little bit, my love.\" Jen answered.   \"May I remind you that he's a filthy breeder, a disgusting man that probably gets pleasure defiling sweet young women.   And he's worse than that too!  He's a would be criminal, trying to defraud us of our inheritance.   It serves him right.\"   Jen thought, still bitter at the years she had been mocked by others for being a lesbian.   She didn't hate all men, but somehow chose to see in Chris her sort of revenge for those that had wronged her in the past.   It was a turn on seeing one slowly emasculated and turned into a woman, and now she had watched a hot session of a topless Christina diligently fellating a huge dildo with all her might.   She smiled thinking of others that she wish had gotten Chris's fate.   Forcibly turning her past male tormentors gay appealed very much to her.   And she thought it even more fitting to see her \"perfect\" brother Michael marry a man.   Oh how her family favored their straight son over the lesbian daughter, but if they could only live to see what was about to happen, then maybe she would have been the favorite.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to watch when Dr Marshall comes back late this afternoon, we should have Christina on that new pain medication by then, should have her well enough for her next session when he gets her to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis throat was on fire!   What was wrong?   It had been getting better but he took a turn for the wise he thought.   Hastily, he reached for that throat spray Jen had given him for his voice.   He used a very generous dosage of it, probably too much...but the cooling effect did soothe the sore throat he had.  Once he did that, he hoped that it wouldn't have any side effects, but Jen told him was safe, and he trusted her.   Feeling the pain return a bit, he used it again.   His bottle was now almost gone and likely wouldn't last the night at this rate.   He looked over to the side table and saw a new unopened bottle.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke trying to say his name, \"Hi...my name is Christina,\" he mindlessly repeated unaware he had just referred to himself by his feminine name.   His voice sounded a little hoarse, but was unmistakably still in a woman's pitch and tone.   This is a wonder drug he thought holding that spray in his hand and applying another spray or two on his sore throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen came in then, and saw Christina smile.   \"Wakey, wakes girlfriend!\"   Jen said cheerfully.   She knew she had to continue the subtle hints and clues to bolster the hypnotic suggestions that had been fed to him.   \"How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My throat is sore again, what happened?   I thought the work on my sinuses was supposed to cure that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it must just be an adjustment period, I can send up for some Popsicles.   Would that be good?\" Jen asked, loving the idea of reinforcing his oral fixation on a phalic shaped object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Chris said without hesitation.   He then saw Jen sit on the bed and loosely give him a big hug.   She does like me he thought, but was wishing she could hug and hold him more firmly and with some strength.   Her hug was just sort of weak, and in possessing.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Popsicles came in, and Chris took his and began licking it.   He seemed to smile with it, and Jen told him, \"You're looking very pretty today Christina.\"   She watched as Chris happily worked on that Popsicle.   \"Chris, here's this new pain medicine, it will help with everything, though it will likely leave you in a fog for the next 12 hours or so.   That therapist will be by at 4 pm, and you have an appointment with him again in 3 days time.   Dr. Cox will be here tomorrow morning, and they will probably let you go home then.   It looks like your body is heeling nicely, you will just have to take it easy, no strenuous exercise...and mostly stay in bed for a week or so and apply this cream to where Dr Cox tells you to.   I'm sure you will be allowed to go to the salon or see your therapist, but these are all questions you should ask Dr Cox.   Can you remember that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" of course,\" Chris thought.   He had never had liposuction before or had work done on his sinuses and nose before.   Come to think of it, he hadn't even seen himself in the mirror yet.   But Jen seemed genuinely interested in him and his well being, so that must be good.   He remembered that he was supposed to meet with a therapist, a man he remembered...something he wasn't too happy with he thought, but it didn't seem so bad he thought again...he just hoped that with all the bruises from the surgery that this man would think he was still sort of pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris thought that, and immediately thought that strange.   Why should he care?   That wasn't right.   Chris liked women, and at the moment was thinking of wooing the sexy Jen.   He looked at her while devouring his Popsicle, which he had buried in his mouth until it was hitting near the back of his throat.   She was looking at Chris's real medical file,   The nurses had noted his vital signs, and observations.   But there was no mention of Dr Marshalls visits.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris took her distraction to be one that maybe he was losing her interest.   Well, that would change when he got his share of the inheritance he thought.   He looked at the clock and saw it was almost 4, he grabbed a brush and started working on his hair to make it look pretty.   He again thought it odd that he cared, but chalked it up to just wanting to do a good job at this little deception.   He would probably feel better and be happier if people saw him as a woman rather than a man in a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen watched Chris go to work on his hair.   Yes, he immediately set about to make himself pretty once he knew a man was coming.   She smiled.  It was working.  \"Here, take some lipstick,\" she handed the tube to the feminized boy.   \"That Popsicle made a mess of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Chris said, as he applied the deep red color to his lips.   \" there, do I look pretty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always,\" Jen said with a smile, and Cheistina felt happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed by:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go,\" Dr Marshall said, handing Jen a DVDs.   \"That was 3 sessions, but I think progress was made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the video message?\" Jen asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered, it is there just as we discussed.   \"She was able to finally repeat her true feelings and voice them in a message to her parents.   It took several attempts, she would occasionally make mistakes making us start all over.   But I think she finally got through it well enough.   I could speak to her parents too if you like,\" he said, as he picked up the envelope of cash Jen had for him, this would go a long way to repaying his gambling debts.   \"She still has that appointment on Friday morning, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I think it may be beneficial for her to continue with her therapy if it continues to work as it seems to already have.   I suspect she may need to continue with that gender identity reinforcement.   I'm glad to see you got her more comfortable in enjoying the female role in sexual positions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea...but that's why you called me.  Most therapists wouldn't do that, it's a controversial technique.   I've seen from my stage act and parties that with the right conditioning you can make anyone perform any sex act, gay/straight...it doesn't matter, right honey?\" Dr Marshall asked with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod she hated men, Jen thought...with horrid memories of a vague hazy night where she was only somewhat aware of finding herself naked titty fucking some guy friend after Dr Marahall hypnotized her into thinking that she had breast cancer, and only semen from her friend could cure it.   It was revolting, and others in the room found it hilarious, but it convinced her just again how sleazy and corrupt the male sex was.    Wasn't all bad, she learned then the powers of hypnotism then, and that proved useful.   She also knew that it wasn't permanent, and would wear off quickly.   So, she needed to be sure to keep his appointments frequent and routine if Christona was ever going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she replied.   \"I think she benefitted greatly from that kind of therapy.   Did you cover anal intercourse too?\"  Knowing he hadn't, she just immediately said, \" because you have too!  It was during sex like that where she felt like a real freak.   That's what drove her to suicidal thoughts.  She's never been comfortable with it, and wants a vafina in the worst way to have sex like a real girl.   But her fianc\u00e9 loves anal, and has insisted on it...but it makes her cry because it reminds her that she's really a man.  I thought you were going to help with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we can do that Friday.  That's common actually with transsexuals,\" he said trying to sound smarter than he actually was.   \"Christina just needs to understand that women have sex that way too.   She has those same nerves and glands there as gay men do, she can get over the shame and be able to enjoy sex with her fianc\u00e9 I promise.   I think you're right about continuing her treatment\" he thought counting the money he had been given, and wanting it to continue.   \"I could see her twice a week if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, make it at least every other day for at least an hour.   There's a lot of work to be done. I will see to it she is there on Friday, after that, we can schedule more appointments as needed.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" he said and then left.   Jen put the DVDs in her laptop, and loaded the video.  With a glass of wine she watched Christina speak into the camera, it appeared free and I coerced, even if it was a little robotic sounding.   No matter, she would tell Chris's family that was nerves when she spoke to them.   The time wasn't right yet, but she would go meet with them and explain how their transgendered son felt so trapped and depressed, and how he was choosing to become Christina to marry the man she loved.   With luck, Chris's father would even give him away at the wedding.   She watched the video, and smiled:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Christina...I'm a very pretty girl.  These are  my breasts (she said clutching her boobs)...they make me feel pretty.  Bi want to feel pretty.  Feeling pretty makes me happy.  Chris was a lie, Christina is the truth.  Christina is a pretty happy girl.   I want to be happy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video continued like that for 20 minutes, mostly saying how happy he was as Christina.   It was good, it would need editing but could work Jen thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called Jill, \"yes, it's working.  By the time the wedding comes around, he will be a beautiful bride whether he wants to be or not.   I need you to go out and buy me something:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it she had to buy:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jill had spent about $200 buying a black boned corset, a garter belt and matching black panties, with sheer black silk patterned stockings.   The stockings had little black flowers running up the calves, and the tops could get secured into the garter straps.  There were also 2 black stiletto 4 inch heels and a satin black robe to wear.   It was all in Christina's new size, and Jen went to see Chris that early morning before Dr Cox would arrive to review and release him.   Of course, there was no record of Dr Marshall's visits, and the ever groggy Chris still hadn't seen his new face in the mirror.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen woke him up, \"Morning beautiful!\" Again, trying to reinforce the mental images of being a pretty girl in Chris,s head.   \"I have some gifts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen, I need to see myself.  My face is still sore, has the swelling gone down?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you will need some make up to mask the bruising, but that healing cream has worked wonders.\" She pulled out a make up compact and held the mirror in a fuzzy way to obscure Chris's reflection a little. V\"don't worry, I can still make you pretty.   You want to be pretty, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OF COURSE I DO,\" he said, and sat up in bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, that makes me happy,\" Jen said, which ironicly was exactly what Chris was thinking too, \"because....I got you something sexy to wear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Jen,\" Chris said looking at the contents of the bag as they were emptied onto the bed.   \"Do you really think I need this, I mean it's just you and me here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, I have to say, and you might have already suspected, but a part of me likes women...you know, sexually.  Seeing you these past few weeks, it's been like...maybe I can have the best of both worlds.   I know when the wedding is over, that you will go back to just being Chris...and all these little changed will be reversed.  But until then, do you suppose you could indulge me from time to time, and maybe dress a little sexy for me?   I don't even know how I feel about starting a relationship, or if I even want one.   But I think if you dress up like this a little, maybe I can get my feelings sorted out.   Maybe...oh, I don't know,\" Jen said, thoroughly acting that scene out and setting the bait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I knew it thought Chris\"...she has the hots for me, and she's bisexual.  Oh, I'll wear your little outfits and tease you, you little carpet munching minx...and then when I've got you so hot for this sexy girl that I can pass myself off as, I'll rock your world and fuck the dyke out of you.   After that, he'll...I'll even compromise and set up a few three ways.   With all the money I'm about to get, I can finally see a happy light at the end of the tunnel.   \"Sure sweetie, I'll put it on.\" And he started putting on the corset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!  With all the weight you lost, you needed new clothes anyway.\"   \"Ok, I have to get going.   But be sure to text my a photo once you're all done up.  Here, send them to this number, that's not my usual cell phone, but the temporary one they gave me while my phone is getting fixed.   But before I go, I'll do your make up and help tie the corset tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen spent a few minutes fixing Christina up. Her make up took more time given the recent surgeries, but with some blending, it was virtually unnoticeable when she finished.   Chris let her.  He was quite used to it by now, and felt better thinking it was going to likely get him laid.  While she was doing it up, she reminded him how pretty Christina was.   She again advised her what to tell Dr Cox when she arrived.  When Jen left, she had Christina mostly dressed, and told her to finish up with the garters and to think of some flirty fun poses to take and send while she waited to be released.  Yes, Christina was all wound up like a sexy bomb about to blow up, it was great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Photos:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris took a picture of his face after fluffing his hair a little.  It looked pretty sort of tussled like that.   He took a photo with a kiddy face and texted it to that number.  \"You like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes, but the reply came back \"damn, so sexy girl!\"----this was Michaels new cell phone number, and not Jen's.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike saw the photo, it was that slut from that date night.   \"Fuck, she was hot!\" He thought.  He wasted no time in texting her back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris smiled at the reply.  \"Glad you like it, I think it looks pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too came the reply from Michael.  \"I want to see you again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris thought, wow...she was just here and does want me.  \"I'd like that\" he typed trying to play it cool.  He then sent a photo with his eyes wide looking up from an angle that gave a bear glimpse of what he still thought were his fake breast forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael got instantly hard with this sexy girl sending him photos.  He had been pushed about this girl swooping in, and didn't know if he could trust her.   But the little slut seemed to genuinely want him, something Chris certainly didn't and would never wasn't.   Maybe it was for the best.   \"Can't wait for the wedding he typed,\" eager to see her reply.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!  I'd really like a chance for the craziness to disappear so we can have some alone time together to really get to know each other,\" Chris texted back...thinking still this was him and Jen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...Michael thought\".   She's serious.  Yeah, she'd be fun to have on the honeymoon, and it would be a great cover to have a sexy girl to take to Barbados to help bolster his story to estate lawyers.  He thought of this sexy girl in a bikini and got instantly hard as a rock.  He wanted to fuck her bad.  \"Send me another photo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris smiled seeing that request.  He stood up, in the heels and put a hand on his hip and leaned onto one leg.  Taking the photo, he sent it, and added: \"Like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So hot!\" The text came back.   Chris was now having fun sending the flirty texts.  \"I want your body so bad\" he sent, hoping it wasn't too forward too soon.  He read the reply, \"oh, you'll get it you naughty girl!   Tell me more!\"   Chris wrote: \"I want to lick your body and suck on you until your juices are flowing out of my mouth!\"  (He figured with lesbian tendencies, he should stress oral sex for now(<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...do u swallow?\" Michael replied.   \"Send another pic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris saw both texts at once, and sent back: \"for you baby, I will!\"   He then sent one peering down into his cleavage.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're killing me!   Getting me so hot for you.  I love it!   I think we will have lots of fun together\" we're all messages Michael sent to \"Christina\".  He was going to bust his nut down this sluts throat!   He then apologized and said he had an errand to run off to do, but would see her soon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope so!\" Chris texted back, glad that his flirty sexy photos had swayed the bicurious Jen into wanting to experiment with him.   He drifted off to sleep, waiting to be released by Dr Cox.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy 10am, Dr Cox was in Chris's room.  She noted in his file that his recovery was proceeding at an incredible pace.  That NuU stuff really does work she thought.  She noted Christina was decked out in lingerie, which she didn't approve of.  But, the poor girl must have just been too excited to finally start seeing the woman she always was beneath the surface.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris started to wake up.   \"Good morning pretty face,\" Cox said unintentionally using a trigger word for Chris causing him to smile.  \"I saw your outfit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a friend dropped it off earlier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet...some \"friend\" I can imagine, she said with a smile.  \"I don't normally approve of corsets this tight after surgery, but your healing is way ahead of schedule.   I suppose there's no harm in it.  But these heels?   No, I can't recommend them, even if they look pretty on you.  In fact, you're under strict orders to stay in bed as much as possible.   But don't worry, given the clothes you've been given I don't think that that will be too much of a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" you mean I can still...\" Chris asked thinking about Jen.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course.   Just be gentle.  In fact, sex is perfectly ok...but I'd like you to only do oral for the next day or so.  Give your abdomen some time to adjust to your new weight.   You can still leave the house but no strenuous exercise.  If you have a doctors appointment or a quick trip to the store, but try to keep it under 3 hours for at least the first week.  You have this prescription for this healing cream, keep using it as instructed.  It will help, believe me.  I will want to see you let's say next Tuesday just to see how you're coming along, that will give you a full week to recover.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm being released?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it will take just a little while to do the paperwork.   If I were you, I suppose, I'd call your friend to come pick you up.\" Dr Cox smirked, looking again at the beautiful svelte figure in the corset, stockings and panties.   There was still a little, hardly noticeable in those panties, but the hormones were likely already causing some shrinkage. Vin a month or two, they could probably start talking about her final surgery, that is, if she even wanted it.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris reached for the phone and texted that number, \"I'll be ready in an hour.   Can you pick me up?\"   He got the reply yes, and the next questions seemed strange he thought coming from Jen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still dressed in that sexy get up?\" And \"what's the address again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answered yes of course, and typed out the address a little bewildered as Jen knew where she was.  Oh well, maybe she got distracted or thought he had been moved elsewhere.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great babe!   You look so pretty like that, I can't wait to show you how much I love the way you look!\" Chris smiled putting the phone down, happy that Jen would be there soon and he'd be getting it on with her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael meanwhile ran out the door to go get \"Christina\" from this office she texted from.   But first, he had to:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michael had run out of the apartment.  He wanted to buy flowers and wine for his new fiancee, and had to pick her up in just under an hour.  But before doing that, he called Chris's cellphone.  Unlike before, this time Chris quickly answered.  (No wonder, he had it in his hand at the clinic having just sent sexy/flirty photos of himself to Michael without realizing it!----unfortunately, Chris didn't realize that the incoming call was from the same number.  Who really looks at numbers nowadays anyway?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Chris answered in his feminized voice of Christina.<br>\r\nDamn Michael thought...pure attention to detail his friend did.  No wonder he couldn't reach him.  Chris had given his cellphone to this woman as well so that way she just simply took over for him.  This girl was about same height as Chris and even looked a little similar, so he shouldn't have any issues passing her off to his parents as the same girl they previously met.  But, he wasn't expecting to reach the slutty Christina substitute, but he quickly pivoted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me Michael.  Don't worry...I'll be there to pick you up, just have to pick up a few things first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA confused Chris thought back to Jen.  She was already on her way to pick him up...she texted him so.  \"Oh...that's ok, I have a friend...\"<br>\r\n\"Nonsense,\" Michael said.  The little slut was now trying to play hard to get.  He loved that.  Super sexy and slutty when it's all a game...such a tease, then act all pure and innocent to drive the man wild.  Yes...girls that mean \"yes\" when they say \"no\" and secretly want their lover to overpower them and unleash their inner whore within.  Yes...this was going to be fun.  \"Look...we have to keep up appearances, for the wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit Chris thought.  Michael was right.  He couldn't just run off with Jen right now.  \"You're right.  Alright, I'll see you in about an hour.\"  Chris hung up the phone.  He had about 50 minutes left, and texted the number Jen had given him.  \"With the wedding and all that, we should probably keep things as they are for now.  But to keep it interesting here's a photo to rock your mind!\"  He then looked around for inspiration.  What other slutty girly pose could he do to excite this lesbian into wanting him more?  Looking around, he saw a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine on the table near the bed.  It had Taylor Swift on the cover, with a pouty look on her face as she leaned forward with one knee in front of the other sort of bending at the waist so you could peer a little down her dress.  With one hand on a hip, and the other in her wavy hair...she was a real sexy site!  Chris did his best to imitate that...but with only a corset and panties...his picture looked downright scandalous with his boobs spilling out the top of the corset.  He sent the picture and text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reply came back: \"Sexy.  Glad you agree and are taking this wedding seriously.\" ---Michael answered, but who Chris thought was Jen.  When Michael saw the picture, he almost blew a load while driving.  He texted back: \"So hot baby!  I can't wait to fuck your brains out!\"  Michael waited for the reply:  \"Neither can I.  It's going to be amazing.  I promise you!\"  With that, Michael put the phone down and concentrated on driving.  He was so horny now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Chris sat back.  Jen seemed to understand about having to wait until the wedding, he was happy about that.  And now she said she wanted to fuck his brains out.  Awesome he thought.  But he now had nothing to do, and was bored.  Seeing the Cosmo magazine, he looked at the cover.  \"21 Mind Blowing Sex Moves You've Never Tried Before\", \"Crazy Sex Confessions\", \"What, What in the Butt: Your guide to the ultimate \"O\"\", 263 Hot Looks for the Summer.  Pure trash he thought, but he was bored, so he opened it up and started reading it.  What the hell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen meanwhile had never left the clinic.  This was her day off...so she just mostly hid in her office.  No one would be looking for Dr. Reynolds today.  So, she covertly observed the texting and even phone call being done in Christina's room.  The gamble must have paid off.  Christina looked happy taking photo after photo of herself, and kept at it.  Oh...to see the text of that conversation would be a trip.  She prepared for her brother to arrive.  She'd have to be careful not to be seen, but needed to manage one more trick to make sure Christina's homecoming went as she hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael arrived at the Clinic.  He had no idea that this was his sister's clinic, and if he had, he likely would have tried to avoid her anyway.  He spoke to the receptionist, and said he was there for Christina Mullens.  With him, he had a bouquet of flowers, and a bottle of wine.  In his pocket, he had also an herbal supplement he sneakily picked up too...one that promised to work 4 times better than Viagra and allow him to get hard with ease for the next 48 hours.  The receptionist told him that Dr. Cox needed to talk to him, and he left the flowers and stuff there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Cox spent time telling him how to care for his fiancee.  Michael paid close attention.  Keep her in bed, apply the cream.  Avoid strenuous exercise.  Try to avoid normal sexual intercourse for a few days...but anything above her waist was fine.  The pain medication she is on would make her rather tired the next few days, so expect her to be sleeping at great lengths...which was good for her heeling.  Alcohol was fine with the medications, but avoid any barbituate compounds...as they'd add to the other drugs and could react in unforeseen ways.  Little did they know, that while this conversation was going on...that Jen was injecting just such a compound into the bottle of wine.  To an unmedicated person, it would cause no effect whatsoever.  But to someone on the cocktail of drugs and hormones in Chris's system...it'd have the effect of converting into a drug little different than ecstacy.  Yes, Christina would be having a blast tonight with just a glass or so of the wine...she'd be the life of the party, and then likely crash into a sleepy stupor for 10 hours or more.  Perfect she thought as she injected the contents through the cork.  She then went away and hid, but called Jill to come by now as planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Cox was just finishing when they emerged from her office and about to see Christina.  But Jill approached with a photographer, she had been posing as the TLC executive doing the story...and told them she was there to get a few shots of Michael and Christina together at the clinic.  Dr. Cox was pleased, as this would give the clinic the advertising she hoped to get.  Michael was a little annoyed, but who cared about a few photos.  The four of them entered the room, and Chris put down the issue of Cosmopolitan and looked up to a sea of flashes.  He saw Dr. Cox and Michael...but first saw that girl from the TV show.  Damn he thought!  She's everywhere.  Knowing he had to react quick, he lit into a big smile as fast as he could...beeming his smile at Michael.  The photos unmistakably looked like a young woman overjoyed to see her lover so close...a fantastic shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi sweetie,\" Chris said...leaning up, revealing his sexy clothes to the camera as the sheet fell off him.  Chris wrapped his arms around Michael, and Michael leaned over the bed to hug her back and give her another long wet kiss...similar as he had during the date night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo-la-la,\" Jill said seeing the sexy lingerie (which she had secretly bought the night before per Jen's instructions)  \"It looks like someone is happy to see you!\"  The photographer kept the pictures going, so Chris kept himself in the embrace and was forced to keep kissing his best friend.  His tongue swirled around Michael's tongue...which had been inserted into his mouth.  The photos kept going...for about 2 minutes...capturing this make out session.  Chris was there, being held in Michael's strong arms...and it made him feel small and delicate, which he oddly sort of liked.  Why?  he wondered.  During this, he thought he felt Mike's cock getting hard, and he was initially sort of glad about that?  That wasnt right.  He had to stop this...and so he did, pulling away from the kiss...but sort of feeling like he was missing something while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...that's quite enough you two love birds.  This isn't that kind of show!\" Jill joked.  They stayed and watched as Christina was given her coat, and she wore that atop her lingerie outfit and was taken to Michael's car in a wheelchair as per policy.  She was given the wine and the flowers, and they had a bag for her high heels, old clothes, and that Cosmo magazine she had been reading.\"  They gave Michael the prescriptions, and a tired Chris just sort of sulked into the passenger seat of the car and drifted off to sleep for the ride home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he did, he thanked Michael for coming to get him, and said he would be happy to get home.<br>\r\nYes, Michael said...\"We'll both be very happy to get you home.\"  He said, looking at her stocking covered knee next to him.  It was so distracting seeing this sexy vixen in his car next to him.  He got them home, and carried her into his bedroom.  Placing her down on the king sized bed, he went and got two glasses for the wine.  She was just starting to wake...and he poured some wine in two glasses.  Looking at her:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michael saw this beauty in bed, and marveled at his good fortunes.  \"How lucky can a guy get,\" he said holding the two glasses and thinking back to the various text messages earlier that day.  He put the glasses down, and slowly sat on the side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael reached over to this bombshell and gently stroked the hair off her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-hmmmmmpf\" Christina softly murmured to herself.  Michael was pleased to help awaken this girl.  He leaned down and pressed his lips firmly to hers.<br>\r\nChristina's lips parted just a little, and Michael pushed his tongue in, now almost laying on top of her.  Christina was lost for the moment on the edge of exhaustion, and felt like he was waking from a dream....but he was kissing....OH MY GAWD!!  \"I'm kissing Michael\" Christina thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed Michael off, and while this wasn't the first time, he could feel that this kiss just felt different.  There was a passion in it, and so he pushed Michael up, and was disoriented by being back in the apartment's bedroom.  Luckily, there were two glasses of wine, Michael, grabbed one and downed it fast to wash off the sensations of Michael's tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling, it's ok, you just look so pretty, I couldn't resist, but we can take it a little slower,\" Michael said a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty\" Chistina thought.  \"I like to look pretty\" the thoughts continued.  There was a very warm and soothing sensation building up from within her.  By now the wine glass was empty, and the sensation was addictive.  \"Must be the wine,\" Christina thought...but it felt SOOO good.  Christina greedily picked up the second glass, and got back onto the bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm pretty?\"  Christina asked in her soft, feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe, I think you're the most gorgeous creature I have ever seen, more beautiful than the Venus De Milo.\" Michael said with a smile.  This girl was hot, and if Chris found her as a substitute, and she was willing to do all of those things we texted about, she was the ideal partner...maybe this wouldn't even be a fake marriage after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina let out an involuntary giggle.  She took another sip of the wine to stifle her giggle....not realizing that it was barbiturate laced wine.  \"I like being pretty for you,\" Christina said and she cuddled back up to this man that she felt she needed validation from.  After all, being pretty was a lot of work, and hard work at that.  To know that it was worthwhile, Christina felt that deep down she needed some form of validation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be pretty for me all you want babe,\" Michael said, pulling Christina's body close into his.  <br>\r\n\"It's too bad sex is out of the question,\" Michael thought to himself as he felt his erection grow against Christina's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the wine glass in her right hand, Christina ran her left through Michael's hair as he kissed her.  It was so strange, so erotic, and so forbidden, yet welcoming that the entire sensations were overwhelming Christina.  She knew at that moment she wanted to be pretty, and appreciated, and loved and accepted, and...what's that?  Christina suddenly felt a rock hard cock against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I am pretty\" Christina thought as she realized she had successfully turned a guy on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was sort of blurry, but Christina broke the kiss, and sat back up smiling, and then finished the second wine glass.<br>\r\n\"It's crazy, but it's just one night,\" Christina remembers thinking as she tossed the empty glass to the floor, and now used both hands to undress Michael's shirt off.<br>\r\nWith each button being undone, Christina was becoming more aroused.  But unlike every other time, the arousal was internal.  She couldn't even really tell if she was getting hard, because she was so tightly bound and lost in her chain of thoughts in wanting to undress this man and stay happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh baby, I love you\" Michael blurted out, not even realizing what he was saying, as Christina used this encouragement to unfasten his belt, and Michael helped slipe the pants and his boxer shorts down in one quick motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was.  Michael's 7 inch cock just sprang free.  While not shaved, it was trimmed neatly, and was circumcised.  Christina stared at it in bewilderment for a moment of two.  The fog that was overcoming her was now seriously degrading her ability to concentrate and stay focused.  It was a pretty cock.  Pretty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like being pretty\" Christina said to herself.  She leaned over and felt she was really only leaning over to sort of fall asleep.<br>\r\nHer face sort of bounced up....she had just seductively kissed Michael's chest.  Bouncing back down....she had now kissed his abs.  And again...and again.<br>\r\nEach time her head was bouncing lower, but she was losing complete control over herself.  It was like being on a rollercoaster, and not having a steering wheel.<br>\r\nThere was a strangely familiar musky scent....it wasn't bad...just wait a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it baby, suck my cock, you look so pretty with my cock in your mouth,\" Michael said between moans of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, this seemed natural enough to Christina.  Like she had done this before in a dream or a past life.  \"I look pretty?  I like looking pretty...\" she thought.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmmmmmnnnnnfff\" Christina let out moaning as she took the cock in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the next few minutes, the ecstacy-like effects completely blinded Christina.  In her mind, she was just as happy as she had ever been in life.  She was pretty, and her beauty was being appreciated by a man, so it was definitely real, and if she died at that moment, she would have had found TRUE happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer life was complete.  All that it entailed was being pretty, dressing well, and gaining the appreciation for those efforts, and kissing and sucking on the tool of the person who most appreciates those efforts.  It was PURE bliss....and somehow that sweet tasting hard rod just became a little bit tangy..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now darling,\" Michael said...\"Swallow for me precious\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina did, with a warm and glowing smile.</span></div></div>",

The room was dimly lit, but she looked vaguely familiar.   \"Maybe it's Chris's cousin or something,\" he thought to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had slept well, and could tell there would be an extra bounce in his step today.  <br>\r\nThere always was when you had an enjoyable night with someone you actually cared for.  Sure, he had barely met this hot blonde, but those text messages were damn hot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike carefully slid his arm out from under the pillow.  <br>\r\nLuckily, Christina didn't wake.   \"Or maybe it would be fun if she did,\" Mike thought with a smile. \"No time for that.\" so Mike turned the coffee on and then took a shower.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got dressed, he needed an early start to ensure the wedding and account transfers were still going according to plan.  He had to keep his sister from discovering this phony marriage, but it would be much easier with a real girl than Chris.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And damn, I still have to endure a good arrangement with Chris and now this new Christina, but that's ok there was plenty to go around,\" Mike figured, also accepting that he might even come to fall for this girl if her feelings were genuine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, best to keep her on his good side. <br>\r\nHe leaned over her in bed, nudged her slightly, kissing her softly on the lips, \"see you later tonight honey, you're so very pretty.\"  *mwah*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhuhmmmmm...\" Christina said still dreaming.  \"I'm pretty,\" Chridtins said aloud and to herself.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christina was elated.   She rolled around on the bed in a blissful stupor (mostly the result of the cocktail of drugs and programming her mind had been through).   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Cox had said that she'd be pretty much out of it for a day or so, so the poor unsuspecting Chris slept and would sleep most of the day, as he was intended to in order to heal properly.  If he had known what he had done with his friend the night before, he'd have been mortified.   If he knew that the horny Mike would be returning later that day for another marathon session of feeding his cock to him all night long, he'd have ran for the door screaming.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he couldn't do that.   He was sleepy, and he was pretty.   He heard a voice tell him so, and so he smiled and swiveled on the bed cuddling with the pillow and dreaming.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dreamt about Mike actually.   And in the dream, Mike was naked and Chris was dressed up in lingerie and heels.  Mike held his hands on his temples, and was thrusting a hard dick into his mouth.   He was repeating constantly that he was pretty and a good girl.  Chris was uncomfortable with this dream, but couldn't stop it from happening.   It went on and on until Mikes cum erupted down his throat, and he swallowed.   Chris was horrified!   Was this a nightmare?   But somehow, the shame and guilt turned to pride as Mike in the dream praised him for being a beautiful sexy and pretty girl.  He was a pretty girl, and that cum was the proof.   This dream repeated immediately with Mike again in his mouth hard as a rock pushing his cock past his ruby red lips.   When would this end?   Chris lost track after the fourth time and sank into a haze.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the room, Jen and Stacy watched the unsuspecting Chris in bed with the hypno session recording playing in headphones placed on his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will this help?\"<br>\r\n\"Who cares.   Can't hurt.   Besides, based on our observations it looks like he and my brother did it at least 2 or 3 times.   That dried semen on his face and that stain on his corset are 2 different loads, and I have to assume that the eager cocksucker here managed to successfully swallow at least one load without spilling the seed\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, what a little slut!   And neither he nor Mike know?\"<br>\r\n\"Doesn't seem to be, I wonder how much longer this charade can last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, they packed up the equipment and left, but not after letting Cheis listen to that tape for 2 full hours of him repeatedly being told he was fellating Mike.   Chris was exhausted, and ashamed that he couldn't get these thoughts out of his head.   Must be the effect of constantly wearing these clothes, he figured he'd be fine once it was all over.  Just a memory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, little did he know...the only memory would be his old life, as he was well...WELL on his way to full womanhood</span></div></div>",

She was very groggy, felt hung over even.  She made her way to the bathroom and threw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headache and the sea sickness distracted her mind.  She knew she was having strange and confusing dreams, or were they nightmares?  But just as her mind could almost grasp what they were, the memory would just slip away, teasing her recollection.  It was there and not there at the same time.  Half and half, half a happy and warm dream, and half a terrible and dark nightmare from which she had to awake.  But since the dreams didn't awake her, and she didn't think dreams meant anything, she shrugged it off, they must have been nice dreams, and <u><b>he </b></u>was just confused because <u><b>he </b></u>was feeling sick with a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toast will help settle my stomach,\" Christina thought to herself as she lowered a slice of bread into the toaster.  She was too sick to eat anything else, and despite being starving, she didn't want much to eat anyway.  She saw the throat spray on the counter near her purse.  \"It must have gotten knocked over when I came home from the clinic,\" Christina surmised, \"man was I wasted from that ordeal, no wonder I slept so late.\"  Something compelled her to use the throat spray liberally, Christina rationalized it was for safety and protection in case someone called on the phone or surprised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Christina Mullens\" Christina said aloud in a very pretty and feminine voice.  Her throat was tingling from the spray, and she felt warm and confident and happy even at the thought of her voice being pretty and feminine when she heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toast popped, taking her out of this mini-trance of fascination with her voice.<br>\r\n\"So what's in store for me today,\" Christina wondered as she ate the toast with a single glass of orange juice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After putting the glass in the sink, Christina was just starting to feel a little better.  The black nightgown was soft and free flowing,it felt a little like a hospital gown, but nicer.  There were some stains on it, probably splash back from spit up or something, Chris thought to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the throat spray and returned it to the purse.  In the purse he saw a card \"call me,\" it was from the clinic and was an appointment card from<br>\r\nDr Coc.  Well might as well get this over with, Chris thought, reaching for his phone.  He dialed the numbers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr Cox please,\" Christina said to the overly friendly receptionist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Dr Cox came on the phone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling Christina?\" the doctor asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I woke up feeling sea sick, and I can't believe I slept until almost 3 pm,\" Chris started to say complaining, \"but I ate some toast and am feeling a little better now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is quite common, when you switch delivery methods, the body needs time to adjust, but it is better on your liver not to be taking pills daily, nevermind the hassle,\" Dr Cox said referencing the estrogen deposit surgical implant, but Chris thinking it was just the allergy medication pills.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense,\" I have to say though, it looks like I went three rounds with Mohammed Ali and lost,\" Christina said regarding his bruised and swollen nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The swelling will go down faster than you realize,\" Dr Cox reassured, \"and you're quite pretty despite the swelling already, and I'm sure you'll fit into any gown you choose for the wedding, and a beautiful bride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww thank you,\" Christina said reflexively.  He thought back to Jen and the clinic, he remembered now opting to get liposuction to reduce his waist, he had been so clever to think of that, but it was just a little body weight.  That would help him pull this off, and wasn't even permanent...yes Chris was smart to think of that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Christina realize that the hypnotic suggestions were already fogging his memory, as he had never agreed to liposuction, or estrogen to be administered, or a nose job to soften and reduce the size of his nose into something much more complimentary on a woman's face.  But these triggers were blurring his memories, and something about all of this felt just so right.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should I do today?\" Christina asked for advice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd just stay home, rest up, and give your body some time to heal,\" Dr Cox said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I can do that,\" Christina said reaching for the pain medication bottle in the purse.  \"When is my next appointment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you have a follow up appointment in 2 days,\" Dr Cox said reading from the computer.  \"And our office will send out the notifications for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Notifications?\" Chris wondered, like what a text?  Well his memory had been so cloudy that he agreed immediately.  \"Yes please do, that's a great idea and helpful for me too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok consider it done, bye Cheistina,\" Dr Cox said typing some notes into the computer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patient- Christina Mullens, feels good day after surgery...also reports that hypnosis with Mr Marshal is helpful, please arrange joint session for convenience of patient at next appt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Cox shook her head, she had never believed that hypnosis was all that effective.  But maybe it worked like a placebo, and if a patient like Christiba believed it worked, it could.  \"Well Jen, maybe I have to concede that Marshal does help some people\" Dr Cox thought to herself, updating Christina's patient file.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a few keystrokes, Christina's follow up appointment and hypnotherapy session were both booked.  </span></div></div>",

I guess I will just watch some TV.\u201d  After 20 minutes of watching those athletes on his favorite sports news he was experiencing weird flashes of his nightmarish dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, what is going on?  Is it getting hot in here or what?\u201d he says aloud.  \u201cI think I need a cold shower to clear my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing his face into the cold spray he is shocked by the sensitivity of his sore face, especially his nose and lips.  But that is nothing compared to what he felt when he fully stands under the cold water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh My God!\u201d he exclaims as the water reaches his breasts.  The sudden briskness causes his nipples to firm and stand at attention.  \u201cOoh, I can feel that all the way inside to my own nipples underneath, these breast forms are amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation continues, feeling like his normal arousal would, although his lower appendage seems to only be rising to half staff.  But internally it is building and by reflex he grasps his soft wood.  The feeling of his long nails on his member raises erotic images, the desire in his nipples draws his other hand there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe how good this feels when I do this,\u201d he thinks as both hands massage in unison.  Within relative moments the feeling in his chest escalates, and although he never gets more than a semi-erection, he blasts a load all over the shower floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drain he feels now that the pent up sexual energy has been released snaps him back to reality.  \u201cDamn, what am I doing?  I can\u2019t be getting off on this crap.  These breasts are messing with me.\u201d  He says as he quickly turns off the water and exits the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drying off he wraps a towel around his waist and then proceeds to dry his hair.  The air blasts bring his attention to his exposed breasts, and after a thought decides to re-wrap the towel, this time encompassing his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he is finishing up with his hair he admires how pretty it looks with this platinum color.  He is happy to let it hang free down his back.  The exertion of raising his arms up while doing his hair though reminds him that he does need to rest.  Before he leaves the bathroom he examines his face in the mirror, the bruising is down even further.  He uses some of the healing cream and then a bit of mascara.  \u201cThat really makes my eyes pretty,\u201d he thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo help with his aching arms and chest he snaps himself into a bustier that was in those clothes than Jen brought.  There was no way he could lace himself into the corset that is still lying on the floor.  With some bikini panties and a pair of his old jogging shorts he returns to the sofa to watch some more TV.  \u201cBut no sports this time,\u201d he thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two days of watching nothing but cartoons, science shows, and hair and make-up tip shows he is ready to get out for some fresh air.  His appointment with Dr. Cox is today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time he has not seen Michael.  According to the note Michael left while Chris was taking his cold shower the other day, Michael was back with his parents still taking care of his grandmother\u2019s house and belongings.  Chris didn't have any interaction with him either, other than a weird phone call; something about how Chris was clever to let Christina have his cell phone, to complete the position swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen stopped in only once during this time.  She had some more clothes for him and, after seeing him in his boy shorts, took the rest of his male clothing.  All of it, even his socks.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the clinic, Chris was ushered into an exam room and was told to get dressed into one of the gowns.  It was getting rather easy to undo the dress buttons in the back now, although he was not entirely comfortable with how short it was (and this was one of his longest).  After he removed the bustier, his new favorite due to how easy it was to operate and how comfortable it felt, he set it aside next to his 4\u201d spike heels.  Jen had told him he needed more practice walking like a girl and so she took all of his low heeled footwear with his male clothes.  She said she would return the shows in a couple of weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Cox was happy to see Christina, \u201cYou\u2019re healing up very well.  How do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a lot of time to rest up.  I can raise my arms up now with no discomfort and I was able to blow my nose this morning with no pain at all.  I used up all of that healing cream and nearly used up all of the throat spray.  If I am to keep using them I will need more.\u201d  Chris said all of this while demonstrating his ability to move his arms and twitch his nose.  He did not realize how cute he looked while he was twitching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues, \u201cI am having a problem while watching sports on TV.  Every time I watch them my breasts start to itch and my mind races!  Is there something wrong with me?  Do I need a medicine or something to watch this stuff like I used to?  I really want to feel my normal excitement when I watch my favorite teams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Cox made some notes and replied, \u201cThose feelings are normal as you get used to the new improvements.  They have not fully set in yet, and will take a few weeks to feel like normal excitement to you.  But don\u2019t dwell on it, it will happen before you know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she prepares to leave the room she continues, \u201cYou don\u2019t really need the cream and spray for much longer but I will get you a small amount, so you can ease yourself off from using it.  It is not good to cut it off directly.  Please stay here as Mr. Marshal will be right in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris\u2019 thoughts of who Mr. Marshal is are interrupted as the disheveled man rushes into the room.  As soon as Chris sees him a strange feeling starts to build deep inside him, his breasts warm up with the thoughts that begin to fill his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings Christina,\u201d Mr. Marshal says with a bring grin on his face.  \u201cPlease lay back on the table and close your eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris does as he is told and fails to see the door creep open with Jen peeking inside.  Mr. Marshal is too preoccupied with the beauty of Chris lying before him and he does not notice Jen at the door either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now relax Christina and let your head fill with pleasant thoughts.  Think of the warm things that we talked about last time.  How to make yourself pretty and why it is important to do so.\u201d  Mr. Marshal approached Chris, standing right next to the table.  While taking up Chris\u2019 hand he continues, \u201cThat\u2019s it.  Very good.  Relax and now think about Blue Kittens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mr. Marshal says the programmed trance key words he notices the immediate effect on Christina.  However, he does not yet notice the effect it has on Jen as she is spying at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you are now feeling very happy and you are feeling pretty.  But you want to feel more pretty and you know what you have to do to feel the prettiest you can be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction was as intended, Chris\u2019 hands reach over and start to feel Mr. Marshal\u2019s already stiffening member through his pants.  Mr. Marshal is startled just a bit when he feels a second set of hands reach around from behind him, as Jen finds she wants to feel real pretty too.  \u201cOh wow, I cannot believe she is still affected by that trigger,\u201d Mr. Marshal thinks, \u201cthat was set so long ago it should have faded by now.\u201d  He was not aware of Jen\u2019s eavesdropping during the programming of Chris and the reinforcing of her own programming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings quickly proceed as Chris and Jen work together to expose Mr. Marshal\u2019s member and then take turns taking him as deep as they can.  While one is going down the other is taking loving care of his sweaty balls.  Both are feeling nearly the prettiest they could possibly feel.  There is only one thing more they could do to feel prettier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dr. Cox returned to the room she was hearing some strange slurping and moaning sounds.  The door was not closed all the way so she slowly opened it further.  The sight inside brought her up short in surprise.  Mr. Marshal was lying flat on the table with both Christina and her co-worker Jen double teaming him like wanton sluts, neither getting enough of his raging member.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When Dr. Myers was notified that Mr. Marshal was back today he had to go down there and do something about it.  But this is not what he expected to see.  That pervert obviously has used his hypnotic skills to control a patient and one of his doctors, but what was his other doctor doing?  Being a voyeur?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exclamation abruptly interrupted the activities.  Mr. Marshal jumped up off the table, his pants falling down around his feet as he scrambled for balance.  Jen and Chris both try and keep contact with his member as he tried to get their lips and hands off from him.  Dr. Cox, standing closest to Dr. Myers, turned with utter surprise on her face, surprise that was quickly replaced with shame for being caught up in the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Myers, clearly now in control, sends Dr. Cox to her office, to be reprimanded.  He directs one of the security guards with him to take Mr. Marshal to the lobby and hold him there for the police.  He directs the other security guard to stay with the patient and Dr. Reynolds, who obviously are not in their right mind at this time.  He then proceeds to the reception office to call the police for Mr. Marshal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Little while later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Myers is still on the phone with the police, reporting what that pervert Mr. Marshal was caught doing.  While on the office phone he is texting on his cell phone to Dr. Fields, his psychiatrist friend. \u201cEmergency hypnotherapy needed.  Pervert has corrupted the mind of my best doctor and a poor patient.  Please come over ASAP to undo what that pervert has done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the busy lobby, a disparaged Mr. Marshal is having no luck influencing the guard holding him firmly by the shoulder.  \u201cI knew I shouldn't have got involved in a place like this, it\u2019s too upscale to not be trouble,\u201d he thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her office, Dr. Cox is sitting, gathering up what evidence she can to put all the blame on Jen.  \u201cI can explain my stunned appearance as I was just as shocked as Dr. Myers when I saw what was going on,\u201d she says to herself as she rifles through papers, putting them in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the exam room, Chris and Jen are just finishing off the poor security guard left to watch over them.  Feeling as pretty as they possibly can they now busy themselves with cleaning and primping.  The guard, drained like never before, stretches out on the table and succumbs into a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd later yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the busy lobby, \u201cWe\u2019ll take Mr. Marshal down to the precinct now.  Come down to answer some questions and fill out some papers as soon as you can, within the hour.\u201d  The detective is talking to Dr. Myers, the receptionist, and the two security guards, while his men are escorting Mr. Marshal out of the clinic in handcuffs.  \u201cI will need statements from Dr. Cox and also from Dr. Reynolds and Ms. Mullens when they are available.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her office, Dr. Cox is crying, worried about losing her job that she loves so much.  Thoughts are racing through her mind, \u201cWhy did I get involved with Jen\u2019s patient, or more correctly what was Jen doing with my patient?  I knew that hypnosis stuff was no good.  Look at the mess Jen created here.  Poor Christina doesn't even know what has happened to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the exam room, a very well put together Dr. Fields has both Chris and Jen in a trance as they sit side-by-side on the table.  Chris is still in the exam gown, evidence of his activities are dribbled down the front.  Jen is wearing her doctor coat with similar evidence on display.  Dr. Fields clears her throat and continues, \u201cYou are both very pretty and do not need outside markers to make you feel any more pretty than you already are.  Taking care of yourselves, doing your normal routines, watching what you eat and exercising will maintain your natural beauty and keep you feeling pretty and good about yourself.  Forget all of what Mr. Marshal has told you.  What he has told you is not the truth and therefore no longer needs to be retained.  Clear it from your minds.  The truth is that you are both very pretty and that you are still BFFs.\u201d  The last part about being best friends was based on a comment by the receptionist, who told Dr. Fields that Jen called in Mr. Marshal to help her good friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Dr. Fields, by telling Jen to forget all of what Mr. Marshal told her, although she still thinks most men are pigs, she returns to favoring the male over the female.  Deep within her she still retains some of her old bisexual feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso unknown to Dr. Fields, buried within Chris\u2019 mind is all the stuff Jen and Stacy dumped in there.  But are they strong enough to have any lasting effect.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It will be ok.\" She tells him as she rubs his shoulders, meanwhile thinking, \"wow, he's so soft and cute now, so sexy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris and Jen were still sitting on the exam table where Dr. Fields had just had a talk with them.  Dr. Fields had left the room just a moment before so she can fill Dr. Myers in on what she found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the director's office...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janice, what about Jennifer?\" Dr. Myers asks. \"How was she affected?  Is she going to be fit for work?  Were you able to clean her up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, I have never seen such a thing.  That pervert had the one girl, Christina, all messed up.\" Dr. Fields says as she reports to Dr. Myers.  \"It took some work to even get to the depth of the layers in her.  Jennifer was not so deeply affected.  It looks like some long time latent programming was buried deep inside her.  I couldn't tell how long it was hidden in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say that Dr. Marshal is good at what he does.\" Dr. Fields says as she takes a sip of her coffee.  She continues, \"But I am better.  I was able to undo everything he did...although he was using some kind of experimental drug to prepare the hypnotic state so I cannot be too certain they will come out 100%.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you better go back in there and make sure they are well, especially my doctor, she's the best one I have.  Also, the detective wants them down at the precinct to give their statements.

He tries to smooth his hair down with his hands and he still has a few sniffles when he answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am not happy with all that has happened to me.  Although I am glad I was smart to ask for the help with weight loss and I am happy with my nose problem being fixed.  I am worried that my voice and my body makes me a freak.

What have I gotten myself into?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Fields is surprised by that.  \"You couldn't really look any more normal, for a cute young woman such as you are, you are very pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Fields realizes she has some more work to do with her, \"how can she not think she is normal?\" she thinks to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about you Jennifer?  How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen has cleaned herself up as best she can.  She had taken off her lab coat and tossed it in the linen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is sitting now brooding. \"I cannot believe what Dr. Marshal had done to me and how long those things were in my head.  I cannot wait to give my statement to get him locked up.  I hope they throw away the key.  I am also worried about my friend Chris, will she be alright?  What can I do to help her?  Look at her, she's been traumatized!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dr. Fields writes some notes in her notebook she responds. \"Well, she will need some more counseling, some deep therapy too.  No more hypnotherapy though, I think she has had enough of that for a long while.  I think you are fine now, though, so I feel you will not need any more counseling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now you both should go home and cleanup.  Change into some clean clothes and then later go down to the precinct to give your statements.

We are still waiting for all the statements to be taken.  Some of the doctors and the staff have come in but the two main victims haven't come in yet.  Without their statements we cannot really charge the guy with much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he get his phone call yet?  I heard he said something about his lawyer getting him out before dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ya, we gave him his phone call.  He's using that hack Jimmy Viola.  That guy has connections but we can never catch him with any of it.  He hasn't even come in yet to talk with the Doc.  Maybe he's too busy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Michael's place:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris is getting dressed.  He took a long shower, and although he is still sore in places it felt real good.  Jen went home to get herself cleaned up.  She'll be back shortly so they can go give their statements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris looks at the clothes available for him to wear.  These new clothes that Jen brought were for his new size.  She said his other stuff wouldn't fit him any more and she also took all his male clothes so he had no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But all of this stuff is made to make me look sexy.  That's not something I should be wearing to give a statement.  What am I going to do?\"  Chris ponders as he tries on some different dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally settles on a light blue dress that comes down to just above his knees.  It says it has a special design to hold him in but with his recent body changes that's not all that necessary.  He matches it up with the same colored shoes, unfortunately they have a 5\" heel.  Putting his ID and bank cards into a matching purse he goes out to the kitchen to make some coffee and wait for Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Jen's place:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen got cleaned up quickly and was sitting talking with Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot believe that creep still had programming in me.\" She was saying.  \"From way back during that show he must have left some trigger key word, and when I heard it I was compelled to do what he made me do before.  It was so disgusting, that dirty pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was in shock, as her friend and mate described to her what she went through.  Although she hates men just as much as Jen she has been having these thoughts lately and is now a bit secretly jealous of what Jen and Chris got to do with the doctor.  Her spying on Dr. Marshal programming Chris has left a slight implant in her head, hidden desires for performing fellatio so she can feel pretty and be happy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you are ok now, Jen.  I'm sorry you had to go through that.  I am not sorry Chris had to do it though, as I'm certain he felt very pretty and it made him happy.  Besides, he needs to practice that to make Michael happy too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome undisclosed downtown place:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy Viola is talking to two large goons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to stop them from giving any evidence on the Doc.  Joey, you and Sal need to grab them up.  Bring them to the blue house and then convince them.  The Doc says to use this 'medicine' on them to help get the job done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe holds up two tiny vials of purple liquid and some needles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you give them this you have to wait some time, maybe two or three hours.  They will be passed out so go out and get yourself some food or something.  Then when you get back, even if they are still asleep, read aloud to them what's on this paper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shows them the document that Dr. Marshal had provided for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you are done with that they should be well convinced to not give any statements or testimonies.  Unload them at the bus station or somewhere like that so they can find their way home.  We wouldn't want any trouble if they came up missing.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was that?\" Chris exclaims as he starts to get out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't make it too far.  Neither did Jen.  Two large goons appeared.  They jumped out from behind the dumpster and quickly grabbed them up.  Within moments they had them stashed in a nearby van and sped off down the street.  Another goon jumped into Jen's car and drove off, bringing it back to Jen's place to leave it there.

They are dragged out of the van and brought from the garage into the house.  They are brought into a bedroom with two queen size beds and each are dumped unceremoniously unto the beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give 'em the shots and lets go get some food, I'm hungering for some riggies and chops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold your horses, we got to make sure these gals pass out first before we leave them here.\"  Joey says, putting the empty vials and used needles away.  He and Sal then watch the two girls stop wriggling and lie still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These babes are lookers.  Pretty and all but they could do with some exercise.  The blonde is a bit flabby in the ass.\" Sal says as he is taking the bindings off of Chris with Chris' ass right next to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, you know it.\" Joey replies. \"This one's got a few pounds on her too.  Too bad these girls don't take care of themselves like the working girls do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Sal finish taking the bindings off the girls and then leave, locking the doors behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than twenty minutes later Chris starts to wake up.  His head is murky, stuffed with cotton and heavy fog.  He slowly becomes aware that he is lying on a bed in a room he doesn't recognize.  There's a fireman's pole over by the TV.  \"They must be at a fire house,\" he thinks.  Across the room is another bed with someone else lying on it.  Lifting his head is too much and he decides to lay it back down.  He is soon asleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen, likewise has gained consciousness.  Her head is filled with buzzing bees and falling leaves.  Her vision is blurred but she can see the room she is in and that there is someone else on the other bed. \"Hopefully it is Chris,\" she thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen has some knowledge about her condition and finds her purse nearby.  Inside she has some oral spray that can be used to help clear her head.  Spraying some near the end of her nose makes her eyes water and brings up a deep sneeze.  Soon she has a much clearer head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Chris asks Jen.  He is still sneezing a bit as whatever Jen did has got his new nose twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough their heads are still a little stuffy and its a bit difficult to think they get up to look around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen gets busy trying to open the door.  \"It looks like we got kidnapped by those goons.  I don't know who they are but they were waiting for us in that street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think I need to exercise?  That one said my backside looked fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, what nerve to say I was overweight.  Did you notice how fat they both were?  You look fine Chris.  Don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris finds a TV and a DVD player, some books and sex toys and a stack of DVDs.  There is no phone in the room and both of their cell phones are missing, although the rest of their purses are intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we probably should be doing exercises and getting fit.  It makes sense to be healthy and I'm sure it will make us both happy.  Hey look, some of these are fitness DVDs.  Just our luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes and puts one in the player and turns the TV on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Girls, its time to workout.  You know you need this.  Its good for you.  Its fun.  And its easy.\" Says the scantily dressed woman on the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Chris and Jen now stand in front of the TV watching, their foggy minds in a daze.  Within moments they start to repeat the steps the woman on the screen is telling them to do.  It is for fitness and good bodily health after all.  That's what they need to be happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey feel so good after the first video they change it out for another one and then for the last fitness one in the stack.  In the matter of three hours their brains have absorbed all the contents of 'Goddess Workout: Bellydance Fitness for Beginners', 'Advanced Pole Dancing &amp; Fire (Extreme Fitness)', and 'Fitness and Flexibility'.  Unfortunately, the disc inside the 'Fitness and Flexibility' case was 'The Art of Fellatio' but neither of them noticed the mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe workout has both of them feeling both great and tired.  Their brains are still a bit murky and so they climb in one of the beds and fall fast asleep, snuggling close to each other.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She couldn't tell he had ever been a man, even half dressed in his own house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Chris said. \"All I ever do these days is get out of the house and do stuff! I feel like I never have a moment to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly the problem.\" Jen said, in her best 'reasonable' tone of voice. \"Your entire life revolves around planning for this wedding. Don't you want to get out and do other things? Or do you really want your entire life until it happens to be solely about a wedding you don't really care about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris blinked. Didn't care about the wedding? Something deep inside him had a need to be validated, a need to feel pretty. Everyone thought Chris was pretty, even Michael. The show and the wedding proved it. Against his will, he felt a resistance to her words. \"Well, I wouldn't say that I don't care about it.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen smiled mischievously. The hypnotism was still going well, she could see - along with the many, many weeks of immersion, manipulation and the original financial incentives. \"Well, since your on television now - or will be - and this is very public, for both that reason, and your sanity I think you need some hobbies. Or at least a hobby.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris paused. \"What can I do looking like this?\" he asked. \"I still have to pretend to be Christina. How can I have friends?\" Suddenly, Chris didn't feel so pretty; he felt self-concious and insecure, and in need of validation. Immediately, his thoughts turned to Michael. \"It might make more sense if I did something with Michael.\" he says, regretting the words as soon as they were out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen couldn't have planned it better if she'd put the words in his mouth herself. \"Well, not what I was going to suggest...\" she pretends, \"But you know, your right. It will help cement the fake bond the two of you are developing, while also giving you two a chance to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris immediately felt that resistance rising up inside of him again, to Jen's words that they had a 'fake bond'; and yet again, part of him felt hollow and empty without Michael around. His mind flashed back to his strange dreams of Michael, which caused a strange tingling sensation in his chest he couldn't quite identify; not entirely unpleasant, but slightly foreign. He shifted his body uncomfortably, and had a mental image of strong warm hands kneading his breastforms, which he tried to put out of his mind. What was wrong with him? He shook his head. He certainly wasn't pretty enough for anything like that. Or wait...he was pretty, right? He realized with a start that he hadn't responded to Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter?\" Jen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris shook his head. \"Uh, no, nothing. Just some strange dreams.\" he replied. \"Sorry, I feel a bit out of it lately, not quite myself you might say.\" He gave what he thought was a mischievous and boyish grin, but it came off looking feminine and impish instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen smiles. \"I understand completely.\" In more ways then you can possibly know, she reflected. \"I'll set something up for the two of you, how's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris nodded. \"I'd appreciate that, thank you.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll set something up and let you know.\" Jen replied, \"I'll talk to Michael and one of us will get back to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen left, grinning to herself.

Somewhere along the line, Jen convinced Gwen Chris loved Michael and therefore really wanted to be Christina.  Jen left when Gwwn refused to believe that, but not until after showing her proof.  She had videos of the real Christina.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that Chris was suffering from multiple personality disorder.   At times he was Chris, and making his choices accordingly.  At other times, he was living a secret life as Christina.   This began shortly after the deal with Michael, but he was only just finding out now about his other self.   But now Gwen showed him the video, and there he was.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would go to bed as Michael, and wake as Christina.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after the last operation with Dr Cox, Christina woke up, and begged for more.   For whatever reason, a month passed by before Chris woke up.  In that time a full sex change happened and Gwen returned.  Jen left when Mike made his choice to marry Christiba, for while the state did not recognize same sex marriages, it would recognize this one with Christina now officially a woman.  Jen had lost, and she left town.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was devastated.   He had learned he had a split personality, and now also learned that his split personality had gotten him a sex change operation.   He was stuck as a woman forever now!   This sucked.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Michael loved Christina, and he had few options, so he went through with the marriage to get the inheritance.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as much as he could, he could never get the Chris portion of him to accept being a woman.   While Christina lived Michael, Chris did not.  In time, they divorced and Chris lived with his share of the inheritance.   Some days he was Chris and therefore a lesbian that yearned to have her penis back, and sometimes he was Christina an insatiable slut that brought random men home.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just never who he was or who he was going to be from one day to the next.  But he did know, that whoever he was going to be on any given day, that'd he'd certainly be doing so wearing dresses and heels.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End</span></div></div>",

She was left with permanent brain damage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Gwen had come back, and yes she had discovered what happened with Jen.   Jen denied any wrongdoing, claiming you wanted it as you secretly loved Michael.  But you were never able to understand that, and certainly never able to refute that with the truth.  You were a mindless catatonic vegetable, almost brain dead.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you had the face and body most women would die for.   You were transferred to a special hospital, where they could care for you as best they could.  The orderlies loved you, but not in a sleazy way.  You were the prettiest patient they had, everyone thought it a pity that you were so incoherent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Michael lost the inheritance.   Jen and her sister Kate (bet you forgot it was 2 stepsisters, Kate had just been absent from the story) had won.  Jen lived in absolute luxury while you were trapped in your own body in a hospital.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA body that was dressed up everyday in panties and bras and blouses and such.   The staff styled your hair and polished your nails and applied your make up.   You had few visitors, but those that did thought you were a knock out.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, somewhere trapped beneath that was Chris...if he existed at all anymore, and he hated it all, but was unable to say anything.   And whenever he did try to frantically scream something, no one understood and it only caused him to drool...this forcing more people to come fix his make up and clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris died many years later, and wore women's clothes for the rest of his life.  He was buried on hospital grounds wearing a very beautiful dress with matching heels.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: people, if you can't write a coherent chapter, here is some free advice: don't even bother trying.

He weighed about 100 pounds more than you.   He wasn't a bodybuilder, but wasn't out of shape either.   With dark brown hair that was almost black, he looked to be about 35 years old or so.   He was of a pale complexion, and seemed like he was from Eastern Europe or perhaps Scandinavia on heritage.   You learned that he was married, in what was increasingly a sexless marriage.

A transition you had no intention of ever doing, this was just something for you to do until you got onto your feet.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the worst of it wasn't the dressing, or the heels, or the awkward conversations with coworkers-those that knew your tg status complimenting you how passable you were and asking about how your boyfriend liked it (even though you didn't have or want one).   The women that didn't know would talk about menstrual cramps and sex talk about their husbands and awkwardly assumed you understood because to them you were one of the girls.

It took a mere 10 minutes until he climaxed, and you had the job.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unbeknownst to you, he had it all videotaped.   He then said he was going to expose you to the company as an eager whore unless you met him every other day or so to suck him off again, and so you did.   You went to work, getting up early to dress in a sharp suit and heels...spent time with make up and perfume to create the proper illusion of feminist, and ran for that bus in heels.

You loved your life, and wouldn't change a thing of your past even if you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Which given the interactive nature of this story site...you can!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End</span></div></div>",

He rarely spoke to Chris after that, partly because he was mad his friend didn't help him out, but also because he was embarrassed he even asked.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few years later, Chris was finding work very hard to come by.   He often thought back to that plan and the $10 million he would have made.  He could have retired early rather than slave away in a cubicle paying off his student loans.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, he had to admit, if he was honest with himself, he often wished he had said yes to the plan.   I mean, actors get paid to dress up as women, so it wasn't really that different.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, too late now.   He returned to his job, and lived a moderately happy life.  He never struck it rich, but did one day marry...then got divorced since his work schedule was too demanding.  He later had a fianc\u00e9e, with whom he had a chil with, but they called off the wedding when she confessed she was really a lesbian.   She was a good mother though, and Chris worked as hard as he could to pay the child support, and mostly was able to do so in time.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the recession of 2029 hit him hard, and he. Was laid off.  When he couldn't pay child support, she eventually took their son away moving to Texas with her domestic partner.  Chris rarely saw his son anymore, and typically only 1 holiday a year or so at best.   He took a job as a cashier at Walmart, and months turned to years and turned into 12 years before he realized that so much time had passed him by.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis career was non-exist ant, unless you count becoming an assistant manager a career.   He made ok money now, enough to survive, but had no wife and only 1 child he barely ever saw.   He spent most of his money and free time at a local bar, but really...he was very lonely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe often thought back to that easy $10 million, and wished he had taken that chance.   He died alone from depression and alcohol abuse in 2045 at a relatively young age.   He never held more than $5000 in his bank account, and never paid off his loans.   He wasn't a happy man, but at least he died exactly like that...as a man.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if you could have asked him and shown him the alternative, I suspect he would have been happy about that at least.</span></div></div>",

He tried to tug against the arm, but it was immovable as it continued to follow its owner down the aisle. He looked up again to see the smiling man at the altar. Suave, jet black hair, thin moustache, clearly rich. The smile was clearly intended for some beautiful, blushing bride and being on the receiving end of it threw Jasper off. For a moment he didn't appreciate that with the pure white dress, the subtle makeup, all the little details, he looked like he was a bride that had waited all her life for this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper was pulled up to the altar, the big man finally letting go and taking a few steps back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper looked over his bouquet to see the smart man facing him, in front of an altar, in front of a congregation of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today...\" the priest started..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world seemed to spin around Jasper and he cursed Jacqueline, this had all been some cruel trick.

How on earth was he supposed to get out of this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in sickness and in health...\" the priest continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper ignored him, taking a quick sideways glance at the side doors in hope of finding an exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were four scattered throughout the chapel. Two on either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you, Jasmine, take...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck though as men like the one behind him were guarding each one. He looked above and past the suitor at the window past him, looking to see if there was anywhere he could climb out to escape either above or below, but no luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSudden clapping distracted Jasper, as the crowd had suddenly began to politely celebrate. Wait a second...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis left hand was gently lifted away from the bouquet in that distracted instant. He gasped quietly in surprise as the smart dressed man slid a stunning diamond studded ring past his delicate red nails onto his ring finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, WHAT? Wasn't the priest supposed to wait for the bride to say I do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe froze up slightly. When he looked up and down at the window...did he look like a timid bride nodding shyly to accept her wedding vows?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may now kiss the bride.\" the priest closed his book with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper felt his blood run cold as the man, (his HUSBAND??) lifted back his veil. The fear that crept into his eyes probably merely looked like nervous anticipation to all those involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... are my babe now.\" the man said with a pleased smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper was stunned, his long dark eyelashes blinking in a way far more seductive than he wanted. He was someone's WIFE? His...babe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this moment of stunned vulnerability, the husband grabbed the bride tenderly by her chin and pulled her crimson lips into his.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jasper couldn't believe it, a mixture of shock, fear and sheer disbelief stunned him to the point that he couldn't believe that this man's lips were now pressed against his, that his moustache were tickling his face, and what? He could feel the man's tongue in his mouth, firm and energetic! Through this he could hear applause and cheers flood the church. This was crazy, they actually thought Jasper had married the guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper was getting out of here. No question, he was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the long deep kiss gradually came to an end, the man moved away and Jasper turned to face down the aisle, practically blinded by the countless camera flashes. Through them, Jasper could see the double doors he'd entered the church by were now open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tang of the man's tongue on his echoed through his mind, but Jasper forced himself to ignore it. With at breath, and also trying to ignore those big men, he strode straight towards the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was chaotic, the cheers continued, the crowds seemed to reach out and touch him from the aisle, he heard \"congratulations\" and even a \"you're beautiful\" between all the yells, the flashes continued; Jasper just kept skating forward, as fast as his heels would allow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the doors, he suddenly realised he was still holding the bouquet. Angry at both the crowd and this physical symbol of femininity, he launched the bouquet up and behind him into the church. The crowd suddenly started getting ecstatic, Jasper just walked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his light adjusted to the bright sun, he could make out an big black limousine at the bottom of the church steps. Florally decorated, and with cans trailing behind it, Jasper had no illusion what it was there for. A smartly dressed chauffeur was even holding a door open in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper wanted to give the limo a wide berth, but navigating the church steps in heels without tumbling and breaking his neck became his next immediate concern. He found he had to hold up parts of the wedding gown skirt to make sure they didn't interfere with his steps. After carefully making his way down the stone steps, he found his feet on slightly less stable gravel, and looked up. The chauffeur was still looking at him with a smile on his face, and he seemed to be indicating the passenger door of the limo. Before Jasper could react he felt an arm around his waist and he found himself nose to nose with the man he'd just (gulp!) married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steady on,\" he said, \"there's plenty of time soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned Jasper to see the huge crowd come out of the church doors. Coming down the steps, flooding to the left and right, Jasper and the man faced them side by side. There were photos and cheers and suddenly a rain of rose petals came down upon them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you all for coming here,\" the man announced in a loud voice. \"I know some of you think this is sudden, but when it's love, it's love!\" More petals rained down, Jasper found himself trying to wave them away, stop them getting caught up in his mascaraed eyelashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man continued \"It is heart-warming to see everyone share the joy and love that Jasmine and I have found in finding eachother. We hope this is the first of many great memories that we'll share together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper stopped waving, and turned towards the man. Jasmine? What sort of reality did this guy live in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned towards Jasper too, and moved in for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no, Jasper wasn't going for this again. Even with their lips touching and the man's arm behind him, Jasper moved back, into the open limousine door and the limo itself. The moment the man's arm loosened, Jasper broke free and scrambled across the plush leather seats (in spite of the skirt/gown), and pulled the handle of the door on the opposite side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't open. Jasper yanked it several times more, flipping the locks on and off while doing so, but the door didn't budge. <i>Child locks? Really?</i> Jasper awkwardly rotated, and got himself sitting down on the the soft leather seats, facing the rest of the limo. The ruffles of the white dress seemed to push up around him and the veil had spun back into his vision again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to where he had come from, Jasper saw the man enter the limo from the same door. He landed on the seat beside Jasper, and with a pull he closed the door with a clamp, instantly dampening the sounds of the crowds outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, Jasper wasn't doing this. Maybe there was another door on the far end of the limo? Looking forward towards the rest of the limo, he found it was surprisingly spacious with more leather seats, visible bottles of champagne in ice buckets, a minibar(?) and something that looked like a curved large sofa at the far end end. Jasper certainly wasn't used to this standard of living, coming from humble beginnings and finding that his actions tended to lead to more humility. He'd always yearned for this level of luxury, and his efforts to gain it had now borne fruit in the most perverse and unexpected way possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man clasped Jasper's hand in his \"My dear\" he said. This brought Jasper back to the current moment, along with the crowds now seemingly pounding and slapping the outside of the limo with somewhat muffled cheers, and the engine starting up. Jasper tried to get up, but at that moment the limo pulled forward and unsteadily Jasper fell back into the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rattle of cans and the sounds of the crowd rose up from behind them. Jasper craned his neck and looked out the rear window, pulling the veil out of his delicate eyes as he did so. The crowd was still waving, the cans rattling, and the church seemed to gradually move away from them. In desperation Jasper slammed his  partially loved hand against the rear window, but it held solid. He tried to call out but barely a whisper came out. \"For the last time I'm not doing this!\" he tried to yell, waving fanatically, the crowd just waved back. Slapping his hand against the window one more time, he paused he noticed the glaring  big diamond ring that now sat square at the base of his ring finger. As some of the implications about this hit him, the crowd and the church pulled further and further away into the distance, until the limo finally turned a corner, and they were gone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jasper averted his eyes, looking out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver turned, headed for a building not far from the church, equally grand and appearing to be of similar architecture. Was THAT where the reception would be?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the man reached out a firm, sturdy hand to Jasper's smooth leg. Jasper froze, his eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should a lovely and beautiful rose like yourself have to slave away working day in and day out?\" He gently caressed the leg, sending a shiver down Jasper's spine. \"From now on, you've got just one job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper felt the parts of his body relax that he hadn't even realized had tensed up when the man released his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the man's voice suddenly was much closer as Jasper realized he had his mouth right next to Jasper's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Be beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss to his neck was sudden but brief, over before he could recompose himself to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much was happening and it was hard to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and the man stepped out. The crowd was already starting to rebuild around their car as more and more guests hurried to keep up with the newlyweds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned and slightly bowed, holding out a hand to help his bride out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear...\" that smile again...</span></div></div>",

Maybe the wedding dress was influencing him a bit too much, but he just crossed his arms and pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's smile flickered for a second, then he regained it. \"Alright then,\" and he sat back into the limo beside Jasper, closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what this is. You're still sore about that whole police thing... the whole getting thrown in jail for your debt... maybe the whole thing made you feel a bit vunerable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hit a bit close to home. Jasper got up and walked down the length of the limo. It turned out there weren't any extra doors at the front part of the limo, the only doors were at the back where he'd come in. In a huff, he sat down on the curved, sofa like seat. Unfortunately the man followed him and sat close beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you don't need to worry about that now. As my wife you now have more than enough money to pay everything off, such petty concerns such as debt and gambling are beneath you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper paused, and turned towards the man, questioningly. Despite everything, the lure of money was still a pretty powerful pull on him. The allure of that mountain of gold would always shine on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, smiled at \"Jasmine's\" reaction and reached up to knock on the smoked window to the driver's compartment \"One more loop, we need to prepare.\" and the limo took off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to \"Jasmine\" with her deep searching eyes, the poured on what he thought she'd like to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's sudden, and such and adjustment, but can you really say your life was better? Desperately searching for the win that will make everything easy? Poker can be a dignified game, but to play it when you're not good enough to win, and don't have enough money to lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper ground his teeth, the effect compressing his ruby lips. This guy was not scoring an easy victory against him, he may not be the best gambler, it was all just a scam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't have to worry about all that now. You've had your win, this is it? The gold at the end of the rainbow! The high life.\" Smoothly, he took a bottle of chilled champagne out of the minibar and two flutes. Deftly filling them both up, he offered one to Jasper. \"Taste what is has to offer, I'm sure its something you've never had before.\"</span></div></div>",

Marble columns raised up on either side that held up a vaulted roof, and ornate sculpted details could be seen in the high ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed by this, Jasper didn't notice he was leaning a bit further into the man for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked by the reception and towards a large corridor that had a great big sign and arrow with fancy cursive writing on it: \"Reception for the wedding of James and Jasmine\" It took Jasper a moment to register that James was the man that was right beside him. They walked down the brightly lit corridor. A huge swarm of people followed, far back enough to give space, but close to make their presence felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple went through another double doors and the next thing Jasper knew, they were in a huge room with a whole crowd of flickering of faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations James! And Jasmine, I don't believe we've had the pleasure?\" Jasper hesitated, then shook the guy's hand. Someone else came up, \"I wish you the very best in happiness, if there's anything you need...\" It went on, Jasper tried to remember some of the faces, some elderly, some young, one was a little girl who just said \"I want to be as pretty as you when I get married\" and Jasper found himself blushing. James smiled as it went on and offered quick replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a somewhat elderly couple came up and James switched his tone to a more sincere voice. \"Mum, Dad, I'd like you to meet my wife Jasmine. Jasmine, these are my parents.\" Out of sheer awkwardness (\"wife\"), Jasper smiled and shook their hands. Part of him wondered if with some of that mature parental wisdom, they'd instantly be able to see through the sham and know what was going on.

Of course his parents had their doubts. He had been married before, but for the wrong reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis encounter with Jasmine had stirred up something inside him. She had been just as timid at the poker table that night, and he had initially thought it merely a ruse as her winnings began to build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he heard that Jasmine had gone to Jacqueline saying he had cheated, he had not. He told Jacqueline, that firey woman, as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, he had in the past, but something about playing with a woman that could match him excited James. So he asked Jacqueline to persuade her to honor their bet. And it seemed she had decided he was right, after she calmed down, he assumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting her to marry him...he suddenly wanted nothing more.

She actually looked happy to see it and slowly took it from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...God, she was beautiful. And her smile...how he loved the look of her looking happy and content, not the upset grimace she wore at that table. The next time she played cards...she would feel beautiful and liberated, not desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched her ruby lips as she took a drink, sighing contently. Her sexy eyes met his. She blinked, her long enticing lashes making his heart skip a beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in longer than he could remember, James blushed with a smile, caught staring at his own wife like she was  a goddess descended from the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And as heavenly as she looked in that dress, he was certainly looking forward to tenderly taking it off her...</span></div></div>",

I thank you all, friends and family, for being here for this very important day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe applause resurged as Jasper felt himself guided along. The whole world felt surreal. He wasn't Jasper, the small time gambler, trying to make it big...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a bride, on her wedding day, being whisked away by her new husband. Every swish of the dress, blink of his eyelashes, click of his heels...it was like he has suddenly been throw into the role of someone else (to be fair, he had).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors closed behind the two of them as they exited the hall. James let out a content sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took Jasper's hands in his. Jasper looked up at him, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My beautiful wife...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was he supposed to do? It wasn't fair, everything he ever wanted, just...spread out in front of him...and all it would take was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames guided the star-struck bride along, leading her into the elevator. He hit the key for the penthouse and walked behind her, wrapping his arms around her waist and gently caressing her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened to a luxurious room, a massive bed, glorious view of the city night out the window, paintings over the walls, expensive stonework...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames could see the wonder on his bride's face. He put his hands on her shoulders and began to massage them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And all of this...is yours now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper couldn't think. It...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames gently began to guide him into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...what say we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper felt himself be guided toward the bed and the massive mirror beside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beautiful bride looked back at him. Her stunned expression was like his, but she almost looked...happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...officially make you...my wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zipper of the dress was slowly pulled down his back. Jasper looked on in the mirror as the dress slunk down the beauty in the mirror's shoulders until it fell to the floor, exposing her pure white lingerie and corset. Her skin was dark and smooth, standing out from the ivory of her undergarments. Her garter Sat tantalizingly on her thigh, and her hair fell freely over her \"breasts\" and down her back as James undid her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll it took to never struggle again was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames scooped his hands under her, lifting his bride into his arms. He gently kissed her neck, making her shiver in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be taken care of...and doted upon...and treated like something to be cherished...and it just meant becoming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He placed her into the bed where she sat...angelic...beautiful...waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper sat on the bed, clad in only bridal intimates, the white choker, the heels, and the veil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was within reach. He just had to reach out and become...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond James he could see his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman in the mirror looked at him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames set upon his bride gently but eagerly, starting with kisses from her ankles, slowly up her leg to her thigh. Her eyes rolled in her head and her breaths grew sharp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped up to her bosom, every touch of his lips eliciting a tiny noise from her. Up and down each breast, over her collarbone, her neck, ears...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she just quivered underneath him as her breathing got heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper lay there, every kiss sending a tingle up his spine and across his skin. That he shouldn't be enjoying this was becoming more and more silent a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all...it is only natural for a bride on her wedding day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArousal was building in the air, James worked his way down and up her other leg and, knowing what he wanted next moved to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames froze. His bride looked at him, a puzzled look on his face. She sat up slightly to look at him...but he was too busy looking at her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down and then blushed, embarrassed. She looked up meekly at James and waited his judgement.</span></div></div>",

You know it should hurt, the damned thing looks like it went several inches into your flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comforting warmth, like a stifling blanket stops your squirming, as it withdraws you feel another wave of warmth spread out from that point. Your head is too heavy to move, but you still have control of your eyes. Soft pink flesh spreads outwards from that point. Looking babyish soft and new. Again the same goofy smile covers your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt spreads faster and faster, soon reaching an inch across. In another minute, a two inch circle of new skin is visible. You know you should feel panicked and terrified. It's rewriting your DNA, but you remain limp and unconcerned. Another minute passes and it's covering your whole belly. After that it accelerates even faster. You feel the changes working over your body as it reaches them. Beneath the blanket it's reached your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch, as the bulge visible in the blanket sinks lower. Distantly, you know what this means, but it still has no impact. Watching you see the outline of your legs beneath the blanket shift, taking on more feminine dimensions. A loud crack comes from your pelvis, as your hips widen. It sounded painful, but only a wave of heat comes from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch, your feet shrink, becoming far smaller, before retreating beneath the sheets, as your legs shorten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chest mercifully remains flat, even covered with its' tender new surface. You frown, or at least know you should, as you try to work out what the end result is going to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips tickle as the spread reaches your face, your breathing altering as it reaches your nose. Rising to your eyes, you find yourself blinking uncontrollably. The sensation of ants crawling over your scalp makes you want to leap from the machine. But your limbs refuse to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the blinking fades, your breathing slows, becoming heavier, more deliberate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down you see the reason why, and receive the answer as to where the changes are going. Your T-shirt is distorted by the new bust you've developed. A laugh that should be hysterical, tickles your throat, surfacing as a trilling giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch, the bust swells even fuller. Their size is hard to judge, you're not used to seeing a bust from this angle, and with the alien-ness of this situation, and your new body it's hard to tell their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0a/c3/b8/0ac3b8ecb8421a1e37d8f9d409f1600a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0a/c3/b8/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn image flashes into your mind, and you enjoy her cute, pixieish looks. A voice asks from nowhere, \"Are you happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hazy, and disconnected, you like this gorgeous new woman being shown to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"a cutie....\" you mumble, the words barely shifting your lips, \"but.... more... you know... more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands refuse to illustrate the size of bust you like on your women. But the words make it through. Briefly, you shut your eyes as another wave of warmth spreads out from your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now?\" That same voice won't let you sleep, or take any rest, \"And now?\" it repeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/92/36/a7/9236a7930ddc4eec67d89b8a85bbd96a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/92/36/a7/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks bustier, now. Bustier than most Asian chicks, but you still have a fantasy. The drugs flowing through your body keep you honest, and unconcerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More...\" you mutter, the words audible to yourself this time. You hear the soft, tone of a woman, yourself?... as your eyelids get heavy once again. A sigh spilling from your lips as you drift off once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you struggle back awake, it feels like swimming for the surface. As you wake, you still feel tired from the exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now?\" That same voice, bothers you like annoying insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a2/1e/6e/a21e6e7f9cd5e87e918add43a43f719f.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a2/1e/6e/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... that's fine... I like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice stronger, it still sounds oddly feminine. Finally, that dizzying warmth fades from your muscles, and the dullness from your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes crash over you, as you realize that the body you wanted, is your own, it's yours that's busty and Asian. You gape at your massive tits... These can only be TITS! Their sheer size dismisses more subtle terms. Far too large for bust, or bosom. These are Tits! As you surge forward to escape the machine, you feel their weight properly for the first time. Your skinny arms too weak to stop them dancing, sloshing over your chest. You leap, flailing from the machine. The inertia of your tits making it ungainly, and sends you crashing to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour whole centre of balance is different now. The room far larger too. No! It's you that's shrunk... The best guess, at least a foot of your height erased by that damned machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour last drug addled words haunt you, as you stuggle upright. '<i>That's fine... I like that...'</i>, a humiliating reminder, of your misjudgement. Your muscles still ache, from unfamiliar usage, and you sit/collapse onto a nearby padded bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you feel the other changes. Your wider hips came with a fuller ass. It spreads over the bench, far, far more than your petite, taut male ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, your arms can't reach the bench to steady you, not without brushing against those wider hips, and that sumptuous, round, fleshy, firm ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c7/c2/08/c7c208f6142a812de2ab637fe1825dc0.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c7/c2/08/...</a></span></div></div>",

You wanted a <i>haircut</i>, dammit, not a do-over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou surge to your feet, the answering ripple from your soft bits only adding fuel to the fires of your rage. This <i>stupid</i> body, turning tanktops into bandeaus and exercise shorts into thongs with its dammed endowments!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI DON\u2019T WANT THIS!\u201d you shout, driving your fist into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regret this for three reasons. Firstly, you just punched a stone wall. Ouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly, your voice is unusually high and annoyingly soft, turning all impassioned protests into shrill whinging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirdly, your accent makes the phrase sound like \u201cI dontu wanto dis!\u201d Wait, you didn\u2019t have an accent, didn\u2019t you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble over to a metal table strewn with referential magazines, cradling your bruised fist in one hand, testing words and phrases under your breath. Lips and tongue betray your mind\u2019s commands, twisting any spoken words into the cadence of a non-native. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith effort, you can produce a phonetically accurate sentence, but it still drips with the clipped hesitance of a second language. You\u2019re a changeling with accent and vocabulary perpendicular to one another, trapped between two worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collapse in a metal chair, calculatingly sagging in a way that doesn\u2019t collide your oversized rear with the backpost while giving your shoulders a rest by placing your overlarge bust on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes unconsciously flit to a sign of motion on the opposite side of the room, but it\u2019s merely a mirror. You don\u2019t avert your gaze fast enough to avoid the image searing itself in your mind\u2019s eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s almost as humiliating as your new accent. You see a girl struggling with her own features, a bust that far outstrips the girth of her chest and the hips and rear of a horse. Too-mature curves and a too-young face, a caricature of feminity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you could manage it if it were one or the other. Being an over-endowed <i>woman</i> seems a better fate, able to impart advice to younger peers with knowing smiles and contralto tones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, you\u2019re burdened with this form of contradictions, attracting lust from men and scorn from women. Any recognition of competence or intelligence would be smothered by your unwieldy body, baby-face, and piping voice. Even your smile looks insecure, asking the question \u2018Am I good enough?\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perfect prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark cloud passes over your face as you consider your future. What were your viable career paths? A car-show model? A booth babe? Or was your body too lewd for even those?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stifle these dark thoughts by grabbing and desperately leafing through a nearby fashion magazine. Your bust serves an unexpected, but demeaning purpose as a book-rest, as you page through the pictures of women after women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, there are figures like yours in the book, diminutive women with overloaded curves. They\u2019re not as miserable as you though, their lips curved by secret smiles or split open in jubilation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe it\u2019s their clothes,</i> you think to yourself, tracing the picture of a woman cutting a nice figure in a suit. You pick at the stretched band of your tanktop, recognizing its unsuitability as a garment with its rough fabric and small size. Your shorts are no better, the band unable to clinch around your small waist but snagging around your wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanto clothesu\u2026\u201d you mumble, wincing at the warped words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d chirps a familiar artificial voice. You jolt up in your chair, eyes wide and bust sloshing. Was there going to be more needles, more dammed <i>questions?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no such thing happens. Instead, a rectangular outline in a nearby wall appears, depresses, and slides away, revealing an ink-black room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour throat is dry for a few moments. Should you stay, and wait for someone to come reverse this heinous process? Or do you go forward, hopefully to correct this mistake at the end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, it\u2019s the unspoken promise of garments that drives you forward. The maddening chafing and constant reminder of your bouncy bits will drive you mad, and there\u2019s no guarantee that the attendant\u2019ll come back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou totter forward into the blackness, gently <i>eek</i>ing at the wall-door sliding shut behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll is darkness for a short bit, until the sudden light blinds you. You blink your dazzled eyes to clear them, only to have your heart sink in disappointment at your new view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is full of clothing, yes, but only racks and racks of...</span></div></div>",

The feeling of your body being spread without your consent, along with your current state of undress, can't help but make you feel vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could anyone ever feel comfortable doing this?\" you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the top of the tube a robotic eye descended and hits you with a horizontal line of red light. Slowly it follows the shape of your body, starting at the top of your head and down to your feet. Once it hit your feet, it then went back up again to you head before going down once more. It did this a few times before an image appeared on the glass of the tube, which appeared to also be a screen of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn screen was a message stating that there may be an error and that it was sending a message to an Operator before continuing. Before it sends however, you hear the light sound of the machines and lights power down to silence. The lights go out and you are left in darkness. Unfortunately, the arms didn't release you when they powered down. You pull at your restraints but your freedom is still out of your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to wonder if someone was going to come back and check on you but the thought is still in it's infancy when everything kicks back on again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scan Complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commencing Cleansing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had little time to register what was said before your body was hit with water. Water sprayed out from tiny nozzles that were lined inside the tube's walls. If you could jump, you would have when you feel something touch your hair. You can't see but you guess that one of these arms are cleaning your hair, which you can confirm as you watch suds flow down your front. Your hair is teased and manipulated before you feel something cover the top of your head. You look down and expect to see the tube filling with water, but instead see the suds circle small drains on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water stops before you are hit with some kind of foam which sprays on you and sticks to your skin. The foam is fine at first but soon begins to feel hot and uncomfortable. You start to worry about being burned by this chemical as it's flowery odor fills your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, water hits you, this time a huge relief. The growing pain is gone and replaced with the soothing water as it rinses the foam and your body hair away. After the foam is gone the water stops. You continue to stand dripping as you feel your hair released from it's covering. more arms come into view with cutting implements and brushes. There is a flurry of cutting and brushing as your hair is cut and styled in a feminine style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms complete their job and leave, signaling another spray of water to wash the hair away. Once the nozzles finishes, the tube is filled with moving air, drying your supple, smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" you say as you look at yourself reflected in the glass of the tube. You are disheartened with how girly your body looks, not to mention your hair. It's clear that something has gone horribly wrong. You stand, mouth agape, as the machines begin their next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore another word could be said, a bucket-like helmet descended down the tube and covered your head.  There was a hiss of air and you could feel pillows or bladders being inflated inside the helmet, holding your face in position. A tube was extended pushing into your mouth, and you could feel your lips being lifted by smaller bladders, and something pressing against your teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOVA's voice filled your ears from small speakers that had been positioned over your ears in the helmet. \"My scans showed your teeth could use some whitening. And I will shape your brows. There is no need for concern. The helmet will not harm you. There may be some discomfort as I proceed. Please enjoy some musical selections as the process begins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome pop music filled your ears as you could feel little stings on your brows, making your eyes water. The tube in your mouth began pumping something slimy onto your teeth. And you could feel something greasy tracing itself onto your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several songs, the stinging in your brows stopped, and NOVA's voice again filled your ears.  \"Makeup application initiating. Please keep your eyes open until told otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes tightly, dreading the thought of what this system glitch was doing to you. You wanted to tell the machine to stop and let you out, but the helmet and the tube prevented anything more than a muffled grunt out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, NOVA's voice said, \"Please open your eyes until told otherwise.  You will not be harmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In order to complete your desires, I am going to take steps to ensure your wishes are carried out. Again, there may be some discomfort, but you will not be harmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a metallic object placed against your eyes, which were immediately wedged open with two specula. You felt eye liner being applied, and some mascara, and there was nothing you could do.  After several coats of mascara, an eyelash curler made sure your lashes looked wonderful. The curler wasn't immediately released, though. The special withdrew, and a slight downward tug from the curlers closed your eyelids, which were immediately assaulted with eyeshadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt other cosmetics being applied in the helmet.  Lotions and powders were dusted over your face. You felt brushes on your cheeks, and a sharp pain in your earlobes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tube in your mouth suddenly sprayed cold water on your teeth.  With a hissing deflation, the tube relaxed it's grip on your lips and retracted. The helmet hissed with its release, and was lifted off your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at disbelief at what NOVA had done to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face was... pretty. For a girl. Delicate brows arched above smiley eyes. Your lips glistened with color. Your ears had been double pierced on both sides, and earrings dangled from your ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked.   Before you could get any word or command out, NOVA announced, \"Again, you may experience some discomfort, but you will not be harmed. Please select a style of dress for your blind date.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

None would be thought of as anything other than, \"perfect for a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne outfit consisted of black knee high boots, sporting a pretty high heel, tight jeans, a wide belt lazily draped about the hips, and a vintage rock tee shirt tucked into the jeans.  The tee clung tightly displaying curves with the collar notched, revealing just a hint of cleavage. Some jewelry and a baggy purse completed the look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other outfit consisted of black pumps, sheer dark hose, and a strapless black tea length cocktail dress.  The dress had a few crinolines peeking out from under the skirt. Not enough to make it super poofy. Just enough to give the dress some shape. The strapless top of the dress had a sweetheart neckline and a very thin red belt encircled a similarly thin waist. Like the other outfit, some jewelry and a small clutch completed the look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared in horror, still.immobilized by the machine, at the outfits before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a woman.  I'm not a girl. I'm not going on a blind date with anyone!  Now stop this and let me out of here!\" you said to the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your safety is of my utmost concern. You will be released as soon as you are prepared for your date,\" NOVA said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, you stupid machine,\" you shouted, \"I'm not going on any date, and I'm not wearing....that!\" nodding your head in the direction of the video screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outfit selected,\" NOVA said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!  Stop!  I didn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again I warn you that the process may be uncomfortable, no harm will be done to you,\" NOVA said, talking over your objections. \"Let's get you gorgeous!l<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich outfit did you pick?</span></div></div>",

Maybe that meant this wouldn't be THAT bad, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was before a girdle was slid up your legs.  You swore it was several sizes too small, and you cringed as it smashed your crotch.  The waist came up right beneath the padded bra that NOVA was applying.  \"We'll give your self confidence a boost, honey,\" NOVA's computerized voice said.  \"It'll be our little secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, two fleshy cutlets were placed into the bra cups.  They felt sticky and cold.  The mechanical arms patted your bra and pushed the flesh up into a reasonable facsimile of cleavage.... The cleavage you'd seen in the original image of the outfit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girdle and the bra give you a respectable hourglass figure.  One that you didn't have much time to admire before the tee shirt was pulled over your head.  Your hairdo was re-fluffed by the mechanical arms as the tight jeans were slowly worked up your legs.  You squirmed, trying to stop it, but you were held tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boots were slid onto your feet and the zippers pulled up by the arms.  A quick dousing with perfume and NOVA showed you your appearance in a monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCute.  Like a girl ready to go on a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There.  Gorgeous.

You need a break from all of these sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, gasping for air, you say, \"Scott... I really need a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you, Andi,\" he says, adding, \"and you should probably fix your lipstick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDammit.  MY lipstick.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back,\" Scott says.  \"Wait here, and don't get into any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you think as Scott turns and heads to the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start fishing around in your purse and find a small compact and a tube of lipstick.  Fumbling with it, you start shakily applying more lipstick as the thrumming bass from the speakers makes sure you remain on edge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind wanders for a bit, looking at your glossy lips and not believing they're yours when you're suddenly jolted out of your reverie.</span></div></div>",

Problem was, however, when we got there the beach was dead. It turned out that a load of jellyfish got swept in from some storm and they were everywhere. It didn't look like swimming was going to happen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I set out my blanket, slathered myself up with my suntan lotion, and relaxed. It was nice to be finished with classes and the fact that I had off from work just made this setting all the more calming. I closed my eyes and just drifted to sleep listening to the ocean and feeling the the wind play with my long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing I knew, I was on fire. Not literally, of course, but I was burning up. I was afraid that I might have been in the sun too long but when I checked my phone, I saw I was only out for a few minutes. Instinct took over and I ran for the water despite the jellyfish. Unpleasant as the jellyfish could be I was in too much pain to think clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ocean was like heaven. I had managed to find a bit of water that was clear and I splashed myself down. The burning ended as soon as the cold water hit my skin and I sighed in relief. That is until I saw the floating hair. I tensed, then looked down at my now hairless chest. I checked myself over in a panic and sure enough, all of my hair was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not all of it. The hair on my head was still there but all of the hair on my face was gone except for my eyebrows, though they felt thinner for some reason. My face felt really soft, smooth, and sensitive to the touch. The hair on my groin was still around but my legs were nude as well and felt just like my face did. How could this happen? Then it hit me...Kevin.</span></div></div>",

It hammered me hard and for a moment I couldn't really see much of anything nor did I even know which way was up or down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the stinging. I tried to get away from the squishy monsters, but its hard when your attacker is everywhere. They stung my chest something awful and I felt one swipe across my face burning my lips. Luckily, I was able to get my head above water before I drowned and was able to swim enough to walk to shore. The jellyfish weren't done, of course, the mindless things getting my thighs and backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on land, I thought the worse of it was over but that's when I felt the breeze.

If I didn't know better, I'd have sworn that the caws of the seagulls were them laughing at me. It was so embarrassing but I figured I'd just wrap myself up in my towel and head home for a change of clothes. Hell, I could have a little bonfire with all of Kevin's stuff when I got there, I had thought to myself. That was the plan until I realized I couldn't see my stuff. How far did I get washed away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really sure what I should do, I walked to the boardwalk with as much stealth as I could muster. I sneaked between concession stalls while trying to keep a low profile with only partial success, being spotted buy the occasional giggling teenager or horrified mother covering the eyes of her kid. I wasn't exactly sure what I was looking for, just something to cover myself but luck should have it, I found something. I was elated to discover a clothing shop filled with beach themed merchandise. I quickly ducked inside happy for my good fortune. My good fortune was short lived when I looked over to see one of those aforementioned horrified mothers talking to a police officer, pointing at the shop I was currently in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the officer entered the shop I grabbed the first thing I could and bolted, hoping to avoid getting charged with shoplifting as well as public indecency.

I wasn't sure but they felt larger and much more sensitive. I shook my head and started to put on the dress, I was going to look stupid but at least I wouldn't be in jail. I tried to unbuckle the clasp in the back but it wasn't coming undone so I just slipped my legs into the dress, not really having the time to mess with it. The inside of it seemed to resemble a one-piece bathing suit. I pulled the material up by the shoulder straps, with the intent of just getting the bottom part on but it wouldn't budget around my swelling hips and thighs. I tugged and tugged getting more frantic until I heard a *Vvvvvvvvvp Pop!* and felt the dress slide past my thighs and secure themselves snugly around my hips, cupping my growing ass and lifting it attractively, and simultaneously flatting my crotch. In that same motion my fingers slipped past the small arm holes of the straps, bringing the suit's breast cups up to my chest while the straps hugged tightly at my slender shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my reflection in a nearby window and was shocked. My lips were indeed larger, if not kissable and my eyebrows were arched and alluring. The flesh of my chest filled the cups much better then I would have ever expected which was made all the more dramatic by the tightened waist and flaring hips. The dress hung down to mid thigh of my long, silky legs. I actually looked sexy and I cursed the jellyfish for facilitating this illusion.</span></div></div>",

I heard a woman moan as hands touched my leg and it took me a moment to realize that the moan was coming from me! Despite how much I hated it,the sensation of his hand on my now sensitive and silky leg was really nice. I quickly put a hand to my mouth but the damage was done. Kevin looked up at me with a flirty smile and I felt sick. He placed my heeled foot on his knee and fiddled with the tiny clasp until it was shut tight. He moved to my other leg and, encouraged by my previous moan, was less shy about running a hand along the back of as he worked my other foot in the other sandal. I tried not to make another sound as he touched me but squeaks of pleasure sounded from behind my hand.

She imagined this was to make it harder for people to change their minds. <br>\r\nAs she looked around she saw instructions stating that each costume was in a locker and each locker had a unique outfit to it. The lovely maiden was to strip and choose a locker once the Key was removed no other locker could be opened until the removed key left the room. The maidens close were to be placed in the locker after removing the outfit inside.<br>\r\nFollowing the instructions Tina chose a locker, not that there were a lot of choices, placed her own clothes inside closed the locker door and then looked at the chosen outfit.<br>\r\nIt was a very shear Nightie and matching panties. Tina blushed realizing just how many guys were going to see her in this. When she left the changing room she heard a couple clocks coming from the door and released she couldn\u2019t go back in. She also found shelves and shelves of high heels in new room she was in. <br>\r\nA poster board with instructions on it stated to match the locker key to the heels for ones that went with the outfit. After some searching sure enough she found a set of heels that seemed to go with her lingerie.<br>\r\nThe caress of the silky nightie on her sensitive skin and nipples kept her nipples very noticeable. The nightie itself didn\u2019t even reach the panties so her ass was on clear display in the panties. <br>\r\nLeaving the show room Tina found herself in the party. There was quite a few people and she could tell it was a adult adult themed party. Those that had chosen whimsical all seemed to be in sexy versions of other costumes. While those that had chosen sexy seemed to be in lingerie in case of woman and very tight athletic shorts in the case of the guys.<br>\r\nAS Tina wondered around the space hoping to find one of her friends she ran into Tim.<br>\r\n\u201cHi Tim\u201d she said<br>\r\n\u201cOH high I was hoping to run into you alone Tina\u201d <br>\r\nTina noticed a look in Tim\u2019s eye that got her worried<br>\r\n\u201cOh why is that Tim\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cwell Chris I\u2019m pretty sure you can figure out why\u201d Tim had said that with a tone and volume barely hearable but Chris had heard it clearly<br>\r\n\u201ch-h-how did you know\u201d stammered Chris the voice of Tina falling away<br>\r\n\u201cHailey gets very gossipy after sex\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I can ex..\u201d<br>\r\n\u201clet\u2019s find some place private to speak\u201d<br>\r\nA little while later they were in a private room with a bed. Chris\u2019s mind was spinning what confidence he had built up being able to pass so well as a woman was shattered.<br>\r\n\u201cok so first off Chrissy take that nightie off\u201d <br>\r\nChris did as told and stood there in panties and high heels with a very feminine figure. Bare breasted as it were.<br>\r\nFrom behind Chris Tim reached around and cupped Chris swollen chest and went to work. Hailey had mentioned once while they were bra shopping that Tim could bring her to orgasm just using her breasts. Chris who\u2019s swollen chest that looked so very feminine and easily passed for large breasts was just as if not more sensitive then Hailey\u2019s breasts.<br>\r\nAs if knowing the signs all too well Tim stopped just short of letting Chris have an orgasm.<br>\r\n\u201clisten up Chrissy. Hailey isn\u2019t aware that she told me about you. In fact, she isn\u2019t even aware of our meeting at the moment. And I can\u2019t wait to see her in whatever outfit or costume that she got. But\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cb-b-b-but what\u201d replied Chrissy a mixture of Tina and Chris\u2019s voices<br>\r\n\u201cdon\u2019t interrupt me\u201d said Tim squeezing Chris\u2019s breast, for lack of a better term, hard enough for her to let out a sound that made it hard to tell if she was hurt or turned on even more.<br>\r\n\u201cBut you are going to make a choice Chris. I got the message saying you would be away for a while so it works out well. You get to choose what kind of life you will have for the next few months to a year.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201ca y-y-year\u201d Chris interrupted only got Tim to once again squeeze a breast again,<br>\r\n\u201cyes you see here is the deal you have 3 options. One you \u201che chuckles\u2019 man up and tell Kevin who you really are and ask for a relationship0 and see it threw to the end. Two you go to Kevin as Tina and spend as long as necessary as Tina either until the he moves on you both die of old age. Three you make it clear to Kevin as Tina that you not into him and you do that by hooking up with a guy here tonight at this party\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cb-bu-but what about my life\u201d<br>\r\nAS Tim circles around to face Chris he smacks Chris\u2019s large shapely feminine ass hard so hard in fact that Chris jumps in his his heels and all his new found feminine assets are sent jiggling.<br>\r\n\u201cThe way you look right know you would find it hard to get people to see you as chris\u2026.so Chrissy what will you choose.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are allowed to be your own women but you will hook up with Kevin tonight and tomorrow move into his room. I expect him to leave the bedroom quit happy tomorrow morning. two Your name is now Christina Roxanne Rees. Rees is very common name where I grew up a lot of people have that last name and most of them are not related to the other. Ill also get you a ID kit. Three go to the local doctor tomorrow and ask for a way to make your current form last longer explain in full detail. Four start taking birth control and insisting on the use of condom\u2019s after all if you are not careful he will wonder why your never pregnant. Ask Hailey for help on that. Five I know I said you are your own woman but I want my friend to brag about the sex kitten he hooked up with. He has been hurt in the past he deserves a sexy girl that will take care of him\u201d<br>\r\n\u201canything else\u201d Tina asked<br>\r\n\u201cYea Tell him you prefer to be called Roxxy, and fix your hair he has always wanted to date a girl with blonde hair and red highlights\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cwhy Roxxy\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll work out better if he can\u2019t make any assumptions or conclusions that make him doubt you\u201d<br>\r\nAt this point in time Tim had pulled down Tina\u2019s panties. And was staring at her groin<br>\r\n\u201cJust how good is this thing\u201d he asked pointing at Tina\u2019s Gaff<br>\r\n\u201cvery I can fell everything as a woman have sex. pee etc. as a woman and it\u2019ll even make me cum like a woman and get wet like one. Apparently I don\u2019t even have to remove it to clean it and the material allows everything underneath to breath so no worries there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cok good if you\u2019re going to spend a long time as a crossdresser at least you can get some pleasure out of it. Ok get dressed and go find Kevin I\u2019ll be keeping a eye on you. When you do hook up come to this room and get going. Me and Hailey will walk in on you two and it\u2019ll be decided that we head out early.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is where we put on all of our shows.\" the tour guide had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this where that accident was a few years ago?\" one of the prospective students asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accident?\" another asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a fire a few years back, yes. But everyone came out alive... except for one actor. He was the understudy of the lead role, in the back dressing room.\" the tour guide replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And his spirit haunts the auditorium to this day!\" someone laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut that out! It was a terrible accident and nothing to joke about! A student died!\" the tour guide immediately quelled any laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was ushered out of the auditorium, but the thought still lingered on everyone's mind. Was there a ghost lurking around the dressing rooms?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were unconvinced, you weren't superstitious. When you were accepted and once you started classes, you checked around for the fall musical, which was a retelling of Faust, where the protagonist makes a deal with the devil for personal gain. You were hoping for a role, even though you had been told that freshman usually didn't get roles in the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why you were in the auditorium after hours, doing some vocal practice. You were in the dressing rooms, newly renovated since the accident with proper fire suppression systems, and singing the songs that had been distributed for auditions. As you sang, you noticed that something was breaking your concentration. A rattling sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you asked. \"Is anyone there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get a reply, so you continued singing. But the noise started up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you tried to find the source, which was behind a mirror in the back most dressing room. The noise was coming from a vent, old-looking from the sight of it, probably from before they renovated. It was probably just age... but what if there was something inside causing the noise? You could hardly concentrate with all that racket. You pulled the cover off the vent and... </span></div></div>",

Alice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurriedly put on your shirt and check that the bra is totally hidden, and it seems to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head to the register and pay for your purchase, thanking Ashley on your way out. You take your receipt glancing at it as you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... the bra you bought is labeled as a 32 B-cup wonderbra... damnit, You had just assumed Ashley had gotten you another a-cup, but she'd gone a cup size up and it was padded on top of that.</span></div></div>",

Alan was getting himself a large fountain soda when his dad noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you certain you want that?  They won't let you in past the lobby with it so you'll either have to drink it or throw it away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, no problem.

Mary, the HR assistant, was gathering them all together.  Besides Alan, there were seven other girls, ranging in age from 14 to 17.  Alan did not recognize any of them as being from his school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings and welcome to the first 'Bring Your Daughter to Work Day' here at Thompson Technologies.\" Mary said with a big smile and her hands waving in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were excited, whispering to their parents, as they gathered closer together.  Alan looked them over as he deposited his now empty cup in a waste bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan thought there were two or three girls about his age, the one with the medium length black hair (she said her name was Lucy and she made it clear she was the boss's daughter), the one with long stringy light brown hair (she said her name was Patti), and maybe the brown haired one with the braids (who said her name was Tammy).  The other four girls were younger than him with Sally, the cute curly blonde haired girl, looking to be the youngest of them all.  He was lost in thought and did not catch the other three girls names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped out of his daze as Mary cleared her throat, \"Hello, it's your turn to introduce yourself...\" she said while everyone was now waiting expectantly for Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow feeling the pressure, \"Oh, uhh, my name is, is uh-Alice.  I'm sorry.\" he finally squeaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK Alice, you don't need to apologize,\" Sally says to him as she and Patti moved over to calm him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the others also came over and quickly he found out the last three girls were named Margaret, Valerie, and April Grant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret's hair was the longest he had ever seen and it was very curly and very red.  Her glasses did nothing to detract from her beauty.  He found out she was Mary's daughter and he could see where the hair came from.  Valerie looked mousy, apparently unaware that her beauty was hidden under her long messy blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril Grant was bouncing on her toes with her wavy strawberry blonde hair flying about, \"Come on, we have to hear the rest of the introduction\" she says, urging them all to pay attention to Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...will be getting real government photo IDs and then we will start the enrollment paperwork,\" Mary was saying, \"so say a short goodbye to the parents as we'll be catching up with them just before lunch.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Next to her was a large camera system connected to a computer.  The camera was facing a blank green wall with an X taped on the floor in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice please stand on the X and look at the camera,\" Mary says as she is typing away on the computer.  \"That's it, now smile.\"  And the camera flashed so brightly that Alan was dazed a bit, blinking his eyes and trying to get the spots to go away.  There were more flashes in the meantime as Mary took several pics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, now come over here tot he higher counter and give me your right hand please,\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill stunned by the flashes Alan moved to the counter and did as Mary requested.  She was placing his fingers into a small scanner device and she then asked for and got his left hand to do the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments of Mary typing away, Alan's eyes were finally starting to clear up.  There was some processing sounds coming from the computer and Mary took the ID card as it popped out and handed it to Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wait out in the waiting room and send in Valerie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was trying to get a clear view of the card as he stepped out into the waiting room and told Valerie she was next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his eyes finally came into focus he saw the card had a picture of him with his eyes partially shut and his mouth agape.  He looked down right pathetic in the picture.  The card had his full name as A. G. Krebs, his gender as F and his date of birth was missing a number and was smudged.  His height and weight were correct though as well as his hair and eye color.  Even his SSN was correct.  But this card needs to be fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Valerie came back into the waiting room she said it was Tammy's turn.  Alan quickly got up though and told her that he had a problem with his ID so could he go in first.  Not waiting for an answer he went into the room to voice his concern.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mary proceeds to set her 'real' DoB for her 'real' age of 14.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the card was done processing she handed it to Alan and told him to go and quickly send in Tammy as they are running out of time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tammy was good with his hair and Lucy was good all around doing the foundation and lips, but it was Margaret who was truly the one to make him shine when she was done with his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls stood back looking at him and Tammy says, \"she couldn't take a bad picture now, that is if she looks at the camera and doesn't make any funny faces like last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey return to the waiting area just as Sally does.

The classes at HWS were significantly challenging for all students and should provide a challenge for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter handing all the forms out Mary instructs, \"Please fill out the blank fields listing your desired subject major (you can pick more than one), extra-curricular activities, interests, and hobbies and also use the blank page to write a short essay on why you would love to graduate from HWS.

The words that Lucy had put on her form and said it was good enough for all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I so want to go to the HWS Institute of Science and Technology for Young Women so I can get a great education.  To learn state of the art technologies, maths and sciences.  To obtain a robust knowledge of the world of computers.  To access both the academic and athletic programs provided by the school.

It was clear to him that she had knocked herself a bit silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother perfect landing...\u201dshe said with a wavering voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up on to her feet and swayed a bit, putting her hand on the wall to help keep her balance.

How are you going to give me a different life?\u201d he asked dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith magic, of course,\u201d she giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh, fine. How about you start by \u201cmagic\u201d-ing that floor clean?\u201d he said rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that he should be a bit more open minded after what he just saw but it was all still a bit too much for him. His new Fairy Godmother, however, wasn't daunted by his skepticism. Instead, she reached into her sleeve and pulled out a long wand. With a little flourish, she pointed at the floor and a light blue light shot out of it, hitting the floor. It glowed blue for a moment and then it was suddenly clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Riley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, such language.

I understand but we must practice patience,\u201d She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley ignored her and ran out the door, followed by his godmother who was taking her time. She lifted her arms and shook her sleeves before letting loose with another blast of magic. Riley held his breath and closed his eyes, waiting for another curse to befall him. Instead, he felt himself tumble onto something hard. He opened his eyes to see the floor of a stagecoach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUpsy daisy,\u201d he heared the voice of his godmother say as he is forced into the stagecoach the rest of the way.

You, my dear, will become that bride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really most go,\u201d he said politely instead of \u201clet me go you bitch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now, no need to be nervous.

Wasn't that I didn't care about her it was that she was a bit of a cold fish. I wasn't planning on leaving her but a guy has needs, you know? Anyway, she caught me and things got bad. When I was out, she moved out. To top it off, she tossed out all of my things. I mean, everything I owned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you can guess, I had been irritated at the time. Who could blame me? So its not unthinkable for me to have had a bit of a short fuse, right? We this woman that I work with was being annoying, talking so loud on the phone that it was difficult to get any work done. To top it off, it was a personal call on company time. So I called her out on it. The she has the gall to fight me about it. Things get heated and I call her some names. Finally she shuts up, which I thought meant she had decided to stop acting like a brat and grow up some but I was wrong. Turned out she has skin as thick as paper and she ran off to cry to HR. I get called into my bosses office to have a meeting and the bitch takes her side, which is total bull. My tempers up so I explain to her how unfair she was being. She took it wrong and that was the end of my employment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, I tried to find work but apparently I've been blacklisted because the big mean man made those poor little girls cry themselves to sleep. So my cash dried up. I was just about to be evicted when I found something interesting in the mail. It was addressed to my Ex but I figured I wasn't going to give it to her anyway and opened it. It turns out my Ex had applied to some kind of beta program for a state of the art housing unit. I didn't quiet get it but read on. I looked like she was going to get the worlds first \u201cSmart House\u201d or something. To top it off, they were going to pay all of her expenses while she lived there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about it. They said that they wouldn't physically fix any of the issues it might have, instead they would do so digitally. She never had to meet them in person, just by email. She was required to document any bugs and submit them, but that was all she had to do. After a year they would stop paying for expenses but she would get to keep the house for free as a thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for me to email them and get everything taken care of. I moved a week later.</span></div></div>",

I wouldn\u2019t even need to bring clothes as the house could make any item of clothing I wanted.<br>\r\nAfter settling and making sure that the security cameras didn\u2019t send out automatically. After all I didn\u2019t want them to realize I wasn\u2019t her.<br>\r\nI had decided to go and work out for a bit in the in house gym. From the pictures it looked nicer than most gym\u2019s id been to.<br>\r\nStepping up to the gym\u2019s door I saw my reflection on it. My thin frame frame had me labeled as petite by some and I guess my long hair hadn\u2019t helped on that regard. But my ex had seen through that so I was confident that some exercise would mean a better more masculine me.<br>\r\nEven if so far swimming lad left me with a smoother skin, cycling had left me with a more girly butt, and even my brief use of steroids had left their mark with smallish mounds that I preferred to try and get rid of.<br>\r\nAS I tried to open the door it would not budge. A flashing light alerted me to a nearby terminal saying I had to undergo a special scan before I could enter. I went to the room I was directed towards and entered it<br>\r\nAnother display informed me that I would need to remove my clothing, even underwear, and drop them into a chute. They would be cleaned and returned to me after the next laundry cycle.<br>\r\nAfter getting into position and the proper pose, dam this machine was picky, the scan began and I closed my eyes after the scanning laser hit it. After a small amount of time I heard a chime and felt the floor under me give away.<br>\r\nI\u2019m not sure what caught me but as I looked around I could hardly see anything. I felt something tight being pulled up my legs something tight being pulled down over my head. then something really tight on my waist and it was only getting tighter. It felt like small hand son my face and something was messing with my long hair.<br>\r\nI felt my self being moved up and over and blinked wildly as I was thrust into a brightly lit room. As I came to I saw that the walls of the room were mirrors, this made sense as the gym was located in the basement.<br>\r\nIt was the reflection in the mirror that stopped me cold. I was wearing a sports bra and small matching bicycle shorts. The two things that really got my heart rate up was that my waist was a good two inches\u2019 smaller and the bra actually was filled out a bit. <br>\r\nI wanted to freak out but the bra and shorts caught my attention they had what looked like circuitry running through them. A terminal started flashing so I walked over to it.<br>\r\nThe terminal explained to me how the three items of clothing and the shoes worked. The bra monitors my stats, heart rate oxygen etc. the Shorts would help exercise my butt as well as help with my legs. The Corset would reduce my overall waist size and train my ab muscles to hold the shape better.<br>\r\n Know I wasn\u2019t the smartest person but to me that all sounded Like good things. Sure the corset was under my skin. But hey I was on my way to a better me so I could roll with this and it\u2019s not like anyone else was going to see me. The shoes though had me a little confused. They were to guarantee a more pleasant hip motion while walking as well as help tone the butt, thighs and hips. I wasn\u2019t sure what it meant by that but I was ok with the idea of looking better.<br>\r\nA large screen near the door let me know that because of the request I had put I when I did exercise I couldn\u2019t leave until I had done all the prescribed exercise\u2019s.<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure by why my ex had chosen to ask for that but I knew I\u2019d have to put up with it. As I started doing the routines it was wanting me to do I heard some music start playing. It wasn\u2019t my kind of music more to my ex\u2019s taste but at least it was music.  <br>\r\nIt took me a few hours to get through the routines and ever 45mins the equipment would rest to a neutral position and a drink was dispensed. This also worked for me because I didn\u2019t like the idea of being stuck done here with nothing to drink.<br>\r\nWhen I was done I excited the gym and felt the coolness of the house on me. Admittedly I felt cold and had already wanted a shower before the terminal\u2019s suggested I take a \u2026<br>\r\n\u201cwhat the hell is a Spawer?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I looked slightly more feminine know that my bodies normal hair pattern was that of a woman.

To make things embarrassing it took me 20 mins to realize I was wearing heels. Not just any heels though heels that matched the nightie and panties.<br>\r\nWhen I got in front of a mirror I wanted to scream. My hair was know long and curly going to the middle of my back. My lips were puffier more feminine in appearance. It was if someone had exchanged them for a better looking female variant.<br>\r\nI realized my eyebrows were shaped and looked like I had seen my ex shape hers. My eyelashes were also longer. I wasn\u2019t sure exactly how to pinpoint it all but it was like someone had changed a few dozen things on my face to make it look more female even pretty.<br>\r\nI went to the main control terminal, admittedly forgetting how I was dressed, and sat down to change the settings so I wouldn\u2019t have a repeat of last night.<br>\r\nI was greeted to a pop up\u2019s saying setting changes applied and password reset accepted.<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t get into change the settings.

If the password isn\u2019t reset got a period of sixty days then the main terminal would trigger a forced password change event, were in all terminals would be unresponsive until a new password is set.<br>\r\nThis would work out for me. I mean for all I know I set the settings the way I wanted them while drunk.<br>\r\nThe panic subsiding, I sashayed to the kitchen, still forgetting I was in high heels and a nightie, and queued up some breakfast.<br>\r\nI was surprised to receive a shake. Apparently one of the settings I had done was implementing a diet program. As getting a better me was on the list of goals I rolled with it drank the shake down, it tasted of strawberry, and headed to the gym<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a decking area around the house which led onto a well maintained lawn but the real jewel was the shimmering pool. I watched as automatic leaf catchers set to work removing all unwanted debris from the pool, ensuring it remain clean.

She was in her late twenties and had her blonde hair cut short in a pixie style cut. \"Hey there\" she shouted and waved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waved back a little awkwardly and began to walk over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I guess you're my new neighbor huh?\" She said as I approached. \"I'm Kirsty, nice to meet you. I didn't know they'd be another girl moving in next door. The guys in the beta program don't ever tell me anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this I realised two things, firstly that Kirtsy was not only my neighbor but also a participant in the same house test I was in and secondly and more disturbingly, she thought I was a woman.I looked down at myself widely and suddenly realised that the sweats I was wearing were actually women's yoga pants. As I did this, my long curly hair cascaded over my face reminding me of the feminisation I received last night. This combined with my petite size and feminine figure was more than a enough for a person to conclude that I was a woman. What's more, I won't be able to correct her as it was my fianc\u00e9e not me who was supposed to be living here. She could blow my cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no way out of it, I had to play along. \"Erm, hi, I'm Rebecca.\" I said using my ex fianc\u00e9e's name. I paused for a moment, \"but you can call me Becky.\" Not only did I prefer the name Becky but my fianc\u00e9e also hated it so it was a win win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you finding the new house?\" Kirsty asks, still grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it will take some getting used to\" I replied, \"how is your's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it. I can't believe they're letting us keep them after the years over but who knows? I might try and fork enough out for the full release version when that happens.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh only two weeks. Though another guy got here last week next door to me on the other side. He keeps to himself mostly though, I think he's a bit weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was getting involved in the conversation I didn't notice that I adopted a femanine standing position with one hand on your hip with it pointing out. \"Really? What does he do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never had the chance to ask him.\" She turned round and shook her head at the house behind her before turning back to me. It might have been my imagination but I thought she was quickly checking me out since her eyes looked me up and down. \"I'm glad I've got one sociable neighbor though. Hey, I be got an idea, why don't you come over to my place for dinner tonight? I'd love to get to know you more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I don't want to trouble you on such short notice.\" I said, trying to find way out of it since I would have preferred not to have to pretend to be a woman, though it seemed more and more inevitable since Kirsty was part of the programme too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about it. The house will do it for me. See isn't it amazing? Come on it'll be fun, plus I'll show you some of the fun features you probably shouldn't know about.\" She winked at me as she said this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed softly knowing there was no way out. \"Okay, what time should I come over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say around 8. Is that fine with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I'm free for then.\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, it's a date then\" Kirtsy winked at me again before getting off the fence and trudging across her lawn to her back door. \"See you later Becky. \" she called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI too decided to return back to my own house and after closing the door behind me, I slumped against the nearest wall and groaned. \"How am I going to get out of this.\" I thought. I thought that I was the only one doing this test in the area. If that was so, I wouldn't have to worry about pretending to be my ex fianc\u00e9e everyday. I considered moving out but I had no where else or go. \"I'm sure I'll think of something.\" I said, trying to reassure myself. Whatever the future holds for me would have to wait for the moment however as I had a evening to get ready for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked myself up and headed upstairs to my room. Looking at the time, I had three hours to prepare which seemed like plenty but considering I was trying to actively pass I off as a woman to another woman, three hours didn't seem nearly even. I reminded myself that I had already fooled Kirtsy once but still the nerves were getting to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brought up the wardrobe interface and and begin scrolling through the options. What annoyed me was that the clothes themselves weren't actually specified, only the occasion. In the end I narrowed down the long list to the \"dinner for two\" and \"dining out\" options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to tell the difference or decide, I left the choice to fate. \"Easy meeny miny moe...\"I said under my breathe moving my finger in time to the childish rhyme over the two options on the wardrobe console. \"And I choose you\" I looked to see my finger had landed on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Knowing the drill already I stripped down dropped the clothes in the chute. Taking note that it had dressed me in panties. <br>\r\nUnlike the gym\u2019s scanner the one and my bedroom dresser were quick and I found myself in a AR booth. Looking around I could see this one had been designed by a real AR pro.  The AR suit though was so tight a lot more then I was used to.<br>\r\nJust like there other set up this dresser had a mirror near its exit and I walked to it and saw my reflection.<br>\r\nI was wearing a hot pink AR suit. It was defiantly made for a woman\u2019s figure and it made me look even more feminine. My waist looked so small in it. In profile it looked like I had a bit of a booty going on as well. But my good mood was slapped in the face when I saw the mounds on my chest looking so prominent and that I was in high Heels.<br>\r\nStill not sure how I was able to walk in heels so well I decided to just deal with this for now and get on with the AR.<br>\r\nLoading up the system I saw this was a fresh out of the box unit. The training program had never been ran.<br>\r\nI turned on the machine and let it boot up. <br>\r\nSomething I never knew about AR systems was that they took certain things like gender from information transmitted by the suits.<br>\r\nAs it finished a pop up informed me that removing certain sections of the suit would enable access to adult AR programs.<br>\r\nI removed the section of suit over my chest and a section near my butt and groin. The pop up changed and said Adult programs unlocked.<br>\r\nI tried to get access to a game I liked to play but the only things it would let me access was training programs and a Program Labeled Run Before Online use. I realized this was probably the safety program, my older unit had been bought used so it was already used on it.<br>\r\nAs it loaded up a pop up informed me that three scenarios would be run and each one would take 5-10mins depending on how quickly I got through them.<br>\r\nThe booth loaded up the first scenario and I found myself on the first floor of a house.<br>\r\n\u201cwow this booth is better than the public ones I can\u2019t even heard the builders working.\u201d<br>\r\nAs I walked around some Sensations were sticking out to me. Firstly, my chest was jiggling and my legs were cold.<br>\r\nLooking down I saw cleavage. Running around I found a mirror and saw my reflection. I was wearing a clubbing dress and I was wearing it well. I had a curvy figure. My breast I realized were about the same size as my ex\u2019s so I was probably a B-cup.<br>\r\nSitting on a table next to the mirror was a book labeled Scenario one objective. Reading through it I saw the objective was to allow me to use the AR\u201d s clothing and costume system. After trying on a few different outfits it labeled it as passed and the booth went dark as the next scenario was loaded.<br>\r\nThis time the jiggle of my AR breasts didn\u2019t bother me and I went looking for the book. What I did noticed was that I was in some sort of mall.<br>\r\nAfter finding the book it told me this was to let me try out buying products thru the AR shopper. Deciding to try out the costume shop I tried on some costumes that were not available during the first scenario.  Being apparently a store for adult costumes I was only really able to try on sexy female costumes that included a school girl, Nurse, Cheerleader, cat girl, and a costume that said Business woman but made me look like a secretary.<br>\r\nI made a purchase, after all it was a fake area so I picked the secretary one, and it labeled the scenario as passed and the third loaded up.<br>\r\nI was still female but this time I was dressed in nothing but lingerie. Walking around I noticed it was a room of sorts and there was no book.<br>\r\nOut of no were men appeared and within minutes they were on me. Fondling groping slapping my ass. Fondling groping teasing my breasts and nipples. I wasn\u2019t sure what this was about but I hit the help command and the men vanished. The final book appeared near me.<br>\r\nStill stunned I picked it up. It explained that the normal test was kicked up because of me enabling adult settings. But that the point was that if I was getting harassed to use the help command.<br>\r\nThe program ended the booth went back to normal and I was upset. My fem features before this house had been a issue for me and arguably the house had made them more prominent. So being treated like a woman with a group of mean doing that to me struck a nerve.<br>\r\nFir the first time in years I cried. Hoe fem I looked at the moment wasn\u2019t helping matters but I di eventually calm down.<br>\r\nHaving rested a bit, I was back up and at the terminal selecting something new. Hoping I could access a game or something.<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t.<br>\r\nMy favorite games were know in the menu but they were listed as locked until certain requirements had been met. There was a game I noticed that was playable and a new section called Daily Training. The new game was still installing and even then it said the daily training would have to be completed first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mulled it over and decided to\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I tried to remove them but a thought came into my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere so comfortable though<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really sure where that came from I elected to keep them on and went to the gym. Only I couldn\u2019t enter the scanner to get in.<br>\r\nThere nearby terminal simply said settings changed. Fearing the worse I went to the main terminal and sure enough the pop up was there. When I closed the pop up I saw there were a few more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorkout routines switched to shaper room.<br>\r\nDiet Changed to High Estro<br>\r\nSpawer Treatment Know required twice a day.<br>\r\n\u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d<br>\r\nAfter closing all the pop ups, I saw that there was know a social media link on my home screen. I opened it and it took me to the latest social media site and More specifically to a page for woman.<br>\r\n\u201cok Roxy Gree good looking ...OH MY GOD THAT\u2019S ME FROM LAST NIGHT!!!\u201d<br>\r\nIt was a head shot only but I looked so pretty. Just like the main terminal I could not log into the website to delete the profile.<br>\r\nAfter digging through the terminal I found out that shapper was an advanced work out machine and body sculptor. Reading or rather let\u2019s be honest skimming through the information available it seemed like a machine that would let me exercise but I wouldn\u2019t have to do a thing.<br>\r\nThis appealed to me.<br>\r\nAfter locating it I discovered why the settings said I had to use the spawer twice.  The Spawer machine there were two of them connected to this machine.<br>\r\n\u201cwow this machine is going to require hours of time out of my day\u201d<br>\r\nI removed my heels stepped into the SPawer and let me mind drift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaper or whatever it was called certainly did its job well. I was hurting in ways id never hurt before. The muscle ache alone told me I had gotten a good workout in there. I was fresh out of the second spawer and had that flushed hot look again. ON my feminine face it made me look so attractive. It occurred to me that if I found my fem face attractive other might as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis routine carried on for a few weeks before I noticed any results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked so much more\u2026...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feminine<br>\r\nThere was no real way to see it otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was standing her in front of the mirror wearing a bra and panties. The bra was labeled as a B-cup. Beyond that I had no idea I knew there was more to a bra size then just a letter. But the dressers were what measured me for clothing and it had only put B-cup on the bra.<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t argue with the fact that I was in far better shape when when I entered the house. But that shape was an hour glass and came with boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater around lunch time\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood in the kitchen trying to decide on what to eat. The spawer and shaper routines always took it out of me and some good food was in order. Admittedly the Spawer\u2019s attention to my chest and the pleasure it was bringing me was the only reason I was still using them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeing anything I wanted on the houses menu I decided to go out to eat. Something I hadn\u2019t done since before I moved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter using the dresser and spending ten minutes exasperated in front of the mirror I ventured out. The dresser had put me in a short skirt, heels and a low cut top. I knew I would pass for a woman but this outfit was far to girly for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later I returned home. I had gone to the local diner and ordered a salad. I was only able to eat half of it and I\u2019d like to blame the guy who chatted me up flirting with me or the size of the salad. But nope I couldn\u2019t do that I had enjoyed myself and it was a good salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf hour later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found myself down in the AR booth. I had been down her only once since the first time. It was to try out that new game. But just like with the training program I couldn\u2019t remember what I had seen or done.<br>\r\nThe AR made me look even more fem with its corset like waist and my enlarged chest jutting out of the open chest slot.  I sighed as I looked myself over in the mirror inside of the AR booth. I looked so female. I actually reminded myself of an older AR streamer who only did ADULT games and programs and was built along the same figure I have.<br>\r\nHappily, it seemed the games I was used to playing were accessible and I spent a few hours playing them. Though playing as my old male character seemed odd to me and with it being an online game I received several queries from other plays asking if I was a female playing as a male.<br>\r\nIt was hard to argue with them about that considering how I looked. So I decided to start anew. I made a new account registered to the same social media profile I had set up the last time I had gotten drunk. Created a female character and was over joyed with the acceptance I was getting. <br>\r\nI was moving so naturally in the female form that people had no doubts about me being female. I had no real idea why this caused me joy.<br>\r\nAfter a bit the game was shutting down for a debug cycle and I still wanting to game went looking for another game. The only one available to play at the moment was the strange game from before that I couldn\u2019t remember playing but had logged over two hours in it.<br>\r\nDeciding to try and figure this out I installed a screen capture program to record the game play footage. Loaded the game and then\u2026.<br>\r\nI blinked a few times my mind clearing out some fog. Had it happened again. I looked at the time log then the clock in shock. I had logged twenty-four hours of time on that game. I didn\u2019t remember any of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally worried know I went a checked the game play footage only to see\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I looked down and remembered I was still wearing the high pink heels that were a part of the AR suit <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/itCt0v\" target=\"_blank\">https://ibb.co/itCt0v</a>.   Keeping them on for so long was starting to pinch and strain my toes and ankles; although I had to admit, my calves looked sleek and toned with them on. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luckily, it appeared that the heels were not connected to the body of the suit and could be taken off separately. I took them off and tossed them aside and almost immediately a small robotic arm came out of the wall, grabbed the shoes and disappeared. After stretching and massaging my feet a little, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and was once again shocked at just how trim my waist was and how wide my hips looked <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/kSpy0v\" target=\"_blank\">https://ibb.co/kSpy0v</a>.   I decided it must be the suit padding and readjusting muscles and fat to mimic the female form - seeing as how I had just gone through an AR program dressing myself in various ultra-feminine outfits. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now that I was feeling more comfortable, it was time to decide if I should go back to the AR. Looking at the screen from outside the booth, it was apparent that the daily training was still the only option. I was also curious how the other games in the game room worked - I enjoyed pool but didn't want to have to play it completely alone. </span></div></div>",

I walked back into the AR machine, and began. I don't really remember what happened, but an entire hour passed in what seemed like the blink of an eye. I walked out of the machine, a bit of swing in my hips, trying to remember what I'd done. My train of thought was cut short when my stomach growled and I realized I was very hungry. I had been in the AR machine for a very long time.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Absentmindedly tucking a strand of hair behind my ear, I walked out of the AR area, where a darkened cylinder rose up around me. I was quickly stripped of my clothes and a display in front of me flashed \"speak your destination.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dinner\" I said, and added \"give me something cute but comfortable.\" Don't know where that came from, but I quickly dismissed it. I felt clothing being pulled over my legs and head, and stepped out of the changing cylinder wearing a long soft red sweater and white stretchy jeggings <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/iRyMoF\" target=\"_blank\">https://ibb.co/iRyMoF</a>. My hair was loose, and curled down over my shoulders. Smiling at my reflection in the mirror, I headed upstairs for dinner.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dinner was lighter than I'd had in the past, but somehow I felt myself getting full much quicker. The house seemed to know exactly the amount of food I'd need to feel satisfied. After dinner, feeling bored, I started drinking again. I guess my tolerance has been pretty low lately because before I knew it, I was wasted. Lying on the couch I started rubbing my arms through the soft sweater. Damn it felt good! My skin was so sensitive, and I was starting to get a bit turned on. Remembering how the spawer massaged my chest, I moved my hands there and did the same. Ooooh it felt good. I circled and teased my nipples and bit my lip at the warm sensations traveling from my chest to my crotch. After a minute, I stood up, and still feeling quite horny, downed another drink and headed down the hallway. I don't remember anything after that.</span></div></div>",

He has been returned to the airport which you departed from. In the meantime, we have provided you with a wardrobe, free of charge. If you have any questions, talk to us at the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\nResort Management.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy headed to the dresser to check out his new wardrobe. Opening the first drawer, Tracy revealed something unexpected... Panties. Opening the second drawer, looking for men's clothes, he found leggings, shorts, and other girl items. Tracy headed to the closet only to be met with dresses and girl shoes. Having an issue with his new wardrobe, Tracy decided to talk to the resort staff. Since the main desk was by the pool, he decided he should throw on the sandals, so he didn't burn his feet. He also threw on the complimentary pink robe with his name embroidered on it, to cover up his bikini bottoms. A pink robe was more manly than a girls swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked to the front desk. \"Can I talk to you about my wardrobe?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, are they the wrong size? We took everything from the form you filled out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy had never filled out a form. \"Can I see it?\" He asked. The man behind the counter handed him some paper work that Tracy looked through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed the name was the same but other than that, everything was different. The handwriting, the address, and most importantly, the gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy realized that this stay was not meant for him, so if he were to bring it up, he would probably be escorted home. On the other hand, he did not want to dress like a girl his entire stay. Decisions, decisions...</span></div></div>",

They were bright pink, cotton material, with the name of the resort on the butt. He slid off his bikini bottoms and slid the underwear up to replace them. Just like the bikini, the underwear flattened his area. He looked at the itinerary. It said that the dinner was formal, meaning dress and heels. Tracy looked over at the closet, noticing a tight black dress that was taunting him. Looking back down at the drawer, Tracy noticed a pair of pink and white, plaid, pajama shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Tracy want to go to the formal dinner or put on pajamas and order room service?</span></div></div>",

She soon returned with three items.  Tracy took them into a nearby changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeling his sweatpants off his silky smooth legs, he sighed in relief at the much lighter fabric of the main item he had.  It looked like a kind of white v-necked robe, but it was extremely light and didn't have sleeves, exactly.  He pulled off his damp t-shirt and slipped the cover-up over his head, a little perturbed that his only came partway down his thighs, but the light, cool fabric was just what he wanted.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sta.sh/0w2esmnfws6\" target=\"_blank\">http://sta.sh/0w2esmnfws6</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two items were a woven hat with a floppy brim that extended as far as his shoulders, and a pair of sunglasses that seemed larger than one's he'd worn before.

Did you stay here all night?\" Tracy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought someone should in case you woke up,\" he told Tracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really didn't have to do that. You've already done so much,\" he told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It no trouble at all,\" he said with a stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this guy for real?\" Tracy wondered. He could have just left him with the staff there but chose to spend the night in a cramped chair. He stretched and as he did, Tracy couldn't help notice how well built this guy was. He wasn't huge but he clearly takes good care of himself. That said, a night in a chair would be rough on anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man. I'm sorry about all this. I didn't mean to ruin your vacation,\" Tracy said feeling guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, hold on. First, I didn't do anything I didn't want to do. Second, anything that happened is not your fault,\" he said with deep singularity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that proves it,\" Tracy said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Proves what?\" he asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are too good to be real,\" He said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy blushed and looked away as the nurse came back wheeling a tray over with a glass water, two light blue pills, a small bottle with a label he couldn't read and a pile of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pills are for your head, the bottle is for everything else,\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the pills and chased them down with the water before looking at the bottle. It rattled as he looked at it and popped the lid off revealing light red colored pills. He closed it then looked and saw the label was hand written in Spanish but that was all he could figure out. Figuring they were vitamins to \"balance his levels\", he turned his attention to the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And these?\" he gestured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got sick, these are clean,\" she said rather succinctly before heading out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get out of your hair,\" the man said getting ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on there, Superman. You don't get to fly off after saving me like some damsel and disappear,\" he said tossing his hair striking a feminine pose as a joke, not realizing how cute he looked doing so. The man noticed, however, and stayed put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we meet up at the Dinning center tonight around 5:30 tonight?\" Tracy told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works for me, I'll see you then...\" he said then paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tracy. My name is Tracy,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Rodger,\" he told Tracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Rodger, you are dismissed. I need to get changed,\" Tracy told him with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tonight,\" was all he said as he left grinning ear to ear.</span></div></div>",

That wasn't all, however, as he was also wearing something wrapped around his chest. Straps around his shoulders kept the cupped fabric in place as he began an attempt to take it off. In his muddled state of mind he decided to ignore it for now and just get dressed, instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up a shirt and pulled it over his head. It was a light red color made of a nice, soft material. It looked longer than he realized and the hem of the shirt hung low, passed his hips and down to above his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn't make sense...\u201d he says to himself before being interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEse vestido se ve hermoso en ti! Do you need help with your new tacones altos? \u201d the nurse said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy didn't know how to respond so he just smiled. He was about to ask where the pants were but the nurse interrupted by picking up a pair of light red shoes and slipped them onto his feet. The heeled shoes forced him to have to focus on not tripping over and confusion filled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy where these shoes like this?\u201d he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a different day, he would have clearly seen what was done to him but he just wasn't in the right state of mind to figure it out. Instead, he focused on walking as the nurse helped him out of the building. She waved to Tracy as once again he was in out in the sun but this time in a dress and wearing heels.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't easy and he was having a great deal of trouble doing so. On top of all of that, he was feeling embarrassed by being out in public without pants but after walking buy a few people, they didn't seem to mind. In fact, plenty of guys were really friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Tracy decided that he needed to sit for a while and get off his feet. Lucky for him he saw that there were plenty of people sitting in a pavilion of some kind. He approached and saw that there was some kind of show getting ready to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, fun. I didn't miss anything.\u201d he said while making his way close to the front of the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy sat down, now more clear headed than he had been. He sat, crossing his legs and waited for the shoe to begin, looking down at his feet. He looked at his smooth legs and his heeled shoes. It was then that he started to piece together that something was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...\u201d he started to say but was startled by an amplified voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome ladies and gentlemen. I hope you are all enjoying yourselves. I am Drake Bloodstone and today we are all explorers. Not explorers of strange jungles or dark tombs but of something much more frightening: the human mind,\u201d said the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping on stage was an odd looking man dressed in black. He had way too much eye makeup on and his bald head shinned. Tracy smiled, deciding that this was going to be a fun time. The over the top nature of his performance was the perfect amount of cheese for Tracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is still much to be discovered about the mind and tonight we will plunge deep into the unknown, past the veil of consciousness into eternity. To start, I will need a volunteer,\" he said to the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the stage filled with people from the audience. There were the normal things: people singing, people pretending to be animals, and other mildly embarrassing actions and Tracy just sat there grinning. </span></div></div>",

To his own surprise, Tracy was incredibly easy to hypnotize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let's start with that confidence first. You stand here, with all over these people looking at you and instead of discomfort, you find yourself feeling calm. You like it when you have the attention because you are worth paying attention to. Tell us, what is your name?\u201d he commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Tracy,\u201d Tracy announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Tracy.

Do you understand?\u201d he urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand. I will accept the similarities I share with attractive women. This will make me happy,\u201d Tracy stated with hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you are complemented, you will not reject them as untrue, instead, you will accept them as truth,\u201d he informed Tracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will accept complements and not reject them as being untrue,\u201d Tracy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTracy, I think you are a beautiful young lady,\u201d Bloodstone admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Thank you,\u201d Tracy said with hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTracy, I'd like to see you again.

The comments by the woman next to him were still swimming in his head, the compliments echoing in his mind. He smiled thinking that she thought he looked good, which a woman never told him before. The feelings he was experiencing were difficult to reconcile with the fact that he was dressed like a woman. No matter how good he was feeling suddenly, he needed to set things right. Eventually, the show ended and Tracy all but sprinted away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to get back to my room and find something else to wear...\u201d He thought, a little sad at the idea of changing into something that might not look as good on him as the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain and again his thoughts revolved in a loop. He felt proud, embarrassed and...beautiful? He would shake his head and try to focus but again it would start. It was when he got to the pool on his way to his room that he needed to rest again. As much as he didn't want to be seen, he couldn't keep going. He found a beach chair under an umbrella and sat down. Occasionally he would get a dude looking at him and Tracy was terrified at what they were thinking of him. He turned his attention to the woman instead, who weren't looking at him for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw them in their bathing suits swimming or sunbathing and a strange thing entered his mind. He saw one woman whose hair was long and lightly curled. He brought his own hand to his head and touched his own hair. Now that he thought about it, his hair was probably more like hers than other men's. That realization didn't disgust him like it normally should, instead, he felt good. He saw the similarities and felt happy about it. Again he shook his head to rid himself of these weird thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting enough, he got back up and took off, now more confused that before.</span></div></div>",

No matter the cause, he got up and readied himself for the day. Today he considered trying one of the many swimming pools that he had access to. For now, he headed to the main lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnecting to the main lobby was a nice dining room filled with people and food. He was greeted by a man that lead him to a table and asked Tracy if he would like coffee. At least, that's what he assumed. The man's accent was fairly thick so he had a hard time understanding but it didn't bother Tracy. \"I'm in another country,\" he thought. \"I'm the guest here, I need to be aware that I'm not unintentionally being a rude guest.\" Once the man returned with coffee as well as a mojito, he knew he was going to enjoy this trip. The breakfast was buffet style which encouraged Tracy to indulge in a little over eating. He piled food onto his plate and had his fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ate, he couldn't help but notice the conversations of other people near him. The family to his left had English accents and the two gentlemen to his right where speaking french. He was surprised at that, though he felt silly for feeling like that. \"This is a vacation spot for many people, not just Americans,\" he thought to himself. One thing that was new for him was seeing the different styles of swimwear. Multiple times he saw men walking around in speedos. He admitted to himself that he found it weird but even in his limited experience, he knew that the swim trunk style was not a universal one. Tracy never traveled before, so there were bound to be some learning opportunities and personal growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished off his pancakes, Tracy made plans for the rest of his day.</span></div></div>",

He coughed and his throat felt weird as he did so.  He tried clearing it, but only a whisper of sound escaped.   Somehow the poison in the berries had paralyzed his vocal cords!  He was completely unable to speak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow feeling a desperate need to get to the town, he picked himself up and began slowly making his way there, his legs still bound in the spider's webbing.  He had no idea the picture he presented.  The giants' belt still pulled in his waist, making his hips seem curvier under the close-fitting wrapping of the web.  The need to walk carefully was forcing him to wiggle his butt from side to side with each step.  His dark hair fell in curly waves to his shoulders and swayed tantalizingly with each step, a single rose still entangled in it and the smell of flowers clinging to him.  Lastly, unbeknownst to him, the berries had had one other effect: his lips were swollen to an inviting plumpness and stained a bright red.  Any man seeing them would be aching to kiss them... or do other things with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I can find someone willing to help me,\" Will thought as he minced towards the town.</span></div></div>",

He did have to pause a few times due to feeling lightheaded, though. He would lean against a building with his hands behind his back and take deep breaths. His chest rising and falling was noticed by more than one person and caused two people to collide since they weren't watching where they were going. Once he would feel better he would wiggle down the streets until he needed to rest again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething he noticed pretty quickly was that people seemed really nice here. Everywhere he went other guys would smile at him. He smiled back with his inviting red lips as he passed and many would turn around to watch backside sway. He kept his eyes out for a shop or something so he could try and find a way to ask for a healer. He didn't want to ask someone passing by because he knew it was going to take time to try and explain without a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be long before the towns folk would begin gossiping about the pretty girl that walked into town in her silk dress.</span></div></div>",

There were shoes everywhere and he had pair he was currently working on. He didn't notice Will enter so will tried to get his attention. He tried his voice again but his vocal cords were still non functional from those blasted berries. The he finally settled on pursing his lips together and whistling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man jumped at the sudden sound and his jaw dropped when he saw Will, or rather, the beautiful woman Will appeared to be. He somehow found a way to pick his tongue up off the floor and came over to will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, how can I help you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill's pretty mouth opened but yet again, nothing came out. The man looked confused so will tapped his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You can't speak?\" he asked, unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill nodded and gave the man a smile that quickened the man's heart. Will did a pantomime of writing and the man understood and grabbed a quill and parchment. Will quickly wrote out what happened and handed the page back to the man. The man studied it for some time, but didn't react. He looked up at Will who was looking back expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I uh...I can't read,\" he said apologetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill slapped his forehead and turned trying to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man got a better look at Will and his back looked just as lovely as his front. That is when he noticed Will's boots. There most have been a time when they were shiny and new but that day was long ago. It was curious to the man to see a woman of such elegance and beauty wearing such a thing. Maybe he could help her out?</span></div></div>",

Will started and crouched as best as he could in the silk confinement, before looking back at the shopkeeper who already seems to have headed out a back entrance in panic. Looking around Will half wondered if he should stay, but another, almost screeching noise picks up; and suddenly Will decided that the best thing he could do was to move as far f from that sound as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was easier said than done with the silk skirt still keeping his legs together, and his sword still pinned to his side under all the silk. Will made it for the door as fast as he could and as he was leaving the shop he tried to pick up speed. But his more frantic pace and the uneven street ground caused him to stumble, falling forward. Bracing for the ground, his fall was arrested at the last second by a strong arm that held him, and then pulled him back onto his feet. Will turned to see a large, well built knight facin him, wearing no helmet but otherwise in full armour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Will looked into the knight's blue eyes, the knight seemed to hesitate, almost like he was staring at Will. Will tried to thank him but again no noise would come out. Fortunately the knight seemed to snap out of whatever daze he was in and quickly responded. \"No need for thanks, but we must get you to safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Will could try to respond, he suddenly found himself hoisted up by the knight and in a princess carry. Before he can say anything else, the knight picked up pace and dashed down the street. Will was stunned at this turn of events, but he'd heard of knights going about doing good work. He must have seen Will's limited mobility and come to help, and Will certainly wasn't about to turn down help to get to safety, he could see several several villagers rushing in the same general direction... but safety from <i>what</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother screech ripped through the air, and that's when Will saw it. Far behind them but closing fast. A great, dark dragon.</span></div></div>",

Will turned to see what the delay was, but the knight was already furiously unhitching a horse from a post and very quickly checking the saddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Will thought, a horse would definitely be a fast way to get moving, but how would Will be able to get his legs on both sides of the saddle with his silk casing? His thoughts were interrupted has the knight suddenly hoisted him up onto the horse and placed him sidesaddle. The knight mounted the horse astride behind him. With a click of the reigns, the horse was back on the main village street. Will tried to get a look at the dragon but somehow his view got blocked, often by the big knight behind him who held Will close to stop him from falling off. The saddle was clearly not designed for a sidesaddle passenger and every gallop the horse made threatened to dislodge Will from the horses back, so Will pressed against the knight and wrapped his arms around him. The knight thankfully seemed to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a shelter up ahead,\" said the knight, \"either a cave or some building. I haven't seen it myself, but I made sure to know of its location when I arrived here. That's where we're all going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill could looked as they overtook several running villagers. He couldn't imagine how well he would have fared if he hadn't been rescued by this knight... who's name he didn't even know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kevin by the way.\" Will looked up at Kevin's face and smiled, happily noting Kevin returned the smile warmly. Kevin seemed to understand without Will having to say anything, which was a relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe galloped on leaving the village behind, the sounds behind them seemed to change in nature including great big whooshing noices, and mix with more human yells and screams.

Being on horseback they were some of the earliest people to arrive, but more villagers seemed to arrive every moment. Slowing down, Will finally got a good look at the village behind them and was horrified, at several parts flames leaped into the sky while other parts were charred and smouldering. Smoke billowed up and, with a suddenly erupting tongue of flame, Will could suddenly see the dragon, swooping across the city like a bird of prey, flame lashing the city below. Will could just about see some other villagers trying to leave the village and his heart sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin gently lowered Will to the ground and looked down at Will from his steed. \"I need to go back, other people need me.\" Will simply nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Kevin hesitated, he focused his deep blue eyes strongly on Will's brown eyes and said \"I promise I'll be back, your safety is something I shall always do my utmost to protect\" and with that he turned his horse and galloped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill blinked. Safety? He was already at the shelter, Kevin was certainly dedicated to the people he rescued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Kevin galloped off into the distance, Will felt a pang of... guilt. Kevin had quite possibly saved his life, his life instead of some other villager who'd probably lived in the village his whole life. Will never pretended to be some noble hearted adventurer, but he didn't want his quest for fortune to cause hardship for others. And now the dragon, he looked at it as it swooped a wide angle, ready to make another pass over the town. He'd been looking it as his ticket to great riches, but here it was causing huge devastation and problems for real people....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Will sat down on a sloping boulder. Arms supporting him from behind, pushing his chest up; legs resting on the boulder pointing his knees to the sides, like a statue of poignancy. A couple of villagers came up to him, but he just responded non-committally. His eyes glazed over as he watched the dragon seem to calm down, and more toy with the village, but still breaking buildings and driving people away.</span></div></div>",

Confuddled, Will tried to say that the girl was pretty too, but of course couldn't say anything. Instead he smiled, nodded, and lightly pointed towards the girl. Something about kids made it easier to be theatrical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm pretty too?\" the girl asked open eyed. Will nodded, and was delighted to see the girl beam back at him. Something about her bright and enthusiastic demeanour broke through his cloudy mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I... can I paint your nails?\" Will laughed silently. He'd heard of kids doing such thing in the name of fun, and while some men would scoff at doing such a thing, who was Will to get in the way of a child's happiness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded to the child's delight and sat down in the grass beside her. Apparently the kid had what looked like her Mum's cosmetics in a small bag she had tied around her waist. It was surprisingly high quality stuff, her Mum must have really cared about appearances. The child furrowed her brow and focused on painting Will's nails with the concentration of a surgeon. \"My name is Samantha,\" she said, \"and one day I'm going to go to a castle and make all the princesses look beautiful. And the queen too! But Dad says you have to work up to that, so I'll make the princesses look beautiful and the Queen will be so happy with that she'll want me to make her beautiful too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill's heart is lightened by her upbeat nature and smiles as she talks on. Soon a worried looking mother approaches, she's a bit taken aback to see you (though you nod to reassure her), but she then urges her daughter to move into the cave. \"Just a minute Mummy,\" she replies, and against her Mum's protestations, she finishes her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at his now bright red nails, Will is surprised that Samantha did such a good job, they look bright and vibrant. Looking back to her he smiles thanks, she smiles back and then her mother hustles her off to the cave, throwing an apology to Will, while Samantha says she hopes to see him soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Will's mood lifted, he decides what to do.

It's been getting dark, but the cave is nearby and part of him is a bit worried about Kevin. The village is still on fire and smoking, though the fire has spread to some new areas and has died down in others. There are far less cries and screams, everything seems quieter, eerily quiet, like an aftermath. No matter how hard Will looks through the gloom, the dragon is nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this stage Will was used to the trickle of villagers passing by the rock to enter the cave, but then he notices something a bit unusual. Two horses pulling a broken cart and at a pretty decent speed. Looking close he sees a knight on one of the horses, and the horse the same brilliant white as the one he was on earlier that day. Skuttering closer, Will sees it is indeed Kevin on the horse, and the two horses combined are dragging a barely functioning cart holding a whole family of people, who are clinging on as the two horses pulling it up the slope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill waved at Kevin and Kevin waved back and soon the cart has stopped at the cave mouth and its passengers are dismounting. After quickly checking over everyone Kevin returned to Will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A farmer family,\" he explained, \"they broke an axle trying to get away on the cart. We've probably done even more damage to the cart by having dragging it here but more than worth it to get to safety. But enough of that, get into the cave, the dragon might still be about.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it hadn't been the best move to stay outside, Will joins Kevin, the farmer family, and even some horses, and enters the low but fairly spacious cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are murmurs of \"is it over?\", crying about lost friends or possessions, much talk of who is okay, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill feels he can't engage with this, it's too much and still doesn't know anyone, so with a few comforting shoulder presses, he find an unoccupied part of the cave and lies down. After a bit of discomfort, a kindly stranger hands him a bag with something soft in it which Will thankfully accepts as a pillow. Lying back, and despite being famished, everything that he has done today catches up with him and Will drifts off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Coming closer, Will found himself offered milk and porridge, which he gratefully accepted and ate with gusto, though he carefully manged each spoon of porridge since he imagined spilling any would give a bad impression if the dragon attack made any of this food scarse. He had to admire the people, they'd received a blow, and certainly their spirits were down and would take some time to recover, but they were continuing on, making food, keeping going, even offering food to someone who had been with them less than a day. He would have liked some way to help them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe early morning went to mid-morning, a few seemed to leave the cave, and then Kevin appeared at the cave mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greeting everyone, I am Kevin of Hofstead, a knight currently in the employ of Lord Denham,\" there were a few cynical remarks at the mention of the Lord's name, but nothing too vitriolic, \"From what I can see, the dragon has left us, and the town while badly damaged does have some areas intact. You all have my deepest sympathy for anything you may have lost.\" More low key discussion, \"I will not pretend to know what you are going through right now, but I will do everything in my power to stop it from happening again. First I shall send word back to Lord Denham about this attack, letting him know the dragon is a serious threat to be dealt with. This may lead to some strong action, but I won't wait for that because, second. I shall challenge the dragon myself.\" There were gasps from around the cave, Will's eyes widened.

At the very least he'd need.... someone who could back him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill looked at Kevin again. Reliable, trustworthy, was heading straight to the dragon, probably more experienced and less likely to walk into spider webs, and when they reached the lair? Well, deal with that issue when they come to it but he would definitely have more options with someone by his side. And surely Kevin would be happy to have someone have his back too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just one minor issue... the silk. It was nice that no one had made fun of him for effectively wearing a spider web as clothing. Feeling himself down (not noticing some strange reactions from villagers), Will confirmed it wrapped around his arms, his full upper body, and most frustratingly: still wrapped his two legs together to below the knees.

Looking around, Wills saw among some foodstuffs a short, serrated knife used for stuff like cutting ham, and borrowed it. Going back to a more private area of the cave, Will pushed the knife down into the fabric between his legs, but the silk proved tough. A cutting motion at the very end of the skirt seemed to cause minor fraying but that was it. Then Will had a brainwave, he returned to the campfire, placed the knife blade in the fire, waited, and then took it back to the alcove. This time, will was delighted to see the web sizzle and give way as he attacked the hem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was still slow going and the knife cooled down fast, but Will had another great idea. Heating up the knife again, this time he cut at the side of him, and after some surgical cuts... he could see his great sword hilt peeking out. Will finally had his sword back, and pulling it free he saw a chance to speed everything up. He put the sword blade in the fire, left it a long time, even throwing in a bit of wood; and back at the aclove finally put its point to the ground and pressed its blade against the silk, pushing his hard as he could to cut the silk through between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith sizzling and a bit of steam, Will feel the sword move as it made its way through both sets of silk. He could feel his legs getting freer and being able to move them apart. Finally looking down, he saw instead of a skirt, what looked like two silk leggings, perfectly sealed all the way his legs. Somehow when cutting the skirt, he'd also managed to seal the front and back parts of it together. Just like his arms, they were wrapped in spider silk, though thankfully not bound or restricted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it hadn't perfectly sealed up a the crotch area. He took the opportunity to discretely relieve himself, but Will really didn't want people to get a view there however brief. So with delicate and understandably nervous motions, Will pulled the silk together and moved the flat of his still hot blade up to it. The silk sizzled, but seemed to melt and join together in a seamless seam. Then suddenly it dried and... hrk! The silk suddenly tightened and pressed against his crotch with tremendous strength. Will dropped the sword and doubled over in pain as he imagined the web ending him in such an unexpected way. But, gradually the pain eased and he could see that webbing had constricted, flattening his crotch area. While tight, it all looked smooth, and Will had to take comfort in the fact that this was far preferable to accidentally flashing people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking heart in this Will decided overall this was definitely an improvement, and making a few strides up and down the cavern, Will felt more confident.</span></div></div>",

I was looking for you earlier but you seemed to have gone off. Anyway, I understand you're not a native to this town so I've spoken with the mayor and he says he'll arrange for someone to give you lodgings. I shall go to the dragon and if the result leaves me still able to walk, I shall return here. I don't know what you intend to do in the meantime, but I hope to see you here when I return.\" He said the last bit leaning a bit closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill shook his head, and Will's face fell. \"Of course, I wish you luck in what you plan to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill shook his head harder and gestured to the horse trying to make a mounting motion, Will's eyes widened \"You want to come with me?\" Will nodded. \"To the dragon's lair?\" Will nodded again. \"It's dangerous, very dangerous, I cannot guarantee your safety. There are many things out there, bandits, giant snakes, steep terrain, not to mention the dragon itself. Are you sure you're ready for that?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tried to wield it as he'd been taught to, but frustratingly Kevin looked at him in astonished amusement, almost like he would burst out laughing. \"Well... that is quite a lot more spirit than I was expecting out of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill looked at Kevin with a mix of confusion and annoyance. Was he being patronised?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin noticed the look and tried to push his humour aside, \"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"I just did not swordplay to come out of someone like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill sagged his shoulders looking down, he guessed he would need more actual experience with a sword before a greatly experience knight like Kevin would take him seriously. But then Will felt Kevin's heavy gauntleted hand on his shoulder, and Kevin was looking into his eye \"But one should not judge by appearance, a very fatal mistake to make. I'm sure that's not the last surprise you have.\" Will smiled weakly, but noticed that Kevin was now looking at him thoughtfully. \"You want to do something don't you? Anything you can? Whatever you can?\" Will nodded vigorously. \"And you realise there are no guarantees? I will do everything I can to protect you, but if you choose to join me on this quest anything could happen and I can't, and it breaks my heat to say this, but I can't promise I'll be able to keep you safe.\" Will nodded, more slowly this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin smiled wryly,  \"Very well, but you need to do exactly what I tell you to do and heed my advice, in the wilderness there is very little margin for error and we can't leave anything to chance.\" Will nodded, he felt Kevin was underestimating him but admittedly his most recent escapades had left him wrapped in a spiderweb and unable to talk, following someone more experienced seemed like the smart option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin nodded once, \"Then we are off.\" Kevin stowed Will's sword on the saddle, mounted the horse and pulled Will up onto the saddle in front of him, Will thankful to be astride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was suddenly surprised by the reaction of the villagers. They were anxiously insisting he shouldn't go and saything these terrible warnings about what could happen to him, some men even offered him lodgings. So little time he'd spent with them, and yet again they seemed to care so much for a simple stranger. \"Your concern is appreciated, but we all must be free to make our own decisions,\" Will nodded in agreement, glad once again Kevin put effect to his thoughts. Will waved to the villagers to thank them, and in a flash of good humour, theatrically blew kisses. The thunderously enthusiastic response to surprised him and he started to think that now was the right moment to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was one more event before they left, the young girl from before was waving with both hands, and anxiously trying to give them something. Kevin slowed down the horse for her and some of the crowd even went silent to support her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're doing something dangerous, but my charm will keep you safe. Also it looks pretty.\" Will took what she held out and examined it. It was a well crafted handmade bracelet, a series of nice stones threaded by a simple piece of string. Some were bright colours like green, others seemed transparent, others were marbled or textured. Probably not worth much but beautiful to look at. More to the point, Will was touched by the thought. He got off the horse and thanked the girl with a big hug, the crowd cheering at the touching moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was really the time to get going. Will remounted, Kevin flipped his reigns and the horse cantered then galloped off, the crowed behind them cheering as they fell further and further behind them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They had been travelling for a while, big trees passed by on both sides of them as they cantered down a dirt track. Will's long black wavy hair would occasionally get in his eyes, reminding himself to get another ponytail when he wasn't constantly dealing with one thing or another, but for the moment he just swept it aside. At first the saddle was uncomfortable, pressing Will and Kevin's body together as they bumped along, but he'd gotten used to it. Sometimes Kevin's arm would come in front of Will and hold him securely to Kevin's body. It seemed unnecessary but Will knew Kevin was determined to keep him safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall the journey was... boring. Kevin hadn't spoken much, probably with many deep thoughts on his mind of the days ahead, and with Will unable to speak and neither able to read each-others faces as they were both looking the same direction, conversation would have been frustrating. After the initial buzz and excitement, it was now trotting along forest trails. Will wished for something to liven it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMen jumped out \"Stand and deliver!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe careful what you wish for, thought Will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin pulled the horse to a stop. Four or five men approached from all sides but two at the front (one with a crossbow, the other with a bow and arrow) seemed to keep their distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Kevin of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care who you are, get down and empty your saddlebags,\" the thief with the crossbow said. Kevin slowly dismounted. \"You too Rose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose? thought Will. A memory stirred, and he reached his had back through his hair to find... the rose was still there! Dammit, no wonder the girl called him pretty. It seemed it was still tangled in his hair, and still fresh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said get down,\" the bolt's point waved at him menacingly. Hurriedly Will turned to dismount, only he wasn't that used to saddles and horses. His foot got caught in the stirrup, he lost his balance and fell face flat right into the dirt, wrenching his foot slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose!\" Kevin called out. Great, thought Will, now even Kevin had picked up the nickname, I should have spelled a name out for him before we.... Will had been pushing himself up while trying to wave away Kevin's concern, but now a bandit wielding a Janbiya (very exotic) grabbed Will one handed by the neck, pulled him up and pushed him against the side of the horse, which shuffled but remained still. Will immediately grasped the arm that was holding him with his painted hands, but held back. The bandit looked into Will's deep brown eyes, then to his wavy jet black hair with a single fragrant rose, face with bright red lips, white silk encased body with the narrow waist, and then back to the brown eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what are you doing out here?\" asked the bandit with a broadening grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to Will's side, Kevin answered \"We are on our way to kill the dragon.\" The bandits burst into laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are you going to do? Make an offering?\" the bandit replied nodding towards Will. Will and Kevin scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're interested at all in ending the dragon's reign of terror, surely you'll let us go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crossbow bandit stepped forward with an air of authority. Still pointing his crossbow at them he said \"Well we could, if, you know, I thought you had a snails' hair's chance of doing more damage than just pissing on it. And that's if I even believed you are going off to the dragon, and not, maybe, some couple going off to elope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill rolled his eyes at the low-brow humour, he was worried that Kevin would feel his masculinity attacked and get angry, but encouragingly he let the comment slide. \"I suppose you have no reason to believe us, but know this: We have just come from a town ravaged by a dragon attack, mothers, fathers, children all flushed out of their home, lives destroyed, buildings and livelihoods decimated, and that is only the most recent in a long line of destruction that dragon has wrought. Maybe that dragon has led to you having to take this course of action to survive, or maybe you have long subsisted off this way of living yet you've noticed a drop off in gains as the dragon's actions have made everyone poorer. Either way, it is best for all of us that the dragon is vanquished from this land, and whatever you do to us, whatever parts of us remain, we will fight on and do everything we can to make sure that dragon sees its last day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the crossbow bandit heard Kevin's speech, he gradually relaxed his grip and lowered the crossbow, as Kevin finished the bandit stood, looked around, nodded to Kevin, then quickly raised the crossbow \"Nope, we're still robbing you\"</span></div></div>",

Will had to admit, going with the bandit probably wouldn't lead to a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" the crossbow bandit asked, ignoring the knight, \"If you do this you're not getting as big a share\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have my whole share if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but be ready when we finish or we're leaving you behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal, now c'mon,\" the bandit grabbed Will roughly by the arm and hustled him toward the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not lay a hand on -OWWWW\" a bandit punched Kevin squarely in the face, another one knocked him down from behind, and suddenly bandits all around were kicking at him. Shocked Will struggled towards Kevin to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be fine if you don't resist,\" said the bandit wrenching Will back towards the trees, \"Isn't that right lads?\" The other bandits replied half heartedly in agreement and eased off attacking Kevin. Will felt he had to accept this, at least until they were out of sight and went with the bandit towards the woods. As they were crossing the threshold Will thought he could hear Keving groan \"Rose!\" but without an obvious choice, he stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill couldn't figure out what all that talk back there had been about, or exactly what to do now, but he knew he was going from a 2-4 situation to a 1-1 situation. Of course he didn't have his sword, and his foot hurt.... his foot! Will started limping hard, If he exaggerated his injury it could help to take the bandit off guard, but the bandit just got more annoyed in response to this and pulled Will along hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Will could give the situation more thought, they reached a mini cliff of earth. \"Sit\" the bandit commanded, and Will sat on the embankment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit steadied his breathing and looked a Will, looking him all over. Will did not like the look in his eye, he wanted something from him and it wasn't information. The bandit looked more, his breathing becoming heavier, tossing the Janbiya from one hand to the other and suddenly Will realised... The bandit was a serial murder! A vicious monster that killed for the sake of killing before moving onto his next victim. He wasn't going to let Will leave the forest alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realisation chilled Will to the bone and his stomach lurched. Why did he keep ending up in these situations?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knew he was quick-tongued when under pressure and could probably find some way to gain an advantage or opportunity, but instead he'd have to grab whatever opportunities came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you should smile more,\" the bandit said distastefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill shot back with a mix between a wry grin and an outright grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, come on now\" the bandit said as he approached. \"We don't have very long here,\" another step, \"so lets make every moment count.\" Now crouching in front of Will, he reached out and brushed a strand of hair out of Will's face and behind his ear. His eyes glistened with anticipation, \"C'mon, be more enthusiastic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill responded with an expertly timed full force head-but, smashing the top part of his head against the bandit's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit staggered back and lost his balance, Will jumped to his feet and approached for another hit, but the bandit partially recovered and swung with his curved dagger. The blade seemed to graze off Will's leg, but there didn't seem to be damage or pain. Of course, thought Will, the magic belt was still on him, but no time to consider that now. Will kicked hard with his full body force against the Bandit's upper body and he fell back on the ground. Before he could recover, Will jumped up and slammed his foot down on the bandit's midsection, and again, and again. The bandit spasmed each time and dropped the knife, but on Will's fourth kick, the bandit grabbed his boot. Frustrated, Will tried to move away, struggling for a moment like a tug of war before he pulled his foot free. The bandit fell back with the boot, but the prepared Will quickly regained balance and with one bare foot he took a step forward and slammed his other boot into the side of the bandit's head. At last, it seemed to do something as the bandit became dazed and disorientated. Will furiously kicked a few more times until the bandit's eyes slid shut and he clearly seemed unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe furious fight was over, simple woodland sounds took over, Will took a moment to take it all in, but knew he had little time to think over the events right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst he ensured the Janbiya was well out of the bandit's reach. Examining the dagger, Will appreciated it's good quality and sharp blade. Then he noticed the dagger's sheath, attached to the bandit's belt. Seeing no reason not to take advantage of the situation, Will unclasped and removed the belt from the bandit, carefully ensuring he was still unconscious while doing so, and strapped the belt to his own waist instead, sheathing the Janbiya firmly. The belt hugged his waist snugly, and looked good with its brown leather contrasting strongly against his pure white \"clothing\". Patting the sheathed Janbiya, Will affirmed he would not be caught unarmed again. There was also a pouch on the belt containing some coin and a couple of vials of chemicals that Will did not have the time to examine right now. Checking that the bandit didn't have anything else on him, Will stepped back and admired his took in the supine body before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he'd done, he'd needed to do, but now what to do with the bandit. Will decided that he wasn't a murderer, but just leaving the man out here seemed like asking for trouble. He'd heard stories of unconscious enemies left unattended only for them to come to and spoil the heroes' plan at the last moment; and more to the point if Will's assessment of him was right, the man was a serial murderer with every future murder he committed could potentially be on Will's conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPondering it for as long as he dared under the circumstances, Will made a decision. He found a big rock and lugging it to the bandit, he heaved it above his head and brought it crashing down on the bandit's leg. He wasn't sure if he hard a crack, but knew the bandit's chances of walking were severely diminished over the short term. What would happen to him in the long term would be left to the bandit, the forest and the stars; but not to Will. He had other priorities, chief among them, rescuing Kevin.</span></div></div>",

Three, definitely three, bandits in sight. Kevin on his knees with the sword bandit hovering over him. The leader still holding his crossbow, with his back towards Will and engaged in conversation with Kevin, and the archer looking through items taken from Kevin's horse, putting some of them in the saddlebags of a new horse tied up nearby. As Will took it all in, snatches of conversation wafted to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how can we tell that your are telling the truth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Lord Denham bond is always honoured, and I have sway. If need be I can forfeit some of my property to contribute to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But only if your 'friend' is unharmed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can make deals with criminals, even bandits. But never with people who enact the greatest evil upon others in return for only brief a brief moment of pleasure for themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering \"Hmmmm, a lot that could go wrong, but still...\" the leader thought for a moment, \"Brandon,\" he called to the archer, \"see if you can stop Erik. I know he likes a good leadup so you may have time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way; not while he's waving that knife around, you let him go out there in the first place, you can stop him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, keep things secure till I get back,\" and turned towards the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill scuppered backward out of the bush and crouching he put more trees and bushes between him and the leader, hoping any noise he may have made would be attributed to woodland creatures. Kevin's touching gesture had put the odds more in their favour. Will had to take advantage of this.</span></div></div>",

Will moved far back into the forest to be sure that the most obvious sounds would be muffled, but a shout or a yell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the forest didn't have a path per say, Will could see the most likely route the leader would take in following his comrade. There was cover all around but Will needed to take the leader as off guard as possible. Time to go with the classic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill grabbed a whole handful of red berries off a bush and squeezed them so a red juice came out. He patted it against his stomach so the front of his garment was stained red. Throwing the belt into a bush, he kept the Janbiya in his right hand and put more berries in his left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delicate part: lying back down on the ground, right side of him facing away from the bandit's approach, right hand and Janbiya close to his body and partially covered with leaves. With his left hand he squeezed again and left a trail of red juice from the side of his mouth down his left cheek, then he simply patted his left hand on the big red stain, rolled his head back and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe approaching cracks of branches and footsteps showed, the leader had no concern for stealth, something followed by his sudden yell \"ERIK? WHERE ARE YOU?... I NEED YOU TO STOP, THERE'S MONEY INVOLVED, WE NEED TO...\" he stopped, there before him, white with a strong accent of red standing out against the drab woodland colours, lay Will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dammit!\" the leader raced up to Will, taking in the red stains, and then crouched low,putting a hand on either side of Will's face in a surprisingly close gesture. \"Please, give me some sign you're alive.\" Will obliged...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill didn't like to think about what happened next, for many they would question whether this sort of life was really for them. Will thrust, and pulled and thrust again. The bandit's face was a mask of shock, Will took this opportunity to push him back, his red stained hand over his mouth, and took this guaranteed silence to stab again... and again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was no doctor, but in a short while he could see the life draining out of him and removed his hand from the man's mouth with no risk of shouts arising. Will stood up, a bit shocked himself, his pure white garment now vividly blood stained. He'd been in fights before, but he'd never killed anyone before now. Then again, before now there'd never been anyone who he desperately wanted to protect. Kevin had done so much for him, and a decent person like him deserved to be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill avoided looking back at the blood stained thief, giving one solemn nod and once again focused on the task at hand. He picked up his belt again, and the bandit's crossbow on the ground a bit away (must have put it down on seeing Will). Still loaded with a bolt, Will picked it up and returned once again to the side of the road, taking up position again under the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the chaotic events that had happened, things now seemed pretty simple. While not skilled with a crossbow, Will could pick off a stationary target from a steady, prone position. He just needed to choose.</span></div></div>",

Quick as a flash he picked up the fallen sword and plunged it downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archer, of all ironies, had two weapons but neither of them ready. He struggled to get the bow off his shoulder but seeing how fast Kevin dispatched his comrade, he tried to draw his sword instead. He was barely ready when Kevin faced him, bloodied sword in hand and a moment of silence passed as they looked at eachother. Then the archer turned and ran pell-mell into the forest on the opposite side of the road, disappearing with a rustle of branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was... over?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill stepped out from the forest. Kevin caught sight of him. In a moment they were together and suddenly embraced. After a moment, Kevin pushed them apart looking at Will and his blood soaked clothes \"Are you harmed? Did they hurt you?\" Will shook his head. Kevin glanced at the crossbow and the holstered Janbiya and got a sense of what had happened. Without saying anything he embraced Will again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill placed his chin on Kevin's shoulder, finding himself crying. Was this normal? Kevin sensed Will's emotion and patted him on the back as they held eachother \"You shouldn't have had to go through that. It was terrible.... But you saved us. Thank you.\" Will burst into more tears and wished he could say something; something about how Kevin saved them too, or asking if it was all his fault, or apologising for forcing Kevin to negotiate with bandits. But right now maybe he just wanted to be held, to be near someone who understood. Someone who had ended human life yet still remained a decent person; someone who knew the world could be cruel and sometimes we are faced with difficult decisions and have to make the best of it; someone who knew that Will had killed yet would look at him without judgement. Someone who he was very lucky to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor many moments they embraced, Will finding Kevin a great rock to cry on, and then gradually the tears dried up, his sobbing subsided, and soon they stepped apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill felt emotionally drained and somewhat fuzzy headed, but Kevin took charge. He regathered the the stolen items, checked over the swordsman, sorted through some of the bandit's possessions, and then surprisingly hitched the bandit's horse to their own. Despite this extra horse, Will was glad to see that after mounting his own horse Kevin pulled Will up in front of him. Maybe early on all this personal contact would have been awkward, but all that they'd been through had forged a bond between the pair, an understanding. Will didn't mind, and even welcomed, that Kevin wrapped his arm around in front of him him and held him close, and that this lasted through their entire journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey galloped on until twilight.</span></div></div>",

Bread, cheese, fish, apples, some weak beer and even ham, it was good, filling and invigorating. Will suspected that due to what had happened today, Kevin was playing loose with whatever rationing system he'd set up for the trip. Just as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the eating exacerbated the fourth issue: Will really needed to relieve himself, in both ways. Kevin had already discretely wandered off, but Will had problems that were pressing hard on him like the lower part of his garment. No fire had been lit, so Will didn't have a heated blade open the garment. Hee'd have to find some other way to do it not to mention way to fix it afterwards.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKevin returned, \"If you wish to to clean yourself, I heard running water off in that direction,\" he said pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh yes. Fifthly, Will was still totally bloodsoaked, dried thankfully. With this and the previous problem using a spiderweb as a clothing garment had probably outlived its novelty, if it had one in the first place. Maybe he could finally deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich would lead to, sixthly, clothes. If he was going to get the web off... if he COULD get the web off... he'd need them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill sighed, deal with a life and death situation and make it through; and you still have to deal with stuff like THIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired but tense, Will stood up, checked his Janbiya was still holstered, pulled what seemed like a robe from a saddle bag on the bandit's horse, and walked in the direction Kevin pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" said Kevin, offering a slightly bulging single strap leather bag. Will had seen Kevin with that bag when sorting out their and the bandit's gear after the attack (when Will had seen the robe). He didn't know what was in it, but trusted that Kevin would ensure its contents were good. Without stopping he nodded thanks, took the bag and headed for the rumoured water.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Will lowered his curved dagger to his leg. Anxious not to mix the blood on the blade with his own, he at first made careful cuts, but anxious to be able to relieve himself he became more and more forceful. Then his knife slipped...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and Will remembered, again, that he was wearing the Giant's belt. Knowing the blade would not harm him, he quickly made the cuts he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst he cut a slit, starting against his inside upper thigh, along the bottom of his crotch (very thankful for belt protection at this point), and down the inside part of his other upper thigh. Already the garment released some of its pressure and he exhaled, but his task wasn't over. The slits on both sides stopped a bit above the knees, here Will simply cut around the leg, splitting the entire garment into its main part and two \"leggings\".<br>\r\nGrabbing  both sides of the garment around his thighs, Will pulled up. With relief he found the garment separated from the lowerpart that covered his legs, and with the slit he was able to pull past his lower regions up to his waist. His nether regions being free, Will finally ducked behind a bush and let it all out. As he did so, he let out an almost inappropriate sound of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, and with Will feeling somewhat drained (partially in a literal sense), he returned to the brook, washed up downstream from the pool and went up to the pool to sort out his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag Kevin had given him thankfully contained a basic sewing kit, which Will used to mend all the cuts he'd made to his garment. Sewing it back to how it had been before would run into the same problems, and making more cuts could make the whole thing more likely to fall apart. So for now Will joined the left and right parts on the front, and also the left and right parts on the back. Looking down, he could feel the smooth garment flow from his body down past his hips to hug his thighs in one single tube. He had to admit he'd done a good job with the sewing, but hoped Kevin wouldn't mind the slightly unusual style. Then again, he'd been understanding so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silk \"stockings were harder to figure out. At first Kevin just wanted them gone, and tried to pull them off his feet. But with a cold breeze he decided some sort of leg warmth would be a good idea. He pulled them down so they covered his ankles, and with his boots on, his whole lower legs were covered. Still though, he felt they went up too far, and he wouldn't mind some knee mobility. Kevin considered just cutting the them just below his knees, but was wary of wasting more \"fabric\". So then he opened them at the top and folded them back on themselves so they were shortened to just under his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his boots back on, it looked like he was wearing a long thin stockings over his feet and calves, then his bare knees, then the hem of his upper garment that coated his torso and arms. It was too dark for Will to see himself properly now, but he decided that people didn't remark on clothing as much as you'd expect, and besides, having functional clothing was a priority if they were really going to take on a dragon.</span></div></div>",

Will froze, the ambush coming flooding back to him. He needed to clean it, and is clothing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill moved over to the pond which by now had a swarm of fireflies glinting above it, dancing in erratic patterns that at other times would have brought Will mirth. Putting the belt aside for now, he plunged the blade it into the cold water. While carefully cleaning it he didn't notice the fireflies gradually becoming more frantic and numerous. He had noticed some old stone positioned around the pool as if the pool had some significance, but assumed such significance had long since past. Just when Will thought the cleaning was almost done, a bright light burst from above the lake grabbing Will's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYOU DEFILE THE SACRED POOL WITH BLOOD?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill's mouth gaped open, hovering above the pool was a being of light. It's features seemed feminine, yet exuded an otherworldly power. The booming voice seemed to strike his very soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTELL ME, WHO'S BLOOD IS IT? WAS IT BLOOD THAT YOU SHED?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill raised the Janbiya from the lake, most of the blood cleaned off. Fight or flight seemed like dangerous options, and striking out was what led him to this situation in the first place, he froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEVER MIND, I SHALL FIGURE OUT MYSELF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to Will's terror, the figure moved towards him. It reached out an indistinct appendage that may have been an arm and Will raised the Janbiya protectively. The arm touched the Janbiya... and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment things were frozen in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI SEE....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice, while powerful and authoritative, seemed different now, subdued and slightly poignant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. I SEE HOW YOU CAME BY THAT WEAPON AND WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH IT. I SEE WHAT EVENTS LED TO YOU TAKING SUCH ACTIONS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill simply nodded, he would take all the sympathy he could get, but to be honest, he still felt guilty about what he had done. Kevin had been sympathetic, but to have someone else know. Would they also be sympathetic? Will then shivered upon asking himself, what would they do to him if they weren't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUT I DO NOT SEE YOUR INTENTIONS, SO ANSWER TRUTHFULLY: DO YOU WISH TO FORGET ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED?</span></div></div>",

Feet rooted to the ground, Will felt tingling all over as sparks raced over him. His vision brimming up with electricity, he could feel the lightning grow bigger and bigger... and then abruptly it ceased. Will stood stock still for a moment, then looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the glow of the being, Will could see that his main body garment, previously white with bloodstains, was now vibrant shiny red; from its hem at his thighs, through his body, all the way its sleeves at his wrists, all bright shiny red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStroking the smooth texture with his hands, Will then noticed his previously painted nails were now a bright varnished red. Looking down, his boots they were now bright red, as were his stockings that coated his legs from his boots up to his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Will taken off his boots, he would have noticed his toenails were now also varnished red. What also escaped his noticed was that the rose in his hair has been revitalised with its leaves now as blood red as ever; and his lips which were previously just stained red were now a perfectly formed, strong, plump, luscious crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bracelet was for some reason untouched, its many coloured stones glistening in the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, redness seemed to shoot out from him, like a bright signature. However, the being was not yet done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTO REMIND YOU WHERE YOU GOT YOUR SPOILS...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belt and the Janbiya handle flared in a hot, electric fire. Will dropped the blade which fell point down onto the pool bank. After a moment, the fire cut out. The Janbiya handle and the belt, save its buckle, were now jet black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill waited, but the being was silent. Was it done? Looking between the being and his items, Will gingerly reached down and picked them up, lightly tapping them at first to ensure they weren't hot. They were covered with a very light layer of soot which Will wiped away with his hands, but they were still jet black underneath. Will gradually put the belt back on, it's large silver belt buckle to the front. In the black sheath he holstered his blade, its blade still shining, but when put into the sheath only its black handle showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to tiredness and now having to look back at a being that was emanating light, Will rubbed his eyes, not recogising his hands were now covered with soot. The soot smudged his face, darkening his eyelids to a smokey black and thickening his eyelashes making them darker and more vibrant. In taking his hands back down, Will noticed the soot and knelt to rinse them in the pool (thinking too late that the being might object). With his hands clean again, but his nails no less shiny, he stood up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being faced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSOME DAY YOU MAY REDEEM YOURSELF, BUT UNTIL THEN THIS SHALL ALWAYS REMIND YOU OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the being vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill blinked in the now near pitch darkness. As he waited for his eyes to adjust he let everything sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed. He was now marked with the blood of the man he killed, and the being was right, it would remind him everytime he looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down, Will picked up the cloak that he'd left by the lake, thankful that it indeed was a cloak and large and covering. It was also jet black and Will had trouble remembering if it was always this colour (it would work for stealth in the dark, something a bandit might like) or it had also been changed when his belt and Janbiya had been. Either way, Will donned the cloak letting it drape around his body, hitching it closed around his neck and pulling up the hood. It covered up all his redness with some exceptions: his red boots that peeked out; the red that peeked through the long slit in the cloak's front (which Will tried to keep closed with his hands from inside); and, unknown to Will, his luscious red lips that shone out from a face that also held his smokey, long lashed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurtively it seemed, Will looked back and forth, eyes darting under his dark lashes, than grabbed up the bag and and with his cloak flowing out behind him, he quickly stumbled back to the camp.</span></div></div>",

Indeed, Kevin was sitting there, head bowed as the light from illuminated the edge of his face. Will was relieved to see two bedrolls unfurled beside the fire, Kevin's forward thinking again, and Will decided to do nothing other than move directly for his bedroll and get to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the noise of his approach, Kevin suddenly looked up. \"Ah, you're back. I was worried...\" Kevin suddenly broke off, starting at Will's face. Will quickly pulled the cloak around himself tighter and jumped into his bedroll, cloak and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" Kevin said, but Will rolled to face away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence lasted a little longer, only the fire crackling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally I'd leave this on tomorrow, or not at all,\" Kevin began, \"but we are on a quest together and need to be able to rely on eachother. I've heard it said that it's best to resolve arguments before the sun sets, and while the sun is already down, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you want out of this... relationship between us. I took you on as a companion in our shared quest to end the dragon's reign. I sensed you had some dispute with the dragon, but it was your strength of will that impressed me. You've since proven worthy, far more worthy than I imagined, to be part of such a vital quest as this one, and more to the point, I am indebted to you for rescuing me. Few have supported me as you have done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill continued looking away, but took in every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I feel that something deeper is developing between us. I don't know how you feel about me. Maybe you don't care at all or maybe you care a great deal. I understand that it is sometimes hard to know ones own feelings, yet other times they are certain. I just want you to know, that I am happy with whatever feelings you have. They are your feelings and your decision on what to do with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this stage Kevin had walked a few steps and crouched just behind Will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to know you more, I would like to find out what drives you, what makes you who you are. But those are just my desires. I respect you. If we go forth and kill the dragon, and in the end you smile and turn away, never to see me again, I will be accept that. You have no obligation to do more, however much I would like there to be more. But I want you to know that whatever path our relationship goes down, whatever misteps or mistake or misunderstandings we may encounter, I will always respect you as a warrior and adventurer. That will always be the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt these last words, Will rolled over a bit and looked up at Kevin, his blue eyes, broad shoulders (less broad than normal without the armour), his earnest yet well defined face, his expression of earnest concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it all in, Will felt he could do nothing other than smile broadly. A smile accented by his ruby red lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe film of concern over Kevin's face broke, and a smile broadened his face. \"Thank you,\" he said, and leaning forward he kissed Will gently on the forehead. Then he got up and, with the occasional glance at Will to ensure everything was okay, he retired to his bedroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was surprised at the kiss, were all knights this emotional? Still, as he said, it was good to deal with this stuff before going to bed. More relevantly, Will's guilt had been blown away by Kevin's show of confidence in him, and his concern over his well being. He thought more about Kevin as his somewhat confused words swam in his head, while he couldn't quite figure out the form, maybe there was more they could gain from eachother.<br>\r\nSmiling again, Will rolled onto his back, and sleep hit him faster than he could expect.</span></div></div>",

The trees thinned somewhat and at one point they rode along the side of the lake, before returning to the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Will rode his own horse, or more specifically the bandit's horse. While he assumed this would be comfortable, the skirt of his deep red long sleeved garment didn't work well with the saddle. It thankfully wasn't as long as its previous length so he could still ride astride, but it was hard to ensure that everything was covered. Fortunately wearing the cloak covered up what was needed so Will had the cloak wrapped around him. Since his (nail-polished) hands with the reigns went through the slit in the front of his cloak, he kept his arms close to his body and his hands together to ensure the slit remained narrow. The effect made him look like a prim and inexperienced horse rider, daintily guiding their horse along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the cloak covered most of his body, it rarely covered his red boots in the stirrup, and even with the hood up, Will's red lips and wisps of long black hair could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth riders seemed in good spirits, Kevin pointing out the odd landmark or making a remark about his life, Will smiling and nodding at his remarks, Kevin seemingly heartened by Will's responses. Will felt that in the short time they'd know eachother, they almost seemed like good friends. As they trotted up and down hills and under the the dappled sunlight of the leaves, he felt he could trust Kevin, maybe even more than many he'd known his entire life. Then Kevin cracked a joke and Will bent over in a fit silent laughter, Kevin beaming at this response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went on, the warmth both in the air and between them grew. It seemed idyllic, like dragons existed in another universe altogether.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As it came closer, they could make out a plump man on a donkey that seemed overburdened with large saddle bags. While they moved aside to give him berth, he seemed to give them a lot of attention, particularly Will, and as they passed by he turned  his donkey around and trotted along side the pair, with Will closest to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morrow,\" he called, \"rarely see such individuals as yourselves in this part of the country, what brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Killing a dragon,\"  said Kevin deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all due respect to the merchant, he didn't miss a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh You'll need all sorts of things for that: Dragons bane, dragonspear, got any flame resistant potions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not buying anything,\" said Kevin with a snap to his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I suppose  you speak for both of you.\" He turned and put the full force of his energies towards a Will. \"And is there something you would like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was a little surprised to have been pitched to so suddenly, but was a little curious as to what the merchant had. The merchant quickly picked up on this and with a smile he opened a side of his jacket. \"I think I know what you want,\" and with that he took out a ring from his inside pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill stared at the ring, it had a bright red stone set into it that flashed his mind back to the events of the pond. Wondering if this was some sort of sign, Will  reached for the ring, and found the merchant grabbing his wrist slipping the ring on his middle finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it suits you,\" said the merchant quickly pulling his hands back.  Will Was struck by how the bright red stone matched his nails. \"For such beauty, it would break my heart to charge full price. For you, only 20 coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stoats head it's worth that much,\" said Kevin uncharacteristically hostile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's valuable, it is.  I swear on my life. The stone comes from the distant land off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"15 coin,  and if you try to split the difference, I'll have Lord Denham perform the most viscous tax audit on you that the world has ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, 15 it is then, but only,\" with a. wink at Will, \"because it would be wasted on anybody else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin  moved his horse back and then forward between the merchant and Will, then quickly gave the payment. With a wave he seemed to dispatch the merchant although the merchant continued in the same direction if a bit further from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill blinked, he hadn't even been sure if he wanted the ring and now he owned it.  What's more, Kevin had bought it for him.  He didn't understand it, but there was no returning it now.  If he could talk he would ask why, but for now he had no choice but to go along with it. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The merchant now seemed to be travelling alongside them, effectively going back in the direction he'd come from. He tried to strike a conversation with Kevin, but was met with stony silence. Will wondered if Kevin had something against travelling merchants. They could be tricky, and outright deceptive in trying to sell you something... be it some potion with allegedly miraculous properties, or some piece of clothing which.... clothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill could have hit himself, the merchant could have some good clothing in those big saddlebags. Casually he took a hand off the reigns and felt the smooth, glistening fabric under his cloak. Something more appropriate than this, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to the merchant, but Kevin was largely blocking the view. He could try signalling or... no, it was best to wait for the next time they stopped, if they merchant was still there by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was. As they rode on he'd comment on some of the local area or make a small anecdote, with Kevin not responding and Will being unable to. Yet he continued by their side, as the forest seemed to close in and the track they followed got a bit rougher. Will honestly thought Kevin should have asked the merchant for more information, he had come from where they were going after all, but Kevin seemed tight lipped and just stared ahead with the occasional glance to his right to check on Will (and no glances to his left).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they came across a cabin on the right side of their trail, alongside a small brook. As they passed by, a hunter came out the door, and upon greeting them asked if they would not stop for a brief rest. Kevin gladly accepted, Will was thankful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill found the hunter quickly moving to help him down from the horse. Will smiled a ruby red smile at him, the people in this region <i>were</i> very friendly. He settled them down at a wooden picnic table in the dappled sunshine, the merchant eagerly grapping a position at the table, and Kevin brining some food supplies, though with a glare implying that the merchant would have to bring his own (which he did). The hunter returned with a jug of water from the book, and soon a small repast was prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what brings you to these parts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We, that is to say the two of us,\" he said indicating himself and Will, \"are on a quest to kill the Black Dragon and restore safety to the surrounding lands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunter chewed thoughtfully. \"So what's its hide strenth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hide strenth. How thick is its skin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do not know, it's possibly reinforced by magics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where does it eat? Drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Presumably close to the cave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where abouts would it hunt for its food? What are its watering holes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, we can scout the area when we get the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weapons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, swords of course, I may have to get a lance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And is that how you plan to kill it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we shall see when we arrive at the dragon's cave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunter shook his head, \"You can't hunt a rabbit without knowing what you're doing, how do you intend to hunt a dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin raised his voice, \"I am of the authority of Lord Denham, this is a decision we make for the safety of our domain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen many like you. You come up thinking you can defeat the dragon, receive riches and glory, when you really haven't the tiniest clue what you're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not doing this for riches or glory, we're doing this for protection. Down the road, not two days from here, is a village that has been ravaged by the Black Dragon. Lives destroyed, buildings in flames, the whole village taking shelter in a nearby cave. Now tell me, should we just nod our heads and let such a thing continue to happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunter was silent for amoment. \"There are ways to help them other than killing the dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not many other ways of ensuring it doesn't happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence rose again, an awkward tension lingered in the air. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can assure you, while you make some valid points, our course is already set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just....,\" the hunter sighed, \"I've seen too many, I don't want to see more people walking towards their deaths.\" He looked towards Will for this last bit, \"The knight I understand, but you? Don't you want to spend your life in a way other than this?\" Will was taken aback, but quickly recovered and set his lips in a thin line. While the hunter had a point, he'd known Will far to little to be able to judge his choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do understand, but perhaps it would be more helpful if you could use your experience to give us advice, rather than dissuade us from doing what we set out to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Advice? I don't know, I've never hunted a dragon. The usual I suppose? Know your quarry, figure where its weakest, choose your weapon, end it as fast as you can. But it takes more than that, it takes skill and experience, you need to build that up over time. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're not interested in joining us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunter laughed nervously, \"I erm, I see maybe you will have enough to defeat the dragon by yourselves after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence fell again, and the meal continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were wrapping up, the merchant spoke up for the first time. \"I say, do you have any furs or leathers you're looking to sell. I assume all your hunting is done locally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I already have person who sells my furs in the market, but if you can offer a good price...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll need to see their quality first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they're right this way.\" And the two men disappeared into the cabin. The exchange quickly reminded will that he meant to ask the merchant about clothes.</span></div></div>",

The two men were already talking by an open chest of furs and looked up to see Will when he entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is going to be tricky without being able to speak</i>, thought Will, but the men looked intently at Will, waiting for Will to speak. Will pointed at the fur, and then pinched his own clothes. As quick explanation he took some coins from the belt pouch and held them out while still indicating the clothes he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunter seemed to smile. \"I'm sorry,' he said indicating the furs, \"these are just pelts, I imagine you're looking for something more... tailored?\" Will nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe merchant spoke up \"I may have just what you're looking for, any particular item you need?\" Will gestured towards his body in general. He opened his cloak and the two men gazed at the blazing red outfit he was wearing. Will figured they wanted to get a good idea of the clothing he wanted to change so he turned a bit back and forth to give them a better look, their eyes locked onto his shape beneath the cloak as it moved, taking in every little detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Kevin opened the door, Will let the cloak drop. \"Am I interrupting something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe merchant huffed, \"Yes, it's fine. I just need some time with Rose here, we're discussing clothing.\" Will nodded while absent mindedly touching the still-fresh rose in his hair, once again it was giving him a nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to talk to you about the terrain up ahead, local knowledge would be helpful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he lives in this area, I'm just passing through. And while you're discussing do you mind leaving us two alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSudden silence, both the hunter and Kevin unsure how to respond. Will suddenly found they were both looking at him. Deciding his clothing really needed to be cleared up, he nodded to them that he agreed with the merchant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" replied Kevin, \"we'll be outside, very close outside,\" and with that Kevin and the hunter went out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, the merchant turned to Will. \"Now, I may need to take measurements.\" Will nodded and led his cloak drop to the ground. The merchant beamed an enthusiastic smile. It was nice, thought Will, to see someone who liked their job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a length of tape, the merchant went up to Will and gave him the most thorough measuring session he'd even been through. Smoothing the tape against him with his hand, the merchant measured his outside leg, his inside leg (stopped short by the skirt), his waist, his chest. Each time stroking the fabric gently and Will's body beneath. His arms, his hips, his thighs, his calves. At one stage the merchant looked Will straight in the face and said \"We must find something to go with those beautiful eyes.\" Will raised his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe merchant resumed and turned Will to face away from him, draping the tape around in front of him while fixing it from behind. While waiting, Will felt the merchants arm move around him to the front of his midsection, and the merchant leaned in close from behind. \"Why don't you come with me?\" the merchant whispered into Will's ear, pressing against him, \"I'm off to the capital of fashion, I can find you all the great pieces of clothing you want, all the styles and fabrics you could imagine.\" Will frowned in confusion, what exactly did this merchant... but in an instant the merchant was off of him, returning to his measuring like nothing happened. For a second Will wasn't sure if he'd imagined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms, forearms, wrists, the merchant caressing each part as he took the measurement, but soon he seemed to wind down. \"Well, that's enough for now, I'm sure I can find something that would be perfect, if you trust my judgement.\" Will nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the tape away, the merchant and Will went back outside. True to his word, Kevin had been standing very close to the door, though clearly talking to hunter who was standing close by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything go okay?\" Kevin asked, nodding towards Will. Will just nodded, whatever the merchant was at, at least he'd be getting new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Adderlay is upriver, and I came the southern route.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin nodded and looked toward Will. \"Rose I... I know the dragon is... you want to defeat the dragon, just like I do, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just... we may have to.. it may be an idea to take a diversion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill nodded, slightly concerned, but trusting there was a good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEncouraged by this, Kevin went on. \"There's a snake terrorising Adderlay, a giant snake apparently. We don't know how big or serious it is, but there have been deaths, and apparently many are afraid to leave their homes.\" Will nodded. \"Normally, it would be my immediate duty to help them, were it not for my current duty to protect people from the dragon.\" Will couldn't help but smile at this, Kevin was so earnest in taking feeling responsible for so many things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdderlay is somewhat on the way to the dragon's lair, but it's still quite a detour, not to mention the time it would take dealing with the snake. Being closer to the lair, the town may have some way to prepare us for tackling the dragon, but as it is a standard logging village we should not be certain of that. And so this is the decision we must make: primarily deal with the dragon, or detour to deal with the snake, and deal with the dragon as soon as we can after that.\"</span></div></div>",

But then again, isn't that what he wanted, what prompted him to go with Kevin back at that village? An image of the decimated village sprung to his mind and then of the smiling faces of the villagers who were so nice to him, the little girl with her smile and bracelet. Then suddenly, an image of the bandits and everything faded to blood red. Will tried to shake his mind of those thoughts, and then looked up to Kevin. Into those blue eyes.

The bright red garment that covered his upper body and arms, and the tubes of red fabric that still clung to his legs... Thankfully people seemed pretty open to different clothing styles. Maybe he should worry less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the red couldn't help but remind Will of the events that led to the colour in the first place... He shook his head.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Will gradually became aware of the webbing surrounding him.  But, as he began to panic, he felt give in the spider's silk and heard a crackling sound.  The webbing had hardened into a cocoon, but now seemed brittle like old bread and he found it breaking as he pushed against it.   He felt odd as he worked himself free; his body was moving in odd ways.  But he kept peeling the layers of silk from himself until he was fully free and stood beside the bed in a slowing disintegrating pile of dust.  He looked down at himself to see of anything was still attached, and gaped at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, his brain couldn't process the sight before him.  He'd seen breasts before, but never from this angle.  Stupefied he wondered whose they were until his fair fell down around his face.  No longer the wavy dark hair he'd had before, it was now a golden blond and hung down as long as his waist.  He grasped it and pulled, only then realizing it was his own, attached to his head.  He gasped in shock and then froze as the sound was like nothing he'd heard from his throat before.  He tentatively said \"hello?\" and the beautiful soprano voice was one that he would eagerly have followed and offered whatever help he could, but to hear it coming from himself was frightening. He padded carefully to the mirror, unwilling to believe what he would see there.  But a moment's look was all it took to confirm his worst fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReflected in the mirror was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.  She stood completely naked, her ripe body open to his questing eyes.  Her golden hair streamed over her naked shoulders.  Her wide, blue eyes darted back and forth as he took in the sight before him.  Her mouth was an enticing bow that gaped open in shock.  Her breasts, slightly hidden behind her flowing locks, heaved as he felt himself beginning to hyperventilate.  Her body was a study in curves and between her legs a thin patch of golden hair hinted at greater treasures within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be!\" Will whispered in his new voice.  His hands came up to cup his new breasts.  Any doubt that they were real and his was quickly dashed when an errant finger stroked over one nipple, causing a feeling like lightning to shoot through him and come to rest in his moistening groin.  His curiosity overriding his better judgment, he allowed one hand to fall between his legs and explore.  The dampness he found there only increased as he spread the folds of his new vagina and, not fully conscious of having decided to, began to stroke back and forth.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze traveled back to the maiden in the mirror.  She was fondling herself, staring into his eyes, and he heard the slight gasps and moans he knew to come from a woman in heat.  The sights and sounds only fueled his own growing arousal and he saw her expression becoming more and more wanton as the motion of the hand between her legs increased and the other began kneading her breasts in increasing desperation.  Pleasure such as he'd never known before coursed through his body and clouded his mind.  His knees gave out and he fell backwards onto the bed, his hands not stopping on their quest to bring him to a femininely alien orgasm.  His moans increased.  \"Yessss...   oooooohhhhh yyyYYEESSSS!!\"  He was right at the precipice when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the door to his room click shut.  His eyes flew open and he sat up in a panic.  Standing by the door, evidently having entered and closed the door behind him, was a strange man.   The man was clearly some kind of barbarian warrior, well muscled and clad only in a metal codpiece held on with leather straps.  He looked at Will hungrily and Will felt a strange bifurcation in his thoughts and part of his mind tried desperately to think of an escape while the other admired the well-crafted sample of masculinity with a matching hunger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Will's warring psyche could reach a consensus, the stranger crossed the room in a few powerful steps and joined Will on the bed.  His hairy, muscular arms encircled the feminized adventurer and his mouth found Will's in a passionate kiss.  Will's brain was spinning out of control.  His tongue danced against the stranger's.  His breasts were crushed against hard pectorals.  He felt the barbarian's fingers teasing between the folds of his pussy and was powerless as his traitorous legs spread wide to allow easier access.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Will's involuntary desire built, the man expertly maneuvered himself above the prone beauty. Will's legs were still spread wide and inviting to the man's now visible erect penis.  (The codpiece had disappeared somewhere along the line, and Will was in no position to worry about that now.)  Will's mind was adrift in a tumultuous ocean of feminine sensations.  His floundering masculinity struggled to find something, anything that would stop what was to come.  As he felt the head of the man's rod start to part his drooling folds, he tried with all his might to cry out \"Please stop!  I'm not a woman!  I'm a man!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all that came out, in a beautiful gasp was \"please....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the barbarian's cock slid home, Will was overcome. Sensations he did not know could exist crashed through him.  His lungs seemed to seize up, his back arched, his eyes rolled up into his head.  It felt like the universe had turned into pink bubbles and they were all washing over him, through him, so that the only solid thing in existence was the steely rod spearing him in his most sensitive spot.  He gasped for air.  His hands clutched at the back of his lover, trying to find some sort of handhold that would keep him from shooting off into infinity.  His legs, through no conscious design of his own, had wrapped themselves around the barbarian's waist and were urging the fucking onward.   He heard a woman crying out \"Yes!  YEESSS!!! HARDER!! FUCK ME! FUCK ME!!! FFFFUUUUUUUCCKKK MMEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!\"  And was only slightly surprised to realize it was his own voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man needed no encouragement and continued to rock against Will's soft body.  Will's cries peaked again as another orgasm shattered his world.  What was left of his male mind, horribly trapped in this body that craved only cock, seemed almost like an observer: unable to stop what was happening yet was the only rational part left.  He was fully aware of the stranger's masculine scent with each gasping breath.  He felt the sweat beading on both their bodies.    Will's rock hard nipples were stroked back and forth against the man's hairy chest.  The man's pelvic bone ground against his clit with each thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the rhythm of the thrusts increased. Will knew what that meant, and struggled in his horny prison.  He couldn't let this happen!  Despite everything, we was still a man!  But if that stranger shot his seed deep into Will's womb there was no telling what it would do to him.  His will to resist the changes forced on him might be broken forever!  He'd be addicted to cock, spending his life in feminine frippery hoping for a big, strong man to have his way with him!  He managed to wriggle a bit and hold back his female voice that he knew wanted to beg for the man's seed.  But it was hopeless.  They were both at the precipice, and Will realized that the orgasms he'd felt before were nothing: rocks skipping over water compared to the cannonball splash that threatened to consume him now.  His partner gave one last thrust and Will had just enough rationality left to feel the warm cum flood inside him before his own orgasm towered over him like a tidal wave, and just as it crashed down....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill woke up.</span></div></div>",

I'll leave you to soak for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was left alone as the treated water hissed around him.  His head was propped on the edge of the trough.  He could feel the silken prison starting to loosen and wriggled against its restraint.  As he did so, he felt the strands dissolve.  Happily, he cupped some of the water in his hands and rubbed it on the webbing covering his neck and lower face.  He climbed out of the water and looked down at himself.</span></div></div>",

While one maid ensured her legs were still smooth and clean, another slid the white heels back onto her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the princess seemed to fall asleep as they worked, the gentle brushing of her dark hair lulling her in the chair.

This swelling in his chest...he couldn't explain it. He had just met her...he barely knew her... Her beautiful, dark hair alighted with a single, delicate rise...

Ring or no ring, he knew that he was still a guy's guy like he had always been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he suddenly heard a knock at the door. He opened the door and saw a middle-aged man standing there. He was wearing a suit and thick glasses. He give a quick bow and said, \"Greetings, my name is Chester A. Wilkinson, head of the neighborhood committee. Might I come in for a brief moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid wondered why the committee head would be at his house. Had he done something to offend someone in the neighborhood already? \"Sure, come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Wilkinson came into the living room and sat on the couch. \"Well, I just wanted to come over on behalf of the committee to apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was surprised. \"Apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Wilkinson turned to face him. \"Yes, Mrs. Johnson. You see, when you and your daughter first arrived here, all of the committee members thought that you were a man. But then today we saw the ladies wedding ring on your finger and we realized our mistake. The fact that you are wearing that shows you can't be anything other than a woman, and we all sincerely apologize for this grave error.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but, but...\" David stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, there is no need to do anything Mrs. Johnson. Rest assured that from now on we are going to treat you as the woman you are. We have changed our records to show that a woman and her daughter now live in this house. Now there is no worry of anyone here mistaking you for a man again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...well...you see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look at the time!\" Mr. Wilkinson says looking at his watch, \"I've got a million more people to speak with today. I just wanted to assure you we have had that problem resolved. Hope you have a pleasant day ma'am!\" And with that final word Mr. Wilkinson quickly got up and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's head was spinning. What just happened?</span></div></div>",

The event still left it's mark on him, however. After he parked he looked at his hand that was resting on the steering wheel and at the ring on his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could a ring possibly be the thing that convinced that guy that I was a woman...that is just ridiculous isn't it?\u201d David said to no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out of his car and popped the trunk to retrieve his groceries. He made his first trip into the house and placed the bags on the table before returning back to his car. It was on his return to the house that he caught his reflection in the window of his car. He looked at himself and noticed that his hair had come out from his business ponytail. Normally he kept it back while he was doing errands but that was no longer the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't notice that it came undone. I guess my last hair-tie broke,\u201d he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed the last bags on the ground and started playing with his hair a bit until he noticed someone behind him in the window's reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEep!\u201d he cried in surprise as he turned to face an old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I'm sorry dear. I didn't didn't mean to startle you. I was just coming over to say hello. You and your daughter just moved in the other day?\u201d the old woman asked kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yes, we did,\u201d David said while he calmed back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, please speak up. My ears aren't what they used to be,\u201d she said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES, WE DID,\u201d David loudly confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh good. I think you two will like it here. It's a nice place with plenty to keep a young lady entertained,\u201d She said catching eye of the wedding ring on David's finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my daughter will be happy to hear that,\u201d not realizing whose she was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman took his hand into hers without hesitation or awareness of personal boundaries. She retrieved her glasses dangling from the collar of her dress and put them onto the end of her nose. She tilted her head to an exaggerated angle as she held his fingers. David was at a loss for words as this strange lady held his hand in a girly position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a beautiful ring. I didn't realize you were married,\u201d she said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. It was my wife's but she is no longer with us,\u201d he explained wanting this exchange to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHERE WAS A LOSS IN OU FAMILY TWO YEARS AGO,\u201d he stated louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I'm sorry to hear that,\u201d she replied with sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his hand back and picked up his groceries. He smiled and shrugged just wanting to get away. The woman took the hint and smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I'll get out of your hair. If you need anything, I'm just next door,\u201d she said heading back to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. Have a nice day,\u201d he told her while entering his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman headed back to her house and thought to herself, \u201cI should tell my grandson about her. With a little bit of attention I'm sure she could be quite pretty. Two years is surly enough time for a young woman to grieve.\u201d</span></div></div>",

For a moment he almost expected the cashier to say something, but he didn't. David assumed that the cashier was only thinking about when he was going to take his next break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid loaded the groceries into his car and drove home. He was able to get home reasonably quickly. As he took his groceries from the car, he realized that Sarah was going to be gone for the next couple of days at least. She was running out to meet some of her friends to go camping. She said that they would only be gone for a couple of day, but he knew she would soon call and try to extend that. And like a sap he would give in. What can he say, he just wanted her to be happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished putting away the groceries and sat down on the couch. He was feeling tried for some reason. He wasn't on the couch for long before nodding himself to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he found himself in the bedroom of his old house. He looked around and saw Valerie sitting in front of your vanity, brushing her hair. She looked like she was dressed for a casual day out. She was wearing a nice denim dress:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{link:http://www.chicos.com/Product_Images/570177066_657_large.jpg?resize=10 00px:*&amp;output-quality=85}<br>\r\n<br>\r\npaired with flat metallic sandals:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{link:http://s7.jjill.com/is/image/JJill/062991_900?$pdp_main$}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he glazed at the wonderful form of his beloved, David was suddenly hit by a blinding flash of light. Suddenly, he was sitting at Valerie's vanity. He looked around the room for her, but she had vanished. Then he looked in the mirror and was shocked. His beard was gone and his eyebrows where now thin and slightly arched. His hair was now almost shoulder length, with bangs and light brown curls. He had on hoop earnings and had light makeup applied to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw that the hairbrush was in his hand, and his fingernails now sported light pink acrylic tips. He looked down and saw that he was now wearing the dress that Valerie had on, and he was able to fee the sensation of a bra and panties underneath. He looked at the ground and saw his now pink toenails peeking out of the sandals his wife was just wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he woke up with a jolt. He looked around and was still on the couch, and was still wearing what he had fallen asleep in. What a weird dream, he thought. What was strange was that for some reason, the dream felt kinda nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tried to think why he would have a dream like that, but couldn't think of anything. It must just be one of those dreams that don't make any sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, no use spending the whole day worrying about it. He knew he needed to get some errands done. He had been putting off cleaning the attic for some time now, and he might as well do it know rather than put it off forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid went upstairs to the attic and turned on the light. A mess greeted him. Boxes where littered all around the attic along with miscellaneous loose items sprinkled all over. He remembered how he was so tried moving that he basically threw all of this stuff up here with no sense of organization. He really wasn't thinking ahead when he did that. He decided not to look in any of the boxes that day and just try to get all the loose crap of the ground and try to give the place some sense of order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning up the attic: Rearranging the boxes, throwing all of the loose items into a new box, throwing away any trash, and sweeping and dusting the place. It was more work than he thought, but he did feel some pride as he was doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was finishing up, he suddenly noticed something thin and small underneath one of the boxes. He bent down to pick it up and was astonished at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his hand was Valerie's old drivers license. He couldn't believe it was up here, he just assumed he had thrown it away. According to the front, it was still good for a couple of years before it had to be renewed. He grimaced at the photo. It was a typical drivers license photo that was quite blurry. Her face wasn't completely clear, but that was good enough as an ID. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized that it was probably still active. When she died he kept putting off calling the DMV to cancel the card because he just couldn't bring himself to tell them. Since it wasn't being used he figured it didn't matter. Well, might as well keep this for now, he thought. He opened his wallet and put it in one of the empty pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished his cleaning and went downstairs, wondering what else there was to do.</span></div></div>",

He shrugged inwardly and tossed the broken hair-tie into a near by trash can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked in the jewelry shop and started looking around not really knowing what his daughter would like. He felt another wave of sadness hit him as he realized his wife would know what to get if she were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, can I help you?\" A man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeep,\" David squeaked not hearing the man approach.

He could definitely see himself doing some more business with that place in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to head back to his car when he noticed something. One of the stores that he thought was closed was now apparently open. It must have opened while he was in the jewelry store, he reasoned. He decided to go and have a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the window, he saw that it was a women's shoe store. The shelves were full of all types of women's shows, from sneakers to boots, from heels to sandals. He also saw that they were having a grand opening sale. Wow, they must be having some good deals now with that sale. Too bad they didn't sell any men's shoes, he thought. He had been needing a new pair of sneakers for a while now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he suddenly thought of something. He new that thanks to him trying on Valerie's heels that he had her shoe size in women's. He knew what size of shoes to get. Yes, it was a women's shoe store, but there really isn't much difference between men's and women's sneakers. He decided that while he was here, he might as well take advantage of the sale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into the store and was greeted by a young saleslady named Megan. \"Good afternoon, can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes,\" David replied, feeling  comfortable with this young girl. \"I noticed that you are having an opening sale, and I wanted to buy a new pair of sneakers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course. Do you have any particular pair in mind?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, not really. Can you just bring out a pair that you would think is nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. What's your size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid told her Valerie's shoe size and Megan went to the back. A few moments later she returned with a pair of white sneakers. I think these are really nice. They are Reebok Princess sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{link<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.reebok.com/dwstatic/sits_pod27/dw/image/v2/AAJP_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-reebok-products/en_US/dw51dd295a/zoom/1475_01.jpg?sw=550&amp;sfrm=jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.reebok.com/dwstatic/sits_pod2...</a>}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the name they were plain white sneakers and they fit David pretty well. They were also very comfortable to walk in. David decided to buy them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to the counter and Megan rang up the shoes for him. She then asked if she could get his ID to put in their system to notify them of future promotions. Once again he accidentally gave Valerie's ID, which Megan entered into the system. \"Have a good day.\" she said as David left the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, that was nice, David thought. I might have to come back to this place as well in the future. He got back into his car and drove off.</span></div></div>",

He got some comfortable new sneakers for himself and a locket for his daugher. In didn't matter what gender they were for, they were the most comfortable shoes he had worn for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened up the jewelry box and took out the locket. It was a gold heart shaped locket that twinkled in the light. It looked so beautiful to him. He was sure Sarah would like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked up to her room to leave it there, he felt kind of cheated that only a few stores were open at that strip mall. He had hoped to spend several hours there, but he barely stayed one. It wasn't the worst thing in the world, but he had nothing to do for the next few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered Sarah's room and placed the locket box on her desk. He was about to leave when he looked in her closet. Suddenly a thought came in his head. He didn't know where it came from, but for some reason it intrigued him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHim and Sarah were about the same height and the same build. He had nothing to do for the next few hours. Sarah wouldn't be back for some time. Since he had nothing better to do, why not try something new? Why not dress up in some of Sarah's clothes and pretend to be her for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe he was thinking about this, but for some reason the idea of spending the day as a teenage girl sounded like fun. Could he do it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was when the rain started to fall that he felt his car jerk. He didn't have to look to know that something hand gone horribly wrong. He quickly pulled over and got out to see the damage. As water streaked his face he popped open the hood. A crack of thunder made him flinch, putting an exclamation point on the scene in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at the engine while the rain chilled him to the bone. His wet clothes lay close to his skin, soaked and left him uncomfortable. He did his best but he just couldn't seem to manage figuring out what was wrong. He was bent over the car, his pants tight from the water, when he heard a truck pull up behind him. He looked over his shoulder and saw a large man get out of a tow truck and rush over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like some help?\" He said in a rich baritone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please. That would be-\" He started to say but found himself stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's eyes were a deep blue that pierced into him. He never seen a blue like that and it took him a moment to recover. The man asked where he was headed and David told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually live in that neighborhood. How about I give you a tow?\" the man offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, I really appreciate it,\" David said in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and dry off in the truck, I'll join you in a second,\" He told David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid got in the passenger side and was immediately thankful for the heater. David leaned back, completely exhausted. He rested there as his clothes dried out and the man hooked up his car. His eyes grew heavy as he waited for the man to come back and was hardly aware what was happening to his clothes. As they dried, they grew tighter on him at different angles causing a feminine effect on his frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the man came back, David was asleep. The man smiled at the sleep form of the woman he thought he rescued.</span></div></div>",

He always enjoyed being able to help a lady out in her time of need. He drove to the address she had given him. It wasn't too far away from where he lived. Strange, though, he thought he heard something saying that a man and his teen daughter had just moved here. But he didn't see any other cars in the driveway, nor was there any lights on in the house. Maybe the neighbor just saw the man and his daughter just looking at the house, but ultimately deciding to look elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Paul pulled to a complete stop, David suddenly woke. He noticed that they were at his house. \"I must of fallen asleep\" he said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Paul replied, \"I told you I knew the place, it was no problem to find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul parked the car in David's driveway and give him the number of a repair shop to call to talk about repairing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you make an appointment with the repair shop, call me and I'll take it down there for you\", he said handing David a business card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I most definitely will. How much for the tow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, its on me for this once. I just don't like to see someone like you in distress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thank you. I'm glad to have met you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nice you meet you too. Be careful for the rest of the night, okay?\", he said as he drove off. It was only after he left that Paul realized that he never got the young lady's name. Oh well, he thought, he'll just have to wait till she called tomorrow. He was already looking forward to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the house, David was walking to the front door. Wow, Paul was sure a nice guy, he thought. He seems like someone he could easily become good friends with. Maybe he'd ask him later if they wanted to watch the football game on Sunday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered his house, he drew his attention to his damp clothes. He wanted to do nothing but to get out of them and put on something clean and fresh. He remembered that before he left he had out a load of clothes in the dryer. He ran over to it and without really looking, he reached inside and pulled out a hooded sweatshirt and pair of sweatpants. He didn't care what they looked like, he just wanted to get out of those damp clothes ASAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stripped off the clothes he was wearing and quickly put on the sweatshirt and sweatpants. It wasn't until he fully had the sweatshirt over his had that he realized exactly what he was wearing. Both the shirt and pants were completely pink. Well, actually, not completely- the sweatpants had the word \"PINK\" written on the butt in gold lettering:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://d2ydh70d4b5xgv.cloudfront.net/images/f/b/victoria-s-secret-pink-bling-sweatsuit-hoodie-jacket-lot-sequin-set-m-l-pants-vs-4e4bb0cfedc8e6ac9738c4708d0ffdb8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://d2ydh70d4b5xgv.cloudfront.net/images/f/b/victoria-s-secret-pink-bling-swe...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for crying out loud!\" David muttered to himself. He knew what had happened. Sometimes when Sarah knew David was going to be doing laundry, she would mix her dirty clothes with his so she wouldn't have to wash it herself. She must have done that before she left for the trip. It always annoyed David when she would do that. He wanted her to wash her own clothes so that she wouldn't be helpless whenever she was on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he already had them on, so he might as well just wear them for the rest of the night. He headed over to the couch to watch some TV. Well, he, thought, at least these clothes are comfortable. Luckily, just like him and Valerie, him and Sarah were at the moment both at the same height, and had similar body builds.</span></div></div>",

He called up the repair shop and told them what happened with the car and that Paul said to call them. Telling them Paul's name ended up giving him David a discount. What luck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile on the phone he found his hair was getting a little annoying without his hair tie. He tossing to to the side when he stopped in front of his daughter's room. From where he was standing he had a clear view of her vanity. He walked into her room as they put him on hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could clearly see a pink scrunchy that his daughter would use some time. He thought, what the hell, he was already wearing pink and it would do the job. He put down the phone and picked up the scrunchy. He was about to put it in his hair like normal but then he heard a voice on the receiver again. Quickly he put his hair back and picked up the phone, walking out of the room. In his haste, his hair was tied back much higher than he would normally have it, It swayed bac and forth as he walked like it would on Valerie or Sarah but he didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he set up the time he called back Paul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Paul, it's the person you helped out today,\" David told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Did you get a hold of Earl?\" Paul asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did. He said for me to come in at 3:30 tomorrow,\" David explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. I'll swing by tomorrow and I can take you and your car over there,\" he said with a smile in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are too nice, Paul. Say, are you free Sunday? I'd love to have you over,\" David told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great. I'll clear my schedule,\" He said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, good. I'll let you go for now. You have a nice night,\" David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too,\" Paul said hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. She asked <i>me </i> out on a date. Wow,\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul forgot ask what her name was so for now just put her in his phone as \"Pretty lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He guess the Victoria's Secret sweatshirt and sweatpants were more comfortable than he had thought. Well, at least I had a good night's sleep. he thought. Thank goodness there were no more strange dreams about Valerie this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to the kitchen to make himself some breakfast. Sarah hadn't called, but he knew she was to busy having fun with her friends. She probably wouldn't call until tomorrow, and would most likely ask for permission to stay a few more days. Well, as long as she is having a good time, he thought. He couldn't wait for her to find the locket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ate, he noticed that the mailman had come and delivered the mail. He was about to go outside to the mailbox when he remembered that the ground was still wet from all the rain last night. He didn't want to go outside in his bare feet, but he also didn't want to put on his shoes just to have to take them off a moment later. He wished he still had his trusty filp-flops. but they had finally fallen apart after years of use, and he hadn't bought a new pair yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he had a thought. Sarah had a couple pairs of flip-flops. He went to her room, hoping she didn't take all of them with her. He looked in her closet and was able to find a pair. They were black and had a pretty thick sole:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/1/4/0/0/5/5/0/webimg/485731438_tp.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/1/4/0/0/5/5/0/webimg/485731438_tp.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were obviously for women, but he didn't care. He slipped into them and found that they were a perfect fit. He shouldn't have been surprised, seeing as her father and mother had the same shoe size as well. It was strange at first to walk in them, but he became used to the feeling quickly. He walked to the mailbox and retrieved the mail. He saw that the jewelry store and shoe store were already sending himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he couldn't go anywhere due to the condition of his car, he spent the next couple of hours just lounging around at home and not really doing anything. He saw that the World Series of Poker was on and began watching it. However, once again the softness of Sarah's clothes overtook him and he once again feel asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid woke to the sound of his cell phone ringing. Realizing he feel asleep again, he saw that Paul was calling him. He answered and said, \"Hey what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where are you? I've been waiting out here for 10 minutes. We gotta go. Believe me, Earl doesn't like to be kept waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at his clock and saw that his appointment was coming up quick. \"Oh, crap! I'm sorry Paul. Let me just get dressed and I'll be out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please make it quick,\" Paul urged. \"We need to go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid jumped off the couch and headed to the laundry room. He went to the dryer again, reached in a scavenged around until he found a pair of underwear, a pair of jeans and a shirt. He pulled them out and once again saw that they belonged to Sarah. Oh well, he thought, I don't have time to look for anything else. I'll just have to wear this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her pink panties. They were from Victoria's Secret as well, and he remembered Sarah called them boyshorts. Boyshorts, he thought, well I guess that doesn't make it too girly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn1.thehunt.com/app/public/system/zine_images/10581698/original/026b2a9995014e5a0b923ad7beca33ec.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn1.thehunt.com/app/public/system/zine_images/10581698/original/026b2a99...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled them up his legs. They were comfortable but snug, and they pulled his genitals back, giving the appearance of a flat front. Next, he pulled on Sarah's skinny jeans:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fashionvip.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Dark-blue-skinny-jeans-for-girls-photo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fashionvip.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Dark-blue-skinny-jeans-for-...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey felt completely different from his regular jeans, much tighter around his hips and butt. Finally, he pulled on Sarah's striped top:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.forever21.com/images/default_750/00220783-04.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.forever21.com/images/default_750/00220783-04.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul began to honk his horn. With no other shoes near him, David slipped the thick-soled flip-flops back on. He then grabbed his wallet and phone, and went outside to meet Paul.</span></div></div>",

Damn it, he thought. I hope Paul isn't trying to get with a married woman. He had to find out her status before anything crazy happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me for asking, but are you married?\" Earl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly caught off guard by the question, David stammered, \"Well yes, I mean, I was, but there was an accident, and well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more, I'm sorry to hear about your loss.\" Earl replied. He felt bad for inadvertently bringing up the loss of this poor girl's husband. \"Believe, me, Paul knows what you are going through. He lost his wife to cancer last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I'm so sorry to hear that.\" David said. David was sorry that another man had to go through losing a wife. Maybe they would be able to comfort one another through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm sure he'll meet someone new soon,\" winking at David. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl went back to looking at the engine. It only required minor repair and shouldn't take more than a couple of hours to get the job done. Then he remembered how Paul had to drive the girl over to him. Maybe that could be a way for Paul to land her. Suddenly a plan formed in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at David. \"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the entire engine is shot. I'm going to have to go in and replace most of the major components. This is going to be a day job at least, most likely two.\" He felt bad about lying to a customer, but this would be a way to help Paul move on from his grief. If he had to drive around this girl some more, maybe something could develop between them. Anyway, he would give her another discount when the job was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid groaned when he heard that. \"Oh just great! So I'm going to be without a car during all that time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl shrugged. \"Sorry, these things just happened sometimes. But don't worry. As I said, Paul is one hell of a guy, and I'm sure he won't mind driving you around wherever you need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt a little better. It sucked being without a car, but he did want to spend some more time with Paul as he believed Paul could be a good friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me call him to pick you up.\" Earl said as he went to his office. He called Paul and told him that the car would need to be in the shop for one or two days, and that he should pick up the girl to take her home. He didn't tell him that he made up the stuff about the engine. Didn't want Paul to think that Earl thought he wasn't good with women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Paul arrive back at the garage to pick David up. \"So we meet again,\" Paul said as David climbed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again man,\" replied David, you've been a big help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. Listen, I never got your name. If I'm going to keep being your chauffeur, it would help to know it.\" said Paul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid laughed a little. \"Oh, you can just call me Davy,\" David replied, giving his nickname. Having Paul call him by his real name just sounded too formal, not like something two best buds would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, thanks.\" Davie, thought Paul. He remembered that his sister once had a friend with that name. He remembered that it was short for Davina.<br>\r\nWell, now that he know her name, it was time to make the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey listen Davie,\" he said turning to David, \"how bout before I take you home, we go somewhere at get a bite to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid replied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I've never seen you try so hard for something, maybe you might just be able to make this whole streaming thing work, Though I still think you should get atleast a part time job somewhere, I could put in a good word at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I just want to focus on this for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... well come in, come in.\" Becky says waving Eric in, leading him into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, take a seat there and First I'll do your face, explaining what I'm doing as I go... afterwards we'll wash it off, And I'll do it again, while quizzing you, then again... and on the fourth maybe fifth go through, I'll have you do it yourself while I give advice, finally, I'll leave you to do it by yourself and We'll see how you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... guess that makes sense.\" Eric agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so You shaved really close this morning like I asked, which is good, stubble would show through, We're going to start with Foundation, it'll give you a base to work from, since skin is generally kind of flawed and varies in color.\" Becky used some Foundation and you watched how she put some in areas and then would spread it out from there, something she called Contouring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next we'll do some blush and bronzer, this should help add some color to your pale face, probably why you're getting <b>\"Washed out\"</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Becky did a little bit of eye makeup, showing Eric how to do eye-shadow and eyeliner, then Mascara afterwards, the eyeliner was really hard not to twitch or blink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to tell her he probably didn't need some of this stuff, but Becky was insistent that he learn all this stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly was Lipstick, which against Eric's insistence that he really didn't need Becky showed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to add color to your face otherwise the Foundation is only going to make you look more Washed out, that's why this will help... probably, the colors accentuate your face so it shows up better on camera, now purse your lips like this...\" she made a kissing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, guess I'll trust your judgement.\" Becky coated his lips with a light pink Lipstick, while noticeable it wasn't <i><b>too</b></i> bright or noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, wth makeup on, we look even more like family... <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><i>sisters</i></font>\" she said with a slight cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up... haven't you made enough girl's jokes?\" Eric sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even close, I mean I still need to teach you how to walk in heels, and how to sit while wearing a skirt, oh how to put a bra on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugghhh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright, I'll stop, I'm only giving you a hard time Baby Bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, I only wanted to look good on Camera, not look like a girl\" Eric complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Kiddo, but like I said, I'm no Makeup expert, I don't know how to do Actor Makeup, I do know how to do... <b><i>\"girl\"</i></b> makeup<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky slowly washed it off and began again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next several hours were spent in front of Becky's Makeup table, until Finally Becky left him to do it himself., while she made dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 20 minutes of doing all his own makeup himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy with how it looked he came out to the Kitchen just as Becky Finished cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smells good\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Wow, look at you, not bad at all, You're a quick learner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly, I've been sitting in that chair for hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I spent much of my young life getting my techniques, you're pretty good in an Afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, guess that's true. Guess I had a good teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down to eat, and while eating could notice a few things, every time you're lips moved you could feel the lipstick on your lips, and once you wiped your mouth, and noticed some pink smear on your napkin, Another time you wiped your eyes for a moment only to get eyeliner in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, this stuff will take some getting used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Dinner Becky packed up a few makeup supplies to get you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the stuff You taught me with?\" noticing its all different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my good Makeup, I use all that for work and Socializing, I'm giving you the stuff I don't use, times are tight for me to you know, I can't keep giving you all my stuff... though I do have a few pairs of shoes I don't wear anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright, that's fair, and no I don't need your shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Eric got in his car, and took a look through his makeup supplies.

Be sure to subscribe if you want to make sure you can catcch my next part of my Barbie series...Good night!\" he said before signing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe makeup must have really helped because things were really starting to kick up. Not fast enough for him to make any kind of money yet, but still. What Becky had said about part time work did stick with him. She worked at a salon, so he didn't know what he would end up doing there if he did try. Maybe manning the register or cleaning the place? He pushed the thought aside for now. He did want to focus on the real work after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the Barbie shirt and looked it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you get what you ask for,\" he smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about it. It might be funny to wear it next time. That way people know he can take a joke with grace. Of course, does he really want to encourage the internet? He'd think it over and come back to it another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day he got ready to go out and get some groceries. He tossed on one of his sister's shirts and tried putting on his last pair of jeans. He was just out side when he heard a *rip*. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" he said feeling the split between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped back inside and tossed the jeans into the trash. With little other choice he went back to his sister's clothes. He  tried on a pair of \"his\" new jeans that Becky gave him. They fit, though the cut was odd at first. They hugged his thighs and his butt more than his normal pair. He felt his butt and could feel his briefs through the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt anyone would notice,\" He told himself.</span></div></div>",

You looked at best androgynous the past few months and ever since the haircut last week you've looked like a girl, and you've been out in public no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm wearing girl's clothes...\" he said embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been wearing mostly my old clothes for a week too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never a skirt!\" he moaned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok fine, but that's only different because you're making it different, right now I think you'd rather people see you as a Ericka rather than as Eric in a skirt right, well they will and so there's no reason to be embarrassed. Come on out.\" Becky said taking his hand and giving him a bit of a pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pep talk didn't particularly help but Eric got up anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the worst parts of the outfit was the low heels, there was nothing more decidedly girlish than hearing each footstep follow along with an audible click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got to work he was able to distract himself enough to almost forget how he was dressed. Until a couple of hours later he was cleaning up one of the stations, when Connie saw his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Becky would you mind taking a short break to give your sister a Manicure, her nails could use some work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric quietly groaned but was glad she couldn't see his toes or he'd end up with a pedicure as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Eric was sat down as Becky looked over his nails, filing them somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, there's not a lot I can do since you're nails are short...</span></div></div>",

He kicked off his skirt and panties, stripped off his top and wrestled with the bra before getting it unhooked and threw it on the Table across the room, tossing the rest of his clothes in a pile on a chair. He put on a Pair of Pink-d Boxers and a pair of the Padded Jeans, not having many better options, and one of Becky's Girl-cut T-shirts, which wasn't too noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave it a few minutes and before long had a bit over 20 viewers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to keep his hands slightly out of frame as he opened the Box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>'COSPLAYGIRL91'</i> sent me this, I can't wait to see what it is.\" to his annoyance he couldn't quite get the box open so he went to get a knife, and made short work of the tape, First thing he saw was some sort of Gold Halo... and then he realzed he was holding the knife in clear view of the stream, his french tipped acrylic nails in obvious view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...

He rolled over and brushed the sleep from his eyes and tried to clear his head from the post sleep fog. Elena was still asleep, her back to him. It had been a while since he shared a bed with a girl but it had never been like this. He stretched out his arms and yawned a little as he looked down at what he was wearing, and blushed. Never did he ever expect to be wearing anything like this to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the only thought to come to mind. One of his bra cups was completely flat. He realized that his packing job must have come loose as he slept. He lifted the blanket a little and felt around slowly, trying not to wake Elena as he searched for the missing toilet paper. He cold feel her start to stir as he started to panic. If she saw him as he was right then, she might start scrutinizing him. The last thing he needs is for her to realize that she invited a guy into her bed last night. He heard her yawn and begin to roll. His heart was in his throat as he finally found the missing toilet paper. He grabbed it and turned away from Elena just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did I wake you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess so. Good morning,\" he said as he fixed his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena got up and made the some coffee while Eric got changed back into the clothes he was wearing the night before. They picked up where they left of the night before and talked about everything and anything. Though they both wanted to keep hanging out, Eric had a stream planned. Once they were ready, Elena dropped Eric off at his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric walked to his door, he was spotted by a local guy. The guy was walking his dogs and waved a good morning which Eric sheepishly waved back. He couldn't get into his apartment fast enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I hope he thought I was a girl,\" he thought for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't thought about being spotted by neighbors until now. He never really talked to any of them but they knew a guy lived there. Fear hit him as he wondered if anyone else had seen him over the last few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly stripped and got a shower. His makeup had smudged somewhat over night and he washed it all way but knew he was going to have to re apply it for the stream. He cleaned up and dried off then got dressed. He put on a pair of jeans and a blouse that he thought looked okay enough. The blouse's material was cut in a way that was supposed to help create a curved silhouette. It wasn't too bad, though, so it should be fine fore the stream. He redid his make up and tied back his hair and was ready for another night of gaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She convinced him but he still agreed. Not to mention that he didn't tell Connie that he wanted it all cut off.

Then a thought popped into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if he want's to be Ericka?\" she pondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been easier to push than she expected. He even came to her for help with makeup. At work, he has been really learning how to a lot of things at the salon. Maybe he has been hiding this about himself? He has been a real natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if she should visit him and tell him that she knows. Then again, he might not take that well. Perhaps she should wait until he tells her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the walk she was still confused as to what Eric was up to. </span></div></div>",

At least his viewership when up since that was surely going to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there had been the matter of his sister. Becky was just loving humiliating him, it would seem. She always had this smug look every time she would pop over with something else he had to try or do. The \"compliments\" about how good he looked were getting old real fast. After she volunteered to sort through her old clothes for him, he swears there are less wearable items than there were before. He still can't believe he has been using the nightgown she found for him to wear to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric didn't have to wait long before having an audience to play for. He relaxed as he played, happy to have the stream. Knowing that he was making progress on his dream kept him going strong. While getting ready to sign off, in a moment of seriousness, he turned to the camera and addressed the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys. I just want to thank you all for watching. The gifts and your support have been amazing and you guys mean a lot to me. Don't mean to get overly sentimental but you all mean a lot to me,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> CosplayGirl91</b>: We love you Ericka! Your vids are the best!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric winced as he read her call him Ericka. He hoped this wasn't going to be the moment he lost a fan. But then he saw more comments follow that confused him at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ericka Boom is the best streamer out there right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the funniest girl out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are as pretty as you are talented.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis confusion turned to panic as the messages kept coming. Over and over he read comments that mentioned that he was a girl and no one corrected them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...goodnight,\" he said before quickly turning everything off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and paced the room, not believing what he read. How could this happen? How didn't he know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into the bathroom and really looked at himself and saw the girl he had been too blind to see looking back at him.</span></div></div>",

He had to keep up the lie that he was going out so Becky wouldn't think he just dressed up on his own. Of course Becky had already seen through the lie but he didn't know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled up to a store and parked the car. Eric hoped this would be over soon and made a point to tell Becky that he had to go home after this to wait for Elena. Any hope of picking up something for himself was dashed when he saw that it was a just women's fashions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he followed Becky around, she kept holding up to Eric things she thought would look cute on him. How was she not sick of this joke yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you getting?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A headache,\" he told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled but didn't push anymore. The real point of this trip was to get Ericka familiar with this store. It was a favorite of hers and she figured that once her sister was inside already, coming back would be less scary for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, Eric spotted something out of the corner of his eye. It was a purple-ish pink color and stood out in his mind. Becky wanted to try something on so she headed to the changing room which gave him time to investigate. His heels clacked loudly as he quickly minced to where he thought he saw the garment. He found it easily enough and pulled it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" he said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a one piece bathing suit and the color was perfect for widowmaker. He got out his phone and texted Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you buy anything for your widowmaker cosplay yet?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, why?\" she texted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I found something that would work,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pics?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried taking a picture but couldn't line it up. He held it up to his body like Becky had been doing to him earlier and took a selfie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's perfect! Can you grab it for me. You look spectacular today, by the way,\" she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he said ignoring the comment about his looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you find?\" he heard Becky ask from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric jumped not hearing her get so close and quickly pulled the one piece off his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elena was looking for this, for her costume building. She makes costumes,\" he said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you going to get it for her?\" Becky asked in an odd tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. It's very nice,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not for me,\" he blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say it was,\" she said walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed her to go pay for the swimsuit.</span></div></div>",

He carefully stepped into it and slid his arm into the sleeve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped out and she had him pose for her. She had a look of concentration on her face as she examined him. Eric suddenly felt nervous at the scrutiny but it he didn't need to worried. She was completely focused on the task at hand.

The top was tied around his neck and covered his chest but exposed much of his shoulders and back. He felt the material and he had to admit, it felt nice. He looked at himself in the mirror and froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus. It shouldn't be this easy,\" he said looking at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe posed and looked at himself from different angles. He still couldn't believe that he looked as good as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I make a better looking girl than guy,\" he thought with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept making poses until he heard a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You about ready in there?\" Elena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh, yeah. Just need to do my hair....\" he said. Quickly trying to get his hair under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce settled, he stepped out to approving nods. He slipped on some heels and the three pretty girls left to meet up with the three cute guys.</span></div></div>",

The shirt should help to hide your lack of a feminine figure. It's not too girly but should still be enough to please Connie\", choosing to leave out more information about the padding in the leggings. Eric didn't need any more reasons not to wear the things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric had his own opinions on how 'not too girly' the ensemble was, but chose not to voice them. Becky was being generous, even if she was the one who got him into this mess. He instead expressed his grudging consent and reluctantly took the clothes from his sister's waiting hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up on his reservations, Becky tried to assuage his worries. \"It won't be too bad.\" She said. \"It's only while you're working, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nodded. \"Right. And I don't want to be recognized, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric slid the leggings up his legs. They felt odd, like the jeans he had worn, but he didn't think too much of it. He then put on the blouse, which hung loosely on his skinny frame and extended past his waist. It seemed really baggy to him, but the fit in the shoulders and sleeves wasn't too off, so he guessed it was just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Eric wearing her old shirt was an odd experience for Becky. The way the large piece of clothing hung on his body reminded her a lot of herself a few years ago. It was a surreal experience, almost like looking into a mirror to the past. Honestly, her figure back then was a lot like Eric's now. He looked too much like a high school girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky couldn't help but have a small grin at the thought, which Eric was not too happy about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you smiling about?\" Eric asked, looking almost as though he was pouting, none too pleased with his sister's smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just, uh.. you remind me of me when I was in high school. You really do look like you could be my little sister, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I wanted to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait, it's good though. I didn't have, ah, a very developed appearance back then. You don't look too girly, just young.\" Seeing her brother's expression continue to sour, Becky decided to steer the conversation away. \"Anyways go find those shoes you wore yesterday. They'll go well with this outfit too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, sensing his sister's discomfort decided not to press the issue any further. Though he was unsettled by his sister's comparison of him to her high school self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went and grabbed the pair of shoes that he had not especially ceremoniously stored away yesterday and began putting them on, but he ended up having some trouble. He wasn't used to his new acrylic nails. He was having trouble strapping the shoes back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help me with these?\" Eric gestured at his heels. \"These nails are too long for me. My hands are all clumsy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky giggled. \"I suppose I could help out my little sister. You'd think she'd know how to do this by now though. She's about to graduate high school after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric groaned. \"Just do them, all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky obliged. Making no effort to hide her smile as she helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shoes firmly attached, Eric went into the bathroom to do his make up. In the meantime, Becky had the opportunity to explore his abode. </span></div></div>",

My. God. Eric's fans think he's a girl. He must have been mortified.\" Becky smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little sis!\" She called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you're still in high school, isn't that a bit too old to be playing Barbie games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop saying I'm in high school. And what do you mean by Barbie games?\" Came Eric's response from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I can see the game here on your counter. It seems like you're a great role model for other girls. I bet all of your fans are really pleased to see a girl not playing up her Gender to get views.\" Becky said, poking fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rushed out of the bathroom, makeup only half applied. \"Look, that's just a misunderstanding. The girl who sent that is obviously just mistaken, maybe seeing what she wants to see. I mean I'm glad she likes me, but it's not like I'm a role model. I don't know why she'd think I was a girl. Everyone can see and hear me when I stream after all.\" Eric said, defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Eric in front of her, Becky was able notice the similarities between Eric and the Mercy figurine on the table, along with her halo-like headdress and its life sized replica resting on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Becky countered. \"And I suppose your hairstyle is the same as this angel girl's by coincidence? Is that why you have her halo too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric paused. He hadn't put two and two together. He gazed at Mercy with a blank stare, actually seeing himself as her like basically all his viewers had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear.\" Eric ran back to the bathroom, snatching the mercy figure as he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was legitimately confused. Was Eric really that oblivious? How could anyone not see him as that character? The resemblance was uncanny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god.\" Becky heard Eric say from the bathroom, dumbstruck. \"I really do look like Mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what she's called? Maybe once you're older you might have her figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric returned. \"Stop it. This is your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Connie cut my hair like this. She must have seen a picture of Mercy on my phone while I was reading about game strategy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you need to be more careful then Ericka, unless you want the rest your fans to see you like CosplayGirl91 does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's definitely a misunderstanding.\" Eric denied. \"I might have the hairstyle, but there's no way people think I'm not a guy. If they noticed, they probably just think its a joke, like I said my nails were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky noted the statement about Eric's nails, but chose not to pursue it further. \"Well whatever. We're running late. I'll fix your makeup so we can get out of here quicker.\" Becky pulled Eric back to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit mischievous, Becky decided to give Eric a more adolescent look, fitting of his status as an honorary high school girl. Plus it would make sense that a younger girl would know less than a regular salon employee, which would help Eric blend in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they rode to the salon, Becky ensured Eric had at least a passing knowledge on the sorts of things he might be asked at the salon. Enough that a girl Ericka's age would know at least, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived, Becky settled in to work. As did Eric, who was tasked with learning some of the other simple goings on at the salon so he could help out beyond just cleaning. Eric picked up what he could. He wasn't really eager, but he did need the money and it didn't hurt to be more knowledgeable, after all.</span></div></div>",

Even I wouldn't have recognized you if I hadn't practically dressed you this morning. There is no way she'll recognize you from high school. You look, at best, like you just graduated. There's no way she'd think you were her classmate, let alone her male classmate. Now go help her, or you'll look suspicious. Don't make her wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nervously approached the counter, too worried to be bothered by Becky's comment about his apparent age and gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Ericka,\" Eric said, trying to calm his shaky voice. \"so you're in for a mani-pedi right? Any specialists you'd prefer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, anyone is fine. Don't worry about it.\" Elena said, trying to be as accommodating as possible for the obviously new and not especially confident girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well I think it'll be uh..\" Eric looked around quickly. Everyone was busy. \"about a 5 to 10 minute wait, uh.. or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie called over to Eric, \"Why don't you get her started Ericka, You've learned how to file and clean nails, start with that, and somebody will be over to assist in a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was on edge: even more time near Elena. More time where she might see through the disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena, recognizing Ericka's insecurity, put a hand on her shoulder. \"I'm sure you'll do just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric lead Elena over to an open seat and began readying the supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena continued, hoping to ease Ericka's nerves, \"Anyways is this your first day here? I feel like I've seen you before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric started. \"Oh! Uh.. That's.. because I'm Becky's little sister, probably. Uh.. I mean I am Becky's little sister, of course. That is, you probably recognized me because I'm her little sister, not that I may or may not be Becky's little sister. I am. Her.. little.. sister... I mean.\" Eric trailed off as he realized what he was saying. He wasn't pleased to have just so adamantly claimed to be a little sister. He didn't like the sound of it one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Eric's terrible attempts at conversation, Becky chimed in. \"No. She's my <i>baby</i> sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of his near-breakdown for a moment, Eric rolled his eyes. Elena noticed and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like you get along well. I'm jealous. Becky's the best and I'm an only child.\" Elena explained. \"So you must've grown up around here then? What year are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I've graduated\" Eric corrected, but realizing he almost inadvertently let slip their connection backtracked, \"... just recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so cool!\" Elena responded. \"It's great to be newly independent. What are you planning on doing now that you're out of school. Hoping to make a career as a hairdresser?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of that sent a shiver down Eric's spine. \"No. I'm actually, uh, trying to become a streamer. On Twitch, you know? Video games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's incredible! I love video games! What sorts do you play?\" Elena responded enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Overwatch mostly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man that's great! I play tons of Overwatch too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean time, Becky finished up and moved to take over for Eric, who was at that point painting Elena's toes. </span></div></div>",

Like, he feels like an assault character right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fair. It maybe was a little much, but I think it needed to happen. Pre-patch Zen would basically die to a swift breeze. They need to change something to get people to use him more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it definitely worked.\" Eric laughed, forgetting his predicament as Becky took over the pedicure. \"Every match has one right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now at least. That's what I like about the game, that they keep balancing it.\" Elena countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was pleased that Eric was making a friend, but sighed as they went on and on. This sort of stuff wasn't her cup of tea. She did hear Eric make a couple mentions of Mercy, the character he looked like. Apparently Mercy was 'falling out of the meta' or something, though Eric was pretty adamant that a good player could make all the difference. It was a bit over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation went on even past the end of Elena's mani-pedi. They were still talking even after she had paid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to interrupt.\" Becky stepped in. \"But Ericka needs to get back to work before she gets into trouble. Why don't you two get together after work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You up for it?\" Elena asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! That would be great!\" Eric responded in a snap, before considering the ramifications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey exchanged numbers and Elena left. Eric, seeing her go turned to Becky, mortified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... get coffee?\" Came the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm so stupid.

You were having a good time.\" Becky said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because now I have to go out as Ericka!\" Eric whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... right. Well, that's fine. I'm sure I gave you something cute to wear.\" Becky responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric wasn't sure if she was intentionally being obtuse to bother him, or if she really didn't see the problem.</span></div></div>",

Becky made a beeline for Eric's new box of girl's clothes, still unsorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this seems good. It's something I would have worn back in high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to look like you looked in high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky rolled her eyes. \"Look, you mentioned that she though you looked familiar right? Well you seemed pretty sure you were my little sister then. I guess you could just wear jeans and a T-shirt, take off your makeup and swear off anything girly. You'll probably won't look as young, more like the old Eric. She's definitely not any more likely to recognize you if you do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ok... I get your point. The younger and girlier I look, the less likely she is to think connect me to Eric. It's just... I'm worried...\" Eric trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky giggled slightly. Ericka reminded her of herself. The nervousness and lack of confidence. Sure it was for different reasons, but it just seemed so appropriate. <i>Of course</i> her little sister would be contending with the same insecurities she had had. Becky just needed to help her get over it. Ericka was too worried about being recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to wear a bra.\" Becky added. \"Elena met you with boobs, so you can't suddenly be flat as a board.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit damnit. I was just about to take this damn thing off too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be more confident in your figure. I'm sure you'll grow in eventually.\" Becky teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric chose not to respond. He needed Becky to choose the rest of his outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd texted Elena earlier and they had made plans to go to the mall across town. Elena had offered to pick him up when he mentioned his car was in the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric removed the clothes he had worn to work. He noticed, as he took off the leggings, that they had been padded like the jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Becky. \"Damnit Becky. These leggings were padded. Why did you put me in these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want you to be insecure about your lack of curves.\" She winked. \"I know you're a bit embarrassed about your boyish figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed. \"You would phrase it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric changed into the knee length skirt and frilly, lacy blouse that Becky had selected. He touched up his makeup reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look OK?\" Eric was still nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look gorgeous, Ericka. \" Came the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you not call me that. There's no one else here. I get enough of it at work, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't know what you mean. Just because my little sister is out of high school and working doesn't mean I can't use her name, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric frowned. \"You know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, Becky gathered up Eric's work clothes for washing and headed out. Leaving Eric with a wink and assurance that he 'just needed to be confident in herself.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, Elena arrived at his house. Eric, realizing that his short heels were the only girl's shoes he had, put them back on. And stepped outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, I should have gotten some tennis shoes\" Eric lamented to himself, before piping up to Elena. \"So, we doing anything specific?\"</span></div></div>",

Keep your eyes out for a purple swimsuit.\" She tells<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at a goodwill store and headed inside, seeking something that might work to copy Widowmaker's shiny, purple ensemble. They didn't really find anything that would work though. Elena wasn't surprised. She explained that sometimes you get lucky at stores like this, so it's smart to look out, but mostly she just ordered what she needed online. She ended up buying a one-piece anyways to use as practice for the intended altering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer to make test cuts to get an idea of how it might look on the final costume. You don't want to spend a lot of money on something doomed to fail.\" She clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally makes sense. Sounds expensive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a bit expensive, but for me it's worthwhile.\" She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the store.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They continued driving around. Stopping at the mall for a bit like they had planned, then some more local thrift stores. They passed the time with conversation about costumes and strategy. They found little to work with, at least until Elena appeared from an errant clothes rack looking pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check out what I found!\" She showed Eric some dark orange leggings and a long, bright orange skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Widowmaker?\" Eric asked, confused what the orange color was all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh no of course not, but don't they seem perfect for a Mercy cosplay? They seem small but they look your size.\" Elena examined Eric's thighs. Did they seem... thinner than they were at the salon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Eric panicked. \"Oh no I couldn't, uh.. I'm not sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena realized what the problem was! Ericka's thighs <i>were</i> thinner, and her butt <i>was</i> smaller. She must have been wearing padding! No wonder she was so unconfident. She was embarrassed about her figure. And now Elena had just called attention to it. She was so stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait that's not what I meant! It's just they'd look great on you. I don't want to make you uncomfortable or anything. You're fine regardless. It's just rare to see something so perfect. If I ever want to throw together a Mercy cosplay I'll already be started for cheap.\" Elena smiled, hoping to assuage some of Ericka's insecurity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to ring them up, hoping she hadn't made Ericka too uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, the two of them returned to the car. Eric was still fidgeting uncomfortably. He was already worried about looking too much like Mercy. Looking exactly like her was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know.\" Elena said, hoping to take Ericka's mind off her underdeveloped appearance. \"I have other cosplays back at my place. I bet you'd love them. My roommate's out of town so you could totally come over for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other cosplays?\" Eric asked. Suitably distracted. Elena was pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I said I was working on Widowmaker, but I've been doing this for years now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was amazed. When had Elena become such a... geek? She seemed like a stereotypical girl in high school. Then, maybe she just acted that way in front of guys. It makes sense that she'd be more open around other girls like... him. Eric turned his mind away from that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to check them out.\" Eric responded enthusiastically, avoiding his previous musings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I love showing them off!\" Elena said, positively giddy with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later they were pulling up to Elena's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the mess...\" she said, thought the room was far from messy. Just a bit cluttered. No worse than any other living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered Elena's room. She extracted several outfits. Some from Overwatch, more from anime or other games. They chatted for a while while Elena showed off her costumes. They were all almost completely handmade, and the craftsmanship seemed to improve as the costumes became more recent. It was impressive the amount of effort Elena had been putting in to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly high school wasn't that long ago, and some of these outfits were made in the timespan. Eric wondered if he and Elena could have bonded like this back then. Though, he supposed, he wasn't Ericka back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Elena said inquisitively, \"Do you work tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh uh, no. Only weekdays, far as I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, me neither. We can hang out all night if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just a Barista at Starbucks. I'm hoping to make a career out of cosplaying and tailoring for it though. I've already made a couple bucks off of small commissions, though I haven't got anything consistent going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed the two of them were more alike than Eric realized. She wanted to cosplay professionally and he wanted to stream professionally. Elena seemed to make the connection as well, remembering his statement at the salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mentioned you wanted to stream right? That's super cool. You said you usually play Mercy right? I bet I could put together a quick Mercy cosplay for you, only a few days with that stuff I bought! You could wear it while you stream, I bet the viewers would love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was afraid about where this was going. If he dressed up as Mercy on stream then <i>everyone</i> would mistake him for a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe voiced tentative concerns. \"Oh no I couldn't. There's no way I could pay you for that, and I probably wouldn't look that good in it either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" Elena countered. \"I'd put it together for you for free. If you really wanted to pay me back for it you could just direct your viewers to my website, more traffic means more commissions, so you'd essentially be making up the cost for me anyways. And of course you would look good in it. Come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena grabbed Eric's arm and pulled him into the bathroom, grabbing a couple pieces of clothing as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take of your shirt.\" Elena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I uh.. I can't\" Eric was a deer caught in the headlights. What if she found out he was a guy? What would she think? Would she call him a pervert? Kick him out? Report him to the salon? Oh god what was he going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing Ericka's insecurity Elena pushed harder. \"Come on it won't be a problem. There's nothing to be ashamed off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena started removing Eric's blouse. Eric froze, offering no resistance, not knowing what to do. Elena pulled the shirt off and got a good look at Ericka's torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, was her bra stuffed? Of course! She really was a late bloomer. Elena facepalmed, chastising herself again for being so inconsiderate with a teenage girl's embarrassment. She knew what it was like to want to hide things, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was mortified. Elena knew! Oh god! \"Wait!\" He yelled. \"I can explain! I'm just doing this because... the salon! I uh, my car broke down! I needed the money and I was afraid that if I didn't look like a girl I wouldn't get to work. And I uh, I'm sorry. Please, please don't be mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric closed his eyes. Hoping Elena would let him off easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey.\" Elena said, sadly. \"Don't worry, it's not that weird. It makes sense that you'd do that to fit in at the salon. I totally understand. Why would I be mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric opened one eye. \"So you don't think I'm weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not. It's totally reasonable. In fact, I think I can help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed in relief, confident now that Elena hadn't realized that they had met before when he was Eric, and relieved that she wasn't furious at him.</span></div></div>",

It'll give the wrong idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena was honestly shocked. She didn't realize Ericka was having so many reservations. She seemed so enthusiastic about video games earlier. Elena knew how Ericka felt though. After all she had gone through something similar when she had decided to seriously pursue cosplaying and costume making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe resolved to try to help Ericka out. \"You shouldn't be so worried about people's perceptions. It's ok if they think of you like that. There's no reason to go against it right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose...\" Eric wasn't sure how to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, you should just embrace it! It'll be fine. People will love it. And if it's based on what you think is a flawed perception that doesn't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?

Just be confident in yourself and there won't be anything to find out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric considered that for a moment. He guessed Elena had a point. He didn't really want his viewers to think he was a girl. But he was already having fun streaming and building up a viewer base. If they already thought he was a girl... Well then nothing would change would it? He'd still have fun streaming right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric conceded. \"I guess you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena was ecstatic. \"So you'll dress up as Mercy on stream then? Oh that's so great! I'll get started on the costume right away! We already have the leggings. All we need is halo and wings. The armor should be fairly easy with the stuff I already have here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was happy that Elena was happy, but he was still unsure. \"Oh, I uh, already have a halo. A fan sent it. But what about--\" He gestured to his flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're really so worried about stuffing, maybe I can find something that will make you less anxious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you?\" Eric asked tentatively. \"It's just... I wouldn't want to mess up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd be nice to have something to ease his nervousness, but he also didn't want to impose any more. Elena was being so understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, in fact I think I have just the thing in the medicine cabinet. I can set you up right now.\"</span></div></div>",

Now, can I, uh..\" He gestured to his blouse, still in Elena's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right!\" She responded. \"Wait I wanted you to try this on.\" She picked up the shirt she had grabbed from her room. \"It should be a tight fit, but it's what I would use as the base for Mercy's armor. While you throw that on I've got another thing to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena left the room, leaving Eric with the smooth long-sleeved black shirt. Eric put it on. It was a tight fit, but not too tight. It wasn't restricting, at least, and it was very comfortable. As he adjusted it getting it to sit right, Elena returned carrying something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hands were two large pieces of.. plastic? It seemed more flexible than hard plastic was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric asked her about them. \"What are those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are what I plan to use as the base for Mercy's armor. I originally got them for my Reinhardt armor because they have the right look, but their too flimsy to stand on their own like I'd need for that, so I had to get something more rigid. They'll work great for Mercy though, since her armor will hug your body. Check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena laid the pieces against Eric's torso, moulding them along his stuffed bra. It made Eric's figure look decidedly feminine, but he supposed that was the goal if he was going to look like mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool that you have these, but is it really alright that you're using these pieces for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it's alright. Plus I'm pretty sure we're basically the same size, I mean look how well that shirt fits you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nodded. \"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So like you can always give it back to me and it'll fit me. Still I don't think I could possibly pull off Mercy like you could.\" Elena looked Ericka over. \"I mean your hair is just the right color and the style is perfect on you. It's incredible. If she was real, I'd say you were her little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was getting used to being called someone's 'little sister' at this point. But the thought still stung slightly. It certainly wasn't what he was hoping for when he'd gotten Becky's hand-me-downs. Eric voiced his quiet assent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways.\" Elena continued. \"Looking at this I bet I could get this outfit cooked up at lightspeed. I just need to paint on the designs and carve up the material into the right shape. We already have the leggings, and it'll be easy to cannibalize the skirt to get all the rest of the orange cloth. If you're willing to stay still and act like a mannequin I could probably finish everything but the wings by the end of the weekend! We can work on it tonight. And then continue tomorrow. We'll make a whole day out of it! Uh, I mean if you're down, of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena trailed off, having gotten caught up in her own excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, having already decided that dressing up as mercy on stream would be fine, saw no reason at this point to not oblige her. Elena would probably be fun company to play video games with, and he didn't have plans to do anything else over the weekend. Though he was remiss about not using the next as an opportunity to stream for a long while, he imagined that dressing up as Mercy would make up for it. CosplayGirl91 would love it. Though Eric still had reservations about 'confirming' that he was a girl..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Uh.. Sure, I guess.\" Eric agreed, weakly. \"Sounds fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Let's get started right away.\" Elena replied, rushing out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric followed awkwardly. As soon as he entered the room after her, Elena positioned Eric in a specific spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just stand still there. The lighting's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena pulled out a sheet with what looked like measurements, then began examining the armor material she was planning on using. Eric stood there awkwardly while Elena went to her computer and pulled up several reference pictures of Mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a stool and setting her computer on it next to Eric, she got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold this\" She commanded, pressing one of the panels to Eric's torso. \"Make sure you keep it steady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena grabbed a pen and measuring tape, first putting marks in specific locations, then actually tracing out a line where the armor would end on Mercy's side. She repeated the process with the other piece on Eric's other side, using the first to ensure that they were symmetrical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright that's all I need you for for now. I'm gonna start cutting and work on the bits that I need to compare from Mercy's pictures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really that quick?\" Eric asked. Less than an hour had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well normally no, but assuming your measurements are basically the same as mine, a big portion of the work is already done. I've done similar armor before for other cosplays, so it's almost rote at this point. The hard part is going to be the wings, but we don't have the materials for those right now anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Eric was impressed. Elena seemed to have this almost down to a science. Her were area seemed a bit cluttered, but Elena always had the right tool on hand whenever she shifted to working on something else. Holding the armor in place, carving it, shaping designs, sewing, it was all there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched Elena work for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know this bit's going to take a bit longer. Just take off that shirt and once I'm done modifying it I'll need you again. In the meantime you can play some overwatch on my computer or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric thought that was a fine idea and removed his shirt. This time not worried about his stuffed bra since, after all, Elena knew he was a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena was pleased that Ericka was much less embarrassed about dressing down in front of her this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to take those pills\" She reminded Ericka. Seizing the opportunity to try and reinforce her confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Eric replied, heading to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened up the pill bottle and was a bit surprised to see circular tablets. Anxiety medication that he had seen before was usually in capsules, but he supposed that this wasn't anything particularly out of the ordinary. He swallowed four pills. They left a pretty terrible taste in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric returned to Elena's 'workshop' and fired up Overwatch on her computer. Elena continued to work, occasionally looking over at Eric's play and complementing him. Elena was impressed at how talented Ericka was. Maybe Mercy could be viable in this meta?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Elena finished up her work for the night. Conscripting Eric as a mannequin again for a short while after splicing the armor with the shirt and altering the sleeves to be primarily orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she asked, \"do you plan on staying over? Like I said, Roommate's out of town, and this place gets lonely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric didn't see much reason to decline. He enjoyed her company and he didn't have any plans for the night. Though he was remiss about spending the night as a girl...</span></div></div>",

Should we head back to my place really quick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, we're the same size remember. Just throw this on.\" Elena dug out a thin night-dress and tossed it to Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean time, she stripped down, digging out a comfy looking, and much more conservative pair of pajamas for herself. Eric averted his gaze, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have anything more like what you're wearing.\" Eric asked pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Elena replied cheerfully. \"You'll look great in that anyways. Don't be so worried. This sort of thing is what those pills are going to help with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric didn't feel much better yet, but he supposed there wasn't any point pressing the issue. He donned the outfit, removing his skirt and socks. He was embarrassed by the sheer gown, transparent in several places. It did hide his chest, making him look decidedly feminine, much to his chagrin. He removed the stuffing from his bra, but it did little to help the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Ericka's red face and boyish figure, Elena did what she could to be reassuring. \"You look great. Probably better in that thing than I ever have... oh, you've got plain nails. Hey, let me return the favor for the salon earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to decline. \"You payed at the salon. It was hardly a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena, however, insisted. \"Pretty please? I owe you for saving me from staying here alone tonight. Plus you're going to be my Mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anything, dressing up like that is a favor to me!\" He continued to resist, not realizing the path his argument had taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena just kept looking at him like a forlorn puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric finally capitulated. \"Sure alright. Go ahead.\" He could believe he was agreeing to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena gave a little cheer, sitting him down at the desk and pulling out her nail care materials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could take a bit.\" She said. \"You should play a game of Overwatch while I work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was fine with that. Anything to take his mind off of how feminine he was becoming. He allowed himself to become engrossed in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Elena was done she shook him out of it. Waiting, of course, for him to finish his match. Looking down at Elena's urging, Eric saw that Elena had painted his toes hot pink. Even going so far as to adorn his big toes with flower designs. It was honestly impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's really good.\" Eric complemented, the skill behind the painting taking his mind off the fact that those were his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena and Eric continued playing games and chatting through the night. Staying up altogether too late before finally deciding to go to get some actual sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asleep?\" He heard Elena ask?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? no... i don't think I was\", Eric was awoken from his tired stupor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way its probably time to get some shut eye, thanks for hanging out with me, I don't have a lot of geeky girl friends.\" She says shutting off the game and climbing into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither,\" Eric replied tiredly, following Elena into her bed. He was too tired to pay any heed to Elena's 'girl friends' comment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The light sneaking into Elena's room danced across Eric's face, forcing him awake. He was lying at an awkward angle in Elena's bed, her arm resting over him almost protectively. Squinting, Eric gently lifted Elena's arm off his flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, he heard Elena's sleep muttering \"mmMm.. brave little sister..\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did his best not to wake her. He felt extremely awkward about this whole sleeping situation. It had been a while since he shared a bed with a girl, and it had never been like this. He stretched, working out the sleep-borne kinks in his arms, and yawned. He finally got a good look at what he was wearing and blushed. He'd never expected to wear anything like that to sleep either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to slide out of bed, not wanting to be stuck in this outfit any longer than he needed to. In doing so he disturbed Elena. She yawned and stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\" She said, sleepily. \"Sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Elena hopped out of bed with an energy that she hadn't possessed a moment earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stripped, much to Eric's embarrassment, and put on some regular clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for some more modeling today? I made a lot of progress last night. I think all that's left is the more elaborate construction, joints and designs and stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" Eric replied, eager to see how the final outfit would turn out. Though he didn't see the prospect of wearing it with the same enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena walked out and made some coffee. Eric took the opportunity to change back into his 'going out clothes'. He and Elena continued their conversation from last night. Talking about video games primarily, but also about their career pursuits. Eric was intrigued by the intricacies of cosplay and costume construction, and Elena was likewise intrigued by Eric's streaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Elena asked, \"When are you planning on streaming next? I'd love to watch. What's your handle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was still having his misgivings about streaming as a girl. Telling Elena who he was meant there really was no going back. If he did, she was going to watch his stream. And he had agreed with her that he would stream as a girl. His audience was going to think he was a girl. Still, he had already given this its consideration. It would be fine, right? Streaming wouldn't be any different. Who cared if they thought he was a girl. He knew the truth and that was good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm probably going to stream tomorrow, maybe tonight even, if I'm feeling up for it. I stream as Eric KaBoom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ericka Boom?\" Elena confirmed. \"I'll be sure to tune in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, not noticing her mispronunciation continued with the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually if you want you could cameo in the stream.\" He offered. \"If you really finish with the Mercy costume that quickly and I wear it, then you can show up and I can give you a shoutout. It's the least I can do, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That sounds fun. I'd love to watch you work.\" Elena agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's settled then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Elena ate breakfast and Elena took a shower, leaving the door half-open. When she finished, she walked out with only a towel wrapped around her, wringing out her hair. Eric was a bit uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a shower too?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have any of my stuff.\" Eric said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no prob.\" Came Elena's reply. \"Just use my products. The body wash is the pink bottle, the shampoo's purple and the conditioner's the blue one up high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, ok.\" Eric agreed, seeing no available excuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went into the bathroom and closed the door, being sure to lock it. He noticed that his makeup had smudged overnight. He really ought to have washed it off. He quickly stripped and hopped in the shower. He cleaned up, using Elena's products as directed. He climbed out of the shower smelling distinctly of lavender, but he didn't really think too much of it. He walked back into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing him, Elena perked up. \"Great.\" She said, grabbing his hand. \"Help me out with my makeup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, ok.\" Eric obliged, applying a subtle amount, as directed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll do you.\" Elena said, beginning before Eric could protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena expertly decorated his face, applying the makeup in a way that looked significantly more girly than anything Eric would have done for himself. She looked pleased at her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked in the mirror, seeing a pretty young girl looking back at him. It really was well done. Eric was moderately impressed. His protests at the reflection being his own being pushed out by his admiration for the execution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's great.\" Eric offered. \"Did you just pick the skill up, or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get a lot of practice from cosplaying.\" She explained. \"A lot of really precise stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was a bit unsettled by how girly he looked. Honestly how could someone <i>not</i> see him as a girl like this? Still it was fine, it's not like anyone else would see this. And Elena knew his secret too. She must have just been dressing him up in anticipation of him playing Mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways.\" Elena said \"We've got some more work to do on this Mercy costume. The body's basically finished aside from a bit more construction that will only take an hour or so. What we really need now are the wings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you mentioned that the armor material wasn't sturdy enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, but I know just the thing. I've made protruding fixtures like that before. We need to take a trip to the hardware store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hardware store?\" Eric asked. \"I'm going to go there dressed like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon Eric stating that, Elena realized he had a point. \"You're right.\" She said. \"You can't wear the same clothes two days in a row. We're the same size. I'll grab you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.. That's, not what I meant...\" Eric trailed off. Elena had already left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned with a light blue sundress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put this on\", she said \"It's loose. It'll look good with your figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I mean that's not really hardware store attire.\" Eric tried to get out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter. Not like we're going to be building anything. It's just like shopping for clothes, except we're going to be picking up pipes and whatnot instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.. I suppose.\" Eric conceded, not really having much reason to not wear the thing. He was already wearing that makeup after all. Wearing a dress wouldn't be any different from wearing the skirt and blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric donned the sundress. It physically wasn't too different from the skirt, but it felt off. More breezy and <i>girly</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, let's go.\" Elena said enthusiastically.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elena and Eric walked out of Elena's house. Eric felt awkward wearing the dress. Going to a hardware store wouldn't be any different than going to a thrift store, he justified. They were just going to pick up some more costume materials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stepped into Elena's car. Elena started the conversation. \"Yeah I go to the hardware store pretty frequently. Turns out there's a lot of useful stuff there for making costumes. Tools, materials, the works. Plus when I have something really intensive I need to build I sometimes ask an employee there to help me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was surprised. Basically all he ever did at a hardware store was buy lightbulbs. He supposed it made sense though. Elena had demonstrated her tool knowhow and organization yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled up the the hardware store and stepped out of the car. Eric smoothed his dress. Examining the place, it was a rather small building. 'Ericson's Hardware', it was called. A simple name. It was tucked into the corner of a shopping center, sort of out of the way. Through the front window shelves with arrays of valves on them were visible, a strange thing to have at the front of a store, but whatever. The front counter was also in sight, though it was unmanned. There seemed to be nobody inside as well, though the sign on the front said the store was open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly are we looking for?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Several things.\" Elena said, \"but I know a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just observe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stepped into the store. Nobody was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY ERICSON!\" Elena called out. \"Get out here you lazy asshole! There are paying customers waiting for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric flinched at her outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA call came from some distant corner of the store, which seemed much larger now that you were inside. \"If it isn't my least favorite customer!\" A man's voice yelled back, though there was no malice in it. \"Come to apologize for your past misdeeds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena led Eric towards the voice. \"No.\" She called back. \"I came here to buy things, idiot.\" Elena smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third voice came from some other place in the store. This was getting ridiculous. \"Elena is that you?\" Becky?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Becky! What a surprise to find you here!\" Elena responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric had yet to see any of the people Elena was talking to. Was that normal at this store? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the corner that the man's voice came from in short order. Standing there was a twenty something guy with short cropped brown hair and... no shirt on. His muscular body glistened slightly with sweat. Eric noted how much more fit the guy seemed compared to him and his scrawny body. He was probably only slightly older too. He was fixing something to the wall, but as Eric and Elena approached he turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elena! What brings you to my humble shop. Need something?\" He grinned wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems I don't\" She responded. \"No shirt, no shoes, no service and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not how it works.\" He quipped back. \"It's only customers that've gotta obey the dress code. Though I'd probably be willing to make an exception for you or your cute friend.\" He turned his gaze on Eric, who blushed and shifted slightly behind Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Becky made her appearance, materializing from a rack between Elena and Ericson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi\" She chastised. \"Stop bothering Elena's friends. You did this to me when she brought me here too. You'll lose your business that way.\" Becky pokes him on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright.\" He conceded. \"What is it you're here for Elena. And who's your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a bit interested to know too. Who have you cursed now with this horrid-- Ericka?\" Becky paused as she caught sight of you. Her grin widened unsettlingly. \"And why are you here on this fine day, <i>little sis</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEricson chimed in. \"Little sister? You never told me you had a little sister. Why didn't you set me up with--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ericka's too young for you.\" Elena cut him off. \"Now are you going to help us or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ericka\" Ericson smiled. \"Good name choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky piped up, \"Isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you here for?\" Ericson asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm making a cosplay for her.\" Elena said, gesturing at Eric. \"And I need some materials. We're basically trying to build what look like robotic angel wings. I've got several reference pictures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena pulled out several photos of Mercy, and what looked like some sketches that she had made. When did she draw those up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright cool\" Ericson nodded, taking the pictures from Elena. \"I think we can throw something together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky peered around his side, getting a look at the picture \"Oh? Dressing up as that angel girl Ericka? I thought you didn't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shot Becky a glare. \"Elena convinced me it was a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEricson mentioned something about pvc and he and Elena walked off with purpose, leaving Eric and his sister alone in the corner of the store. Becky gave him a smug look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your makeup looks extra cute today.\" She said \"And that dress is super cute. Where'd you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elena loaned it to me. And she did my makeup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you would have been so willing when I was trying to decide your outfit\" Becky pouted. \"She's even getting you to dress up like a beautiful angel. How come you've changed your mind about being my little sister?\" She smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elena convinced me.\" Eric began explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you really did change your mind?\" Becky asked, actually surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Well, yes, sort of.\" Eric snaps off. \"I was thinking about that note I got from my fan, you know. And I told Elena about how I was worried my audience might see me as a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told her that you weren't a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she saw me and my stuffed bra, so she figured it out. It was fine though. I slept with her over at her place last night. There was no problem.\" Eric supplied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky pondered for a moment. Elena was certainly treating Eric like a girl still. Perhaps he had misunderstood. Still, it wasn't important. What was important was how unbelievably cute he was in that dress and how he didn't seem that uncomfortable. He certainly was acting less out of place than he was yesterday, even when they were in private together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't explained why you're dressing up as a female video game character now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting to that.\" Eric said, bothered. \"Anyways I told her I was worried that my audience would think I was a girl, and she basically said it didn't matter. She put it better, but like, regardless of what they think of me, if I enjoy streaming and they enjoy watching then their perception of me didn't matter. Nothing changes if they think I'm a girl. She even gave me some anti-anxiety pills. Well I considered that and it made sense. So I figured I wouldn't change anything...\" Eric trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\" Becky said, helpfully. \"Now you're dressing up as an angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Elena said I looked like her, and that she had the materials. And then she begged me to let her make me an outfit.\" Eric clarified exasperatedly. \"Long story short I'm going to wear the costume on stream. Short story short I'm really going to need those anti-anxiety pills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!\" Becky said. Clapping Eric on the back. \"You're going to look so cute all dressed up. I can't wait to see it. You just <i>have</i> to send me pictures. Better yet, I'll come back with you and watch the magic in process!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Eric said, quickly. \"No, you can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why is that?\" Becky feigned confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric searched for a reason to muster up. He didn't want his sister seeing him cosplaying. It was too much already.</span></div></div>",

She's going to be working and.. uh.. you're not interested in video games anyways..\" Eric concluded weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky grinned. \"Nonsense. I'm friends with Elena. I'll simply be showing up to help her deal with my little sister. I'm sure I'll be nothing but helpful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky put her arm around Eric's shoulder. \"Why are you here anyways?\" Eric asked, half to Becky and half to fate itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was buying lightbulbs.\" Becky shrugged, holding up a bag. Huh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, whatever.\" Eric capitulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd come around.\" Becky said cheerfully. \"Now why don't we see how the construction crew is doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky put her arm over Eric's shoulder and started leading him to some other part of the shop. Casually throwing open an Employees Only door, Becky strode in to what appeared to be a sort of break room, pulling Eric in after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we wait outside the employees only area?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, Ericson's the only person around right now and he knows me. There's never any business at this hour so nobody else shows up and he just holds down the fort. Now come on, they'll be in the workshop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the workshop, Eric and Becky saw what could generously be described as a horrid mess. The whole place looked like a tornado had gone through it, with random shapes of various scrap materials piled haphazardly wherever there wasn't some sort of machine. The saws, mills and other such things did have islands of tidiness around them, either surrounded by empty space or by neat racks with drill bits and that sort of thing, as necessary. Eric wasn't really sure, but this seemed like more than basic hardware store equipment. He looked around for Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Becky crossed the threshold of the room, hoping to get a better view. After only three steps they were met with the sound of Ericson's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Safety glasses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky froze immediately. \"Sorry.\" She yelled back, looking legitimately contrite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled Eric backwards and towards a rack on the wall, grabbing a pair of plastic glasses and shoving a second pair onto his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when are you so concerned about safety? Or perhaps do you have some other motivation?\" Eric teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky blushed for a moment, before masking her face. \"Oh <i>little sis</i>, you don't want to go down that road with me.\" She said ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I?\" Eric asked coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you paint those nails yourself? It's a great design. You'll be a full stylist at the salon in no time!\" Becky looked pointedly at Eric's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric blanched. \"Elena did them.\" He said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky stood back. \"Victory. Now let's see how my little angel's costume is coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric pulled his arms closer to himself, embarrassed. \"Can't you just let me have a little teasing, considering the last few days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never let my little sister get one up on me.\" Becky pulled Eric over towards when Ericson's voice had come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavigating the scattered piles of junk and various high quality machines, they arrived at the table Elena and Ericson were working at. The thing had a serious of symbols on it in strict fashion that probably would have made more sense to someone with more experience in carpentry or whatever than Eric and Becky had. As it was they were both lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSizing up the situation, Eric was at least able to tell that:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric was at least able to tell that Elena had made some significant progress. Arranged on the table were various pieces of plastic clearly laid out in the shape of one of Mercy's wings. Sure they were blocky and not connected, but to Eric's untrained eye it seemed like all that needed to be done was that they needed to be put together somehow. Surely that would be quick. He had thought this was going to be a much longer process than it was turning out to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approached the preliminary construction. \"So this is going to be a wing?\" He asked. \"Is this as close to done as it looks? It seems like all you need to do is make all these pieces look smoother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\" Said Elena, Ericson nodding along. \"This is just part 2 of sketching basically. We're trying to see if these pieces could be made fit together right. After that I want the wings to articulate, so we'll need joints for all the connections. Then we also need the light feathers, which I have an idea for but still need to set up. Then finally we can sand down the pieces, then paint them. And THEN we still have to attach them to the torso robustly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically what she's saying is we'll be finished by the end of the day. Just for you.\" Ericson said, giving Eric a wink. Becky's expression soured slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. He's not necessarily wrong. Everything we need to construct the actual wings is here in the machine shop. There's so much spare stuff that we'll certainly be able to find the pieces we need. Plus the tools here are great. We can even suspend the pieces in place while we construct the thing so we can do it in any order!\" Elena excitedly gestured to some sort of apparatus with several vice-looking things with that last statement. \"If I just stay here and work on it for a while. I should get it cranked out in a couple of hours.. but I'll need Ericson's help.\" At that, she looked at Becky penitently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky cocked an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEricson put a hand behind his head somewhat awkwardly. \"Well I can't just leave the shop unmanned you see, even if it is the weekend. Plus the materials we're using and the machine time aren't actually free...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are for me.\" Elena said. \"You still owe me a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, ok. But the point is if there were some cute girls handling the front of the store then I could work back here just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Elena.\" Eric jumped in. \"I don't want you to use a favor just for me. You're already making this costume free. I mean I really appreciate it.. I, it's just, you don't need to do so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. This is as much for me as it is for you. You're a perfect Mercy, Ericka, and I've been itching to use some of my ideas for this costume. The wings are going to be super cool.\" Elena responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. If you're sure..\" Eric agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena turned back to Becky. \"Anyways if you and Ericka could handle the front while we work on this I'd really appreciate it. Ericson's the only one allowed to use some of these machin--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky interrupted. \"Ericka will do it. I'll help out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" Eric asked. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you need to pay off Elena for this costume?\" Her malevolent gaze turned on Eric, who had to resist the urge to flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's fi--\" Elena began, but was cut off by a look from Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure that's fine too. We could use an extra pair of hands.\" Ericson chimed in diplomatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I can't run a hardware store.\" Eric said nervously. \"What if someone asks me for something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody ever comes here.\" Said Becky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEricson dramatically feigned being wounded. \"How could you say such a thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky gave him a withering look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but it'll be fine. There's a 'secret' store map in the front counter: middle drawer on the left. If someone comes in and asks for something, just look it up on that.\" Ericson agreed awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't really know anything abou--\" Eric was cut off by Becky. She walked up to him and marched him around the corner. Elena and Ericson just watched awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>can</i>. It'll be just like the salon. Please just be a good sister and do this for me.\" Becky's demeanor changed dramatically. She was figuratively on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but you owe me. Especially if someone comes in and sees me like this.\" Eric replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even after I gave you my clothes and got you a job and helped you out so much?\" Becky's tone changed abruptly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But actually though.\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Becky agreed. \"I owe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually can I get this in writing? Is there a recording device around here I could borrow? Does this count as your little sister 'getting one up on you'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends. Are you my little sister?\" Becky left Eric with that, gesturing for him to get moving. As she did she spoke to Elena and Ericson, \"So let's get started.\" She said cheerfully. \"How can I help?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shuddered slightly. In the past couple of days it had gotten far to easy for him to think of himself as a girl. As Becky's 'little sister', even. And it didn't look like that was going to be stopping any time soon. Still, he had made a friend right? And the stream had been going well aside from the whole girl thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in his thoughts Eric meandered back to the store entrance, taking up a position behind the front counter much like he would do at the salon. This wasn't how he expected today to go. Then again, what exactly did he expect after agreeing to model Mercy for Elena? Actual modeling? He supposed this was probably better than that. There was no dressing or undressing, for one. He wondered what exactly he was supposed to do as he stood awkwardly at the counter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric waited for a short while. He wondered how it was exactly that he ended up in this situation: working as a clerk for a hardware store so his sister could spend time with a guy who was helping his new friend make a costume so he could dress up as Mercy, a female character, on a public stream. He didn't have time for the absurdity of the situation to sink in, however, because he was interrupted by the door opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn walked a twenty-something woman. Her long stride carried her smoothly forward, her heels clicking on the concrete floor as she glided towards Eric. Her sundress swayed with her in a way that was eerily similar to the way Eric's did. He lacked the grace this woman possessed, but the comparison was no less unsettling to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking Eric from his thoughts, the woman asked \"Hey, uh, is Ericson here. I was hoping to drop something off with him.\" She held up an envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, he's just in the back. I can go give it to him, I guess.\" Eric responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he doing, taking a nap? Don't answer that.\" The woman chuckled, but then began examining Eric more closely. \"Say, you don't actually work here do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, uh..\" Eric stammered, but was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's expression brightened. \"So you must be Elena's friend then! That's perfect. I'll just leave this with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed Eric the envelope. He took it, nodding awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure that gets to her. I owed her a favor and that's how I'm paying it off.\" The woman said. \"Anyways I'm Amelia, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ericka.\" Eric responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, always nice to meet a friend of Elena's, see you around.\" Amelia left as quickly as she came, leaving Eric alone in the store once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric debated for a moment heading to the back in order to give Elena the envelope, but figured he wouldn't bother. No reason to interrupt the work, and he probably wasn't supposed to leave the store unmanned. He went back to waiting. No patrons showed up at the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later Elena, Becky and Ericson finished their work and returned to the main floor of the store. Finding Eric still standing near the front, twiddling his thumbs, having nothing to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone show up while we were gone?\" Becky asked, cheerfully. Eric was jolted out of his stupor. He was surprised to see everyone there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah actually.\" Eric responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Ericson was mildly surprised. \"Were you able to find everything ok then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she wasn't actually here for the store. Said she owed Elena a favor and wanted to drop this off here.\" Eric gestured to the envelope. \"She assumed I would be able to give it to you, which I suppose wasn't incorrect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey!\" Elena said. \"That's great. Who was it, did you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name was Amelia.\" Eric responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I think I know what's in there then.\" Elena snatched up the envelope and tore it open in a single motion. \"Spa coupons!\" She held up two small green pieces of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEricson cocked his eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say,\" Elena said, \"Are you doing anything tomorrow Becky? There are two here, I get a bonus guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah actually.\" Becky put her hand behind her head awkwardly. \"I, ah.. had some errands I needed to do today that I forgot about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shot her a smug look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky narrowed her eyes at him. \"Ericka's not doing anything tomorrow though! She'd love to come with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric flinched. \"Wait, uh, you know I couldn't.\" He directed the statement at Elena. \"Uh..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's great!\" Elena said. \"We'll have another girl's day. It'll be super fun! Don't be shy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ok..\" Eric shrunk down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it'll be relaxing after your stream tonight. You said you were really stressed about it right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, uh, I wasn't even sure I was going to stream tonight.\" Eric replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you have to! We're gonna get your Mercy costume done super quick. We've already assembled the wings and sanded them down. Yeah, and all that's left is painting back at my place and putting in the feathers of light. They're not going to light up like I was hoping but that's not a big deal.\" Elena said, becoming more subdued at her last statement before piping up again. \"I guess there's a bit of finishing left on the torso beyond just painting, but that's going to be trivial. Plus, Becky's helping so it'll be that much quicker.\" Elena pulled Becky in bodily, practically wrenching her to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't want my sister's costume to be anything but perfect, after all.\" Becky said, her tone held a note of malevolence that didn't really fit the words of the statement. Eric was the only one who noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see you all later.\" Ericson concluded. \"I've got to stick around here. It was nice to have an actual project to work on, fun stuff. Though I'm a fan of the design as much as the construction and Becky already had all that hammered out. I'll see you around.\" Ericson took Eric's place behind the counter. \"Come back any time Ericka.\" He said with a wink as Eric left him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky, Eric and Elena departed. Elena held the Mercy wings gingerly, as though they were children. Though they looked fairly sturdy to Eric. Elena's caution did little to hide her glee as the walked though. She was practically bursting at the seams with excitement. She kept talking about the various elements of the design that she had worked out some time ago, mentioning worries that had proved unfounded in the construction and redundancies that she had put in. It was all a bit over Eric's head, Becky's too. They nodded along though. Eric pleased that his new friend was having fun. Becky was pleased that Eric was going to be wearing those things, Elena's excitement was a bit contagious though, she took care not to get too caught up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After arriving back at Elena's, Eric, Becky and Elena went to work finishing up the costume. While Elena painted and finished up everything, Eric and Becky were tasked with cutting thin yellow fabric into 'feathers', then wiring the pieces so they would stay in place on the wings. After a few hours the work was done. The costume was fully assembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing one basically boiled down to two pieces, a legging piece and a torso piece. The torso piece came apart in the back and could be stepped into sort of like a one piece swimsuit. Once it was cinched. Appeared sort of like a robust plastic leotard with 'armored' sleeves that extended all the way into a pair of gloves. The wings were attached to this piece and could be articulated by the wearer. Rather ingeniously, Elena made them able to extend and retract much like the wings actually could in the game. When they were extended, the 'feathers' made of a translucent yellow cloth became visible. Elena lamented the fact that she hadn't had the time to rig up the lighting system she'd thought of to make them glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond that was the leg piece, where the orange leggings became a metallic-painted pair of boots that Elena had cannibalized from some other project. They fit surprisingly well on Eric's feet. Additionally, tabard-like pieces of cloth hung from the front and back of Mercy's torso, along with several fauld pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing up the design was the spine piece, part of the torso, which covered the cinching in the back. It was decorated with a caduceus. And then there was the halo, gifted to Eric by CosplayGirl91 previously. The whole thing made for a very feminine getup, with the armor designed to represent a thin waist and wide hips, leaving only the dark shirt below in other places. Eric was impressed, but also regretted that he was about to be the one wearing it. He steeled himself in preparation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly' I'm astounded this got finished so quickly. We spent less than 20 hours working on this.\" Eric commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not normally this quick, sure.\" Elena said. \"But I'd already finished nearly all of the design, plus we had most of the materials on hand. It didn't hurt to have two extra hands helping me out. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it was nothing.\" Becky grinned evilly. \"Seeing this beautiful costume on my baby sister is going to be its own reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast.\" Elena shot Becky down. \"We still need to wait for the paint sealant to dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, plus if I'm going to stream tonight I really ought to get set up.\" Eric pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's perfect.\" Elena said. \"I'll drive you home and we can wait for the costume to dry while you set up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena immediately set to work, carefully moving the costume onto a stretcher-like sheet. She handed Eric his clothes and new pill bottle as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean time, Becky stood around, giving Eric her widest grin. Eric chose not to pay it any heed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all filed out, back to Elena's car. \"Say,\" Eric asked \"How'd you get to the hardware store in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a ride.\" Becky commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For lightbulbs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I also had other errands I was going to do.\" Becky said more importantly. \"This was just, uh, more important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah\" Eric said. \"There were 'matters' you needed to attend to at the store.\" Eric teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're attending to your 'matters' now, <i>Ericka</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena just smiled at the sibling banter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car pulled up outside Eric's place. He led the two girls inside. His living area was a bit of a mess, what with half-unpacked boxes of Becky's old clothes, along with worn clothes strewn about the area haphazardly. Neither girl made any comment on the mess, but Eric still apologized for it and made a token effort to sort it out before getting to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric posted 'Erickaboom streaming in one hour with a special surprise. Be sure to tune in ;)'. He began getting his technical stuff in working order for the broadcasting to begin. Elena set down the Mercy costume and began watching Eric over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't the 'B' in Ericka Boom be capitalized?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right.\" Eric said. \"Because I'm streaming.. as.. Mercy..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now isn't the time to get cold feet.\" Becky stepped up. \"You said you've been getting followers and people have been enjoying your stream. This one's only going to be better than the last couple. You have a rad costume and you have your big sister backing you up.\" Becky gave Eric a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric didn't feel very comforted but went on preparing anyways. When he finally finished, he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the costume ready.\" Eric asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" responded Elena. \"Whenever you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Eric shuddered. \"Actually let me just get a bit more prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric grabbed his 'anxiety' pills and downed four on the spot, then retreated to the bathroom to psych himself up. He also inspected his makeup and hair for any flaws that wouldn't be fitting. Once he was ready, he walked out to bring the costume back to the bathroom and change into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In the living room he saw Becky inspecting his pill bottle. She looked at the tablets inside inquisitively.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Becky was rather intrigued by Eric's 'anxiety pills'. First off, they were quite clearly tablets. Secondly, they where multicolored, one half of each was white and the other purple. That struck her as quite uncharacteristic of anxiety pills. In fact, they looked quite like combination anti-androgen and estrogen pills, something Eric would not be taking willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky's first thought was to tell him. He really ought to know what he was putting in his body, but seeing him walk out and grab the Mercy outfit she stopped her self. There's no way he would put that on if she interrupted him with this. She could always tell him later, right? And really he'd been so cute recently. Being her little sister wasn't so bad. Honestly he didn't seem that unhappy either, just put off. He'd been fairly excited about the angel outfit, if not the prospect of wearing it publicly. He could use a little confidence and telling him now could only hurt, she justified. Becky chose to say nothing. What was the worst that could happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, in the meantime, was donning his Mercy costume. It fit him surprisingly well. He and Elena really were the same size, it seemed. The location of the plastic armor pieces gave him the appearance of curves, the tight fit of the body piece only serving to accentuate the look. His shape was a bit smaller than Mercy's, but really no less girly. Eric couldn't help but see the female character in the mirror. His reflection might as well have been something out of the game. The hair, the face and eyes, the armor, and hell even the body were all those of a high teen or low twenties girl. He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric at least took solace in how cool the armor was. The design really was elegant. By shifting his shoulders around, he could make the wings extend and retract. Really how did Elena even do that? The whole thing was just mechanical and was really impressive. The design was spot on, maintaining near perfect fidelity to the game. While he was disturbed by that accuracy as it pertained to his appearance, he couldn't help but admire the costume itself. Had it really only taken two days to build the thing? Eric was in awe. He chose to focus on that positivity as he walked out of the bathroom, bracing himself for his sister and Elena's reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the bathroom walked the spitting image of Mercy. Maybe a little younger, to be fair, but still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it look?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was speechless. For the first time ever, Eric thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's AMAZING!\" Elena shouted. \"Oh my god it's better than I could have ever imagined! Where did Ericka even know? How did Mercy get into the real world. Oh my god! Oh my god!\" Elena was literally jumping with excitement. She was hopping across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's--\" Eric started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The halo! The halo! Put on the halo!\" Elena ran into the kitchen, sliding across the floor. She grabbed the halo and practically slammed it onto Eric's head. He flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow.\" Eric rubbed his head. \"Haven't you made costumes before? This isn't anything new is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is though! You look like Mercy incarnate. Everything is perfect. I've never gotten everything this perfect before. Honestly I'm a little jealous even. I wish I could be Mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit Ericka.\" Becky said quietly. \"My little sister is a literal angel.\" Any guilt Becky had about not mentioning the pills was gone. Ericka <i>was</i> this character. No doubt about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha.. Right..\" Eric wasn't used to Becky being legitimately in awe. He felt like he was wasting a situation he should be capitalizing on. \"WELL I'm going to fire up the stream then, uh, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky watched Ericka walk over to her chair and start fiddling with various things. Lights, a microphone, a camera. It all seemed rather professional. She stood out of the way of the camera, not wanting to distract her or get in the frame of her stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena simply looked on with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys can monitor the chat for me.\" Eric said. \"I'll be playing, but I'm interested to see how  they react.\" Dreading it, really, Eric thought to himself. He turned his second monitor slightly to give them a better view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric went live.</span></div></div>",

The viewers that had seen the notification that he was going live and tuned in were spamming the chat like it was their job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>MercyMainBTW:</b> I feel like I'm having an identity crisis!

Did you make that costume? Is that my halo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, still sitting in the competitive queue, got a good look at his chat. He smiled at the compliments. He was a bit unsettled by the comments about his cuteness, but he knew those were coming. If he was really going to commit to this, he ought to be appreciative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey thanks for the kind words everyone.\" Becky saw Ericka give a wink. It was distinctly feminine. \"Anyways, CosplayGirl91, a new friend of mine is really into cosplay. Actually, Elena why don't you come into the screen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked over to Elena and gestured for her to come over. She was a bit out of her element, but obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elena here made my costume one she saw my haircut. Had the whole thing planned and just put it together. Though your halo was the finishing touch! Thanks for that! Tell them about your stuff Elena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh. I do costumes and make cosplay. I'm, uh, trying to make it a career actually.\" It was Elena's turn to be nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Eric took back the mic. \"This here getup is courtesy of her skillful hands. If you like this, you ought to thank her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena retreated out of the frame, somewhat embarrassed. She wasn't used to be watched by strangers, though there were only a few at that point. The stream viewcount was growing surprisingly quickly though, considering Eric hadn't even started a game yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CosplayGirl91:</b> \"Do you have any more examples of Elena's work? I'd love some more inspiration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric noticed. \"Hey Elena, mind if I link them your website?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena nodded. \"Sure I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo I'm posting a link in chat. Check it out if you want to see what Elena's all about.\" Eric got the website from Elena and typed it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit more time talking about the costume and receiving compliments he'd perhaps rather not have gotten, Eric eventually got into a game. His viewcount was already about what it had been near the peak of his last stream. He had no idea just dressing up as a character could get him so much exposure. Maybe someone had made a post about how similar he looked to Mercy or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric picked Mercy, obviously. And got ready to focus. He really wanted to give his best performance, partly because his views were as high as they had ever been for Overwatch, and partly because he was dressed as Mercy. Wouldn't want the Avatar of Mercy to disappoint, after all. Plus he had some new tactics thought out from talking with Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the game went on, Becky and Elena monitored Ericka's chat partially. Elena was a bit distracted by actually watching her play, so it was up to Becky to catch anything her sister might want to hear. The chat was overwhelmingly positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>l1IIll1I1lI:</b> \"Did you see her positioning on the last play? That was pro level shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>xX_SniperAssassin_Xx:</b> \"sick that she's willing too pull out the pistol. Too many Mercy's are too timid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WoverAtch:</b> \"@xX_SniperAssassin_Xx good aim too. this might be the best Mercy stream out there. most streamers don't play her and the girls that do tend to be pretty bad I find\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>xX_SniperAssassin_Xx:</b> \"yeah she might be the best female player ive watched. Most are pretty bad i think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>sneakycymbals:</b> \"Hey there are plenty of good female overwatch players out there. Not to take away from ErickaBoom's play though. She's incredible :D\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so on. Becky called some of them out to Ericka as she read. Ericka thanked people for the kind words, ignoring the emphasis on her gender. Becky was happy to see her sister appreciating the attention. She hoped that this would keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEricka finished the stream rather late in the evening. Becky was dog tired, but staying up with her sister had been worth it. Elena had already fallen asleep on the couch.</span></div></div>",

I dunno how you manage to keep your attention on the game and keep up the cheery demeanor this late in the evening. Morning now, really.\" Becky was impressed with Ericka's constitution. She didn't look tired at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's just fun. I get into it. I'm tired now though. I need to get this costume off too.\" Eric said, gesturing vaguely to his whole body. \"It's actually really comfortable, but the wings get in the way. Help me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Becky stirred herself, stretching and slinking off Ericka's bed. She walked over to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEricka pointed out the spine and cinching and explained how to undo it. She slid out, pulling off the leggings and revealing her panties below. She then went back to her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Eric exclaimed. \"My viewcount tonight spiked past 400. That's way more than I've ever gotten. I practically doubled my subscribers too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, good for you. You put a lot of effort into that, glad to see it didn't go unnoticed.\" Becky grabbed Ericka's shoulder affectionately. \"I ought to get going though. I need to get home. Can I borrow your car-- oh right..\" Becky trailed off, remembering that her sister's car was still in the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stay the night if you want.\" Eric shrugged. \"Looks like Elena already is.\" He gestured to her sleeping form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I owe you.\" Becky walked into the bathroom. She did what she could to clean up before going to sleep, using the stuff she had given to Ericka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure there's something for you to wear to sleep. This was all your clothing originally.\" Becky heard Ericka say. She grunted her assent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both lapsed into deep sleep shortly after. Becky's thoughts were of how much closer she and Ericka had been in the last few days than they had been in years. She'd always wanted a younger sister, and it was great to finally have one. Becky had been really enjoying the time they had been spending together recently. She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was awakened roughly by Elena holding his shoulders and shaking him back and forth. \"Wake up sleepyheads! It's getting late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uunnng\" Eric groaned, covering his eyes to prevent the harsh light of day from reaching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky responded similarly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena dragged Eric out of bed, revealing the loose shirt and boyshorts he had worn to bed. \"Come on! Come on! Time to change. We've got a SPA day ahead of us. It'll be relaxing after your long night of streaming.\" Elena stood over Eric with a smile, before bounding over to where Becky was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky had been lying on the ground in a pile of clothes and pillows, having opted to neither steal the couch from Elena nor share the bed with Ericka. She could have, but thought her sister deserved her unperturbed rest. She rose stiffly, not wanting to receive the same treatment Ericka had had at the violent hands of Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose you could drop me at my house on the way to your spa trip.\" Becky rubbed the sleep out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Elena responded in the affirmative. \"We'll need to leave a bit earlier to make the appointment I set up, but that's not a problem. We still have like half an hour or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spa first thing in the morning? I wasn't prepared for this.\" Eric complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, you had long night last night, fun though it may have been.\" Becky pointed out. \"You deserve some relaxation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You owe it to yourself.!\" Elena agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" Eric conceded. \"I'll guess I'll throw together a quick breakfast then, it's the least I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later they were out the door. Elena went a small ways out of the way to drop Becky off. She and Eric arrived at the spa not long after.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Elena drove to the spa, Eric couldn't help but wonder what she had done to warrant getting a free trip for two. She also had free reign over the entire machine shop for the hardware store for a favor as well. Didn't she only work as a barista and make cosplay or whatever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say,\" Eric asked. \"What'd you do to get this free spa trip anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I just helped Amelia out with a thing.\" Elena said vaguely. \"I do a lot of favors. Like with Ericson I fixed the mill in the hardware store. I'm good with materials and construction and precise stuff so there's a lot of little things I can help out with. Like at the club I fixed their stage. I've even helped a friend of mine out with some top secret research projects of hers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Top secret research project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not really 'top secret', but I'm not supposed to say a lot about it. Something something trade secrets or whatever. They needed help building some sort of large tank for water or something, since their equipment wasn't good for larger scale stuff, so she brought me in. It was pretty fun actually. Like they had a bunch of really specific stuff, openings and the like that needed to be in precise spots, so it was like everything I was good at. Big project, but with a lot of details. I thrive on that stuff. So now a science lab owes me a favor.\" Elena gave Eric a wink. \"Along with several other people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Eric was surprised. \"So, like, do you ever think about monetizing your repair skills? I mean that sort of thing probably pays better than working at a coffee place right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's not consistent right. Well, at least not until I can get my costume building thing up and running.\" Elena looked wistfully off, somewhat worryingly considering she was driving. \"It pays the bills fine. I think favors are more useful than hard cash though as long as I'm not struggling to make ends meet. Like all that stuff at the hardware wouldn't have been possible with whatever the going rate is for minor industrial repairs I'm sure. And then we wouldn't have had the treat of seeing Mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric blushed. \"I guess I get that. I dunno it's just for me, I'd take the cash. I'm running on borrowed time at my place. I can't even use the salon money to pay rent since I need to repair my car. My Mom's cutting me off after June.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena nodded. \"It'll work out though. You got how many viewers last night? Some obscene amount.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Eric agreed. \"Hopefully it will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well today is for relaxing, so don't stress about stuff! That's against the rules at the spa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No stressing.\" Eric considered. \"Got it, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation died down. Eventually Eric and Elena made it to the spa, a rather fancy looking place that was somewhat out of the way. Not in any sort of shopping center, but rather out towards the hills. The structure was built into the ground. The front of it paneled, unpainted wood, but with sealant or something on it to protect from the elements. Eric thought it had an almost rustic sort of look, but that the sign, glass doors and structure all seemed too clean to really keep that going. He honestly thought it sort of clashed, but maybe it was just a modern art thing. Too advanced for his plebeian tastes. It didn't look bad, he supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Elena got out of the car and walked up to the building. Upon entering, Eric saw a front area more fitting for a high class sort of country club establishment. The front desk was polished stone. The walls had various pictures of people fishing, riding horses or whatever other strange thing Eric guessed rich people would do. It was above his pay grade to be honest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe from room led directly into the locker rooms, with the men's on the right and women's on the left. Behind the front desk were doors that presumably opened into an employee area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena walked up to the front counter confidently. Eric trailed behind, feeling out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya\" Elena greeted. \"I've got two vouchers for the 'full service'.\" She brandished the coupons at the receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" The receptionist took the vouchers. \"If you'll just make your way into the locker room and shower up, we'll have people waiting for you right outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" Elena set off to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric walked to the right before he was stopped by Elena, who jogged over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly.\" Elena laughed. \"That's the way to the men's locker room. Follow me.\" Elena dragged Eric off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, but shouldn't I...\" Eric protested feebly. He was pulled into the women's locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's shower up.\" Elena began stripping. \"Come on.\" She said to the uncertain Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena got completely naked. \"Well, you'll catch up. The shower stalls are off down tho the right.\" Elena gestured down a hallway. \"Just put your stuff in a locker and grab a robe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric went completely white. How was he supposed to deal with this? Didn't Elena know he wasn't a girl. \"I, uh.. I don't really feel comfortable getting completely naked.\" Eric shrunk down. \"I'm, uh, um, embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about it.\" Elena brushed it off. \"They aren't going to look at you naked, it's just for the baths and stuff. Here, I'll even get you privacy. I'll be sure to inform everyone that you're a bit uncomfortable. Just remember that this is what those pills are for. You don't need to be worried about anyone making fun of you for your figure or chest. Be confident.\" Elena patted Eric's shoulder, then walked off towards the showers, grabbing a white, lacy robe as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric flinched at the close contact with a naked woman who obviously was not aware that he was not a woman. How did he mix that up? Hadn't Elena seen him naked? It was just his chest, so he guessed that that was it then? Elena just thought he was a flat chested girl with no confidence? Well I mean she was right about him being very nervous and uncomfortable, but she definitely got the reason wrong. Still, he supposed he'd make it through this. Elena had said not to worry about them seeing him naked. He stripped down, grabbed a lacy robe, then went over to the showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena exited the showers before Ericka. <i>That girl.</i> Elena thought. <i>She really needs to learn to be more confident. She has some sort of crazy complex about her appearance. Honestly she looks fine! If only I could show her that somehow. But Ericka's clearly too caught up on her figure. Her boyishness</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena considered what she could do to help.</span></div></div>",

She accosted the first worked she saw, who just so happened to be waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Elena said, perhaps a bit too forcefully. \"My friend is on her way, but before she gets out here I have special instructions for her treatment. To put it bluntly, she's embarrassed about her figure. Thinks she looks too boyish in general. She's not very developed for her age, so what I'm thinking is she could use a little push. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman Elena had almost violently pulled aside looked unsettled. She was not equipped to handle this sort of situation. How was she supposed to deal with violent patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll, uh, uh.. I'LL GO GET AMELIA FOR YOU!\" She pulled out of Elena's grip and ran off fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena sighed. Not four seconds later Amelia popped out from the nearby hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you insist on frightening my workers so?\" Amelia asked, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was certainly quick.\" Elena commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured something would happen. Though I thought you'd be dismantling some panel that was crooked or something.\" Amelia laughed. \"Anyways I know just the thing for your friend. We can help her look as 'not-boyish' as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you so much Amelia. Really this is great. She needs a confidence boost. What would I do without you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, what would I do without you. This place would have been a borderline wreck without your help. I'll give you and your friend the best.\" Amelia said. \"You know, we just added a new procedure you and your friend might try out. It's electrolysis, but it's much better than most current methods. Faster and less damaging; only a few sessions for completion with no soreness in between. You two can have it along with the day's service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're underselling yourself. This place was great before I came in. I just helped it shine, figuratively. Anyways we'd love the procedure. I'm sure it'll be great.\" Elena gave a smile. \"Can I get my bath really salted like that one time though? Everything else should be the same as normal, but I like the super saltwater bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Amelia agreed. \"I'll inform the workers. Once your friend is out just make your way to the massage area to begin. You'll only be splitting up for your friend's hormonal treatment, which won't take long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" Elena waited. Amelia walked away, hips swaying and heels clicking on the tiled floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Eric made his way awkwardly into the hallway. Elena was waiting impatiently, but when she saw him she perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! We're starting with a massage. Follow me and don't. stress. about. anything.\" Elena instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. You lead boss.\" Eric replied, mildly amused out how serious Elena was being. \"I'll be sure not to stress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Elena lead him down the hall with practiced ease. She clearly knew her way around the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massage and baths and so on went without a hitch. Originally Eric was a bit worried about someone seeing him naked, but after time went on the fear was assuaged. The spa workers were quite considerate of his privacy. The treatments were also very relaxing. Eric felt tension that he didn't even realize he'd built up over the past several days drain from him, leaving him relaxed and lethargic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a stint getting a foot massage and pedicure that Eric was too relaxed to be bothered by, Elena directed him down a different path than she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up.\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got you a special. Tailor made for you. It'll help you with your worries. They'll tell you where to go once you're done.\" Elena explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not getting it too?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm not as self-conscious as you, no offense.\" Elena said. Perhaps a bit too callously, she worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken. Lord knows I've been a bit on edge.\" Eric sighed. \"It'll be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Elena gently pushed him towards the door he was supposed to enter. \"Good luck.\" Elena winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric entered, trying not to be uncertain. It was weird not sharing the room with Elena at the spa. His worry was quickly assuaged by the presence of a spa worker in the room with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just lie down and close your eyes. I'll wait outside for a moment while you get settled, and once I come back in we'll begin.\" The worker stepped out of the room and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric took the opportunity to pull off his robe and lie on the cushy table in the middle of the room, taking care to cover his behind with a towel, just in case. Eventually the worker reentered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we've got a procedure to help you with what Amelia describes as a 'stress problem'.\" The worker tried to word it gently. She'd gotten harsh words from Amelia about doing everything possible to not draw attention the this patron's figure, or lack thereof. \"It's going to use a needle, but don't worry. It won't hurt a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like acupuncture?\" That made sense, Eric had heard about that sort of thing. Some sort of Eastern way to release tension. He was open to try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, like drugs.\" The worker corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric understood. \"Oh ok. I have pills for this already, is that fine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" The worker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just I've heard that you're not supposed to overdose you know. It'll mess up your liver or something?\" Eric thought back to stories about prozac and whatnot staying in your system for a long time. It was like binge drinking alcohol for several days straight. Or maybe it gave you ulcers or something? Eric wasn't actually sure what the dangerous of too much anti-anxiety drugs were. Hell he didn't even know exactly what he was taking; he was just trusting Elena and the fact that the drugs were presumably over-the-counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. The stuff we've got here is pretty newfangled and fancy. It'll be quicker acting. Like, you'll get results in a week. It's safe though. Won't fuck up your liver or anything. All approved, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worker seemed a little defensive about the safety of the procedure, but if Elena set it up for him it wouldn't be a problem. She had told him not to stress, so he wouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All good.\" Eric said. \"Let's start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe procedure was over in a minute, surprisingly. It was basically nothing. The worker stepped out so he could get dressed again, and he made his way as directed to the room Elena was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe greeted him, then jumped right in to the next thing on the itinerary. \"Next up's electrolysis, but don't worry. Amelia said they have a special version. No redness or soreness and you can put on makeup no problem the next day and so on, so it won't get in the way. Plus it's only like 7 sessions total to get it done. Really it's just better in every way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First top secret scientists, now bleeding edge spa technology.\" Eric joked. \"What are you, a spy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssh!\" Elena affected worry. \"Don't tell anyone, I'm undercover.\" She laughed. Eric laughed along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric received the treatment relaxedly. It felt weird on his face, like someone was freezing it but also heating it. He supposed it was like those masks of cream or whatever that you see people wear in media, but with metal stuff. He didn't think much more about it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle and Sam Gladstone were sitting in the backseat of a very fancy limousine. Having just been picked up from the airport, they were both jet lagged and rather worn out. Not that it stopped them from exploring all the cool features of what was easily the fanciest car they had ever been in. From the mini-fridge to the massaging seats, they tried everything. The driver didn't care, he was separated by a partition and couldn't see or hear them. Finally tiring of the gadgetry, they sat back in their seats. Sixteen year old Kyle took a cola from the fridge, and his fourteen year old brother followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said Sam, breaking the silence as he cracked open his cola, \"What's with the limo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got me.\" answered Kyle with a shrug, \"I know Uncle Mark's pretty well off. Maybe he splurged a bit cause he wants to make a good first impression since he hasn't seen us since we were toddlers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's with us having to come all the way cross-country anyways? Why couldn't we go to the ski resort for the summer with Mom and Megan? How come while they're off in Europe we have to spend the summer with some relative we barely remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard Mom just like I did,\" snapped his brother, tired of the oft repeated question, \"He asked for us to come visit. Aunt Mary and our cousins are on a cruise, so he had the house empty. And in some sort of mid-life realization thing, he decided that he needed to get to know us better since he's got no sons of his own. He even paid for the plane tickets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having really expected a different answer, Sam sat back and drank some of his cola. Both brothers sat silently for a bit before Sam commented,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind you, that plane ride was kinda strange. Everyone I met was acting really weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle half-choked on his drink, sputtering as he held back a laugh. He composed himself and set his face in a faint, but smug, smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam fixed him with a steely gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. Did. You. Do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, some background would probably be useful. Kyle and Sam were average brothers. They played and fought like normal boys. The only really different thing was their never ending prank war. Sure most brothers will pull pranks every now and again, but their war had been going on for years. Though both were tech whizs, most of their pranks were effective in their simplicity. Each prank didn't really have to top the last, no, these boys went for subtlety. Adding glitter to bodywash so one brother came out sparkling like a romanticized vampire. Cutting apart a swimsuit and resewing it with water soluble thread. Putting a hot dog inside the hollow bars of a bicycle so it mysteriously stinks for weeks on end. Sam, in fact, had recently gotten his brother by adding some stitching to the back of Kyle's shirt so it looked like he was wearing a bra underneath. Kyle had yet to get him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me.\" Demanded Sam, \"Tell me what you did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smirked in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you like to know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, tell me now or so help me I will coat your laptop's hard drive in magnets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't!\" gasped Kyle, who loved his laptop like his own son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Neodymium magnets.\" threatened Sam coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright! Sheesh, if you want to know that badly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. Now spill it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sighed, his internal joy at Sam's obliviousness to knowing he'd been pranked was fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Just keep your magnets to yourself. You know that time you went to the bathroom for ages at the beginning of the flight? Well, while you were gone I told everyone, nearby passengers, flight attendants, random people walking by, everyone that you... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, savoring the last moments as he held his brother in panicked distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told them what?!\" Sam sputtered, the suspense choking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that you were a pre-op transsexual going to California for your gender reassignment surgery, and that they should treat you as a normal girl, since you're very sensitive about the issue and are slightly mentally imbalanced!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle said his line quickly in one breath, hoping to catch all of Sam's reaction in a single expression. It succeeded. Sam was dumbstruck, his face contorting between anger, horror, fury, embarrassment, rage, and several other unnamed emotions within seconds. Finally, he managed to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to kill you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said it calmly, as if merely commenting on the weather. \"No seriously, I'm going to go into your room, and smother you with a pillow. Made of spikes. And fire. Dipped in poison. Then I'm going to cut your body into pieces, bake you into pies, and sell you to everyone on that plane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth brothers stared at each other for a long moment, then burst out laughing. Sam was actually still angry that he'd been had, but he tucked that anger away. Later, he'd use it to find the perfect opportunity to create a hopefully ironic revenge. The irony wasn't really necessary, but it would make it so much sweeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they laughed, they felt the limo slow to a stop. The windows were heavily tinted and had fancy curtains on them, so neither boy had bothered looking out. The limo stopped and shut off. They heard the driver get out and come around to their door. He opened it and Sam hopped out. Kyle shuffled across to that side and climbed out as well. In front of them was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before them stood a giant mansion. Made of a creamy white stone, it had columns out front and clearly dozens of rooms. As they were on a hill, they could also see the land stretching out behind the mansion. There was a hedge maze, multiple fancy patios, a field of flowers, and some thick woods off a few hundred meters off. The boys stood there, shell-shocked, their mouths hanging open slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That's a big house.\" Sam managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" replied Kyle, \"I knew Uncle Mark was pretty rich, but still...wow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke, the mahogany front doors opened and a man walked out. He was not quite middle aged, maybe late thirties, early forties at most. He was tall and slightly on the portly side, but not fat. His beard and mustache connected in a short trimmed circle, and his hair was pulled back in a short ponytail. He wore a casual Hawaiian shirt, light blue with pale green palm trees, and khaki shorts. A pair of cheap sunglasses sat on his forehead, and he walked towards them barefoot. Considering him as he approached, the boys concluded that there was no way this could be their uncle. Someone who owned a mansion would not dress like that. Maybe he's the gardener, they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boys!\" he called out jovially, \"You made it! What, don't recognize me? I'm your uncle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're our Uncle?\" asked Kyle, who looked skeptically at the strange man as if he'd just exited an alley and offered to sell a Rolex out of his trench coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course I am, though I suppose it's no wonder you don't remember me. You haven't seen me since you were this high.\" He said, lowering his hand to about knee height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're our uncle,\" Kyle began, \"Then whose house is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, it's mine. Didja think I'd just pick you up outside some random home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's a rich guy's house.\" Sam interjected, \"And rich guys don't dress like that. They wear formal suits and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it took me a long time to get to where I am today. So I figured I'm rich enough now that I can dress however I want.\" He then sheepishly added, \"Plus your Aunt Mary just left yesterday, so I can finally let loose and relax, ya feel me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys smiled. This uncle of theirs seemed to be a pretty cool guy. A bit weird, but still cool. Plus he was rich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you guys want to go in? Where's your luggage, in the trunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle shook his head. \"Mom said that the luggage charge on the plane was ridiculous, so she mailed our bags instead. She said it was cheaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle Mark sighed and looked skyward. \"That mother of yours. I'm sure she's a great mother but I have never seen a woman pinch a penny like my sister. Even when we were kids she would wait to go shopping till she could combine deals and coupons to get stuff for pennies on the dollar. Anyways, let's go in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked towards the front doors as the limo drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Uncle Mark,\" Sam started, \"just how are you so rich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped in his tracks and turned to face hie nephews. \"What? You mean your mother never told you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys shook their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't mention you much.\" Kyle commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh... that's so like her. Forgets to tell her kids about her own brother. Okay then, well, you know NuTech Inc.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" said Kyle sarcastically, \"Who doesn't? It's a technological giant. It makes everything from toys to entertainment to appliances and junk. I've got a Nupod music player right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Uncle Mark began, \"Twenty years ago, NuTech Inc. was called Gladstone Electronics. And it was started in a garage by Jerry Halson, and Jenny and Mark Gladstone. That was my friend, your mother, and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" exclaimed both boys, equally shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Uncle Mark burst into laughter. Nearly crying he doubled over, completely cracking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...oh. It was a joke.\" said Sam dejectedly, \"Don't mess with us like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no it's true,\" Uncle Mark managed to say, finally regaining control, \"It's just...oh man... the looks on your faces when I said that. Ooohh that was priceless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you got all your money from selling the company?\" inquired Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Never sold it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... the Inc. at the end means \"Incorporated\" right? So it's owned by millions of stockholders and run by a board of directors. Maybe you have a controlling interest, but that doesn't really mean you own the company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Uncle Mark started, as he began to break into giggles once more \"the 'Inc.' at the end of the company name is a massive troll I thought of years ago. There are no stockholders. I still own something like 99% of the company. I just pay Jerry the other 1% to run it for me, but he'd happily do it for free, he loves the work so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked towards the house again, Uncle Mark explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, ever since computers began showing up in people's houses, us Gladstones have been geniuses with them. Your mother, myself, even your grandparents were all exceptional with computers and building things. One day, tinkering in the garage with Jerry (who was Jenny's boyfriend at the time), we happened to create something cool and new. We marketed it, and got rich. Jenny managed the company, I provided the main creative force, and Jerry was our public image. Eventually, we grew older, moved apart and all settled down. Jenny left the company after she met your father, but by then the company was big enough that we had many people working for us. Jerry still runs day to day operations and appears as the face of the company. And I... I sit back and create new and cool stuff to market. The whole family does in fact. We're pretty much 75% of the R&amp;D department. Your cousins, Sami and Amy, got the Gladstone tech genes too. In fact, that Nupod you've got there? Your cousin Sami invented it, and Amy wrote the programming. I bet even you boys are probably good with tech too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they reached the doors and entered the house. The front hall was huge. It consisted of a large room with marble flooring, columns along the sides, several doors at the back, and a sweeping staircase in the middle that split into two where it hit the back wall. Each staircase swept along the back wall until they met up with the second floor balconies on the side walls. The balconies were lined with doors of various colors and designs. On the wall where the staircases split there was a larger than life sized portrait of Uncle Mark, Aunt Mary, Sami, and Amy all of whom were dressed to the nines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the boys stood still, awed at the house, Uncle Mark was unimpressed. It was his house after all. Noticing their expressions he said: \"I know, that's a terrible portrait right? We look like a family from Victorian Europe. But your Aunt insists we keep it there to project an air of \"normality\" to any guests. She likes to play the debutante sometimes and occasionally worries that her socialite friends will discover that we're all massive uncultured nerds. Here I'll fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled some sort of remote from his pants pocket and pushed  button on it, aiming it at the painting. With a fluid motion, the picture and frame began to rotate, revealing another picture affixed to the back. As it finished turning, he tucked away the remote back into his pocket. The space now held a larger than life size portrait of Uncle Mark, bare-chested, brandishing a pair of battleaxes, whilst posing heroically atop a hill of bones as skeleton and zombie warriors climbed towards him. His family stood around him in medieval fantasy style armor, brandishing weapons of their own. The backdrop consisted of thunderclouds with a bolt of lightning hitting one raised axe and illuminating their figures. It somehow managed to be both epic and slightly cringey at the same time, and looked quite out of place in the elegant entry hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Much better. Ya like? I had it commissioned.\" he commented, \"Now, would you boys like the tour, or would you wanna explore for yourselves?\"</span></div></div>",

Regardless of his wealth, it was clear that their uncle was an oddball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great,\" Uncle Mark replied, clapping his hands once \"Oh, wait, almost forgot. Boys, step forward about five or so steps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Sam and Kyle did as he said. As they placed their feet on the last step, they heard a voice emanate from the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Gladstone Villa, GUEST_1 and GUEST_2.\" said a smooth female voice, though it put a strange accent on \"guest\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet MARCI\" proclaimed Uncle Mark proudly, \"our Intelligent House. She's incredibly interactive and controls the whole house. We've been building her into the walls and existing systems for years. Her name's an acronym for something really clever, but none of us remember what it was. The girls and I all have user accounts in her database, so she'll call us by name and keep track of our schedules and such. Right now, you two are guests, but I'll set you up some accounts later so you can start personalizing. She's really amazing. Watch this. MARCI?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master Gladstone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change the floor in the main entrance please, random pattern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath their feet, the elegant marble floor began to fade in color, revealing that it was some kind of advanced screen. The black and white marble faded to solid white, before new colors started to appear, greens and reds. Within seconds, the once marble floor was now a vibrant plaid. If the boys didn't know better, they'd have sworn they were standing on the the kilt of a Scottish giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool stuff right?\" beamed Uncle Mark, \"Like I said, we invent a lot of gadgets to market, but we always keep the coolest stuff for ourselves. Most of it's not economically feasible to mass produce anyway. Well, what are you waiting for? You wanted to explore, so explore! If you need anything, just politely ask MARCI, or contact me on the intercom. I'll be in the kitchen making some dinner. Is brick-oven pizza okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys nodded, but Sam had a question. \"What does the intercom look like, in case I need to use it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle Mark gave him a look like he'd just asked how much coal a computer ran on, then answered. \"It's an intercom. It's a feature, built in. It's like on Star Trek. Please tell me you've seen that at least? Just say \"contact Mark\" and some of the digital wallpaper near you will render into a video display connected to the kitchen, or where ever I happen to be at the time. Most of the basic operations are pretty intuitive. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys nodded, eager to explore the futuristic tech house of their dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well go on then!\" Uncle Mark chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Uncle Mark!\" They called out, dashing up the stairs, one taking a left, the other a right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can drop the \"uncle\" bit!\" he yelled back, cupping his hands around his mouth like a megaphone, \"we're all family here!\" And then to himself, \"Plus it makes me feel like an old man.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should we follow?</span></div></div>",

He poked his head in the first.  It was an entertainment center, with a huge Tv and massive sound system. He looked in the next doorway. It was a bathroom as big as his bedroom back home, equipped with some devices he didn't even recognize. The next door. Some kind of workshop filled with half assembled or half disassembled electronics. Oddly, the walls were pink. Coming to the end of the hall, he found a large room that seemed to be entirely storage. As he closed the door, he heard a beep on the wall next to him. Turning, Sam saw that part of the wall had changed and now showed a pulsing blue dot. He pressed it. An image of his uncle appeared with a backdrop of a fancy modern kitchen. He had some flour and a sheepish look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam,\" he started \"You're brother just called me up with an important question I forgot about. He asked where the guest bedrooms were so he could pick a room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was wondering that too.\" Said Sam, \"Where are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the trouble,\" Uncle Mark replied, \"There are none. The house had seven bedrooms when we bought the place, but we converted one into a workshop, one into a library, and two into an indoor pool. I'm sorry to say it, but you're gong to have to crash in either Sami's or Amy's room. The girls are 'bout your ages, at least. But don't worry! They're not too girly! Both my daughters are pretty technologically inclined, but they do have some notable feminine touches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's okay,\"Sam said hesitantly, \"as long as there're no unicorns or ponies or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fret bucko,\" Uncle Mark replied, smiling, \"They grew out of those years ago. Let me pull up a map so you can go check then out. Remember, first come, first serve on who gets which.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his image vanished, a simple map appeared of the floor Sam was on. He was indicated by a red dot and another dot indicated Kyle way across the building. Two rooms were also highlighted in blue, one near him and one near Kyle. He headed for the nearest one, which was two hallways over. He found himself in a hallway with deep blue walls. It was also filled with small tables and pedestals each containing some strange piece of what seemed to be abstract art. Sam picked one up and examined it. It was spherical, but with a flat base, and covered in swirling black and white patterns. He found two metal nubs on the top and a LCD screen on one side behind a removable piece. Obviously the art was some sort of device, but he put it back on it's pedestal since he had no idea what it was. He noticed the word \"Amy\" written on the door next to him in glittery letters. Opening the door, he walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of room was it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't too bad, the room could have been much girlier. The room was large and shaped like a sideways L. The door was at the center of the long side of it. There was a large four poster bed at the turn with light pink sheets. At the end of the long side was a desk with some papers, a lamp, and a few electronic components. In between there was a pair of bean bag chairs and a medium sized Tv built into the wall. There was also a small bookshelf and an end-table next to the bed, the second of which had something screen-like built into the top. Sam walked in and around the corner. It turned out that the room was more U shaped, and turning the corner led to another corner (and a vanity), which led to a bathroom with tub and shower. Filling up the space between the two parts of the room was an enormous walk-in-closet accessed by a sliding door near the bathroom. Overall, excluding the pink sheets and a few scattered plushies and posters, the room wasn't too girly. Curious, he went over to the end-table with the odd screen on top. The top rotated, and he turned it so the single button faced himself as he squatted on the floor. Pressing the button, he was greeted by the appearance of a holographic screen floating before his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wicked...\" He breathed, impressed by the tech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt presented him with a simple login page.<br>\r\nUSER: AMY GLADSTONE<br>\r\nPASS: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally he would have stopped, morality kicking in and telling him not to go poking around in what was apparently his cousins personal computer. But the sudden occurrence of an idea made him pause. If he could get into the computer systems before his and Kyle's profiles were finished, he could play his best prank ever. Driven by his newfound idea, even as it was still forming in his head, he began the task of deciphering the password of girl he'd met once or twice nearly ten years before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started with the basics: \"password\", \"amy\", \"amygladstone\", before he realized that a tech-savvy girl like her would never use something so obvious. He looked around the room for inspiration. Noticing a popular boy band poster on the wall, he remembered an old trick a friend from school had once told him. Complex passwords filled with symbols and numbers swapped with letters are both hard to remember and really easy for hacking software to crack. But, a combination of even just four short random words can be easily remembered by a image or mnemonic device, yet are ridiculously hard to crack with a computer. Remembering this, he decided to try the names of the band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the names of the band's members in mind, he got the password right in four attempts, just before it would have locked him out of the system. What appeared was like a regular desktop screen, but in three dimensions. With a bit of hunting, he managed to find a \"House Systems\" folder. From there, through trial and elimination, he worked his way through \"House Systems\", \"MARCI\", \"Operating Files\", \"Users\". At \"Users\" he had an immense stroke of luck. Uncle Mark had apparently began making user accounts for him and Kyle, but had stopped after only their names and pictures. Entering Kyle's User controls, he created a hidden folder and opened Notepad. Quickly, he wrote out a paragraph of code indecipherable to any normal person, but clear as day to him. When he was finished, he saved it as a \".bat\" file so the computer would run it as a program. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a simple virus really, but once it was activated, its effects would readily become apparent. Wanting the program to stay secret as long as possible, he decided to change Amy's password. He would never even consider doing such a thing normally, but he was more focused on revenge than ethics. Besides, she'd be gone for over two months. It's not like she'd be logging in anytime soon. He glanced around the room for inspiration. Glancing to a pile of books by the bed he decided, on a whim, to use the first word in every title. The end result was over seventy characters long; almost guaranteed uncrackable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent in his security and his program, he logged out of the computer, and left the room to explore the rest of the house, reminding himself to make sure to insist that he should get Sami's room later.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After leaving his code in place, Sam headed off to the kitchen to check in on the pizza. As expected, it was delicious. During the meal, while his brother had his mouth full, Sam made sure to request Sami's room. Kyle, silenced by cheese, was unable to object. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Uncle Mark mentioned that they should begin filling out their profiles when they had time. With quick thinking, Sam was able to derail the conversation by asking if there were any game consoles in the house. Rather than just the conversation, his question ended up derailing the entire evening and late into the night. Mark turned out to be quite an avid gamer, and his custom virtual reality system was years ahead of anything on the market. Nothing held the trio's thoughts that night save for swords, spaceships, and digital brawling. They all found their way to their rooms at nearly three in the morning, where all three quickly fell into deep slumbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, MARCI began her boot-up sequence automatically. This was entirely normal and happened everyday. Diagnostics were run, schedules collated, weather analyzed, and all the other background processes even regular computers did to rev up. However, today the computer discovered an error. As it tried to analyze the profiles of current household members it found itself trapped in a feedback loop. Attempting to access the files on User_Amy redirect its systems to the files on User_Kyle. Accessing the files of User_Kyle in turn redirected back to User_Amy. Finding itself trapped in a loop, MARCI activated the meta-cognitive troubleshooter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meta-cognitive troubleshooter was a program still in the testing portion of it's creation. It's purpose was to analyze technical problems from a human perspective (or as best an approximation as the Gladstone family could program) and enact repairs and patches. It was a learning system as well, designed to recognize new or repeating problems and take new actions accordingly. Viewing the trouble code, it analyzed the loop and decided that the it was the result of human programming error. Clearly, a programmer had meant for one file to reference the other, but had instead had made them both reference the other. Now it merely had to determine which file was meant to be referenced by the other. It peered into the contents of the personal accounts. One was full of years worth of personalization, preferences, schedules, and subroutines. The other was practically blank. Making the logical decision, it proceeded to copy relevant data from the first file into all the unfilled sections of the second; namely, everything except name and identification photo. It briefly encounter a roadblock in the form private user-protected files, but the advanced system quickly worked around the lack of authorization leaving scrambled firewalls and passwords in it's wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this took place within a fraction of a second as the meta-cognitive troubleshooter deactivated, as satisfied as a machine can be with it's work. The main computer resumed it's normal initialization sequences. As it's schedule dictated, Amy required a wake-up call for her morning practice. Systems slowly revved to life in room, though their sound was drowned out by the boy snoring in a pile on top of Amy's bed. Noting Amy's absence, the computer nevertheless continued it's processes, since it's systems showed this user to have the same schedule and requirements. The soft voice of MARCI drifted quietly into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning mistress. It is time to wake up.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is so cool!\u201d He thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower notified Kyle when to turn so that each and every angle of his body was thoroughly scrubbed. A helmet attached to a tube lowered from the ceiling. A panel told Kyle to place it on his head, which he did. He could feel the helmet lathering and washing his hair, although he did catch a slight whiff of strawberries from the shampoo. He\u2019d have to adjust that before tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Kyle thought he had been cleaned, the shower indicated for him to remain o place as the whirling brushes did more passes. He smelled a noxious odor as some new cleaning agent was applied automatically to the shower scrubbers. It wasn\u2019t until he turned to have his front scrubbed again that he noticed all his body hair was being scrubbed right off of him. He danced, trying to get out of reach of the brushes, but there simply was no place to dodge them in the shower stall. He tried to push the stall door open, but it was locked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned to his fate, he thought it would be over soon. He then smelled a floral scent and felt the brushes applying lotion to his body, softening his now hairless skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a \u201cding\u201d and the brushes retracted, stopping their spinning. The helmet was pulled off of his head, leaving a pleasant strawberry scented mop of long, wet, blonde hair cascading down his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the shower, a towel, held in several vertical rods was waiting for him. Kyle reached for it, but the two rods moved toward him, putting the towel under his outstretched arm, and wrapping it tightly around his body, just like a girl would. While that was going on, a blast of air pushed his hair up where a few more rods holding a towel caught it and wrapped it up, turban style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle blinked. If anyone could see him standing there, he would look very much like an undeveloped teen girl that just stepped out of the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid bathroom,\u201d he mumbled, as he lowered the towel to his waist. Much to his surprise, that towel was pulled off of him and the rods applied another towel, wrapping it around his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201d he was starting to get a very bad feeling about this. </span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t wait to get out of this stuff,\u201d Kyle said, starting to fidget. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a sec...\u201d Sam typed away some more. He created a self-repairing backup, hidden, that would restore all of his just edited commands, in case anyone was able to get in and change them. His brother was going to have an interesting summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.

It was now or never. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause. \u201cUser found.\u201d Sam exhaled and bit his lip, trying not to laugh. \u201cWhat May I do for you today?\u201d MARCI continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to get out of this crazy outfit and into some clothes that are more me,\u201d Kyle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d MARCI said. \u201cPlease step into the bathroom to begin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam made a sweeping gesture to wards the bathroom door. Kyle looked back at his brother and then stepped into the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed, Sam heard the water start, and the brushes beginning to whir. He waited patiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few long minutes, the fun started. \u201cHey... no!  Wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUser Kylie\u2019s parameters do not match!\u201d MARCI said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said stop you... Ow!  No!  Wait!  I\u2019m not...OOOOF!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some thuds and bangs and apparently MARCI had the upper hand. There was the sound of some blowers and a loud, \u201cSAM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom door reopened, and Kyle was ushered back into the bedroom glaring at Sam, his hiair wrapped in a towel, turban style, and a towel wrapped around his now curvy chest and body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was deposited in the middle of the room. A hot pink thong was uncerimoniously slid up his legs and pulled sharply into place as the towel around his body was removed, revealing two pert breasts on \u201cKylie\u2019s\u201d chest. They were rapidly engulfed by a hot pink push-up bra that matched his thong. Standing there, Sam<br>\r\nNoticed that his brother\u2019s belly button was now pierced, and a small \u201cplayboy bunny\u201d charm was dangling from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hot pink spandex miniskirt was slid up Kyle\u2019s smooth legs. However, there was a telltale bulge showing at Kyle\u2019s crotch. \u201cMy apologies, Kylie,\u201d MARCI said, \u201cI seem to have overlooked something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was near tears laughing as Kyle was dragged back into the bathroom. \u201cGet off me you stupid.. what are... DON\u2019t!!\u201d Kyle shouted. Kyle then whimpered loudly and was again, dragged out of the bathroom to be finished being prepared. His waist was narrow and flat, his crotch smooth, and his perky ass was barely covered by the miniskirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turban was removed to reveal long, damp, blonde hair that went halfway down Kyle\u2019s back. A white belly tee was lowered over him, having pink trim to match his skirt, and the word \u201cPink\u201d emblazoned over his new breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sagged, defeated as he was again seated at the vanity, his legs crossed for him. A dome descended, as a vacuum pulled the damp hair up and into the dome. A mask settled over Kyle\u2019s face as he \u201cmmmphed\u201d in protest. Sam could hear blowers and motors going. The manicure/pedicure machines proceeded to redo Kyle\u2019s nails. This lasted several minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dome and mask lifted, Kyle\u2019s blonde hair was cascading in soft waves around his face and down his back. His makeup was flawless. His brows sat in perfect feminine arches above his eyes. His false lashes fluttered with every blink. His lips were glossy and pink to match his clothing. His ears were sporting multiple earrings, including a large gold hoop in each. He had a soft pink French manicure on squared off nails with his toes matching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost done, Kylie,\u201d MARCI said as he was returned to the dressing area. Hot pink stilettos were slid onto his feet. His hair was sprayed with hairspray.  A few rings were slid onto his fingers, along with a bracelet and anklet. A silver necklace with a script \u201cKylie\u201d was draped around his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow to make you smell nice,\u201d MARCI added. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Kylie, the pheromones in the perfume will attract your desired attention.\u201d As a nozzle sprayed strategic points on Kyle\u2019s now feminine body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam took it all in. Kyle looked like a boy hungry 17 year old bimbo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d Kyle started. And took a wobbly step towards Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that will never do!\u201d MARCI said, an arm appearing and pinching Kyle\u2019s nose together. He opened his mouth and another arm appeared and sprayed something into his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle coughed a few times. \u201cThere. Perfect.\u201d MARCI said. \u201cEnjoy your day, Kylie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the coughing stopped, Kyle took another step towards Sam, \u201cYou\u2019d better run... my voice!\u201d  The spray had given Kyle a rather sexy feminine voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was stunned. He then refocused his anger on Sam, who was still laughing, holding onto his sides, tears streaming out of his eyes. \u201cWhen i get a hold of you....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s rage was interrupted by a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello!\u201d Someone called from downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m the neighbor!  Your uncle said he had relatives around my age visiting?  I\u2019m Darla!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle grabbed Sam by his shirt collar and got in his face, \u201cYou asshole!

Get into the bathroom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle shoved Sam, letting his shirt loose, \u201cYou\u2019d better!  Then you\u2019re going to fix this. Then I\u2019m going to kick your ass!\u201d  He stormed into the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d Darla called again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked around the room. He left, closing the door behind him.  \u201cUm... up here.  Hang on a sec.\u201d. He wanted to get away from the room where Kyle was but to his dismay, Darla appeared from around the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cute!  Long dark hair, piercing blue eyes, a warm smile on her face!  \u201cThere you are!\u201d She said. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, your Uncle said it was Ok to let myself in. He thought it may be nice for you to get to know people your age this summer. You must be Sam, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kyle had his ear pressed up against the bathroom door. \u201cShit!\u201d He whispered when he heard the muffled sounds of a conversation just outside of the room. \u201cWhat am I going to do!  Think, Kyle!  Think!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided that the best place to hide and stay silent was as far from the door as he could get, which was the shower stall. He tiptoed across the bathroom, got into the shower, and quietly slid the door shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBody scan indicates user Kylie,\u201d MARCI  suddenly blared. \u201cDo you wish to take a shower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe quiet you stupid machine!\u201d Kyle hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cResponse unclear,\u201d MARCI again intoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Sam winced when he clearly heard MARCI activate again. What had his stupid brother done now?  Was he trying to undo the changes on his own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Darla asked, peering over Sam\u2019s shoulder?  \u201cIs that your brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the bathroom, MARCI again asked, \u201cDo you wish to take a shower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Kyle hissed loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the absence of a clear response I\u2019m going to assume that you wish to begin a cleansing and dressing sequence.  Enjoy your shower!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms came out and roughly disrobed Kyle. Within moments, he was again being subjected to the cleansing brushes and floral scents of MARCI\u2019s shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam heard the water running outside the door and panicked. What was going on in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re kinda busy...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like someone\u2019s getting ready. I can wait!  It\u2019ll be nice to show you two around and introduce you to people!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Kyle was dragged out of the bathroom and promptly redressed and restyled in exactly the same outfit as before. Apparently that was his clothing for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the blowers going, Darla said, \u201cSounds like he\u2019s finishing up getting ready!\u201d  She knocked on the door. \u201cAre you decent?  Can I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sam said, trying to get himself between Darla and the door, but it was too late. She opened the door slowly and said, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Darla....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there stood Kyle in all his tomboyish teen girl glory, looking aghast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!  I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Darla said. \u201cI thought...\u201d she peered at the necklace around Kyle\u2019s neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped to some conclusions. \u201cYou doofus,\u201d she said, playfully smacking Sam\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNow I get why you were acting so weird. You could have just said that you didn\u2019t have a brother, but a sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought your uncle said her name was Kyle, and I just assumed it was two guys!\u201d  She smiled broadly. \u201cNo harm done.  And it\u2019s great to meet you Kylie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... same,\u201d Kyle said, mortified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun!  You seem shy!  Not to worry, I\u2019ll get both of you introduced around.  And there\u2019s lots to do, too!  Your uncle said he didn\u2019t want the two of you messing around inside all summer, so he called me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Sam, \u201ci\u2019ll Introduce you to the guys.  They do a lot of team video games, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019d love another player!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beamed at Kyle, \u201cAnd no wallflowers here!  My girls are going to love hanging out with you, Kylie!  There\u2019s lots of great shopping, and Melissa has this great pool to relax by!  Do you have a bikini?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, we\u2019re going to have a great time this summer!\u201d Darla said, taking Sam\u2019s and Kyle\u2019s arms in her\u2019s. \u201cC\u2019mon.

Haven't seen him since we were kids.\" Sam replied. \"So, do you know Sami and Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I know Sami and Amy? That's a silly question! I'm practically their sister given how much we hang out. Still can't believe they ditched us for the summer to go on a cruise.\" Darla replied. \"Don't worry, we promise not to say how much cooler they are... to your faces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla laughed as Kyle fidgeted in his unfamiliar clothes. They came upon a large driveway, leading to another mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we're all meeting at Melissa's house today. Her dad just installed a new 4K TV in their gaming room.\" Darla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds cool.\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla walked up to the gate and punched in a code. The gate opened and she led the two into the compound, before heading to the door. Darla knocked on the door, which opened practically immediately. Behind the door was a redhead around Darla's age, presumably Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These must be Sami and Amy's cousins...\" Melissa looked them both up and down. \"I thought you said it was two boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must've heard wrong. This is Sam and Kylie. Sam and Kylie, meet Melissa.\" Darla introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same.\" Kyle looked down at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on inside.\" Melissa motioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three entered the house and they walked down a long corridor. Like Uncle Mark's, the place was huge and gorgeous, though without the obvious tech flair of the Gladstone family. They turned into a short staircase that led into a movie theater-like room with two rows of chairs set up. Sam and Kyle both gaped as they entered, impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.\" Sam remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, these are Sam and Kylie.\" Darla said, presenting the two to the rest of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Gang\" it turns out included Darla, Melissa, two guys named Liam and Eli and another girl named Robin. Despite Kyle's initial hesitance, it wasn't all that bad once pleasantries were out of the way. Apart from getting pulled into \"girl talk\" by Darla, Melissa and Robin, being Kylie wasn't all that bad, for the time being. Kyle kept trying to urge Sam to make up an excuse, but he was too distracted by the gaming console and between the three boys (that weren't dressed like girls), they had an intense tournament going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kylie. They're probably going to be a while.\" Darla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry if you wanted to play, but they always get like this.\" Melissa said. \"We'll probably get a turn later. But in the meantime, I think we might hit the pool or just relax outside and tan a bit. Wanna come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Kyle started. \"I don't have a suit with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that far back to your uncle's, we'll wait to go in if you need a few minutes to change.\" Darla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Kyle started again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it'll be fun.\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me just ask my brother something.\" Kyle excused himself and walked over to where Sam was sitting, furiously tapping buttons on a controller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam...\" Kyle whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sam absentmindedly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They want me to go in the pool with them.\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure, go ahead.\" Sam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam...\" Kyle urged, but Sam brushed him off and kept playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle rolled his eyes and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me run home and get a suit...\" Kyle said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle sighed. Sam was engrossed in his game on not helping him avoid this torture that was all his fault!  But then he realized it was his ticket out of this mess. He could slip back to the house on this pretext and try to get MARCI reprogrammed. Perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019ll run back to my Uncle\u2019s and change!\u201d Kyle said, appreciating the truth in that statement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!  Hurry back!\u201d Melissa said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle jogged back to his Uncle\u2019s. The first thing he did upon getting indoors was try to pull that stupid wedgie from his thong out. He wanted to change clothes, but he had nothing to change into.  Plus, not knowing that much about this house, he really didn\u2019t want to sit around naked, just in case MARCI\u2019s programming prevented it. She\u2019d already mentioned that he had to be dressed for guests....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing upstairs to the dreaded room, Kyle dashed n, grabbed his laptop, and made a beeline out of the room before something worse could happen to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set up shop in the kitchen, getting on the network and trying to get into MARCI\u2019s programming like Sam had. But Kyle\u2019s programming and hacking skills weren\u2019t quite up to his brother\u2019s level, so he sat there, gloomily trying to think of possible passwords his brother used. He had three attempts left when he was startled by a knock on the patio door behind him. He turned to see Darla, Melissa, and Robin, in their bikinis, standing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Kylie!\u201d Darla called. \u201cYou can check Facebook later!  Go get your bathing suit on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201d Kyle\u2019s mind was a blank as he tried desperately to think of a reason to not change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I have a new bikini that I haven\u2019t worn at my house if you don\u2019t have one, Kylie!\u201d Melissa added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle blinked. Given the lack of fabric on the girl\u2019s bikinis, he was pretty sure that he did not want to wind up wearing something like Melissa\u2019s string bikini she had on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slumped his shoulders, knowing he had to turn himself over to MARCI again.  \u201cOK, OK,\u201d he called out. \u201cI\u2019ll go change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle turned and trudged upstairs, not unlike his walking to the gallows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa nudged Robin. \u201cIs it me, or does she not realize how cute she is?  I mean, get her in the right bathing suit and the guys would be all over her, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCompletely,\u201d Robin said, watching Kyle sulk off. \u201cWonder why she doesn\u2019t realize that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle got upstairs to his room and stepped inside. \u201cMARCI?\u201d He called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, mistress?\u201d MARCI\u2019s chipper voice responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need...\u201d he swallowed hard, \u201c... a bathing suit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Mistress, I have several...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on,\u201d Kyle said, cutting MARCI off for once. \u201cI do not want to be in display. I was to be covered as much as possible. I do not want to show too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood, mistress. I have just the style!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the arms came out and undressed Kyle. He was finally free of the annoying thong, and it was nice having the right jeans off. A halter top was tied around his torso, supporting his new breasts, and a pair of rather short spandex shorts were slid up his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u201d MARCI said.  \u201cJust a moment, mistress.  Something seems off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shorts were pulled to his knees and an arm came out and positioned his genitals up and into his body.  A cold adhesive spray was applied and allowed to dry.   When MARCI pulled his shorts back up, he had nothing that showed anything other than teen girl showing. Some flip flops were slid onto his manicured feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere.  Ready for your activity, mistress.  If you\u2019d like, I can contact a doctor regarding that growth you seem to have developed.  I have also provided a beach towel for you.\u201d  An arm deposited a towel wth a unicorn on it on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing the worst, Kyle quickly said, \u201cNo, MARCI!  I don\u2019t want you to do anything about my... growth. I\u2019ll handle it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, mistress.\u201d MARCI responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle ran to the vanity and looked at himself in the mirror. He was stunned to see just how.... girlish he looked. He still felt like he was exposed, but it had to be better than one of those skimpy suits the other girls....  he corrected himself... the girls had on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart pounding, he hoped he wouldn\u2019t be exposed he grabbed the towel  and slowly went downstairs and back into the kitchen. He peered around the corner, fearing the worst, but Robin saw him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019on, Kylie!\u201d She said.  \u201cLet\u2019s get going!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly stepped around the corner, head down, trying to cover himself with his hands, trying to make himself small and invisible. His face burned red with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s your bathing suit?\u201d Darla asked, apparently surprised. Kyle nodded, sheepishly, certain he was going to be called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKylie, you need to show your body off more,\u201d Melissa said.  \u201cYou\u2019re cute, and that outfit may give the guys the impression you\u2019re not really interested in attracting their attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s head shot up in surprise. \u201cI\u2019m not really looking to attract any attention,\u201d Kyle said nervously. \u201cI\u2019m not...  I don\u2019t wear bikinis often.\u201d He added. \u201cI feel exposed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirl, seriously,\u201d  Darla said.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got a hot little body!  Show it off!  Flirt!  And that\u2019s not exposed. You should see some of Melissa\u2019s bikini collection!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get you some proper bikinis tomorrow, Kylie, don\u2019t worry.  We\u2019ll be hanging at the pool a lot, and a girl needs choices.\u201d Melissa said, smiling at the nervous Kylie.  \u201cAnyway, let\u2019s get going, we work on her self esteem at my house. We\u2019re getting near peak tanning time. And it\u2019ll be fun to try to distract the guys from their game.\u201d  She winked at Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to realize how out of his depth he was a girl, Kyle began the walk back to Melissa\u2019s, keeping to himself as the other girls talked. </span></div></div>",

The  girls wondered why that might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to Melissa's, the boys hadn't moved much, apart from picking new seats as they kept playing. Melissa strolled into the room in her bikini and stepped in front of the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna go sunbathe out in the yard.\" Melissa smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool, Liss.\" Liam said. \"Can you stop blocking the screen now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you need us.\" Darla called out as they strolled out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle remained behind for a moment and went back over to Sam. He figured it was time for one last attempt at subtlety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, was there anything we needed to do today?\" he asked. \"Any reason we might have to head home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Sam absentmindedly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kylie, you coming?\" Robin shouted from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sighed and turned away from his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a sec!\" Kyle shouted, then turned to glare at Sam, who didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Kyle exited the room, Liam and Eli were momentarily distracted as they sniffed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stepped out of the sliding glass door into the large backyard. There was a large in-ground pool, complete with two diving boards off to one side, and on the other a large patch of grass, where the three girls were setting up their towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle made his way over to the girls and followed suit with his towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I don't usually do stuff like this.\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sunbathe? Oh! That's cause you're from back east, right? The weather's not usually right for it.\" Darla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's easy. You just lay on your stomach and let the sun do it's work, and then flip.\" Robin laughed as she laid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle weakly giggled along and sat down on the towel. Darla and Melissa set down and laid down as well. The girls started talking and kept trying to get Kyle involved in the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kylie, what do you think?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, Kylie?\" Darla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversations never ceased and they always wanted Kyle's opinion. And they always somehow drifted back to talking about Kyle's body. Kyle had always wished that his body would be the topic of conversation for a set of cute girls, but this was not how he envisioned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, flip!\" Darla exclaimed as her phone buzzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they flipped, the sliding glass door opened once again, revealing:</span></div></div>",

The feeling of his breasts being pulled on by gravity was just too weird. The woman was attractive, in her 40\u2019s, and obviously took care of herself. She was in shape, with shoulder length chestnut hair and a smile that would melt ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman put her hand over her eyes, visor-like and peered at Kyle. \u201cAnd who\u2019s this pretty thing that has joined your group, Lissa?\u201d  Kyle wanted the earth to swallow him up, blushing furiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Kylie, she\u2019s spending the summer with her uncle, Mr Gladstone.  He didn\u2019t want her to be cooped up in the house all summer, so we invited her and her brother,\u201d Melissa made a dismissive gesture to the boys and the video game, \u201cSam over to hang out and introduce them around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls and Kyle stood at that point. Melissa\u2019s mom came over and hugged Kyle. He wasn\u2019t sure how to react to it, so he just awkwardly stiffened a little. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you, Kylie. You\u2019re welcome here anytime.  I\u2019m Theresa.  If you need anything, just ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... thanks?\u201d Kyle said. The girls returned to their towels, and Kyle slowly did as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d Theresa said. \u201cDiet drinks, girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle hated the thought of diet anything, but the other girls seemed ok with it, and he didn\u2019t want to rock the boat or draw attention to himself again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa went back into the house and returned a few minutes later with a tray of drinks and a pair of oversized sunglasses.  The girls (and Kyle) got up and moved to the shaded patio where Theresa handed them all a diet soda. Everyone took a seat and crossed their legs, Kyle taking a moment to realize that he should do that too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Kylie,\u201d Theresa said, passing the sunglasses to him. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be squinting like that. Crow\u2019s feet.\u201d She winked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, realizing he actually wished he did have sunglasses, Kyle accepted them and put them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGorge!\u201d Robin said, winking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot too much sun, girls,\u201d Theresa said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to burn or get leathery.  And you all know about SPF in your makeup?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all mummured their acknowledgment of that and Theresa smiled. \u201cAnd you, Kylie, you skin is gorgeous. You do take care of it, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201d again, Kyle was not prepared for any of this conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa frowned a little. \u201cWell, Lissa here knows all about skin care. She\u2019ll teach you everything you should be doing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa stood.  \u201cNow to go see what the boys want to eat. They\u2019re always hungry! It was very nice to meet you, Kylie, although I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be around often!  Have fun girls!\u201d  She went back inside through the patio door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get mad at her,\u201d Melissa said, putting her hand on Kyle\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s a big shot at a Catholic Finishing School.  She means well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d Kyle said, not really caring what Theresa had to say. \u201cI\u2019m not hung up on skin care or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let Theresa hear you say that,\u201d Darla said, laughing. And Kyle loved it when she laughed. \u201cShe\u2019ll have you at her vanity extolling the virtues of every cosmetic she owns.  But you should be at least a little careful with your skin, Kylie. You don\u2019t want to age prematurely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin piped in, \u201cThe way I see it, tomorrow we need to get Kylie some bikinis, sunglasses, start her on a skin care regimen... what else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Melissa said, laughing, \u201cwe\u2019ll just spend the day shopping!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle did not like the sound of that. \u201cUh...  I\u2019m not sure I can afford any of that,\u201d he quickly said, trying to put the brakes on things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, not to worry,\u201d Robin said with a dismissive flick of her wrist.  \u201cDaddy\u2019s a Doctor. And we have at our disposal...\u201d she looked at the other girls and the all smiled and said in unison, \u201cA PLATINUM CARD!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s say, 11 AM?\u201d Darla said. \u201cKylie, I\u2019ll pick you up first, then we\u2019ll grab the other girls. That way we have the day ahead of us, and can sleep in a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Kyle said, trying to feign excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKylie!  It\u2019ll be fun!\u201d Robin said. \u201cBesides, you need some stuff, and we\u2019ll help you get it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, OK,\u201d Kyle said, defeated. It looked like he was stuck spending another day as Kylie now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls started drinking their sodas. Kyle made a face when he tried his. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d Darla asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Kyle said, choking down a few more swallows. \u201cI just like the non-diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHorrible for your figure, though,\u201d Melissa said with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls (and Kyle) finished their drinks and returned to sunbathing, with the occasional lecture to kyle about caring for his skin and the passing around of sunscreen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle started to doze when he heard a camera shutter click. Robin has her phone and taking pictures of Kyle. She tapped on her phone a few times. \u201cAaaand....  done. Our new bestie!  Group shot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201dKyle was curious about what just happened, but he was hauled to his feet and the girls all huddled around him. Robin snapped a few selfies and again started taping on her phone. \u201cThere. Didn\u2019t even use a filter,\u201d she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what was...\u201d Kyle started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla hip checked him playfully. \u201cInstagram. Gotta keep the fans happy!\u201d She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin, still typing away at her phone, said without looking up, \u201cWhat\u2019s your Instagram ID, Kylie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have one,\u201d Kyle sheepishly admitted. Melissa lowered her sunglasses down her nose and stared at Kyle, mouth agape. \u201cGirl, that needs to change, right now. Where\u2019s your phone?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack at the house,\u201d Kyle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Facebook?  I can\u2019t find you on there...\u201d Darla said, typing away on her phone, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not on Facebook, either,\u201d Kyle said. Which, technically, was true. Kylie was not on Facebook...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we saw you on your laptop!\u201d Robin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I wasn\u2019t on Facebook!\u201d Kyle said.  \u201cI was trying to... fix something\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour laptop is acting up?  Eli\u2019s a computer whiz!  He can get it working again, I\u2019m sure!\u201d Darla said. \u201cWe\u2019ll ask him once they finish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo tomorrow, remember  your phone so we can get you on Instagram and Facebook!\u201d Robin said. \u201cThat way we can tag you in pictures!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was horrified. In one afternoon, he\u2019d been roped into shopping for bikinis and god knows what else, promised the development of a skin care routine, having social media accounts made for him...  what else could go wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a shout inside, and Eli was raising his hands in triumph. \u201cLooks like the game finished,\u201d Melissa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys slid open the patio door and came out, sitting in the patio chairs while the girls (and Kyle) lounged on their towels. </span></div></div>",

Darla, Robin and Melissa were preoccupied with Sam, no doubt fishing for information about his \"sister\", which he was more than happy to provide. As a consequence, Kyle was conversing with Eli and Liam, both very interested in the new girl in the neighborhood. Kyle kept trying to find an opportunity to grab Sam and run, but it never presented itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Kylie, Sam was telling us that this is your first visit to this part of the country, right?\" Liam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Kyle replied. \"For both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" Eli said. \"Enjoying it so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's only been a day and it takes some getting used to. Especially with Uncle Mark's house.\" Kyle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MARCI, right?\" Liam asked. \"She hounds Amy and Sami all the time. It was funny, a few years back Mark and Mrs. Gladstone went away for a week and programmed MARCI to stop all their activity if it looked like they were gonna throw a wild party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've been having trouble with it. Sam tried to fix it, but I think he made it worse.\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd never try to touch anything Gladstone until I get a Masters in IT.\" Eli laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was the new TV all it was cracked up to be?\" Kyle asked, hoping to shift the conversation off of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was amazing!\" Eli exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you play?\" Liam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, does a 12th level space knight carry a digisword?.\" Kyle replied. \"Don't look so shocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not, it's just that while the girls like to play, they're not as into it as we are.\" Eli said. \"Part of me thinks Lissa has the systems so that we hang around more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna go a few rounds?\" Liam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Kyle replied, happy to get out of the girl zone and into a game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" Eli said and got up, walking back towards the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam followed Eli and Kyle eagerly followed the two boys into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat down and started to play. Kyle was having fun, but his newly lengthened nails were taking some getting used to with the joysticks on the controller. Eli seemed to notice his trouble and reached over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need help?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just a little out of practice.\" Kyle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme help you. The girls usually use their fingers like this.\" Eli said, positioning Kyle's fingers onto the controller a certain way. He seemed to linger more than he had to, but Kyle was quickly distracted by the game. \"Usually helps them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Kyle smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No prob.\" Eli smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle started to play a lot better, though he kept thinking about the lingering. Eventually, Sam and the girls rejoined the group, watching Eli, Liam and Kyle playing the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, we were wondering if you have plans tonight, or if you and Kylie wanted to stay for dinner with the gang?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was still internally laughing about how great the prank was going, but he can't let Kyle squirm for this long, can he? He figured that he should probably take Kyle home and let him relax after the day he put him through, but on the other hand, the three girls seemed pretty interested in him, and it was because of his \"sister\". He mused on the idea for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner? We probably should get back to Uncle Mark's, but...\" Sam started.</span></div></div>",

So why not extend the prank a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds great!\u201d Sam said. \u201cI\u2019m getting hungry, and Kylie isn\u2019t much of a cook. Plus, we don\u2019t really know what all supplies Uncle Mark has on hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa smiled, and Sam thought her smiling, in that bikini, was one of the best things he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cOne thing though,\u201d Melissa said, \u201cMom doesn\u2019t like bathing suits at the table. So Kylie\u2019s going to have to change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem, Melissa!\u201d Sam said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam walked over and took the controller out of Kyle\u2019s hand. \u201cHey!\u201d  Liam laughed as Kyle\u2019s character died a spectacular death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Kyle..eee,\u201d Sam said, almost calling his \u201csister\u201d the wrong name. \u201cWe have to run back to Uncle Mark\u2019s for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Kyle asked, hoping that this day would be over soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.  You have to change for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d  Kyle asked, not relishing another outfit at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa came over and put her hand on Sams\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYeah...  sorry. Mom doesn\u2019t like bathing suits at the table.  But it doesn\u2019t have to be formal. Just throw on something cute. Oh, and bring your phone as we can get you on Instagram, too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle slumped.   Again, he was stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, we\u2019ll be right back!\u201d Sam said, practically shoving his brother out the door toward their Uncle\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked back, Kyle whispered, \u201cI am going to kill you for this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, Kylie,\u201d Sam said with a smile. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like hanging out with some hot girls all day?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot wearing this!\u201d He gestured at his bathing suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Sam said, finally taking a good look at his brother.  \u201cWhere\u2019s your junk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMARCI glued it up out of sight. It\u2019s uncomfortable as Hell, and I want to get out of these clothes and back to my old self. And in case you didn\u2019t know, the girls want Kylie to go shopping tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam laughed at the thought of Kyle trudging around from boutique to boutique. \u201cAl least you\u2019ll have eye candy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smacked Sam in the back of the head. \u201cThey want me to get bikinis, jerk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam really laughed at the thought of his brother trying on those.  Kyle grabbed his ear and twisted it, pulling Sam\u2019s head towards his shoulder. \u201cNot funny, asshole.  Let\u2019s just get this over with. And tonight, you fix MARCI. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK!  OK!\u201d Sam whined as Kyle released his ear with  a shove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair opened the door to the house and walked into the kitchen, surprised to see Uncle Mark sitting there, reading some online news. \u201cAh, there the two of you are. I trust you had fun with the kids?  And Kylie!  That\u2019s a lovely bathing suit!  I see you\u2019re taking big steps!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle glared at Sam. He couldn\u2019t tell if Uncle Mark was poking fun or not, so he just stood there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeliissa\u2019s invited us over for dinner. We weren\u2019t expecting you to be here,\u201d Sam said. \u201cWe told her we\u2019d be right back, so...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes. Go have fun with your friends. I\u2019ll be here when you get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle trudged back upstairs to his room, followed closely by Sam. \u201cWhat are you thinking as far as clothes go?\u201d Sam asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the Hell should I know, dork?\u201d Kyle said. \u201cI have no idea with \u2018something cute\u2019 is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you could always let MARCI decide,\u201d Sam said with a chuckle. </span></div></div>",

He walked over to the walk-in closet and opened the door. He stepped inside and looked around. What he found were several racks of clothing, countless drawers, much bigger than any closet he had ever used before. There was every possibly article of clothing in any color of the known spectrum that Kyle could fathom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that explains how MARCI had so many different outfits today. I bet there's stuff here that Amy's never even worn once!\" Kyle remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You called, Mistress?\"</i> MARCI asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle jumped, worried that MARCI was going to ambush makeover him again, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't.\" Kyle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I will remain on standby in the event you need assistance.\"</i> MARCI stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle started picking through the piles, finding a pair of overalls in a pile of tight jeans and jean shorts. He thought for a moment, overalls were comfortable, and how girly can he really look in them? Were they cute? Kyle didn't really care, he just needed something. He tossed them over his shoulder and turned towards the other areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Kyle said as he started picking through the t-shirt pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam poked his head into the room and looked around, hearing movement in the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Kyle! Hurry up! Melissa and the girls might come looking for you if we're not there soon!\" Sam shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right out!\" Kyle shouted back, picking through the clothes. \"I'm almost done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Allow me to help speed things along.\"</i> MARCI stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare!\" Kyle shouted as the arms grabbed the overalls off his shoulder and lifted him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Crafting outfit based on desired primary article.\"</i> MARCI stated as the overalls were pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" Kyle squirmed, but MARCI held firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn abridged version of the day's earlier events replayed for Kyle, with him being stripped from the bathing suit and redressed in proper clothes, starting with red panties and a red sports bra, before a red t-shirt was pulled down over his head, and the overalls were pulled up over his legs. Kyle was pleased, until he realized that they weren't full overalls. They were overalls where the legs were cut off at mid-thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis makeup was retouched as the overalls were attached and socks and the high tops from before were returned to his feet. His hair was then pulled back into a ponytail as he was dropped back onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam opened the door and rushed into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are! Come on!\" Sam grabbed Kyle by the hand and pulled him out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the front door, Sam reached for the doorknob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids!

Don't worry about running up a bill or anything, so use 'em as much as you'd like and let me know how they work. They've got the newest everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!

No, no, no, no!\u201d Kyle said. \u201cThese things are linked to MARCI!

Sam knocked on the door, and it was promptly opened by Theresa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam!\u201d She said, \u201cAnd Kylie!\u201d  She hugged them both. \u201cCome in, come in. We\u2019re having chicken, I hope that\u2019s OK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Said Sam. He elbowed Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.

Girl stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa escorted Kyle back to meet the other girls, now clothed, sitting at the patio table by the pool. They jumped up and each hugged Kyle. He could get used to that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin piped up. \u201cOk, girl, phone!\u201d She held out her hand.

They made him smile, and they all started typing away on their phones. Once Robin was done with Kyle\u2019s new phone, she also took a picture with him on her phone. The girls all then huddled around Kyle for one last selfie with his phone. Robin took it back and did some last bit of typing before handing it back to Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s new Instagram account was open, and he had pictures posted with the girls, and they had tagged him in all the pictures they just took with him. He sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re now on Instagram and Facebook. We\u2019ll have to get a ton more pics up, though!\u201d Robin declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotally!\u201d Darla agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Kylie, the shortalls are cute, but you really should think about some more fitted clothes.\u201d Darla said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone buzzed and Kyle saw a notification pop up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotification from MARCI<br>\r\nWear more fitted clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle took the phone and shoved it into his back pocket before anything else could go wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Kylie.

Person who moved in the most recently was Eli and that was years ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't quite as interested in shopping as they would have liked.\" Eli joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle weakly laughed as he thought about the shopping and all the girly activities he'd have to endure. If Sam couldn't fix MARCI... hell, even if Sam does, how do they explain why Kylie went missing? He either has to come clean about dressing this way, or keep dressing this way until the summer ends. Neither option is promising. Maybe he can sit down with Uncle Mark and explain everything and he has a mind wiper hidden away in a drawer somewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember Kylie, I'll pick you up around 11AM for the shopping trip.\" Darla said, snapping Kyle out of his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMARCI buzzed in his pocket and Kyle sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't wait.\" Kyle smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chicken is great, Theresa.\" Sam remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much, Sam.\" Theresa replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded in agreement as they kept eating. Kyle was especially hungry and grabbed another piece of chicken off the tray and started digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, Kylie. You've got quite an appetite.\" Theresa remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh... had a light breakfast, so I'm starving.\" Kyle replied. He might have to temper his appetite around her, or she'd be critiquing every thing he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh to be that young and not worried about calories yet.\" Theresa laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Mom! You're pretty skinny yourself.\" Melissa interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I work very hard at it.\" Theresa laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversations started cropping up here and there are dinner continued. Kyle's phone started to buzz and he worried that it was Marci again, but it turned out to be social media notifications. Kylie had amassed quite a few followers and likes in the short time since the accounts had been opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Nice\" Darla nodded as she leaned over to see Kyle's phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's popular...\" Melissa grabbed the phone and started scrolling through. \"Know her, know her... don't know her... She's pretty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wrestled the phone back and put it back in his pocket silently hoping that the meal would end soon as he was pulled into another conversation with the girls.</span></div></div>",

His phone buzzed at a steady pace with updates, likes, and friend requests. The girls insisted the he show them the updates with each buzz as they commented on people, having him accept the friend requests, replying, and sending out friend requests of his own all through dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was ready to head back to Uncle Mark\u2019s to end this day, but was dragged outside to the patio again after dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo tomorrow is shopping,\u201d Melissa said, \u201cand that\u2019s our off day.  Wednesday is cardio, so you can come with us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCardio?\u201d Kyle asked. \u201cGo where?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorkout day!\u201d Robin answered. \u201cWe work out together every other day. We can get you a guest pass to our gym!  We\u2019ll be doing spinning, so make sure you have some workout gear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s phone buzzed and he looked at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotification from MARCI<br>\r\nExercise at gym Wednesday AM and every other day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNew like?\u201d Darla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cJust a notification by the system.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw,\u201d Robin said. \u201cWe\u2019ll work on getting more pictures up on your accounts, though. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Kyle said, feigning excitement. He was feeling defeated after this long, uncomfortable day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kyle said, \u201cBut I\u2019m exhausted. It\u2019s been a... fun day!\u201d He added, trying to be friendly.  \u201cAnd it\u2019s been great hanging out with all of you, but I\u2019m just tired. I want to get a shower and get into bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all said they understood, that beauty sleep was important, and that they\u2019d see him tomorrow for a fun filled day of shopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle found Sam, who was back playing video games. \u201cSam, I\u2019d appreciate you coming back to uncle Mark\u2019s with me so that you can fix that thing for me!\u201d Kyle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Sam exited out of the game. The pair thanked Melissa\u2019s parents for the wonderful meal, and Kyle got another round of hugs from the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they trudged back to their uncle\u2019s, Kyle told Sam, \u201cGo get your laptop and fix this,\u201d He gestured at his body. \u201cI am beat and really want to go to bed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam ran up to his room and got his laptop. Kyle appeared in the doorway to his room and stood there, leaning against the doorway, arms crossed over his chest, looking really like an angry teenage girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam typed in the password, getting it wrong. \u201cTwo attempts remaining\u201d came up on his screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo attempts left?\u201d He asked and looked at Kyle. \u201cWe\u2019re you trying to get into this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Kyle said, \u201cI was trying to get into it so that I didn\u2019t have to sunbathe this afternoon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, no problem, just have to get in,\u201d Kyle said, attempting another go at the password. But it was long, and he entered it incorrectly again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, just put in the password!\u201d Kyle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam began carefully and slowly typing In the password. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mess it up this time!  I want to get out of this outfit and get into bed!\u201d Kyle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, mistress,\u201d came MARCI\u2019s automated response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!  What??\u201d Kyle cried out as arms pulled him into an alcove and a wall slid into place, obscuring the view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden noise and Kyle\u2019s shouting distracted Sam\u2019s last attempt at the password. \u201cAccount locked. Contact System Administrator to reset password.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap!\u201d Sam muttered, as Kyle was deposited back into the doorway. He was now in a lace trimmed nylon short set of pink pajamas, and his hair pulled back in a ponytail. His makeup had been removed, and he was obviously now dressed for bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere. Shall I put you into bed, mistress?\u201d  MARCI asked the annoyed boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thank you!\u201d Kyle said between clenched teeth. \u201cTell me you got in,\u201d he said to Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou startled me!\u201d Sam said defensively. \u201cYou made me get it wrong and I\u2019m locked out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did it?  Don\u2019t you blame this mess on me!\u201d Kyle shouted.  \u201cI ddn\u2019t ask to wear... this!\u201d He gestured at the pink short set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you prefer a nightgown, mistress?\u201d MARCI asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Kyle shouted. \u201cI just want...\u201d. He sighed. \u201cSo who\u2019s the sys admin?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably Uncle Mark?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s find him and get him to reset it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys ran to find Uncle Mark, who was watching TV.  The TV was the entire wall of his den, and he was snoring softly, sitting upright on a couch, his head leaning backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... Uncle Mark?\u201d Sam asked tentatively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle Mark awoke with a snort. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d He said bolting upright. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d  He looked at the pair.  \u201cOh.  Sam!  Kylie!  What can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... accidentally locked Kyle out of his account for MARCI and I need to have his password reset.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.  Well, a few things there, Samuel,\u201d Uncle Mark started, emphasizing Sam\u2019s full name. \u201cI find it offensive that you\u2019re not accepting of who Kylie wants to be. From now on you are to use HER desired name and pronouns, am I clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...\u201d Kyle started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, Kylie. I will not tolerate Samuel\u2019s inability to accept his sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...\u201d Kyle started in again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd as for resetting the password, Amy is the sys admin. I don\u2019t have the time to deal with things like that!  So you\u2019ll have no choice but to accept Kylie as she is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s face dropped. He was stuck like this until Amy got back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m off to bed.  MARCI, bedtime protocol R28.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall of the room reverted back to a plain appearing wall, and arms picked up both Sam and Kyle, carrying them off to their respective rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was deposited in his bed, and the sheets were pulled up.  \u201cYour uncle is upset,\u201d MARCI said. \u201cThe door to the room will be locked until tomorrow morning.\u201d  Kyle groaned. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, Sam was stripped and out into a pair of pajama pants and put into his bed and told about the lockdown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stared blankly at the ceiling. His uncle thought he wanted to be like this. And now there wasn\u2019t anything he could do about it. He was stuck as Kylie until Amy got home. It was a long time before Kyle\u2019s running thoughts allowed him to drift off to sleep. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is time to wake up.\"</i> MARCI said as she played a pleasant, but subtly disruptive tone to rouse Kyle from his sleep. <i>\"Your first activity for the day is at 11AM.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it now?\" Kyle asked as he pulled a pillow over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"9:30AM.\"</i> MARCI replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme another half hour.\" Kyle shoved his head under the pillow and held firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Impossible, mistress. Morning preparations will take at least 30 minutes and you must have proper time for breakfast and digestion before your day begins.\" </i>MARCI stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms flew from the  walls and pulled the blanket off of Kyle. He was immediately reminded of what he was wearing as he felt a sudden chill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please make your way to the bathroom. The shower has been prepared to your specifications.</i> MARCI stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle slowly sat up and blew a strand of hair from his face. He scowled as he walked into the bathroom. He opened the shower door and stepped inside, aware of what awaited him. He was immediately stripped and his hair was taken out of the ponytail, allowed to lay freely. The water turned on and Kyle was aware of the protocol. Kyle got a glimpse of himself in a mirror and noticed that he had noticeable tan lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it's gonna be a while before I'm dressing normal again, so those can fade.\" Kyle sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower once again notified Kyle when to turn so that each and every angle of his body was thoroughly scrubbed. The helmet descended once again and Kyle placed it onto his head. He could feel the helmet lathering and washing his hair, and caught the same slight whiff of strawberries from the shampoo. Thankfully, it skipped the hair removal portion, but only because there had not been any new hair growth since the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything was finished, his hair was back in the towel turban and another was wrapped around his chest. Kyle chose to walk out of the bathroom by his own power and walked over to his remade bed. He found his new outfit and held it up. It was a pair of tight jeans and an equally tight black and red tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure about this...\" Kyle mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Are you dissatisfied with the outfit?\"</i> MARCI asked. <i>\"Since your activity is shopping I chose an outfit that you can enter and exit with ease while trying on other potential outfits.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had a flashback to the previous day where a decent outfit was replaced with the girliest thing ever. He shuddered at the thought of that outfit again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine.\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Time limit for typical preparations passed. Providing assistance to speed things up.\"</i> MARCI asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MARCI, please, not again!\" Kyle whined as the arms grabbed the towels and put him into his new outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst a new set of undergarments, a black bra and panty set, then the jeans were pulled up and the tank top pulled down. Then it was back to the salon chair. The makeup and nail polish were touched up and he was placed back into the high tops. His hair was returned to the braid that it was placed in the day before and Kyle was released from MARCI's grip... for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god for small mercies.\" Kyle muttered. \"Could be worse, I could be in heels again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Did you request a change in footwear?\"</i> MARCI asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I did not. These are perfect.\" Kyle replied. Stupid machine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Breakfast is currently being served in the kitchen.\"</i> MARCI stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle started to walk towards the door as he decided what his course of action would be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle headed down to breakfast. The jeans were tight, but kind of thin and stretchy. They weren\u2019t anything like the jeans he was used to. The bra was an annoyance, and the tight tank top showed off his newly acquired curves a little too much to his liking. They seemed bug to him. On a girl, he\u2019d love to look at them. On him, it was just unsettling. But it wasn\u2019t as bad as it could have been. At least that\u2019s what he kept telling himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found his uncle and Sam already up and moving. Mark was in a somewhat ill-fitting shirt and tie, looking vaguely uncomfortable. Sam was...  well, dressed as Sam usually was. And that annoyed Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUncle Mark?\u201d He started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Kylie?  And please, I told you before to just call me Mark,\u201d he smiled at Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering...  MARCI seems to be much more focused on me than Sam.  Is there a reason for that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle Mark was fussing with his shirt sleeves. \u201cHmm?  Oh, yes!  Of course!  Personal bias, dear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, MARCI was primarily developed to help me deal with two teenage daughters. So she\u2019s keyed to help deal with issues and problems that girls have. Not having boys, I\u2019ve never thought to program her to deal with teen boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMARCi helps me out with household things rather than my own issues, so I don\u2019t need her talents as much as my girls do. And Amy tends to be the one that fiddles with her programming, so her AI is based on what a teenage girl needs.  To her, Sam is akin to a footstool. Something that she just needs to make sure is in the right place when needed. But you, my dear, are something she understands and will help immensely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of on cue, Kyle was presented with his breakfast, which was a bowl of yogurt with some fruit on top.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour breakfast, mistress,\u201d MARCi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked over at the bacon, eggs, and toast that Sam was having. \u201cI\u2019d prefer what Sam is having,\u201d Kyle said hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, mistress,\u201d MARCI said. \u201cThis breakfast is nutritionally complete for a girl your age. Too many calories is not healthy for you, as women and men have different caloric requirements.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?  Helpful!\u201d Mark said. He then fussed with his tie and the cuffs on his shirt before asking, \u201cKylie, do i look OK?  I mean like a titan of industry?  I\u2019m not used to ties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look fine, I guess.\u201d Kyle said, watching Sam taunt him by slowly crunching his bacon. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImportant meeting this morning. So what are your plans today, kids?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle...ee\u201d Sam caught himself, \u201cis going shopping with the...other girls.  And I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, stay out of trouble, both of you.  I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can,\u201d. Mark said. He asked MARCI for a cup of coffee to go, waved, and slipped out the garage door. His car was heard starting up, the garage door opening, and he drove off, the garage door closing slowly after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate this,\u201d Kyle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI never meant for this to go this far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at me!\u201d Kyle moaned. \u201cBoobs!  I have boobs!  And I\u2019m being dragged shopping for bikinis!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Sam said sadly. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see if I can hack into the system while you\u2019re out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust... think about it carefully and be careful. MARCI already spends way too much time worring about me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will. I owe it to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had Marci prepare a cup of coffee.  He wanted cream in it, but MARCI would only give him something made with skim milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat about sums up what this summer is going to be like.  Apparently, I\u2019m officially on a diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s it like?\u201d  Sam asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s what like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving boobs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnoying. They jiggle. Bras are annoying. And they\u2019re always in the way,\u201d Kyle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlay your cards right and maybe you\u2019ll get to see Darla\u2019s,\u201d Sam said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle thought about that. \u201cHey, maybe there is an upside to this mess!  I mean, I\u2019m being dragged for a workout to a woman!/\u2018 gym tomorrow.!  Assuming there are showers, that could be amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Kyle... Kylie,\u201d Sam said.  \u201cI hate to rain on your parade, but...  how are you going to be naked with girls without them seeing your junk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle blanched. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about that...  what am I going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horn sounded outside. \u201cLooks like your ride is here,\u201d Sam said. \u201cHave fun shopping!  And we\u2019ll figure a way out of the gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019d better,\u201d Kyle said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMARCI deposited a small drawstring bag over Kyle\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI put together some things you may need for your outing, mistress,\u201d MARCI said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Kyle said flatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horn honked again, and Kyle exited the house. </span></div></div>",

Kyle, on the other hand, climbed into Darla's car, in the passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Kylie!\" Darla exclaimed as Kyle fastened his seatbelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you, too.\" Kyle replied as he tried to find a comfortable position for the belt to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've just gotta pick up the others and we'll be on our way.\" Darla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No rush...\" Kyle muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Darla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I can't wait.\" Kyle smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought you said!\" Darla smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa and Robin were soon picked up, climbed into the backseat and the girls were on their way to the mall. Their attempts to pull \"Kylie\" into their conversations continued, though Kyle was able to deflect most of the questions, especially when they pertained to \"her\" past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you and Eli getting a bit close yesterday...\" Robin joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was just helping me with the game. Not that easy to game with these, as I'm sure you know.\" Kyle wiggled his fingers towards the backseat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that's a nice shade of pink. What's it called?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... uh... not really sure. MARCI did it, so it's not like she told me the brand names of everything.\" Kyle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You know what would be so cute?\" Darla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Robin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we all got our nails done in matching styles!\" Darla exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa and Robin squealed with delight and agreement. Kyle weakly played along as they started brainstorming colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, (not soon enough, thought Kyle) they arrived at the mall and started looking around stores, starting with the swimsuit section. Kyle stood near a rack of one-pieces, hoping that the rack would swallow him whole and he wouldn't have to endure this anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa soon ambushed him, holding a black push-up bikini top with a matching bottom up to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" Melissa handed it to him. \"This one is perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Kyle slung the items over his arm and started to look through a nearby rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Kylie!\" Robin shouted. \"We're gonna go try on what we picked out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we got you a few choices.\" Darla smiled as she held up a pile of cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sighed as he weighed his options. On the one hand, he could just let them buy it and not have to suffer the indignity for another day or so... but on the other hand, if they change together... he might be able to watch the girls change...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle took his armful of choices and stated heading to the checkout. \u201cWoah!\u201d Robin said.  \u201cAren\u2019t you going to try those on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Melissa said, \u201cShe\u2019s going to try those on first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I...\u201d Kyle started to say, but Darla had already asked the salesgirl to unlock some dresssing rooms. Kyle was led to one of them and the door closed behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was annoyed at both having to try these nightmare things on as much as not getting to change with the girls. He started sorting through the pile of things he was given. The black bikini, a red bikini, a silver metallic bikini, a bright blue bikini, some coverups, a couple of pareos, three pairs of sunglasses, some espadrilles, and a few pairs of flip flops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood there, looking at the mass of clothing, when a knock on the door came. \u201cYou OK in there?  Do you need any other sizes?\u201d The sales clerk asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no...\u201d Kyle said.  \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d  He held up the black bikini and stared at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon our, Kylie!\u201d Melissa said. \u201cLet\u2019s see you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow us!\u201d Robin called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefetedly, Kyle stripped. He examined his glued up crotch in the mirror for a few seconds. It was flat hidden, but up close it wouldn\u2019t pass inspection. He had to get out of that gym visit tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noted the \u201cdo not remove this when trying on!\u201d strip in the bikini bottoms, and pulled them in place. He tied the string around his neck for the top, taking a second to stare at his chest before stuffing himself into the cups and finally getting the back hooked. The push up top did a number on his false chest, and he was worried about looking like that. He stared at himself in the mirror, swallowing hard, when he was broken out of his reverie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla was knocking on the door.  \u201cCan we come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door a crack and Robin pulled it open. The girls gave him a critical look. \u201cI don\u2019t think that fits,\u201d Robin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa came over behind him and tightened up the tie around his neck, hoisting his boobs up further. \u201cYeah, I agree,\u201d she said, looking Kyle over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla had him spin, and he felt like his ass cheeks were hanging out.  \u201cYep.  Wrong size,\u201d she finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was relieved. He was certain that it was too small too.  Darla went to the sales clerk and said, \u201cThe black bikini she\u2019s in, could you get the next size down, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarla!\u201d Kyle said. \u201cIsn\u2019t this too small as it is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Kylie,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure you look good,\u201d drawing out and emphasizing the last word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk returned with the smaller sized bikini and again, Kyle was shoved into the dressing room. Trembling, he put it on. The bottoms practically rode up his ass and the push up top REALLY pushed up his boobs. He was summoned back out. Robin was in a similar bikini, and she pulled Kyle over and struck a pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla snapped a few pictures.  \u201cThese will get a ton of likes!\u201d She said, tapping away on her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re posting my picture online?\u201d Kyle said, somewhat horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d Darla said.  \u201cBikini....summer....babes!\u201d She said as she typed. \u201cAnd... posted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the one,\u201d Robin said, smiling. \u201cNow let\u2019s get others tried on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it went. The girls made him try on variations of the bikinis (which were mostly decided to be too big, so he had to try on the next size down) with the wraps, each pair of sunglasses, with the shoes.  The girls made sure to get pictures of him in each bikini that went up online, and he could hear his phone buzzing, apparently from the likes.  He wound up with the red, black, and metallic silver bikinis, the espadrilles, all three sunglasses, and several covers and wraps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a start,\u201d Robin said with a wink as she paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s grab some coffee,\u201d suggested Darla. \u201cWe can plan what\u2019s next to get. I want to look at some shoes, we need to get Kylie\u2019s skin care straightened out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the coffee shop in the atrium of the mall, got their coffees, and sat down at a table off to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d Darla said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan here?  What else do we need to get besides her skin care stuff\u201d she said, gesturing at Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorkout year for the gym tomorrow,\u201d Robin said. \u201cSome cute outfits?  Oh!  Makeup!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you set for lingerie?\u201d Melissa asked Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... OK?\u201d Kyle hesitantly answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirl, you can\u2019t ever have enough undies.\u201d Darla said with a wink. \u201cDo you have your black lace set ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy black lace set of what?\u201d Kyle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Robin said with a playful nudge on Kyle\u2019s shoulder, \u201cfor when the right guy comes along.  Something sexy to wear to impress him, get his motor going...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo jump your bones!\u201d Melissa added with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201d Kyle tried to think of an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of,\u201d Darla said, \u201cEverone remembered their pill today?\u201d The girls nodded yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPill?\u201d Asked Kyle, hoping to change the subject away from guys for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBC?\u201d Robin said.  Kyle started blankly at her.  \u201cBirth control?  You\u2019re on the pill, aren\u2019t you, Kylie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d Kyle said, not really sure how to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all looked incredulously at Kyle.  \u201cHang on,\u201d Robin said, pulling out her phone. She hit a quick dial number and held it to her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi!  It\u2019s Robin.  Sure. I\u2019ll hang on.\u201d  She looked at Kyle and winked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, Robin said, \u201cHi Daddy!  Yes.... oh, we\u2019re at the mall....  not too much, just got Kylie some bikinis.....  yeah.\u201d  She held up a \u201cone sec\u201d finger at Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Kylie...  Yeah, her....  she\u2019s sexually active.. No, she isn\u2019t on the pill. Could you....  sure!  One sec,\u201d. Robin handed Kyle the phone.  \u201cDaddy wants to talk to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was sure he was in Hell. Sexually active?  The girls thought that?  Uncertain of what to do, Kyle put the phone to his ear. \u201cUh... hello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pleasant baritone voice responded. \u201cHello, Kylie. I\u2019m Robin\u2019s dad, Pete.  She\u2019s been talking non-stop about you, and I\u2019m happy you\u2019ve found a group of girls your age to fit in with. I\u2019m sure you heard her tell me you wanted to get on birth control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... yeah,\u201d Kyle said as the three girls watched him intently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I prescribe that to you, I wanted to ask you some questions. Are your periods regular, or do they seem to come at varying times?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had no idea what to say here, so he guessed.  \u201cThey... vary?\u201d Surely a bodily function that occurred like clockwork would be unreasonable, he figured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd bleeding?  Heavy?  Manageable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cManageable!  Really manageable!  They\u2019re just fine!\u201d  He didn\u2019t Pete to think he had blood trickling down his leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny severe cramping?  Anything abnormal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d Kyle said, \u201cEverything\u2019s normal!  Normal as can be here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, great. I\u2019ll call in your new prescription. You can pick it up after a while later today while you girls are out. If you could, please put Robin back on so I can fill her in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, Kyle handed the phone back to Robin. \u201cYep!\u201d  She said. \u201cShe\u2019s thrilled!   Yeah... OK, I know that pharmacy.  Yeah.... got it. Kylie Gladstone... just as it sounds... G L A D S T O N E.  Ok. Thank you, Daddy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll call that in and we can pick it up on our way home,\u201d Robin said. \u201cYou should be on the pill, Kylie. It\u2019ll help even out your period.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it may even make your boobs bigger!\u201d Melissa said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t be dating guys and not be on it,\u201d Darla said. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, we all have each others\u2019 backs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the other girls. \u201cOk, now that we\u2019ve got Kylie safe for dating, what\u2019s next?  Shoes?  Undies?  Clothes?\u201d</span></div></div>",

This was a forbidden kingdom for boys, and yet he had gained admission. The girls started browsing immediately and Kyle once again started to idly flip through a rack. He had to think of a way he could head this off at the pass... as he was thinking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need any help, Miss?\" a saleswoman suddenly appeared behind Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped in surprise, before turning to the chipper associate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm good.\" Kyle said as he went back to checking the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? Because these don't look like quite the right size. What cup size are you?\" the saleswoman asked, eyeing Kyle's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Kyle hesitated. They weren't huge, thankfully, but MARCI hadn't mentioned the exact size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does your current bra fit?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, it feels a little snug.\" Kyle admitted honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I can measure you in the back.\" she started to lead Kyle towards the back of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle started to follow as Darla noticed that Kylie was no longer browsing the rack. She started looking around, spotting her friend walking with a saleswoman. Darla ran to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where ya going, Kylie?\" Darla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm measuring her.\" the saleswoman replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I come with?\" Darla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" Kyle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked into the back and the saleswoman grabbed a measuring tape. She stood there for a few moments before Darla tapped Kyle on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kylie! You've got to take your shirt off.\" Darla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Kyle quickly grabbed his tank top and took it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saleswoman started to measure and put the tape measure away. Kyle pulled the tank top back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it looks like you're an A, but you were right about the snugness because you're just under a B, so if you want extra room, go a size up.\" the saleswoman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take the B.\" Darla said. \"Trust me, when you start BC and they grow a bit, you'll want the extra room. I was close like that before I started and I had to go out and buy a bunch of new bras after a few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Kyle said to the saleswoman as he and Darla exited the room and returned to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla informed them of the new sizing decision and they started to grab several choices for for Kyle to choose from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kylie, do you have any nightgowns?\" Melissa asked as she browsed a rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really wear them that much.\" Kyle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we have any sleepovers, it's gonna be mandatory, so you better get one.\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls collectively handed Kyle a pile of lingerie and sent him off to the changing room once again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just at it was bikini shopping, Kyle was marched into a dressing room as the girls kept shoving things in to try on. While the girls didn\u2019t make him come out and model, they did poke their heads in to approve or disapprove of their selections. And their selections all seemed to involve lots of black and lots of lace, usually with push up tricks or adding a cup or two to the bust size.  This slightly frightened Kyle given what they\u2019d said before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa vanished from critiquing Kyle\u2019s lingerie, so he asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Melissa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, Kylie,\u201d Robin said, adjusting the straps on the red add-a-cup bra he was now in. \u201cShe\u2019s off getting matching panties.  Lingerie has to match!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle heard his phone buzz, and figured that MARCI had just been given a new instruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin took a step back and looked at Kyle\u2019s chest. \u201cYep, good size, just enough jiggle, I think we have a winner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck her head out of the door and told Darla to get a few more bras in that style. \u201cSure!  Oh, have her try this on,\u201d. Darla handed in a black strapless bustier with garters dangling from it. A matching panty was in a plastic bag connected to the back of the bustier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on!\u201d Kyle said as it came through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to hurt to try it on?\u201d Robin said. \u201cPlease?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Kyle removed everything but his panties and put on the bustier. He grumbled when he realized it, too, had push up pads in it. Robin helped him do up the row of hooks in the back. It nipped in his waist slightly, but he felt stupid standing there in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHappy now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. That\u2019s a get.  You\u2019ll need some hose and heels to go with it, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle started at himself in the mirror, looking at himself and thinking that he was going to kill Sam once he got MARCI straightened out. He was lost in thought when he heard a camera shutter snap just over his shoulder. Robin was furiously giggling and thumb typing away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobin!\u201d He hissed.  \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed him her phone. It was a picture taken over his shoulder, looking down into his pushed up cleavage, his breasts surrounded by the black lace of the bustier. She had captioned it \u201cKylie\u2019s impressive view\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake that down!\u201d He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d Robin said with a grin. \u201cGet used to it, girl. You\u2019re becoming an Instagram hottie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla knocked on the door just then and stuck her head in. \u201cO. M. G.  Kylie, you HAVE to get that!\u201d  Her phone pinged and she grabbed it.  She fussed with it for a few seconds and then smiled broadly. \u201cAnd I see you let Robin get a really good shot of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa came back just then, with a large pile of panties and a few other items. \u201cI\u2019m guessing mostly thongs, Kylie. We got you some V-strings and some cheeky panties, too.  And here are some nightgowns!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now I\u2019ll go grab some black stockings to go with that bustier, because you\u2019re getting it!\u201d  She handed the pile of lacy fabric to Darla, who then began the job of handing things infor Kyle to try on<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling, Kyle worked his way through the nightgowns, although there was little \u201cgown\u201d about them. They all seemed to be short, cute, and...  he hated to use the word, but... flirty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the four \u201cgirls\u201d got out of the store, Kyle had more lingerie than he ever wanted. He wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to do with this stuff. And Robin has made him wear out the red add-a-cup bra, so he was very self conscious about his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa broke him out of his thoughts about everyone, especially guys, staring at his newly padded chest.\u201cSo we still need to get her skin care stuff, but she also needs heels to go with that bustier. Maybe some dresses?  There should be some parties this summer, so she\u2019ll need some cute stuff for that!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like shopping wasn\u2019t ending anytime soon <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I...\" Kyle stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I rest my case.\" Darla smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sighed as they walked to the clothing store. He tried to wander away, but Robin quickly rushed up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go look at shoes while they pick stuff out.\" Robin grabbed his hand and pulled him towards the shoe section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I have enough shoes already?\" Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Kylie, you can never have enough shoes!\" Robin laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Kyle was sitting down on one of the stools as Robin looked around as she checked her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What size are you?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Kyle knew his size in Men's but... He quickly lifted his leg up and checked the bottom of the high-top. \"8.5.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Robin grabbed several shoeboxes off the shelf and brought them over to Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a pair of open-toe black heels. Kyle quickly removed the high tops and his socks, before Robin helped him put his feet into the heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up, lemme see how they look.\" Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stood up and stumbled slightly, as they were the highest heels he'd worn so far. Robin grabbed onto his arm to steady him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First time in heels?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but first time in ones this high.\" Kyle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get the hang of them the more you wear them.\" Robin said. \"And they make your legs look killer! Imagine those with the bustier and hose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle didn't want to, but he <i>could</i> imagine it and it was not pleasant. After taking a few photos, Robin let him return the heels to the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few shoes went about the same way. A pair of knee-high brown boots with a heel that weren't that bad and a few pairs of pumps in varying colors, including red, pink and black. Kyle kept attempting to try on a nice pair of sneakers, or failing that, flats that he figured that Robin would find suitably \"cute\" but she kept diverting his attention back to her picks. Almost as if she <i>already knew</i> what shoes he was going to need to match with the clothes the other two were picking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more boxes, including a few open-toed heels, some wedges, booties, and slingbacks, (which Kyle was quickly learning the names of) Robin seemed satisfied and picked up the boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they're almost done, so...\" Robin started.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robin turned and said, \u201cYep, here they come now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla and Melissa were walking towards Kyle and Robin, both smiling broadly, but oddly not carrying anything. Kyle began to relax, thinking they hadn\u2019t found anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a dressing room full of things for you to try on, Kylie!  C\u2019mon!\u201d Darla said. Kyle\u2019s stomach sank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, he was in a dressing room, and almost everything the girls picked showed off his legs. There were dresses, skirts, short shorts, more skirts, fitted tops, blouses, tank tops, camisoles, and several pairs of yoga pants and cropped exercise tops. They also had pulled some very pink, very feminine sneakers for him.  They had included several pairs of jeans, but they were all very tight, very low rise, and nothing that Kyle really wanted to wear. He was going to be trying things on for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, Kyle had to model everything. He was changing shoes, trying on different heels with each outfit.  The girls made him try on several sizes, critiquing on which looked best on him.  Once optimal cuteness of each outfit was established, the girls snapped pictures, and his fashion show was posted online.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also bombarded him with accessories.  Belts, bracelets, rings, earrings. It was decided that he needed to get his ears pierced again, possibly a stud in his nose, and the discussion of a navel piercing was added too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t I get any say in this?\u201d Kyle whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin laughed, \u201cNo. you will achieve maximum hotness with us. Now go try on those white shorts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith the slingbacks!\u201d Melissa added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls made Kyle turn over whatever they thought he looked best in, and they slowly started to turn those over to the register, building up things that Kylie was going to get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he thought he was finished with the fashion show, he looked around. The tank, jeans, and sneakers he had worn in were nowhere to be seen. There was a small pile of new clothing left, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, where are my clothes?\u201d He asked, sticking his head out of the doorway. Melissa was the only one left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobin has them. We decided that some of the outfits were just too cute on you to not have you wear them. Darla and Robin went to pay. Here,\u201d she handed him some nude heels with a hidden platform. \u201cGo get dressed. We have more stops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSulking, Kyle took the shoes handed to him and went back into the dressing room. They had left him a tan pleated miniskirt and a red knit camisole with matching cardigan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slumped down on the bench. He was stuck. It was either wear this stuff or be trapped in the dressing room in his feminine underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, he got dressed. The camisole was stretchy, and it clung to his bra enhanced curves. The cardigan fell open around his chest, making him feel like his boobs were on stage, the sweater forming a curtain on either side of them. The skirt was short, mid thigh, and the sensation on his bare legs was unsettling. He stepped into the heels, wavered for a second, then got his balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe minced out of the dressing room. Darla and Robin has returned with quite a few bags of his new wardrobe. His earrings were changed, a necklace with a silver tear shaped pendant was placed around his neck.  Again, he felt the silver drop, which rested right between his breasts, just drew attention to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, finally!\u201d Darla said. \u201cYou\u2019re almost presentable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle took a wavering step, and the girls gave him a crash course in walking in heels that high. His calves were on fire, but he had little choice but to learn how to strut in those heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pulled to a piercing kisok where his ears were pierced again.  Much to his relief, the girls were told if they wanted other piercings, they\u2019d have to visit a more dedicated place, such as a tattoo shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his newly pierced ears, mincing along in his heels, his drawstring bag slung over his shoulder, Kyle now looked like a \u201ccute\u201d teenage girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone hungry?  Do we hit the food court, or get Kylie to a makeup counter for supplies?\u201d</span></div></div>",

You'll love it.\" Darla said. \"You wait with the bags, we'll go order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls walked away, leaving Kyle behind to watch over the bags.

He finally spotted them walking back with some trays of food. They saw him, saw the guy sitting there, and all got big grins. They bumped hips, as their hands were full and slowly, much too slowly for Kyle, started walking over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201d Kyle said looking down, not wanting to look at this guy that was obviously hitting on him. \u201cI\u2019m just visiting relatives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob got it. The hesitant speech. The flirty looks away. She was into him. And he thought she was hot, with legs that went on for miles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, i\u2019ve lived here all my life, \u201c Rob said, smiling. \u201cI can show you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...  thanks,\u201d Kyle squeaked, \u201cBut I have my friends...  and here they are now!\u201d Kyle said, hoping that this idiot would leave him alone now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who\u2019s your friend, Kylie?\u201d Darla said with a big grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... Rob?  Rob, this is Darla, Melissa, and Robin,\u201d Kyle said, barely raising his eyes as they say the food on the table and seated themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies,\u201d Rob said, \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you all.  Kylie here was just telling me how she\u2019s just visiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, she\u2019ll be here all summer!\u201d Melissa said. Kyle shot her a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s not seeing anyone!\u201d Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wanted to die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeren\u2019t we going to get me a makeover?\u201d He asked, trying to plead with them to get him out of there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we get it,\u201d Melissa said with a wink, \u201cYou want to look your best for Rob!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle ground his teeth. He wasn\u2019t going to get out of this anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob stood, \u201cLook, I\u2019ll leave you guys to your lunch, but before I go, I need to get your number Kylie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s head shot up, as he stared wide-eyed at Rob. \u201cWhat?\u201d He squeaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s shy,\u201d Darla said, playfully shoving Kyle\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHere\u2019s her number, and here\u2019s her instagram...\u201d she grabbed a napkin and a pen out of her purse and scribbled the info down on a napkin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob stood and took Kyle\u2019s hand, gently kissing it.  \u201cI\u2019ll let you ladies eat and get Kylie her makeover.  But I think you\u2019re gorgeous already, Kylie.\u201d Rob said.  He turned and started to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spun on his heel after taking a step and came back to the table. \u201cOh, I have a friend,\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cHe\u2019s throwing a killer party this weekend. His parent\u2019s are out of town. You four lovelies are definitely invited!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be there!\u201d Darla said, smiling brightly at Rob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you later, Kylie, with the party details!\u201d Rob said as he walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle slumped in his chair. \u201cGirl he was cute!\u201d Robin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd he is so into you!\u201d Melissa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m...\u201d Kyle started to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk girls, party invites.

Eat up!\u201d Darla said. \u201cWe need to get Kylie her makeover now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle pushed around the pasta, not really feeling much like eating anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short order, the girls gathered all the bags, and....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was really cute, Kyle decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I interest any of you girls in a makeover?\" the employee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle shrugged and looked away, but Darla quickly pushed him forward towards the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kylie here is in desperate need of a makeover.\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think desperate, she's already pretty cute, but we can all use some touching up once in a while.\" the employee laughed. \"Take a seat, Kylie and I'll see what I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle complied and hopped into the chair. This might not be so bad, he reasoned. It might be unpleasant, but at least he could stare at the cute makeup counter girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna go put the bags in the car, and we'll be right back, kay?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Kyle said, absentmindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls walked off and the employee got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with removing Kyle's current minimal makeup and started with a new regimen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I'm gonna start with foundation. You've got nice skin, so you'll want one with moisturizer already built into it, plus it cuts a step out of the routine.\" she said, applying the foundation to Kyle's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle barely listened, but MARCI was currently recording everything that the employee said, and was feeding it into Kylie's routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, usually I'd suggest concealer, but you've got pretty clear skin, so I'll go straight to blush to even it out.\" she said, brushing the blush onto Kyle's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close your eyes. Now I'm going to use some eye-shadow.\" she continued as she rubbed Kyle's eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the makeover went about the same way. As the employee explained every item, she applied them to Kyle's face. Eyeliner, mascara, touch-up the brows, and finally lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, she turned Kyle towards the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Kylie?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's mouth dropped open when he saw what he looked like. The smokey eyes, defined face, and kissable lips... he was a knockout!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...M...G!\" Melissa exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle turned around to see the girls in a similar state of shock at his new look. Though their shock immediately gave way to excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great!\" Darla exclaimed. \"I love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betcha can't wait to send a selfie to Rob...\" Robin sang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls quickly started snapping photos as Kyle's stomach turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were done, and Kyle was able to get down from the chair, the girls paid for the makeover and thanked the employee, (making sure to get Kylie a bag filled with the same makeup so he could replicate the look on her own) before heading out of the store.

Silver bikini. My house. Meet there shortly after you get home.\u201d  Kyle\u2019s phone buzzed and he winced.

Unfortunately, it came off as an embarrassed girl deflecting her friends\u2019 teasing. Robin laughed, knowing the Kylie was into Rob then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls, since Kyle now was indistinguishable from the others, piled into the car. Darla pulled up some pop music on Spotify, and the three girls soon had Kyle trying to sing along with a female vocalist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled up to a drug store and Kyle\u2019s stomach fell again. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Robin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Kyle got out of the car and walked alongside Robin. They entered the drug store and walked back to the pharmacy. Kyle was shaking nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, honey,\u201d Robin said, putting her hand on his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. BC is not that big a deal anymore. It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle then realized that just because he had the prescription, he didn\u2019t have to take it. He exhaled a little, gave Robin a weak smile, and said, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pharmacist came over and asked what she could do for the girls. \u201cWe\u2019re picking up a prescription for Kylie Gladstone?\u201d Robin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pharmacist walked over to a nearby set of shelves with bins on them.  The bins had dividers in them with the alphabet on them. She started flipping through the \u201cG\u201d section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, Kylie Gladstone.  Three month supply of Ortho Tri-Cyclen.  What\u2019s the phone number associated with the account?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle rattles off his phone number from the MARCi phone. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t match what I have here,\u201d the pharmacist said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!  Daddy probably didn\u2019t have your number Kylie.\u201d Robin said cheerfully.  She gave the pharmacist her number and the pharmacist nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s the right number. Let\u2019s update you account, Kylie.  What\u2019s your number again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle rattled off the number as the pharmacist typed it in the system. \u201cThere. Now you\u2019re registered at this pharmacy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s phone buzzed and he looked to see another update from MARCI<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotification from MARCI<br>\r\nLocation mapped to CVS. Pharmacy account updated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed.  All things considered, that wasn\u2019t the worst that MARCI had overheard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin paid for the pills, the girls thanked the pharmacist, and they went back to the car.  Kyle threw the bag with the pills into one of the many other bags that contained his new wardrobe that filled the trunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed the trunk and got into the car, sliding in awkwardly as he tried to keep himself covered with his short skirt.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, blaring pop music played as the girls drove home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls helped Kyle carry the bags up to his room and he told them, \u201cJust put it on the bed.  I\u2019ll... figure out what to do with it later.\u201d thinking he could find a corner of the house to shove it into, or take it to Goodwill eventually.  Kyle walked them back to the front door, wondering where Sam was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Kylie,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cGet your bikini on and let\u2019s get some sun!\u201d  The girls got in the car and pulled off, the radio fading as they drive off. Kyle waved, as he felt he had to, and then went back inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, and wanting to get out of these stupid heels, Kyle trudged back upstairs to his room to do something with the purchases. He opened the door to find mechanical arms taking the last of his new wardrobe out of the bags, folding it, and then carrying it off out of sight. The bags were likewise folded and carried off in a different direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have taken the liberty to put away all your new purchases, mistress,\u201d MARCI said happily. \u201cEverything has been organized and added to your new inventory!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I believe you have an appointment with Melissa at her house.  Let\u2019s get you ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!  Wait!\u201d Kyle started, but MARCI wasn\u2019t going to listen. Arms came out and again dosrobed Kyle. He was quickly redressed in the silver bikini, it\u2019s push up top boosting his breasts. The bottoms pulled up slightly, exposing the lower part of his cheeks.   Black pumps were placed on his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was carried over to the vanity where his makeup was touched up. He could feel the sticky wetness of lipgloss, and he was spritzed lightly with perfume. He was released and he stood in shock at how... feminine he now looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour makeup preferences have been updated, mistress,\u201d MARCI said. \u201cEnjoy your sunbathing!\u201d Another beach towel was presented to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sighed.  Sam HAD to get this fixed and soon. He grabbed the beach towel and walked over to the door. He grumpily opened it to find...</span></div></div>",

MARCI is really well protected and there's no easy way in without being the sysadmin. She might lock us out of the entire system if we mess with anything. Or worse, she might do something to <i>us</i>. Something worse than how you are! And the computer doesn't seem dumb enough for us to be able to trick it with a recording or anything like that. Though, there might be some old recordings of Amy we can use to try to reset MARCI if we string enough words together... Otherwise we'd have to wait until they get back from the cruise, which won't be for a while, and hope that Amy is more reasonable than Mark. I'm really sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just perfect...\" Kyle tossed his towel to the floor. \"These girls are relentless.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door closed behind Kyle, and he realized two things:  he was still in heels and he had left his towel behind. Going back up to MARCI\u2019s manhandling (womanhandling?) was not something he wanted to do right then. So he slipped off the heels, picked them up, and started to walk through the grass to Melissa\u2019s. He looked at his phone to see what all the ruckus was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexts from the girls. Darla was running a little late. Can\u2019t wait to see Kylie\u2019s new bikini. And a text from Rob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle ignored that and walked on, looking for settings to stop MARCI from eavesdropping on his conversations. He reached the door to Melissa\u2019s and stood there, lost in the depth of the phone\u2019s settings<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Theresa greeted him with some air kisses, \u201cMy Kylie!  Don\u2019t you look amazing!  Come in, come in!\u201d And she ushered him into the house.  Sighing, Kyle gave up on finding the settings for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring a towel?\u201d Theresa asked. \u201cI\u2019ll get you one. The girls are out back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was ushered out to the patio where Melissa and Robin were, lying on the grass, jabbering excitedly. Kyle gave a weak smile and waved at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look great!\u201d Robin said, running over and hugging Kyle. That was the one thing Kyle liked about this current predicament, being hugged by hot girls in bikinis.   Melissa also gave him a hug. Kyle both cursed and was thankful for the adhesive MARCI had used on his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see the bikini in its glory!\u201d Robin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like I have a wedgie,\u201d Kyle complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t. It\u2019s how that suit fits.  Now let\u2019s see it,\u201d Robin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Meilissa said \u201cGive us a spin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle shrugged and, slumping, kinda stomped in a circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like that!\u201d Robin said, \u201cHere. Like this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came over to stand next to him and executed a graceful twirl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can...\u201d Kyle started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust try it.  Please?\u201d Robin begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle tried a graceful twirl. It was no where close to what Robin had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter, but more like this.\u201d  Robin twirled again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle twirled and actually wasn\u2019t that bad. Halfway through his spin he heard the dreaded shutter sound and Melissa had taken a picture. After some quick thumb typing, she handed her phone to Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an action shot, Kylie was smiling, her arms held in a graceful ex, her hair extended, her cleavage on display, clearly a girl having fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sank. \u201cDo you guys have to post so many pictures?\u201d He whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Next question?\u201d Robin asked, laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa came out with a towel, admonished the girls to use sunscreen, then went back inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u201cgirls\u201d rubbed sunscreen on, with Kyle enjoying (and cursing the adhesive) rubbing their backs and having his rubbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laid on their stomachs, phones at the ready, and proceeded to chat about clothes, celebrities, and boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle tuned most of it out and being somewhat bored, fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nap was interrupted by loud laughing.  He groggily got up to see that Darla had arrived and was standing by his feet with Robin and Melissa. They were all laughing and thumb typing.  It took Kyle a second to register that they had his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!  What are you doing?\u201d he asked, suddenly alarmed. \u201cIs that my phone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd... sent\u201d Darla said, handing the phone back to Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started flipping through it to see what they had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was mortified to see they had taken a close of of his exposed bottom.  The picture clearly showed his wedgie, and the focus was definitely on his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Instagram post simply read, \u201cThinking of my boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you delete this?\u201d Kyle asked, frantically mashing with his thumb. The girls had also set it to his profile picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis phone then buzzed, receiving a new text. From Rob. The girls had texted him that picture, along with \u201cthinking of you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice.  When do I get to see that in person?\u201d Was his reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked up to see the three girls staring over his shoulder, reading Rob\u2019s text. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nudged Kyle.  \u201cWell, go on... flirt with him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle blinked, unsure of what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How on earth could he pass this opportunity up? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls gathered their belongings and set them just inside the patio doors.grabbing only their phones, as they ran upstairs to Melissa\u2019s room.  Kyle was watching (and enjoying) the view as he came up behind them with his phone as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa\u2019s room wasn\u2019t overly girly, at least not to Kyle. Tan walls, some band posters up, not all of them boy bands, either. A rather unremarkable twin bed sat in the corner of the room. A dresser, a vanity strewn with all kinds of makeup and hair products, a full length mirror, some book shelves, and what Kyle guessed was a closet door completed the room. Robin pulled her phone out and put on some pop music. Kyle watched as she began to gyrate to the music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, I love this song,\u201d Robin said, dancing in her bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discomfort in his bikini bottoms made Kyle look away. He studied Melissa\u2019s book shelves, for a bit. When he glanced back towards Robin, Melissa was standing topless, as she got into a drawer and grabbed a bra. He swallowed hard watching her change into a matching bra and panty set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa caught him staring at her and smiled wickedly.  \u201cAre you gay, Kylie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled at being called out, and without really thinking about it, Kyle stammered, \u201cNo!  Of course not!\u201d  He then silently cursed himself for not copping to being a lesbian...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Rob will be glad to know that,\u201d Melissa said, laughing, as she pulled a tight tee shirt on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was fuming. He couldn\u2019t look at the hot girls as they danced and changed, so he went back to looking at Melissa\u2019s bookshelf to distract himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found some yearbooks and pulled them out, starting to flip through them. Apparently, Melissa attended the school her mother was in charge of admissions for. Of course, that made sense. Melissa probably got a free ride there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started reading some of the things other girls had written in the yearbook. Simple things like \u201chave a great summer!\u201d To longer essays about things that happened in the school year. He felt a hand on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!  Yeah!  That\u2019s last year\u2019s yearbook,\u201d Melissa said, peering over Kyle\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the book from Kyle, who was only semi relieved to see she was now in some short denim shorts to go with her tight tee. She started flipping through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla and Robin came over as Melissa started pointing out who was a bitch and who she was friendly with, which teachers were awful, and which ones were nice. And most of the nuns at the school were mean, according to Melissa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle tuned out the droning, just looking at all the teenage beauties in their almost fetish-like school girl uniforms. \u201cWow,\u201d he said softly, \u201cDo you guys all have to wear the uniforms?\u201d He started feeling discomfort again as he thought of Melissa bouncing around in her school girl outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Melissa said, kind of sadly. \u201cIt sucks.  Darla and Robin go to public school and get to wear whatever they want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, ALMOST whatever,\u201d Darla said with a laugh. \u201cRobin did get sent home because her skirt was too short!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy fingertips were just past the hem!\u201d Robin said defensively. \u201cIt should have been OK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be nice to attend that school,\u201d  Kyle said, thinking of all the girls in their uniforms.  \u201cI mean,\u201d he said, catching himself from falling into another trap. \u201cI mean, I guess you go for free cause of your mom, and I imagine it\u2019s a better preparation for college.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Darla said, giving Kyle\u2019s shoulder a nudge. \u201cPublic schools aren\u2019t all bad!  Do you attend a private girls school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe?  No,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cBut that may be kinda fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let Mom hear that,\u201d Melissa said. She\u2019s always looking for good candidates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd by \u2018good\u2019 she means \u2018girls with wealthy parents\u2019.\u201d Robin said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTruth,\u201d said Melissa with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put away the yearbook and the girls sat around the bedroom, playing music and talking about everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Kyle looked at his phone. It was getting late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should get going,\u201d he said, honestly kind of enjoying the time with the girls just hanging out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could sleep over...\u201d Melissa said </span></div></div>",

Lines of code were on the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not exactly,\u201d Sam said, not really looking up. \u201cMARCI\u2019s subroutines are pretty well protected. And it looks like there are a lot of traps in place that could really screw things up if they\u2019re not dealt with correctly.  But...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smiled widely. \u201cBut?  That\u2019s a good but, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I mean, I found out that MARCI is a lot more advanced than I originally thought. It\u2019s got a lot of subroutines. She.... it has an adaptive AI. And there seems to be some pretty advanced things going on behind the scenes. She... it,\u201d he corrected himself again, \u201cIt seems like it has some fabrication technology. This house is a lot bigger than it looks. There\u2019s a fair amount of space carved out below ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle slumped. \u201cSo I\u2019m stuck like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sighed. \u201cAt least for another day. I\u2019m sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing much like the teenage girl he appeared to be, Kyle threw his towel down on the floor and stormed off to his room.  He flopped onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you wish to get ready for bed, mistress?\u201d MARCI asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.  I wish to....\u201d he caught himself before he said anything that crazy machine might take as a command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought for a bit, and asked, very slowly, \u201cMARCI?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, mistress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf... I needed... wanted...to hide my... growth... TEMPORARILY,\u201d Kyle emphasized that word, \u201cwould that be possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMARCI was silent for a second.  \u201cPerhaps, mistress.  However, scans must be made.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms came out, hoisting Kyle into the air, holding him under his armpits.  More arms extended and undressed him. Still suspended, another nozzle came out and sprayed solvent onto his crotch, allowing his trapped member to flop down. He sighed with relief at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn arm with a laser scanner came out.  With Kyle still suspended, a red line moved up and down his crotch. He was turned to a different angle, and the scan repeated. Again he was turned, and the scanning continued. After several minutes of being turned and scanned, the now naked Kyle was gently set down on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeasurements taken, mistress,\u201d MARCi said.  \u201cI shall see what I can fabricate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need it for tomorrow,\u201d Kyle said, quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood, mistress.  Would you like to be prepared for bed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle suddenly realized he really was exhausted.  And sleep sounded pretty good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot relishing what he knew was going to happen, he cringed as he said, \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms came out and carried him into the bedroom.  His hair was brushed out and put into a high pony tail. His makeup was removed. A pink nightie was put on, and matching panties were pulled up his legs. He was dropped gently back into the bedroom, where he walked over to the vanity and looked at himself in the mirror. He looked like a girl, without makeup, getting ready for bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flopped back onto the bed, sighing deeply. He wasn\u2019t looking forward to the gym tomorrow. Sam really needed to get him out of this mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMARCI interrupted his thoughts. \u201cGoodnight, mistress.\u201d And the lights went out, leaving Kyle to drift off to a fitful night\u2019s sleep. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>MARCI\u2019s voice jolted Kyle wide awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, mistress! I\u2019ve let you sleep in as long as I could!  But in doing so I fear I haven\u2019t allowed you much time to get ready.  Steps will be taken to prepare you for your day\u2019s activities on a timely manner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle groaned as he was once again dragged into the shower where he was cleaned with the floral smelling soap and he was treated to ensure no body hair remained. His hair was washed, his teeth were brushed, he used the toilet, and once again he was covered with a towel while another was wrapped turban style on his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was carried back out to the dressing area.  The towel covering his body was removed and a black sports bra with green piping was palaces over his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was lifted into the air as MARCI said, \u201cI believe this will address your concerns about disguising your growth, mistress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn arm came towards him holding what looked like a flesh tone thong. As at approached, Kyle could see that it was more than a thong. It looked like a vagina. So that\u2019s how MARCI was going to hide his junk for the gym!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flesh colored thong was slid up his legs and settled into place. Unfortunately, there was still a bulge under it when it setttled into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me, mistress,\u201d MARCI said. \u201cThis may be temporarily uncomfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother arm extended and pushed Kyle\u2019s member back, while two dexterous fingers pushed his balls up into the cavities they had originally descended from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof!\u201d Kyle said, squirming with discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few more adjustments, mistress,\u201d MARCI said. A probe came out of an arm and buzzed and slid into Kyle\u2019s faux vaginal opening. He could feel it brushing against his trapped member, the vibrations teasing him slightly.  He began to get aroused. The first probe distracted him as he felt a similar probe enter his rear. He gasped with the vibrating sensations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral heat lamps came out and started warming up the area around his crotch, covered by the thong. The material quickly warmed up, and Kyle could feel it getting slimy on the inside of the thong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMARCI?\u201d He asked, starting to get worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost through,\u201d MARCI replied. Several felt wheels came out and began buffing the thin edges of the thong. Kyle was amazed as the seams quickly vanished from sight, leaving him looking like a girl completely now. The probes continued their buzzing, and Kyle was squrming in MARCi\u2019s arms now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne last thing, mistress.\u201d  Another arm appeared, spraying the crotch cover with frigid air. Kyle\u2019s member deflated and shrunk, and the thong seemed to tighten up slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere.  All finished,\u201d MARCI said, setting Kyle down. He walked over to the mirror and inspected his new appearance. It was flawless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Kyle said, now thinking he could easily shower at the gym. \u201cHow hard is it going to be to take off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery simple, mistress.\u201d MARCI said in a chipper voice. \u201cOnce the skin underneath sloughs off, you should be able to step out of it in approximately three weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s jaw fell open. \u201cTHREE WEEKS?  What have you done, MARCI!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to worry, mistress!\u201d MARCI continued on in her chipper voice. \u201cThe device adhered to you is fully functional. You may use the bathroom without concern and even have sexual relations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that instant, another arm came down and held the back of Kyle\u2019s head.  A nozzle tipped arm came out and worked it\u2019s way into his mouth. There was a sharp hiss of air and something hit the back of his throat, forcing him to swallow whatever it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go, mistress,\u201d MARCI said. \u201cI will ensure that your newly prescribed medicines are taken daily. That was the first dose of you...\u201d There was a pause.  \u201c...birth control prescription.  Now let\u2019s get you ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMARCI! \u201c Kyle shouted., \u201cI\u2019m not...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis protestations were cut off as he was forced again into the makeup mask. He emerged after several moments, his hair pulled back in a tight French braid, his makeup done in soft pinks and not overdone. His newly pierced ears has small green jeweled studs in them now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain he was lifted into the air.  He had had enough and began kicking as MARCI tried to pull a hot pink thong up his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress!\u201d MARCI said in a slightly annoyed tone.  \u201cI have to finish getting you ready for your activity!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore arms appeared, holding Kyle helpless as the thong was hiked into place, followed rapidly by tight yoga pants.  Short socks and workout shoes were quickly placed on his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was lowered to the floor where a gym bag was dropped onto his shoulder. \u201cThat should be everything you need for your workout, mistress.  Enjoy your day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle dropped the bag and pulled down the yoga pants and the thong to his knees, trying to free his trapped member inside. The adhesive held tight. He could insert his fingers (which gave him such a weird feeling to think about) but couldn\u2019t find the edges of the thong or even move his junk at all. It was stuck. He was essentially trapped looking like a girl for three weeks, and probably unable to get anything close to hard in the meantime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019d like, mistress, I could help bring you to orgasm, but I fear your time is short to do so,\u201d MARCI said, in that annoying chipper voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, God, no!\u201d Kyle said, alarmed at even that suggestion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I suggest,\u201d MARCI said as arms again hoisted the thong and yoga pants back into place, dropping the gym bag once again onto his shoulder, \u201cthat you go downstairs as it is almost time for your associates to arrive to pick you up.  Have a wonderful day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms carried him to the door, dropping him just outside his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam peeked around the corner.  \u201cDude,\u201d Sam said, amazed, \u201cyou...\u201d his gaze ran up and down Kyle\u2019s body.  His mouth fell open. \u201cYou have camel toe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, jerk. This is MARCI\u2019s help for disguising me for the gym this morning. I am now stuck wearing a thong that essentially makes me look like a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Sam asked, slightly surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s glued on, asshole. It can\u2019t come off for three weeks!  And I\u2019m stuck, literally, in it! You have to fix this!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horn sounded outside.  Groaning with frustration at things rapidly spiraling out of control, Kyle spun on his heel and marched out to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin already had the others in her car.  \u201cLooking good, girlfriend!\u201d She said as she wound the window down. \u201cJust so you know, the spinning class\u2019 teacher is a total hottie!  I bet he notices the new girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle got into the back seat, dropping his bag at his feet. He threw on his seat belt, and slouched, crossing his arms over his sports bra, feeling the new mounds he had there. Things were quickly spiraling out of control </span></div></div>",

Kyle was almost relieved when the car stopped, and he grabbed his bag, before realizing that they weren't at the gym, they were stopped in front of a very famous coffee chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we were going to the gym...\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are, but we always start off with coffee.\" Darla replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll run in and grab the coffee. What does everyone want?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla and Robin had predictable choices, an Iced Caramel Macchiato and an Iced Skinny Mocha respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, Kylie?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a large coffee with cream and two sugars, please.\" Kyle replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you're so boring.\" Melissa giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle just shrugged as Melissa hopped out of the car and ran into the coffee shop. Robin immediately undid her seatbelt and turned backwards towards Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kylie, I love your hair, can you show me how you did it?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. MARCI's in charge of all that stuff, I'm just along for the ride.\" Kyle shrugged. \"I don't usually dress like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you totes should, cause you're a certified hottie.\" Darla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle missed Darla and Robin sharing a look before Melissa returned with the coffees. She handed Darla and Robin their's before handing a cup to Kyle. He immediately knew something was wrong, since his drink was cold instead of hot. And it was in the wrong type of cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Kyle asked. \"This isn't what I said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iced caramel mocha. Trust me, you'll love it.\" Melissa replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin pulled the car back onto the road and Kyle slumped back, defeated. Idly, he took a sip of the drink and grimaced. Skim milk... again. Even when MARCI isn't in charge, he's still on a diet. But the drink wasn't <i>that</i> bad. The girls continued to chat over their coffees as the car finally pulled into the parking lot of the gym.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the radio blaring as usual, the car full of girls pulled into the gym\u2019s parking lot. The three real girls jumped out.  Kyle got out slowly, grabbing his bag as he did, certain that this was going to be his death sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin held the door open for him, waiting for him to enter. \u201cCome on, Kylie!\u201d She shouted. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle felt doomed as he crossed the threshold of the gym. There was a desk and a small waiting area.  Behind that was a glass wall with various workout equipment being used. Darla called Kylie over to the desk to sign in.  She was already mid-discussion with the attendant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she\u2019ll be using my guest pass for the day,\u201d Darla said, smiling broadly at Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill she want a tour?\u201d The attendant asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah,\u201d Darla said. \u201cWe can show her around.  What\u2019s your membership fee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s eyes went wide as the girls were apparently thinking that he may want to join this gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s twenty-five dollars a month.  Would she like an application?\u201d The attendant reached below the counter and pulled out a clipboard with a form and a pen on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Kyle said quickly. He then realized that he needed to downplay that remark, so he quickly added, \u201cLet me see what it\u2019s like here first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, that\u2019s fine,\u201d The attendant said, returning the clipboard to underneath the counter. \u201cJust sign here,\u201d she pointed to a sign in sheet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle picked up the pen and realized that his new manicure prevented him from holding a pen in his normal way. He shifted his position and signed in as Kylie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla and Robin each hooked an arm through his and started leading him to what he thought was his doom, the ladies locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his breath as they entered, waiting to be called out as a pervert or screams of a man being in the ladies locker room, but none came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls put there things in lockers and locked it with padlocks. Kyle opened his bag to see a change of clothing, his stupid pink phone, some makeup, and a keyed padlock with a key on a chain. Stupid MARCI thought of everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stashed his stuff in a locker, snapped the padlock shut, and put the key around his neck, as he didn\u2019t have any pockets or anywhere else to put it. He felt like it drew way too much attention to his chest.  He thought about putting it under his sports bra top, but the chain was too long. So he just left it dangle like it was a high fashion necklace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls led him around, showing him places that he hoped he\u2019d never have to visit again, the pool, the weight room, the equipment room...  there was a yoga studio, \u201cWe should all definitely sign up for a yoga class!\u201d Melissa said cheerily as they showed Kylie around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eventually made it to the spinning class, and it was quickly filling up with women.  The four girls, well, three girls and Kyle, managed to get four bikes next to each other, with Kyle at the end of a row, next to Robin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guy walked into the class at that point and took the bike in front of the class. Kyle reluctantly hopped up on his bike and immediately noted that his trapped member was going to get smashed by the design of the bike seat. It wasn\u2019t painful, but it really was uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shifted nervously on his seat as the instructor began class. Kyle found that if he stood up slightly on the bike, he could keep his trapped member from being crushed.   As the class went on, the instructor kept commenting on, \u201cForm and position, ladies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long into the class when the instructor got off his bike and walked over to Kyle. \u201cYou\u2019re new, aren\u2019t you?\u201d  Kyle was pedaling rapidly, and wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. Robin decided to answer for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s new, and she\u2019ll be joining here soon. Her name\u2019s Kylie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep peddling ladies!\u201d The teacher called out. \u201cWell, Kylie, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, I\u2019m Tom. And you\u2019re not going to get the full impact of the workout with that position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his hand on Kyle\u2019s shoulder and gently pushed him down into a seated position. With every rotation of the pedals, Kyle\u2019s trapped junk was getting crushed. Hit bit his lip and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d Tom said, placing a hand on Kyle\u2019s back. \u201cKeep your back straight, OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle simply nodded, closing his eyes, trying to both ignore having a man\u2019s hand on his back as much as trying to get through this class as quickly as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom returned to the front of the class, leading the women through the workout. Every time Kyle tried to shift position a little, Tom would eaither call out, \u201cKeep your form, Kylie!\u201d Or he\u2019s jump off his bike and move Kyle into the proper position. The workout was intense, and Kyle could feel himself using muscles he hadn\u2019t in a while. He was going to be sore tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class finally ended, and Kyle was so happy to get off that bike. His legs felt like jelly and his crotch was happy to be off that seat. He was thrown a towel by Melissa, and she hip checked him, saying, \u201cSo did we nail it?  Isn\u2019t Tom hot?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... yeah,\u201d Kyle said as Tom game walking back to the group of girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what did you think of your first class, Kylie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...  It was OK?\u201d Kyle said, really unsure of how to answer, but not wanting to commit to anything regarding this nightmare of a gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I hope you decide to become a member here. I\u2019d love to see you again in my class!\u201d Tom said. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, ladies, I need some water and some rest before my next class.  It was a pleasure meeting you, Kylie!\u201d  Tom grabbed a towel, began wiping the sweat off his face, and left the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was gone, Robin squealed, \u201cKYLIE!!  He is so into you!  He wants you in class!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. He\u2019s just trying to increase membership here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen it\u2019s settled,\u201d Darla said decisively. \u201cHe likes you and you\u2019ll join here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!  What?\u201d Kyle said, fearing he\u2019d become ensnared further in this feminine persona. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKylie\u2019s got a boyfriend!\u201d Melissa and Robin began teasing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Darla said. \u201cLet\u2019s get cleaned up and gorgeous and get on with the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio led Kyle to what he dreaded. The showers. </span></div></div>",

On the one hand, he shouldn't go in there, it's morally wrong, even if he looks the part. More importantly, the more time he spends acting like a girl, the harder it will be to get to stop once Sam fixes MARCI. Speaking of MARCI, it would be nice to be able to shower without being manhandled at least once this summer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle took a deep breath and walked into the showers, as he entered he saw several women in various states of undress. As he stared at a particularly buxom woman, a towel was thrown into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kylie! Hurry up!\" Darla shouted as she walked into a stall with a towel around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Kyle grabbed the towel and rushed into the shower stall next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the curtain shut and stripped out of his exercise outfit. He turned the water on and let the water fall over his body, after he got it to a satisfactory temperature. After a few seconds, he realized that he didn't have any soap and he was fairly sweaty. As if by magic, Darla's hand stuck into the curtain holding a bottle of body wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noticed that you didn't have any when you walked in.\" Darla said from behind the curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle started lathering up, finding that Darla's soap smelled very pleasant. He finished up washing, leaving his hair alone, since he didn't know how to undo the braid and turned the water off, pulling the towel around his chest and picking up his exercise outfit. He walked back to the lockers, where the other three girls were standing in various states of dress, Melissa up to re-doing her makeup while, Robin was pulling on her top, and Darla had only just put her bra on. Three weeks was a long time, but at least MARCI's solution saved him today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle reached onto his neck and grabbed the necklace, removing it and putting they key into the padlock as the girls continued to tease him about the instructor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Robin noticed this, gave a subtle elbow to Darla, and nodded for her to look at Kylie, obviously trying to hide her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle started digging through the bag that MARCi had provided. He sighed. A red lace thong and bra, white shirt shorts, and a halter top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waded through the other items in there as well:  sunscreen, lotion, some jewelry, some flats, and a zipper pouch filled with makeup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that he was stuck with what clothing MARCi had provided, and knowing the girls\u2019 opinions, he started rubbing the floral scented lotion onto himself, followed by the sunscreen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla came over and offered to do his back. She insisted that he loosen the towel to get his back. \u201cYou know, Kylie, you have a really nice butt. You should dress to show it off more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... thanks!\u201d Kyle said nervously, suddenly wanting to have the thong on and in place to hide the cover MARCI had glued on, just in case. Darla glances at the other girls in a knowing manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to get dressed after Darla was finished. He mentally screamed again when he realized that MARCI had provided a push up bra that added a cup size.  After adjusting his new chest so that it was as comfortable as he could make it, he sagged when he saw that the bra and the halter top did a marvelous job of putting his boobs on display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really knowing that much about makeup, he watched the other girls and put on some mascara and some lipstick.  He topped it off with some lipgloss. To his horror, the other girls were applying perfume, and he found some in his bag. He gave himself a quick spritz, but didn\u2019t apply much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe minimal look, huh?\u201d Melissa asked, looking over at Kyle. \u201cWith your hair done up like that, I approve. You look cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked into the mirror in his locker. He did look like a teen girl with a healthy glow, ready to go out and tease boys and have fun.   He slumped onto the bench and put on his flats, finishing with a few rings, bracelets, earrings, and a necklace.   He looked like the kid of girl he would love to go out with, rather than be. He was jarred out of his thoughts when Melissa asked, \u201cOK, are you ready, Kylie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Kyle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a hot guy who likes you and who asked us to a party, remember?  Time to start texting him and find out where and when. Then, we\u2019re heading to this super cute little shopping district downtown. We need party wear!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Some black stripper heels were shoved into \u201cher\u201d other hand. Darla spun him around, giving Kylie a shove and a swat on \u201cher\u201d rear back, getting Kyle back into  the dressing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sighed.  He was so hoping the pink dress would be acceptable. He inspected the dress the other girls had chosen for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was short.  A zipper ran down the front middle seam. The dress had lined cups, as he suspected, push up pads in them. The zipper opened downwards, so the amount of cleavage he could show would be adjustable. He didn\u2019t want to think about what the girls would say about how much he should show.  The zipper didn\u2019t go all the way to the bottom of the hem, leaving a noticeable gap that came almost up to to his crotch. And to top it all off, it was stretchy and form fitting.  He didn\u2019t want to do this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on our, Kylie!\u201d Darla called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow us! Show us!\u201d Melissa chanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylie wriggled out of his little pink number and unzipped the black one. He slid his arms into the tiny little straps, and zipped it completely up. It cling to him like a second skin. His boobs looked like they were two cup sizes bigger. Looking in the mirror he could see the lower curve of his ass hanging out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKylie!\u201d Robin called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hung his head and opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls swarmed around him, unzipping the zipper, showing quite a bit of cleavage. He was made to step into the shoes as they were strapped into his ankles. A choker was placed around his neck. At least ten dangly earrings were held up before they were inserted into his earlobes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d Darla finally said, smiling. \u201cBut there should be a few additions. Hold on, I\u2019ll be right back!\u201d  She ran off to the rear of the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta show some cleavage to attract the men!\u201d Robin added. Kyle\u2019s phone pinged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember,\u201d Melissa said, hip checking Kylie, making her take a step in her skyscraper heels, \u201cyour goal is a date with Rob!\u201d  The phone pinged again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Kyle said, hating every second of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla returned, her arms behind her back, smiling broadly. \u201cAnd to make sure you\u2019re in the mood, perhaps you should get these!\u201d  She brought one of her arms  forward and presented an item  that Kylie most definitely did not want anything to do with.  \u201cA pearl thong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was essentially a waistband if black lace with a string of pearls that would run right over his crotch and up his crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa modded. \u201cI have one of those in white. It really turns me on with every step, so I don\u2019t wear it often. But that\u2019s a great idea, Kylie!\u201d  The phone pinged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, look...\u201d Kyle started to say, but was quickly shushed as Darla presented what she had in her other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow this I don\u2019t know about, but...\u201d and she winked at the pun, \u201cit\u2019s an anal plug that has a microphone!

You want to move gracefully, not stomping like you\u2019re kinda doing.\u201d  The dreaded phone pinged again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Kyle was shoved into the dressing room and told to change. He had to hand out the items that the girls had deemed party acceptable, then changed into his \u201cnormal\u201d clothes. When he emerged, the girls were finishing up checking out. Robin and Darla hooked arms with Kylie and Rey walked out of the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere to now?\u201d Robin asked </span></div></div>",

We're dieting until the party, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two girls agreed.  Kyle just shrugged, while he heard his phone ping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, you're going to look like liquid sex next week after dieting!\" Melissa said.  \"Not that you need to,\" she quickly added,  \"In that dress, with those heels, and a makeover at the salon, Rob won't be able to resist you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, you'll have your pick of eligible guys!\" Robin added, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I just had a great idea!\" Robin said, grinning broadly.  \"Let's all work together to get each of us a boyfriend for the summer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all began clapping and liking that idea, forcing Kyle to reluctantly agree.  He'd help get them boyfriends for the summer.  His phone pinged.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving back, the girls made Kyle sing along to some of their favorite pop songs, and he actually had a little fun doing it.  They pulled up outside his uncle's place, and Melissa popped the trunk, allowing him to retrieve the small scraps of fabric they insisted was a dress.  She told him, \"Black bikini, heels.  See you soon!\" and drove off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle paused.  There was no way he wanted those bags containing those torture devices anywhere near MARCI.  Thinking that if he left them outside, until he could get rid of them, he'd be safe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle walked empty handed into the house, unaware that MARCI's arms had picked up his bags outside and set about inventorying them and storing them away until the night they were needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeing Sam anywhere, Kyle trudged up to his room.  \"Welcome home, Mistress!\" MARCI's ever chipper voice said.  \"May I help you with anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle ignored MARCI and walked over to the closet, opening it and trying to see what MARCI had done with the swimwear he had been forced to buy.  He searched for a while and couldn't find anything even close to swimwear.  Sighing, he slammed the closet door, hating what he was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MARCI, I need my black bikini,\" he said, thinking that maybe if he just asked for it, he wouldn't get manhandled into it. No such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mistress.  Let's get you ready!\"  The arms came out and Kyle tried to resist, slapping them away as best he could, but there were too many and they were too strong.  He soon found himself hoisted into the air and his clothing removed.  Sunscreen was applied liberally over his body.  The black string bikini was soon fitted to his him, with MARCI taking care to ensure that the top was tied tightly as the girls had instructed, boosting Kylie's cleavage.  The bottoms were small and tight, showing off Kylie's rear to good effect.  Kylie began kicking in horror when he saw the stripper heels the girls had selected for the party being fastened to his feet.  He soon lost that fight as well, with MARCI telling him, \"You need to practice in these heels, Mistress.  You want to move elegantly at the party to attract a boyfriend!  Please stop resisting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was then placed back into the makeup mask and the hair dome descended.  Kyle felt the usual assault on his face with the cosmetics while his long hair was being brushed into a new style.  When he was released from those devices, MARCI placed him back into the middle of the room and displayed his appearance. He looked hot.  His hair had been brushed into soft curves that fell past his shoulders.  His annoying breasts looked amazing in the pushup top.  His narrow waist was on display as was his rearend in those string bikini bottoms.  He would have gotten aroused if his junk wasn't glued into that female looking thong MARCI had stuck on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle really didn't like this look, but he also didn't trust MARCI not to make it worse for him.  With the stripper heels fastened to his ankles, he began to trudge over to Melissa's.  His calves were burning when he got to the door.  He rung the doorbell, and after several minutes, Melissa's mom answered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kylie!\" she exclaimed  \"That's quite a new look for you!  I see the girls are rubbing off!  You look fantastic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in.  The girls are just getting settled in the back yard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle mumbled a thank you, and  took several stompy steps in his heels towards the back yard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kylie!' Theresa said sharply, causing Kyle to stop in his tracks.  \"That is the most awkward...  I cannot allow you to walk in heels like that!  Come, let's teach you to walk better in heels that high!\"</span></div></div>",

She even had her party shoes on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom was teaching Kylie the finer points of walking in heels. And as much as Kylie had improved, Melissa didn\u2019t want her to turn into one of mom\u2019s projects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom!\u201d She interrupted. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting on Kylie!  She\u2019s not one of your students!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa smiled. \u201cNot yet, but perhaps she will be. Have you ever thought about attending a finishing school, Kylie?  We could polish all the rough edges off of you while preparing you to face the world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... \u201c Kyle searched for something to say. \u201cI\u2019m only here for the summer, remember?  And I\u2019m not sure my family could afford something like that anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe do offer scholarships!  Tell you what, I\u2019ll just get you some brochures, an application, and some financial aid forms, just in case you decide otherwise, dear.

Exude confidence!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa grabbed Kylie\u2019s arm.  \u201cC\u2019mon, we have tanning to do.\u201d She led him out into the backyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa\u2019s little class did a good job of helping Kyle walk in those heels. He strutted over to where the  girls were and assumed his sunbathing position. The girls were pouring over fashion magazines: Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Allure.  Kyle was quickly drawn into reading the magazines. Of course his phone buzzed when the girls said he should read these regularly, as much for the sex tips as for fashion and beauty advice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle glanced over to see the boys back playing their video games. His anger rose when he saw Sam in there with them.   He stood up.  \u201cExcuse me, ladies, but I have to go talk to my brother for a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry back!\u201d Darla said. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait to take this month\u2019s Cosmo Quiz with you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle strode on his heels into the game room, and the boys looked up and stared. To them, this back lit blonde goddess had entered their room. They forgot about the game for a second, with their characters dying horrible deaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam?\u201d Kyle said in a sweet but angry tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam peeked our from behind Eli, as he was seated in the couch away from Kylie. He knew he was in trouble with his feminized brother, but he had other things he was concerned about now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you get mad, let me.... introduce you to someone. Kylie, this is Eli\u2019s cousin, Kim\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was seated at the far end of the couch, hidden behind the mass of boys. She was a girly, skater chick type. Ripped tights, dark lipstick, short spiky hair. But she was cute, not Kyle\u2019s type, but cute. And then Kyle understood. Sam liked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle cocked a hip, crossed his arms over his pushed up chest and said, \u201cSam, a word?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim snorted. \u201cEasy princess.  Don\u2019t get your panties in a wad. Sam can talk to you once we finish playing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle already didn\u2019t like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t princess me,\u201d Kyle snapped. \u201cI need to talk to my brother.  NOW.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnclench, bitch!\u201d Kim started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli stood up.  \u201cLadies!  Kylie, I\u2019ll bring Sam out when he\u2019s done with his turn. Kim, be nice to Kylie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Kim mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Kyle clenched his fists at his side and stomped a foot, something he realized was very feminine. He spun and stormed off, gracefully back to the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you\u2019ve met Eli\u2019s cousin,\u201d Melissa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sat down on his towel, hugging his knees to his chest.  \u201cIt\u2019s not just me, is it? She\u2019s...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMean?\u201d Darla offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAngry,\u201d Melissa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfashionable,\u201d Robin added with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli slipped out of the sliding door of the game room and walked sheepishly over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that Kylie,\u201d he said. \u201cShe likes to make sure she\u2019s noticed when meeting a pretty girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyke\u2019s head shot up, his eyes wide.

We could get her to distract Sam from Kim!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat idea!\u201d Robin said, and immediately began texting someone, probably her cousin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot your back, girlfriend,\u201d Robin said, smiling as she sent several more texts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sighed. Could this get any worse?  Sam would soon have two girls after him, in heaven, and he\u2019d be stuck as Kylie until Amy got back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys eventually emerged from the game room.  Sam walked over to the patio, asking, \u201cSo, superhero movie. Are any of you interested in going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim came over and stood next to Sam. \u201cSo, is she going or not?\u201d She asked, annoyedly. </span></div></div>",

Kyle's hopes for covering up were dashed when he was placed in a medium length skirt and, the ultimate irony, a graphic crop top that featured the logo of the superhero in the film they were planning to see. His feet were placed into a pair of strappy heeled sandals, with his makeup being touched up, but his hair being left alone.

Arms released Kyle's legs to allow a one-piece swimsuit to be pulled up, clamping back once the fabric had passed. It was a form-fitting material that offered full coverage for optimal aquatic aerodynamics. MARCI encountered some trouble in getting the shoulder straps over his arms, but the material was stretchy and soon complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light vacuum pulled Kyle's hair into the helmet as miniscule armatures secured it into a makeshift updo/bun. To protect its mistress' hair from the harsh pool chemicals, a spider-like arm descended baring a stretched-out latex pool cap. With a delicacy that human effort could never replicate, its arms contracted until the cap was nestled snugly on Kyle's head with no more warning than a slight pressure around his temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the system worked, sensors noted the unusual amount of hair on its mistress' body. Not a great amount, but a clear derivation from other recent data. Taking proactive action, a wide laser quickly swept up and down Kyle's limp body, vaporizing each and every hair as it went. The beam even passed through the swimsuit material, eliminating what little chest hair was underneath into less than dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed and prepared (and still completely sound asleep), Kyle was carried back into the bedroom to a small non-carpeted area in one corner. Hydraulic pistons in the floor parted the tiles to reveal an angled tunnel leading off to some unknown destination. With a final act of delicacy, the arms placed Kyle onto the tube, crossed his arms over his chest, and let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle slid down the chute as cleanly as if it were greased, right up until the moment where the slide ended above the indoor pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Good morning, Mistress Amy</i>,\" MARCI stated again over Kyle's sputtering gasps, \"<i>Today's selection for your pre-breakfast aerobic exercise is swimming, in accordance with Master Mark's guidelines for oversleeping. Please perform a minimum of twenty laps to ensure sufficient aerobic activity and proper wakefulness. Breakfast shall be served upon your completion.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle heard none of it as his mind and body still struggled to figure out just what was going on. Eventually, he managed to calm down and take stock of his surroundings. He was wet, and definitely not in the room where he'd fallen asleep. He then remembered his Uncle's comment from the other day about how some of the guest bedrooms had been converted into a pool. A quick look around confirmed that hypothesis. The whole room was a fairly large sized pool, the edges decorated with patterned blue and white tiles. But that still didn't explain why he was in it. And for that matter, what in the world was he wearing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle glanced down as best he could while keeping his head above water. It was some kind of bodysuit that encased him in lycra from shoulder to crotch. The material was lime green with loosely arranged swirls and arcs of yellow. Some kind of swimsuit, obviously, but not like one he'd ever seen around the public pool. Maybe it was meant for competitive racing? It did look similar to something he vaguely remembered from the last Olympics. Still, just because it was stretchy didn't mean it fit well. It was tight around the crotch, flattening down everything beneath it, yet simultaneously riding up his crack. Whatever it was, he decided to remove the uncomfortable garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he tried to pull down the straps, however, the fabric seemed to stiffen. He tried again from the bottom. Maybe he could shimmy a leg out. But the moment he wedged a finger under the edge, the fabric hardened as though it were metal and refused to budge. The same thing happened with the rubber swim cap that encased his head. Yet the instant he stopped trying, the materials became soft and pliable again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Skinny-dipping is not allowed during morning exercise</i>,\" MARCI announced, \"<i>Please perform a minimum of twenty laps to ensure sufficient aerobic activity and proper wakefulness.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he shouted, thankful that he might finally get some information, \"What's the big deal dropping me in the pool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Swimming was selected for today's morning aerobic exercise.</i>\" MARCI repeated, \"<i>Please perform a minimum of twenty-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard you,\" he interrupted. Kyle continued to tread water, as the floor was just deep enough to be out of reach. What a pain this was. Uncle Mark had said that the system was a long-standing work-in-progress. This must be one of its bugs. That or someone had forgotten to turn off an automated system. Like a really wet alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. Strange athletic suit aside, it wasn't all that bad. He knew he could do with a bit of exercise. Maybe it'd be better to just go ahead and do the laps? On the other hand, MARCI was supposed to be pretty advanced. Maybe he could talk her into something else?</span></div></div>",

For now, she was staying with her father but the time was coming when she would have to go to college. Work dried up for Arron and with Sarah out of school, nothing was keeping them at their home town. They decided to make a fresh start, and move a new town to get a fresh start.

Often their mail would get mixed up so much, Arron would often not even bother to correct them unless it was important. Their was a running joke among their friends that they were clones of each other, too. They had a similar build and the same hair color and that didn't make things easier for them.

The event still left it's mark on him, however.

He made his first trip into the house and placed the bags on the table before returning back to his car. It was on his return to the house that he caught his reflection in the window of his car. He looked at himself and noticed that his hair had come out from his business ponytail. Normally he kept it back while he was doing errands but that was no longer the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't notice that it came undone. I guess my last hair-tie broke,\u201d he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed the last bags on the ground and started playing with his hair a bit until he noticed someone behind him in the window's reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEep!\u201d he cried in surprise as he turned to face an old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I'm sorry dear. I didn't didn't mean to startle you. I was just coming over to say hello. You and your daughter just moved in the other day?\u201d the old woman asked kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yes, we did,\u201d Arron said while he calmed back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, please speak up. My ears aren't what they used to be,\u201d she said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES, WE DID,\u201d he loudly confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh good. I think you two will like it here. It's a nice place with plenty to keep a young lady entertained,\u201d She said catching eye of the wedding ring on Arron's finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my daughter will be happy to hear that,\u201d not realizing whose she was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman took his hand into hers without hesitation or awareness of personal boundaries. She retrieved her glasses dangling from the collar of her dress and put them onto the end of her nose. She tilted her head to an exaggerated angle as she held his fingers. Arron was at a loss for words as this strange lady held his hand in a girly position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I didn't realize you were married,\u201d she said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... my wife's but she is no longer with us,\u201d he explained wanting this exchange to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHERE WAS A LOSS IN OUR FAMILY A YEAR AGO,\u201d he stated louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I'm sorry to hear that,\u201d she replied with sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his hand back and picked up his groceries.

If you need anything, I'm just next door,\u201d she said heading back to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. Have a nice day,\u201d he told her while entering his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman headed back to her house and thought to herself, \u201cI should tell my grandson about her. With a little bit of attention I'm sure she could be quite pretty. A year is surly enough time for a young woman to grieve.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a bit of a drive, but it was manageable. Inside he walked around just taking in the scene and making mental notes for later. Arron spent a good hour walking around before getting ready to leave. On his way out, he saw a jewelry shop and thought that maybe he should buy his daughter a present for when she came home. He figured that it would be nice for her to come home to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked in the jewelry shop and started looking around not really knowing what his daughter would like.

He didn't have to look to know that something had gone horribly wrong. He quickly pulled over and got out to see the damage. As water streaked his face he popped open the hood. A crack of thunder made him flinch, putting an exclamation point on the scene in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArron looked at the engine while the rain chilled him to the bone.

As they dried, they grew tighter on him at different angles causing a feminine effect on his frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the man came back, Arron was asleep.

He started to regret his choice as the smell of flowers filled the room but it was better than being dirty. It was fine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he noticed a discomfort building. He wasn't sure what was going on until the discomfort became pain. He rinsed his body in hopes of making the pain go away and it did. With it, however, was his body hair.

When the cold air hit his supple body, he nearly jumped back in the tub. Again his lack of forethought was causing him problems. He steeled himself and jumped out and began to dry himself off. It helped but not nearly enough to keep him from shivering. With no options, he grabbed Sarah's pink fluffy bathrobe handing on the door and put it on. It was fairly short but better than nothing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once down there, he went about shoving his clothes into the washer and set it working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack up stairs, played with the thermostat to warm up the house a bit more while he waited for his opportunity to put his stuff in the drier. Unfortunately, the thing seemed to be busted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll have to call someone over to fix it,\" He thought out loud before looking down at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs were devoid of hair and peaking out of the pink bathrobe. He reached a hand down and touched his thigh and found it smooth and pleasant to feel. It seemed that the bodywash had left his skin fairly sensitive as well as his heart began to pound. The feeling of rubbing his smooth body was really starting to get him off but he stopped himself. He could do that later, once he wasn't wearing Sarah's things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll call now and see if they can send someone over later in the week,\" he said steadying his breathing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The burning filled his nose as he rushed over. Arron ripped open the door to the dryer and cloud of smoke blasts him in the face, knocking him on his butt on the cold basement floor. He would have yelp from the cold touching his bare backside but he was too busy cough from the smoke that invaded his lungs. Once he composed himself, he looked in. Luckily, there wasn't an active fire so the house was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Arron, the same couldn't be said for his stuff. All of it, even his shoes, were ruined completely.

The only scrap of clothes he could find were his wife's things and obviously that wasn't going to fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe emptied everything onto the bed and desperately searched, all while knowing the clock was counting down. He stood there and bit his lip. He began to pace when he noticed a truck pulling up to the house. Painted on the side was written \"Air Repair\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" he cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tore off the the robe and and took his hair out of the towel as he searched for the least feminine items from the piles.

It always looked cute and flirty when his wife would wear it but he figured he would be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried a pair of her jeans but he couldn't get them up his thighs. He tossed them down in frustration before grabbing a pair of pants that was of a stretchy material. Up they went along his hairless legs, sliding smoothly into place. Arron shuddered and squirmed a little at the feeling of the soft fabric on his soft body. When he looked down at himself he realized that they left nothing to the imagination. His small cock was at attention, clearly outlined in the fabric and he knew he had to do something about that. He shivered with what he hoped was just embarrassment as he picked up a pair of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...that is too far,\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he heard the doorbell. He swallowed hard before slipping them on. They were tight but did the job of hiding his embarrassing member from sight. He next pulled on the pants and then dashed to the door, his cute hair bouncing back and forth around his shoulders as he did. He had a hard time ignoring the pleasure he felt as he unintentionally rubbed himself with each step.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was starting to wish he grabbed some socks or something while he was upstairs but he would just have to deal with the cold for the time being. He opened the door and smiled at the man behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh, Hi. I'm Ted...from Air Repair,\" the man nervously said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Ted. I'm Arron,\" he said holding out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Erin,\" Ted said, taking Arron's smaller hand into his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too, come in. I'll take you to the thermostat,\" He said, turning his back on Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArron leads the man into the house to where the thermostat is located. As he walks, he can't help but tiptoe to try and keep as much of the surface area of his foot off of the cold floor as he could manage. Once they get to the thermostat, Arron turns to see Ted eyeing his clothes. He wants to offer some kind of excuse but he just smiles and blushes in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm mortified...I wonder what he is thinking,\" Arron thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed didn't mind walking behind the new customer one bit. He couldn't help but have his eyes drift down to her ass as she swayed it back and forth while she minced in front of him temptingly. Her sweater came down just enough to let her round ass teasingly poke out in her yoga pants. Those tight pants cupped her perfect backside in a way that was making his own pants tight. She turned back to face him, catching him staring. He cringed internally at getting caught but she just smiled and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she likes the attention...\" he thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArron waits as Ted pokes around at the box before unscrewing it and taking a look inside. Arron shuffles back and forth from one foot to the other trying to ignore his feet. That, however, brings forth his other problem. Each shift of weight slides the fabric he is wearing across his skin. The panties slide along his hidden cock and the sweater grazes his now erect nipples. He can feel his pulse moving quicker as he folds his arms in an attempt to stop the sensations. Arron kept himself together but he was definitely looking forward to rubbing one out latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed was finding hard to concentrate as he checked out the thermostat with his erection begged for attention. He had been going through a dry spell and hadn't been with a woman in a while. The image of Erin's ass kept playing in his mind and what he wanted to do to it.

He can't help but glare at the washer and dryer that stole his clothes from him and put him in the uncomfortable position he found himself in. The area is filled with boxes that still need to get unpacked but have been moved there for the time being. It did have the side problem of giving the two off them little room to stand and forced them to stand fairly close to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed could feel the woman he thought was Erin's heat, his cock hard with need for her. He held his toolbox in hand as he stood there with her, looking at the heater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why was she just standing her like this...did she want him to just take her?\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArron on the other hand was lost in thought. He thought about clearing out the dryer and maybe salvaging something in there. He wasn't too hopeful but maybe it was worth doing for the slim chance. He should also see if there was a dryer trap or something that should be removed. If he could fix the dryer, that would be at least one less broken thing to worry about. It was then that he realized that he had been in Ted's space for an awkward amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" he said with an embarrassed smirk as he shimmied passed him to get over to the dryer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" she said with a flirty smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed almost gasped as Erin's fingers grazed against his cock as she smirked.

If he was thinking clearly he would have just finished this job and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't thinking clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he walked over to the dryer and but his toolbox down on it and unclasped his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========== <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArron was looking inside the dryer trying to see if there was something wrong with the filter. Last thing he needed was his daughter coming down and having the same thing that happened to him happen to her. He tugged at the lint trap but it seemed to be stuck and slightly melted. He pulled while still attempting to ignore the feeling the clothes gave him. He shifted left and right unconsciously stimulating his hidden member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden back above Arron startled him, causing him to shoot up and bang his head. He found himself stunned, only vaguely aware of a noise behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========== <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed dropped his pants and boxers to the floor, his cock springing free. It was ridged and at complete attention. He jerked it a few times before moving his hands to Erin's hips. He caressed her hips before running his hands along her ass, running his fingers along the crease. Ted heard her moan, letting him know that she wanted him to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou little minx, this was a trap,\u201d he told her as he pulled her yoga pants down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm happy to take the bait,\u201d he told her before spitting into his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lubed himself up before, slowly, he entered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========== <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArron was in a daze as he felt hands on his hips. He had to conclude that it was Ted hands that were rubbing his ass. Even with all of the stimulation he had been getting, it was still an unwanted surprise that those hands felt good. He tried to tell Ted to stop but he could only moan at his touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArron's mind was buzzing as he felt his pants being slid down but not far enough to free his cock. He heard Ted say something but his mind froze as he felt something hard as his backside. Then it began to enter him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========== <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed shuddered as he worked himself into Erin, not believing his luck. Her ass was smooth, tight, and perfect. He trust in and out, blossoming her up and he enjoyed her body. He heard her gasping and sighing at the feel of his cock inside her. His hands ran across her body, rocking back and forth into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to change this position, he withdrew and pulled her out of the dry, leaning her over it. She was overcome with passion, knocking his tools to the ground as she grabbed the edge of the machine. Quickly he entered her again, her moans becoming more depart and needy. He fucked her they way she liked and he was getting close. He reached over to her face and pulled her face to his and kissed her hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he was pushed over the edge, cumming deep inside her while his tongue danced along hers. He humped her a feel more times while kissing her, giving her the last drops he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========== <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArron's mind went from being frozen to being on fire as this man thrust his cock into his virgin ass. The pain shut down his thoughts as he was penetrated for the first time in his life. Rocking back and forth the pain slowly became dull before he felt something he never felt before...his prostate was being massaged. It felt like nothing he had felt before and his orgasm was nearly there when he felt Ted pull his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArron was pulled out of the dryer and stood back on his feet. He gabbed the dryer to steady himself and tried to figure out what to do. He was shaking with need but he couldn't let this continue...he was a guy. If he was thinking clearly he would have punched the guy and kicked him out of his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't thinking clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead he just stood until Ted pushed back into his hole and began pumping into him again. He felt himself being brought to the edge but still he tried to fight the feelings he was having forced on him. Then Ted twisted his head toward him and kissed him. Their mouths met and Arron's body lost it. He came what felt like forever as a man came into his ass. The post orgasm left him feeling weak, leaving him no strength to stop Ted's continued makeout session. Instead he closed his eyes and kissed him as he leaked into his panties.</span></div></div>",

Still stuck on his tiptoes, splayed awkwardly over the dryer, Arron could only tremble as the man who just completely and brutally violated him fondled his earlobe and whispered promises of more to come. Gathering the courage to look his rapist in the eye, he tilted his head just in time to see Ted coming in for another wild kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes wide in surprise, Arron give a muffled yelp as he locked lips with Ted, the repair man\u2019s tongue working furiously while his merely passively received. Finally, breath heavy and hot on his face, Aaron relented and stood up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be getting prudish on me, Erin. I'll be right back. When I am, be ready for more.\" Arron involuntarily twitched at the concept. Now that the pleasure and the minor concussion had begun to weaken, he slowly realized the nightmare he was stuck in. \"Be ready, sugar. Don't go anywhere.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ted stomped off back upstairs, not even bothering to zip up his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArron lay broken and stunned, draped over the dryer for what felt like an eternity. Ass now burning with the pain of what he feared was rectal tearing, Arron finally gathered the will to move. By the time he maneuvered to his knees, now facing back to the stairs, Arron felt as if someone had cracked his pelvis into a dozen pieces. Moaning with the pain and trying his best to hold back the tears, Arron reached back and confirmed his suspicions. He was lightly bleeding. It wasn\u2019t serious, but it only added to the horror of his situation. Arrin let loose another moan of pained disbelief and then let his gaze rest on his bloody finger in stunned silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moment, Arron heared the stomping and shuffling of Ted\u2019s return. Movements panicked, Arron pulled his cum-covered panties and leggings up as much as he could. The sensation was horrible, and as he glance down Arron was greeted with the sight of a massive wet stain covering his crotch. Arron, face reddening, felt even more disgusted as he realized just how much he came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErin, that was a damn good ride.\u201d You were too distracted by the state of your crotch to even realize Ted now stands before you. You raise your gaze to meet his but are distracted midway by his cock, still exposed but apparently cleaned. \u201cJudging by the waterworks down there and those moans, I think you\u2019d agree. Now, just because we\u2019ve made one happy ending doesn\u2019t meaning we can\u2019t make another. You got me? If I\u2019m being honest, I think that was more of a fantasy for you. Now it\u2019s my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Arron could even yell his refusal, Ted was on him. The musk of his still semi-erect cock was overpowering and it was all Arron could do to keep from getting sick. With a slow and terrifying certainty, Arron felt Ted grab two handfuls of his wavy hair and pull his terrified face closer. Ted\u2019s veiny cock brushed against Arron\u2019s cheek as the stunned man squirmed in terror. To his horror, The momentum quickly reversed and he found his head smashed once, twice, three times against the dryer. Arron moaned in pain as everything went fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed couldn\u2019t believe how horny he still was. This Erin was a miracle, a perfect, eager little miracle. Staring down at her, he saw nothing but a lonely, naughty housewife who was doing bad things with the most glee she could. She refused to make eye contact, but he kinda liked that\u2014a submissive girl was a rare thing in his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCock rubbing on his newfound girl\u2019s face, Ted paused to consider his options. Face stretching with the start of a grin, Ted readjusted his grip on Erin\u2019s hair and opened his mouth to tell her what exactly he had in store for her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unbeknownst to Brian, Andrew had one goal on his mind, to get his buddy a girlfriend. Brain was very shy, so shy that he had always been single. To make matters worse, anytime he had worked up the courage to ask a girl out she would shoot him down, hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew, on the other hand, wasn't bad with women. He was in a band, which helped, though he was fairly thin. He also got compliments on his long hair a lot. He never liked getting too serious, though, so he was often single.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, go ask her,\u201d Andrew prodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, man. Lets just do something else,\u201d Brain suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew dropped it for now, not wanting Brain to shut down. Instead they ate their pretzels and tossed out their garbage. Andrew wasn't done, but he would bide his time. Instead, they started down the mall, window shopping until Brain go a call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh damn, my client's  server crashed. I'm sorry, I need to see if I can get it rebooted,\u201d Brain apologized, finding a bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out his bag and set up his laptop. Andrew was afraid of this happening. Brain often had to suddenly deal with work when they hung out. Maybe Andrew could use the time to get a plan into action? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, I'll just walk around while you handle it. Give me a call when you finish up,\u201d Andrew told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew walked around and tried to think about how to handle his buddy. He was lost in thought as something caught his eye. Before him was a fountain he never saw before, though new installations where common. He approached it, taking in the sight of it. Sat on the edge  of the fountain was a single coin, almost begging to be tossed.

Normally he would have just left, not trusting a woman's salon to cut his hair right, but for some reason he was just let himself go along with this. He sat in a chair as directed and the woman tossed a pink sheet around him. He groaned internally at the color but didn't say anything. Instead, he sat quietly as the woman brushed out his hair. They talked about what he wanted and she got to work. Eventually she had him get up and move to a sink basin to wash his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was while she was washing his hair that she got a phone call. Something personal came up and she had to leave. She ended up having to inform one of her coworkers, who took over for her. Unfortunately for Andrew, there was some miscommunication. The new woman explained to Andrew that she was taking over as she brought him back to his chair and began to work on Drew's makeover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew didn't realize what was happening until it was far too late. When the woman started to do his make up, Andrew wanted to melt away in embarrassment. When she was finished, Andrew's jaw dropped. His hair was smooth and shiny. His lips were red and kissable.

Of course the woman had mistaken him for a woman in the short time they saw each other and now expected him to wear what she gave him. There was no way he would do something like that. The accident in the salon was one thing but he was not going to willingly put on a dress no matter how embarrassed he was. He decided he would just explain that he was a man and would like some pants. He was about to do just that when he heard the woman speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything alright? Would you like me to get you something else to wear?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, everything is fine. These are lovely, thank you,\u201d he heard himself say in a soft, breathy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened and his hand clasped his throat. The girly sound he could explain by the fumes from earlier but there was no explanation for what he had just said. There was absolutely no logical reason he would say any of what he just did. Andrew threw the garment down in anger and frustration and growled an unintentionally sexy growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, Damn it, Damn it,\u201d Andrew cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the dress on the floor with a sense of dread growing in him. To put that on was just one more bullet in the chamber and his masculinity was the target. Along with the dread, he felt discomfort at seeing the dress on the floor. He did his best to ignore it and try to think of some way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to speak up and say that he changed his mind about the clothes but he couldn't get anything out. All the while his eyes darted back to the garment on the ground. Eventually it became too strong and he had to pick it back up and was relieved to find that it didn't wrinkle because of his tantrum. Andrew looked at himself in the stall mirror mirror before lifting the black dress and saw the confusion on his own face. He slipped the dress over his head, fitting his arms through the sleeves, settling the fabric down his body, and then stepped into the matching black heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on, Andrew turned back to the mirror and instead of frowning, he smiled. He twisted and turned, loving the feel of the fabric hug his smooth skin. The skirt tickled his thighs as the hem grazed his long legs. The top of the dress exposed his bare shoulders and was made to support a woman's chest without a bra. On him, it hid the fact he didn't have breast really well. His reflection was that of gorgeous woman and one that knew that fact. The dress looked amazing on him and he was sure Brian was going to love it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Andrew said to his own thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pretty face turned to a grimace as he realized what he just did. He was supposed to be thinking of a way out of this, not embrace it. The image in the mirror was still that of a beautiful women but now she was clearly in a lot of distress.</span></div></div>",

I already handled the bill,\u201d She told him as she started to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew was shocked. He should get a lawyer or something after everything that happened. He lost his clothes and his body hair due to whatever it was that the woman had. Someone should pay. Instead of doing anything to stop the woman, he left the shop and sashayed down the mall. His hips swayed back and forth as he walked along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt incredibly vulnerable dressed as he was and the male attention he was getting. Guys turned their heads as he walked passed, goofy smiles on their face. Andrew was mortified but couldn't stop himself. He even stopped by a shop and bought himself a bottle of perfume and some makeup. Smelling lovely, he walked to the adult section of the mall. There wasn't a lot of stores but he found himself stepping into a sex shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn auto pilot he walked straight for a few items. To his horror, he watched himself buy false breasts, a false vagina and glue. They were crazy high tech and so expensive it turned his stomach as he bought the items from a fairly bored looked attendant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he took his new products into the woman's bathroom and entered a stall before getting to work. He took the glue and got his new parts into place, now looking exactly like a naked woman. Soon, he was dressed again and walking the mall again, though this time clearly displaying breasts on his chest.  </span></div></div>",

The his clacking heels eventually lead him back to Brian, much to his panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, god, please don't recognize me!\u201d he begged in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian was clicking away on his laptop, his face showing concentration. He glanced up and ended up doing a double take when he spotted Andrew's approach. His eyes widened as he took in the sight of his long, shapely legs. His eyes darted back to his computer screen, his face turning red. Andrew felt his painted lips curl into a smile despite him feeling far from amused. After he passed Brain, his feet stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Why am I stopping now?!\u201d he screamed in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt himself smooth out the dress from under him and he sat down, close to his friend. He was pretty sure Brian froze for a second before starting to clicking again. Andrew just sat on the bench and felt himself stealing glances at Brian, the smile still on his face. He crossed his legs and pull out his makeup from his purse. I took sight of his reflection again looking back at himself in a tiny mirror. He still couldn't believe what he was seeing as he watched himself re apply his lipstick. After he finished he glanced back at Brian who was stealing a glance at the display. He tried to act like he wasn't looking at Andrew but it was obvious what he was doing. Andrew just felt himself smile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is happening?\u201d he thought, terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian did his best to ignore the person in the cocktail dress and heels next to him, but Andrew wasn't making it easy. The next thing Andrew felt himself push out his crossed leg into Brian's line of sight. Brain paused again as Andrew began to message his leg. It did feel good since his legs were hurting a bit, not being used to walking in heels. What wasn't good was what this was doing to Brain. It was clearly having an effect on his friend, who was starting to squirm, adjusting the laptop on his lap a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he...am I getting him hard?\u201d Andrew thought in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as his thoughts had drifted to what was happening in his buddy's pants, he felt something weird happen. He felt a light sensation on his hidden cock that was trapped underneath the false vagina. At the same time, his nipples started feeling something underneath his false breasts as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d he wondered in shock as the pleasant feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling passed as quickly as it arrived but he was left startled. He didn't have time to deal with that weirdness because something more pressing began to happen. He felt himself lean in to his friend and reach out to touch his thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, what's your name?\u201d he purred to Brian.</span></div></div>",

As soon as he was free, he bolted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he wasn't the strongest guy around, he was pretty fast. At least, faster than them.

It seemed to be a pretty popular store, since Andrew had to duck and weave to avoid crashing into the girls and women browsing in the store. Which was fortunate, since it provided ample distractions for the three brutes that were chasing Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew kept running until he hit the back of the store and ran down several aisles, eventually ending up near the fitting rooms. There wasn't an attendant standing near the door, and Andrew dashed inside, finding an open curtain and rushed into the room, closing the curtain quickly behind him. He knew he didn't have a lot of time and stopped to catch his breath. Maybe the big guy didn't even see him run into the fitting room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir! You can't go in there!\" a woman shouted from outside the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outta my way! There's a dude in there!\" the big guy shouted at the woman. \"Just let me go in so we can finish our business outside of your store!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Andrew whined. \"What am I going to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew noticed a pile of clothing just sitting on the bench, likely discarded by the last woman to use the dressing room. He looked up and down for a vent before he started digging through the pile of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom outside, Andrew could hear curtains being pulled open as the brute got closer and closer to his booth. He didn't have much time. Andrew quickly pulled his shirt off and hid it underneath the pile of women's clothes. He pulled a light blue bra from the pile. It appeared to be padded, which was another fortunate development for Andrew. He undid his ponytail and let his long hair flow, and he mussed his hair up slightly to give it the appearance of being styled. He slid his arms into the straps of the bra and kept himself turned towards the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have you now!\" the big guy shouted, yanking aside the curtain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew let out a high pitched scream as he feigned covering up his body and face. The big guy's eyes widened and he immediately jumped back. He started to stammer a reply:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I... uh...\" the big guy stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately left the room, with the attendant rushing into the fitting room after he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry about that, Miss. He pushed his way through and I had no way of stopping him.\" the attendant said. \"Allow me to offer you something for all the trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's quite all right.\" Andrew said, hoping the woman would leave so he could change back and get back to Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, I insist.

Thankfully, he still had his own pants and shoes, and he'd have to go buy a new shirt somewhere else once he escaped, but at least he was safe for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew exited the changing room and ran back into Kristi who was waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so we can do this one of two ways, either you pick out your outfit and then go to the salon, or you do the salon first and then pick out an outfit.

He poked and prodded, but never picked anything up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could sense that Kristi was starting to get confused by his actions, so he idly picked up a casual-looking powder blue dress with a fitted skirt and started looking over it, as Kristi observed. She seemed satisfied and eventually, Kristi was called away by another customer. Andrew saw his chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew placed the dress down onto a display table and started to sprint towards the entrance of the store, only to be met by another young woman who he nearly ran into.

She was a cute, peroxide blonde, complete with beauty mark, chewing gum. She had a definite sexy 50\u2019s vibe about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held his hand up and inspected it. \u201cOh, honey, these nails are horrible. Let me guess, you bite your fingernails?  Don\u2019t worry, we have just the thing. Here, have a seat and we\u2019ll get started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut..\u201d Andrew started to say.  But the blonde spun his wrist, depositing him into the salon chair. He went to stand up, but a hot pink cape was immediately flared over him and rapidly fastened around his neck. He again attempted to stand up, but the back of the chair was dropped, and his head was deposited into a sink.  The beautician began spraying his hair with warm water from a hose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began washing his hair with floral scented shampoo. \u201cBarbie?\u201d The blonde called out.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to need some silk wraps on this one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gazed down upon Andrew, massaging his scalp as she washed his hair. \u201cOh, honey, those brows...  not to worry. You\u2019re in good hands. I\u2019m Donna, and we\u2019re going to get you gorgeous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I...\u201d Andrew started to say again, attempting to get out of the salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess,\u201d Donna said, \u201cbig date?  That explains the new outfit and Kristi giving you the works,\u201d Donna said, now rinsing his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should...\u201d Andrew tried again, as Donna wrapped a towel around his hair and sat him back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna cut him off again. \u201cSmile for me, honey,\u201d She said, giving him a scrutinizing look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Andrew gave him a big toothy grin. \u201cI thought so. You drink coffee, don\u2019t you?  Your teeth are stained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeslie!  Bring the teeth whitening tray!\u201d Donna called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, if you could...\u201d Andrew tried again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna dropped a fashion magazine into his lap. \u201cSee if there\u2019s a hair style in there that you like, Andrea. Although....\u201d she grabbed his cheeks in a vice like grip and turned his head side to side, \u201cif you\u2019d like, I know exactly what would look hot on you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna pushed his head down and began vigorously drying his hair. He couldn\u2019t get a word out. When she finally whipped the towel off, another woman was standing in front of him with a foam filled tray. She pinched his jaw open and popped the tray into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Leslie,\u201d the new woman said. \u201cTry not to talk with that in. It\u2019\u2019ll burn a bit if you swallow any.  Just trust Donna. She\u2019s great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew\u2019s eyes went wide. He glanced worriedly up at Donna.  She pushed his head down and began combing his hair out. \u201cUgh. The split ends. Don\u2019t worry. We can fix that!  So, did you find anything cute in the magazine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magazine was unopened, still on Andrew\u2019s lap. He slowly shook his head, feeling an impending doom descending upon him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK.  I know just what to give you!\u201d Donna said cheerfully. \u201cSo...  been dating this guy long?  Or... oh!  Salon trip!  New outfit!  First date!\u201d Donna said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began taking sections of his hair, combing them, and then, while holding them between two fingers, cutting off the ends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman wheeled up a cart and took hold of Andrew\u2019s right hand, placing it in a vat of warm wax. \u201cParaffin soak, honey,\u201d the woman said.  He guessed it was Barbie. \u201cIt\u2019ll make your hands soft and smooth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wheeled over to his other hand and placed it in another vat of warm wax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a first date with a new guy!\u201d Donna said, snipping away at Andrew\u2019s hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Barbie asked, looking up at Andrew. \u201cIs he cute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew sighed. He was in an insane asylum. Barbie took the sigh as a yes. \u201cWe\u2019ll make him adore you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie removed his hands from the wax and it rapidly cooled and hardened. She pulled it off easily, and began working on his cuticles. She also slid something under each nail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Donna combed Andrew\u2019s hair down over his face, obscuring his view. He could feel her combing and cutting, while something with an acrid solvent smell was being applied to his nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t move, honey,\u201d Donna said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his horror, Andrew saw the scissors come in from his left and snip a clean, straight line across his forehead.  He had bangs!  And he could see Barbie finishing up painting a long nail onto little shelves she had slid under his real nails, and putting a carefully cut piece of fabric onto the nail. She took his hand and placed his fingertips into a small box.  A blue light glowed inside the opening and he heard a small fan in the box whir. \u201cSilk wraps,\u201d Barbie said, winking at him. \u201cThey\u2019re super durable. You won\u2019t be able to bite them off once they harden under the light!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie moved to his other hand and began repeating the process of extending and hardening his nails. . Donna, meanwhile, had started taking a straight razor to his hair, shaving the ends off of it, giving him layers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna leaned over from behind him, and asked softly in his ear, \u201cSo, do you want a nice deep auburn, something sexy and redhead?  Or maybe a sexy blonde bedhead?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \u201cSorry!  Forgot about the teeth whitening. Blink once for auburn and twice for blonde!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You really should neaten them up more often!\u201d Barbie said. \u201cLeslie, can you handle the pedi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Leslie said cheerfully. Andrew felt his shoes begin removed and his feet were plunged into a warm bath of scented water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Barbie came at him with a loop of string, crossed over in a figure eight. \u201cThreading is so much neater than anything else,\u201d she said she leaned over, giving Andrew a closeup of her chest as she began rapidly whisking the string close to and then away from his face. With each motion, he could feel a sharp pinch as his eyebrows were slowly plucked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was flinching with each pluck. Barbie chiluckled, \u201cBeauty is pain, honey. But you\u2019ll look great when we finish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and took a step back. She reached over to a cart and got a pencil and he felt her drawing some lines on his brows. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got the heavy work done,\u201d Barbie said, \u201cwe need to make sure we have the shape right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Leslie had removed his feet from the bath, dried them, and was removing any rough spots with a file. She then applied a sweet smelling lotion. She rapidly shaped his toenails and dealt with the cuticles. Andrew didn\u2019t think that felt too bad ,until he felt a foam object being wedged between each toe. He smelled a new smell and cold feel a cold liquid being applied to his toenails. They were painting his toes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe \u201cmmphed\u201d in displeasure as the torments continued. Barbie was threading his brows, taking a step back every so often to make sure things were neat and even. Eventually, she took a small razor on a handle and made very precise angles on his brows. She then painted some of the hoop that Donna had used on his hair on his brows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the foul packets on his head warming up. Donna moved to the front now and took his left hand, shaping his new nails and applying polish to them as well. His fingertips were again shoved into a box, and warm air blew over them, rapidly drying his new nail color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then felt Leslie push his pant leg up. \u201cGirls, she has a little hair. What do you think?  Waxing?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d Donna said, emphatically. Andrew shook his head, but the beauticians ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to that later though. Donna moved back behind him and peeled open a foil packet. \u201cI think she\u2019s just about ready with the color.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew\u2019s head was again dropped into the sink. Donna rapidly removed the foil packets and began rinsing his hair. He could smell ammonia as she did. He just hoped all of this could be undone. He\u2019d have to get a buzz cut, maybe shave off his brows entirely.  She wiped off his brows with a wet cloth, and sat him back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmphing his displeasure, Donna began putting curlers in his hair. \u201cWhen you come back next time, we\u2019ll see about some extensions,\u201d Donna said. \u201cBut for now, let\u2019s give your hair a bit more body, something that says, \u2018Sex Kitten,\u2019 for your date!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew tried to shake his head \u201cno,\u201d but Donna had a lock of his hair pulled tightly as she wound a large curled up, preventing him from moving his head much at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head was slowly covered by tightly rolled curlers.  Barbie announced that his nails were dry and started to clean up the mani/pedi equipment. Andrew fanned his fingers out at stared at his now feminine hand.  Long oval fingernails extended from his fingers, each a deep pink color. They looked like a woman\u2019s hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna meanwhile finished with setting his hair.  The curlers were tight and uncomfortable. <br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s get you dry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew wasn\u2019t sure where his shoes and socks were. Leslie slipped some sort of disposable flip flop on his feet. The foam wedges between his toes remained made walking awkward. Getting out of here now was going to be impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie took him by the hand, and he waddled as she led him over to a bank of hairdryers. She sat him between two older women, put the dryer down over his curler filled head, and handed him a copy of Cosmopolitan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy yourself, Andrea!\u201d  Barbie said. \u201cWe\u2019ll check back on you in a few!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew groaned as the dryer was turned on and warm air blew over his head. He could feel the hair tightening uncomfortably as it dried <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll hello, Andrea!\u201d one of the women said to him. </span></div></div>",

Eventually, Barbie returned and lifted dryer, checking Andrew's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done!\" Barbie helped Andrew to his feet and started to lead him across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew spotted an empty chair by a mirror, and also a back room door left slightly ajar.

But first...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew wasn\u2019t really listening. The curlers on his head were wound tight, and he was preoccupied by the pain in his scalp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led him over to a sink, put on some gloves, and popped the tray out of his mouth. popped the tray out of his mouth. She handed him a glass of water. \u201cRinse,\u201d she told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe  rinsed his mouth out several times and spit into the sink. He finally got a look at himself in the mirror. His face was rather feminine looking, especially with his thin angled brows. His hair, wound tightly around the curlers, was a sexy auburn. What was left of his brows matched his hair. He raised a hand to his face in shock and saw, essentially, a woman without makeup on. He showed his teeth and they were dazzling white. At least he had that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Andrea, there\u2019s still some work left to do,\u201d Barbie said, misreading his shocked face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell have you crazy bitches done to me!\u201d  He said. Or tried to. All that came out was a wheeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie frowned. \u201cLooks like someone swallowed some of the teeth whitener. Don\u2019t worry, your voice will be back, probably tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew made a motion of writing with his hands. He\u2019d tell these women what they could do with themselves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Barbie misread him. \u201cOh, the bill?  Don\u2019t worry. Kristi is taking care of all of this!  Now let\u2019s go. We haven\u2019t got all day, just most of it.\u201d  She laughed and ushered Andrew into the half open doorway. She removed his pink cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a robe and panties in there.  Change into them and come out. You can take the spreaders out of your toes, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe escorted Andrew through the door and closed it behind him. He looked around. Could he escape?  The room was windowless. All that was in it was a light fixture, a bench, a mirror, and a couple of hooks. It didn\u2019t even have a drop ceiling that he could maybe escape through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat on the bench and stared at his pedicured toes, pulling the foam spreaders out and wiggling them. They looked so... feminine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the hook on the back of the door and there was a pink nylon robe, and in cellophane, sitting on the bench, were apparently the panties he was supposed to wear. He opened the package and looked at them. They were essentially made of paper. Disposable, he figured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock.  \u201cAre you ready yet?\u201d  Barbie said as she poked her head through the doorway. She frowned.  \u201cAndrea!  Please get changed!\u201d  She closed the door again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really sure what would happen if he didn\u2019t change, but knowing that if he just rode this nightmare out, he\u2019d soon be free of this madhouse, Andrew stripped, leaving his padded bra on. He pulled the panties up into place and thought that they itched. He slipped on the nylon robe. It was short. Shorter than he ever thought he would wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Barbie knocked on the door, saying, \u201cKnock knock!\u201d And opened the door, peeking inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!  Let\u2019s go!\u201d She said, once again, grabbing Andrew\u2019s feminine hand and pulling him to a new section of the salon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a padded table with a sheet of paper on it, and a pillow. She patted it with her hand and Andrew sat gingerly on it, not really knowing what to do about the shortness of the robe, so he crossed his legs in a rather feminine fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Andrea, lie back,\u201d  Barbie said as she gently guided him into position. She then got a pot of black syrupy liquid and began smoothing it onto his face with a spatula. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharcoal mask,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll help clear out all those nasty little pores. It\u2019ll harden up and we\u2019ll peel it off. In the meantime...\u201d She put a cucumber slice over each of his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting with his curler covered head on the pillow wasn\u2019t uncomfortable, but he focused on the tightening of the mask she had applied. He crossed his hands on his stomach and just tried to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie rapped his foot. \u201cCould you spread your legs a little, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Andrew did just that. He was left to his thoughts for a few minutes, as Barbie was bustling around doing something.   He felt her spreading something warm on his shin, then pressing something into what had been applied. With a sudden \u201crip\u201d Andrew had a large swath of hair removed from his leg. He bolted upright, slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, honey,\u201d Barbie said, rubbing she\u2019d taken the hair off, which helped. \u201cBut if you did this on a regular basis, it eouldn\u2019t be so bad.  Try to sit still.  Breathe for me. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew wanted out if this place.  He endured her waxing his entire legs. She had him flip over onto his stomach as she did the back of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had him take an arm at a time out of his robe as she waxed his arms and armpits. After each wa s finished, Barbie rubbed some floral scented lotion into his skin, and that helped a lot with the pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie glanced at her phone. \u201cShoot. We don\u2019t have time to give you a bikini wax.  I\u2019ll get you a voucher for that for your next visit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew was positive there wasn\u2019t going to be a next visit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led him back to the area with the dressing room and Andrew started to walk towards it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just yet, Missy!\u201d Barbie said with a laugh. There are a few things left.  And the mask isn\u2019t quite ready to come off yet.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Still in his short robe, he sat down and crossed his legs. Barbie put another pink cape around his neck as he squirmed a little.  She turned the chair away from the mirror so Andrew could no longer see himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold still and do as I tell you,\u201d. Barbie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with some concealer, dabbing it on all over his \u201cproblem areas\u201d and then blending it in. She brushed some loose powder over his face, then started covering his face with foundation. Next, she \u201ccontoured\u201d his face. Barbie seed intent on describing and teaching Andrew about how she was doing his makeup. He didn\u2019t care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook up, Andrea,\u201d and she began lining his eyes. He tried not to blink as Barbie smeared the liner to give him a smoky eye look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeshadow was next, with lots of blending. Andrew wasn\u2019t sure how many colors she used. Barbie kept taking a few steps back, looking thoughtfully at him, and then turning his face side to side before brushing more eyeshadow on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then glued false lashes on him. That was annoying to Andrew. What was worse was her applying several coats of mascara and then coming at him with a lash curler. It seemed like he had eyelashes that went on for miles, always in his vision. He found it unsettling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlush was next, as Barbie made him suck in his cheeks. She blended it for what seemed like ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lined his lips, then stained them. \u201cIt\u2019s kissproof, so don\u2019t worry about your date,\u201d she said with a grin. She smeared some lipgloss on next, and he felt it tingle. He raised a manicured hand to his mouth, burn barbie swatted it away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLip plumping gloss,\u201d she explained. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the tingles will go away shortly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie stepped behind him and was rummaging in the drawers of the station he sat at. Andrew craned his neck to see what she was up to.  \u201cNo peeking!\u201d Barbie scolded, grabbing his face and making him look away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few final touches,\u201d Barbie said from behind. Andrew coughed a little as he was sprayed with some musky perfume. \u201cTo drive the guys crazy,\u201d she explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold still,\u201d Barbie said. Andrew felt her wipe something cold on his earlobe and before he knew it, there was a \u201cpop\u201d and a pinch on his earlobe. This was followed in rapid succession by two more. He cringed. She was piercing his ears. Several times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved to his other ear and repeated the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then came around the chair, and leaned in close, again giving Andrew a nice view of her chest. \u201cNow, time for the unveiling...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie sounds the chair around and Andrew, if he had been able to talk, would have been speechless. His reflection was that of a sexy redhead, her hair flowing gently around her shoulders. Her open mouth showed surprise.  She raised a hand to touch her cheek, mirroring what Andrew did. Surely that woman wasn\u2019t him?  He stood and peered closer into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Andrea,\u201d Barbie said with a grin. \u201cJust think how your date is going to react if you\u2019re that in love with your new look.

He started to panic, searching the entire room, and finding nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other options, Andrew looked into the shopping bag. On top was a soft pink patent leather purse, with a note clipped to it. Andrew took the note into his manicured hands and unfolded it. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><i>\"Hey Andrea,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanted to make sure that you didn't get cold feet and put on your new outfit. You can pick up your old stuff after your date. Don't worry about your phone, wallet or keys, we moved them all to the purse, plus we added some samples that we think you might like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Leslie\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Great, just great.\" Andrew thought, opening the purse to confirm that his stuff was in it, and finding various cosmetics strewn around the bag, along with the voucher for the bikini wax. \"I hope they didn't look through my wallet...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing further into the shopping bag, Andrew pulled out a dress, nearly identical to the one that he had been holding onto in the store earlier, but instead colored pink, no doubt to match his nails. Unsurprisingly, there was also a shoebox, which contained a pair of peep-toe platform slingback heels, the same shade of pink as the dress. Underneath that was also a lingerie set, similar to the padded bra that Andrew was currently wearing, but also in pink. Evidently, all these maniacs think that's his color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie suddenly poked her head into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up! We need the room for other customers!\" Barbie shouted before closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew had little choice and hung the robe onto the hook and kicked off the flip-flops. There was no way he was getting out of here without putting the outfit on. What's another set of bra and panties after the makeover, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some doing, but Andrew was soon standing in front of the mirror, teetering in the unfamiliar heels as he made a sickened face. How could this have happened? He slung the purse over his shoulder and sighed. There was another knock on the door and Barbie poked her head into the room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrea, are you...\" Barbie trailed off as she took in the sight. \"O! M! G!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie quickly grabbed Andrew's arm and dragged him out into the main area of the salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look gorgeous!\" Donna exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! I need to get a picture of this for our website!\" Barbie shouted, quickly snapping a few shots with her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna knock your boyfriend dead, girl!\" Leslie encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew nervously smiled and started to walk towards the exit when...</span></div></div>",

While he was gone, Andrew coughed several times, trying to get his voice to return, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew suddenly remembered his phone and quickly opened the purse, pulling his phone out.

What the hell? Were they undressing him or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled more against the clothes, but it seemed like they were knotted. They began pulling him every which way to get the clothes off of him without letting him go. Eventually, it got to his underwear and they started pulling that down too, making him completely naked. He blushed heavily at the idea of being nude in public, actually hoping that no one could see him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course this also made him wonder just what these freaks of nature were even planning with him now that he was naked and helpless. Well, he seemed to get sort of an answer afterwards, as he saw two more sleeves holding up some feminine undergarments. A bra and panties to be specific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What?! You got to be kidding!\"</i> he thought. <i>\"Why those of all things?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unable to actually say anything, the clothes continued to slip themselves on him. They fixed the bra over his chest and shoulders, it hanging on him with nothing to fill them. The panties were then slipped on him, feeling really tight against his manhood, and pretty loose everywhere else.</span></div></div>",

The fabric continued down until he was squeezed into a sleeveless dark blue floral print dress that went down to about his mid-thigh. He continued to struggle, but the scarf stayed put and his arms and legs were at the mercy of the sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as quick, he was turned upright and his feet were placed into a pair of tan heeled espadrille wedge sandals, before the sleeves released his ankles and allowed him to stand under his own power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhhm!\" Justin tried to shout, looking around and not seeing a single other person in the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleeves on his arms loosened slightly, and Justin took the opportunity and broke out, tumbling to the floor as he was not used to walking in heels. Justin quickly stood up, tore the scarf from his mouth and started running, as fast as his heeled feet could carry him, towards the entrance, but when he arrived at the entrance, he found that the gate had been lowered and there was no way to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!\" he shouted, banging on the gate, but no one could hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around, seeing various clothing items following him, including a corset, so he started to run in another direction. After running for a period longer than he felt was necessary, given the fact that the store didn't seem nearly as big from the outside, he came upon a door marked with an \"Exit\" sign above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god.\" Justin sighed as he rushed through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped dead in his tracks when he realized that the exit did not provide his salvation, but...</span></div></div>",

Just what kind of trippy nonsense was going on here? Not to mention, the place was just as eerily quiet as the store was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is with this place?\" Justin said. \"It's like some weird dream...or a nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, making sure the door was closed so those demon-possessed clothes couldn't follow him anymore, he began walking forward, which allowed him to fully take in what he was wearing. Ugh, talk about a really feminine outfit. He'd think it'd look really nice on any actual girl. On him, it just looked creepy. The feeling of nothing but underwear underneath the dress also felt so weird, like being naked. Not to mention how ill-fitting everything was. The dress clearly wasn't made for quite someone of his build, nor were the heeled sandals. Honestly, it'd perhaps be best to take the shoes off at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached down to try and do so, and yet it was like the shoes were glued on to his feet, not budging at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as he talked, there was a sound, making him pause and wonder if someone was around. He called out, to no answer at all. However, right at that moment, he felt something trip him, making him cry out as he fell backwards. Conveniently, it was right into a chair, a pretty comfortable one in all honesty. Still, where did it come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?!\" Justin said, trying to get out of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right then, clasps appeared around his wrists, waist, and ankles, preventing him from getting out. These were considerably harder than the clothing binds before, as evidenced by how they didn't budge. Still, he groaned as he tried to get out, as the chair began to move forward, going to who knows where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he struggled for a minute, the chair arrived at was pretty much a normal salon room. Of course, there was nothing normal about stuff beginning to fly around just like the clothes did before. Justin was pretty convinced he was in some kind of drunken state or something, despite not being much of a drinker. I mean, what else could explain this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair brought him up to a spot, making him lean back into a sink. Now, he knew what most stuff was for, as his mom had taken him to a salon for high school pictures a while ago. There was where his hair got cleaned up, though he could only wonder what this was for. He was suddenly jerked back, his hair reaching water as various supplies like combs and whatnot were flying around it, messing every which way with his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and to add insult to injury, he could feel something along his hands, something that felt like a filer. Was something cleaning up his nails? He couldn't see for sure given his vision was facing upwards thanks to his head being forced into the sink. He wasn't sure how much time passed as his head remained in the sink for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after what seemed like a while, he was finally allowed to move his head back up, only to see....</span></div></div>",

He tried to reach for it, but struggled against the clasps. Justin looked down at his hands and got another surprise, his fingernails had been lengthened, shaped, and polished, now sporting a french-tip design that Justin reluctantly acknowledged, probably complimented the outfit he was now trapped in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on...\" Justin struggled to pull his wrists free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his legs were pulled upwards by a pair of shower hoses and an aerosol bottle sprayed its contents, a white cream, onto his legs. In doing so, Justin was given a look at his feet. A quick glance at his feet saw that his toes matched his fingernails in their grooming. The can then moved to his arms, and the lower part of his face, lathering those as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck! What is this stuff?\" Justin sniffed and made a disgusted face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cream began to tingle, then burn, before wet towels came from the sink and rubbed Justin's legs down, taking all the hair on them with, then going to his arms, and then his face. Just as quickly as this had all happened, he was now practically hairless from the neck-down. His legs were released and he was left alone for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let! Me! Go!\" Justin struggled against his bonds again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of his wrists suddenly released, and he quickly went to work freeing his other wrist, easier said than done with his newly lengthened nails, but he managed to do it. He pushed himself out of the chair and ran to the next exit on the other side of the room. No way he was going back into the department store, but he couldn't stay here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed through the new door to find...</span></div></div>",

It was like something out of a supernatural movie. How in the world was his hair suddenly so long? And they grew his nails out? It all looked so....girly, as if that was what they were trying to change him in to. Well, whatever the case, he was unwilling to go along with it. Hopefully he could make his way out of here. That way, he could at least get a haircut and cut his nails. Hopefully the hair would come back on its own in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just ignore everything. Find another exit,\" he said to himself, looking for wherever the exit to this had to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just like before, a chair came right up behind him, startling him a little as it pushed him up to a mirror, the content around full of various kits. Again, they tried to bind him, and pretty much succeeded. Justin struggled against them again, although his nails were making it a lot harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his head was forced into a straight position, likely something done by the chair, to keep his face from moving around. Groaning, various cosmetics began to fly, all circling around him like predators around their prey. Some lip gloss came first, and as much as he tried to keep his mouth away from it, the possessed chair somehow forced his lips out, allowing the lip gloss to cover them in a bright shine. Justin could even smell a hint of cherry coming from them...and did his lips feel bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, more cosmetics came out. Some powder got applied to his cheeks, while light mascara was applied to his eyes as well as eyeliner. All the pretty usual works for a girl and whatnot. All the more, Justin continued to struggle against the bonds, slowly getting out. What made this all worse was the mirror in front of him, so he could see what was happening in real time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more make-up was applied, the more it was hard to tell there was a guy underneath it all. Each cosmetic only further made him appear more womanly, not too heavy on the makeup, but just enough to be beautiful. Heck, he would love it if it were on anyone but himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the heck was all this about? Preparing him for a date or something? He'd prefer to be the guy in such a situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let....go....NOW!\" he yelled, very frustrated by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he finally got out, even with other stuff still flying around. God, everything was just making it harder. The dress, heels, the long hair, just everything was making it more difficult. Still, at least he found another exit, though he could only wonder where he'd end up now.</span></div></div>",

Before he could react, a hand reached out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need any help, Miss?\" the owner of the hand asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin grabbed the hand and was pulled up onto his feet. He looked around, seeing that he had been deposited back into the mall, in fact, deposited right where the entrance of the department store was. The helpful hand belonged to a man, slightly taller than Justin with broad shoulders and a friendly grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to help me. This store, the clothes were flying and they put me in this dress and...\" Justin trailed off as the panic rose in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down there,  what's going on?\" the man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This store. It's cursed or something!\" Justin exclaimed in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What store?\" the man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one!\" Justin turned to the door he exited from, only to be confronted with a blank wall. \"No, it was here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin ran down the entire section, seeing nothing that indicated that a store had ever been present. Just a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was... it was there...\" Justin sighed, on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, it's okay uh...\" the man started. \"I didn't catch your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Justin-ah!\" Justin exclaimed as a woman pushing a stroller abruptly pushed past him, knocking him into the man's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justina, eh? I'm Axel.\" the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh...\" Justin stammered. \"I really need to sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go get a coffee?

Axel really seemed to think he was a woman, though he wondered just how he could think that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the hair, make-up, and clothes, Justin couldn't believe he looked all that feminine. Heck, he still had a man's build, and no breasts or curves or anything. Not that he wanted any of that of course, as he just wanted to get things back to normal. Still, Axel really didn't seem to be finding anything weird. Either that or he was playing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sure,\" Justin said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" Axel smiled. \"The shop is just around the corner here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Axel began to walk Justin over to the coffee shop. All in all, it actually didn't feel all that bad. Still incredibly awkward though. Justin could only wonder how ridiculous he appeared right now. Surely there had to be people who saw how weird this all looked. And yet, no passeby even gave him a second glance. He wasn't sure if that was a good thing or just spooky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, Axel got the two of them a little table, taking in what Justin preferred for a coffee. The two got their drinks not too long afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is actually my first time to this shop,\" smiled Axel. \"I heard good things about this shop though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....\" Justin hummed a bit before taking a sip. Wow, it actually was really good. \"Yeah, it is good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Axel nodded, before beginning to sip his drink as well. He seemed to like it just as much. \"So, how are you on this fine day, Justina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he really going to have get used to hearing that?

He could only hope he could find a better way out now. On that note, he took into account what else was different. As he walked, he looked into the purse again. Indeed, he saw many of the same things he had brought with him: keys, cards, and extra money.

I want to be put back the way I was when I walked in here!\" Justin exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood there for a few moments, expecting more clothes to grab him, but nothing happened, the only activity was was soft muzak playing over the loudspeakers, and the buzzing of fluorescent lights. Suddenly, a door near the registers opened up, and Justin hesitantly walked towards it, poking his head in. Inside was... a fitting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least this is new...\" Justin muttered as he walked into the fitting room. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin noticed a swinging door at the end of the corridor and walked towards it. He peeked into the fitting stall near it, and saw a pile of items lying there.

He struggled to pull at the new additions, but like everything else, they were stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just... ugh.\" Justin headed out of the fitting room and back towards the exit, he was getting nowhere with the store.

Definitely not the kind of place he'd be anywhere near. Heck, even if he had a girlfriend, it'd be hard to get that kind of stuff. The place was just as eerily quiet, not that he cared much about that right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...find another exit,\" he sighed. It was all he could do. Just keep going until one finally got him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps predictably by this point, items were beginning to fly up. The floor around Justin seemed to spin, until he was wobbling towards a mirror. Steadying himself in the wedge sandals, he watched as a couple items were beginning to come on to him. First was a simple pair of small earrings, which gave him a little yelp of discomfort as they inserted themselves in his earlobes. The second was considerably less hassle, being a simple little necklace that rested in the skin shown by the neckline of the blue floral dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth didn't seem like the most expensive things, but they looked nice all the same. Not that Justin enjoyed them being on him in any case. Getting the sense that more stuff might be flying towards him, he ran around the mirror, seeing another exit just down the hall a little. He ran as fast as he could, getting through the door and closing without even looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's demon-possessed here or something...\" he groaned.</span></div></div>",

I resist, the clothes attack me, I run, I end up falling deeper. But if I accept it, go along with what it wants... then I'm left alone. I went to the coffeeshop with Axel and nothing happened to me.

He had to play along, not get pulled under by all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride was rather uneventful, the most personal the conversation got was Justin giving Axel his address.

However, there was a distinctly different vibe across the place. For one thing, the colors of his apartment seemed a little brighter. Not exactly overly feminine per sey but certainly not what they were when he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, he went over to the refrigerator, and spotted a completely different set of food in there, too much for him to really keep track of. Taking a deep breath and trying to calm down, he began looking over the rest of the apartment. There were pictures around, which wasn't unusual in itself. Justin actually kept quite a few pictures around of his favorite things. There were some that he really liked, particularly when he dabbled a little in sports as a little kid and in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture he had of himself playing football when he was 8 now showed what looked like a blonde girl playing soccer. Looking at some others, they continued to show the same thing, but what really stood out later on was some school pictures which began showing a cheerleader. A really cute one honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.....that can't be me...\" Justin said. He had to be hallucinating this from all the trouble today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to know what the other pictures could be showing so he ignored them, making a beeline for his room. It was a pretty typical apartment room, not too big but not too tiny either. It was enough for him at the least. Going inside the room, he noticed similar colors to the rest of the apartment, but also a full-length mirror next to a simple vanity set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be kidding,\" he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately being concerned about his clothes, he ran over to his dresser. Looking into the underwear section, they were now filled with panties, all of various colors and styles. Actually...was there some langerie in there? Ugh, never mind! There were even bras there, also of many colors and styles. He searched through his shorts and jeans section, which at least yielded some decent clothes like some feminine shorts and jeans. However, there were also plenty of skirts, even a jean skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the big kicker though was his closet. Where many of his shirts and such were before were now a variety of girls clothes. Some shirts there too, but also blouses, tank tops, and even dresses. Heck, the spot where he kept his shoes now had stuff like heels and flip flops along with a regular pair of shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Justin groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was really going too far, and even playing along was getting him nowhere. He pulled at the dress he had, realizing that it now seemed like he could pull it off finally. He wasted no time in doing so, wanting all these girly clothes off him immediately. He kicked the wedge sandals off, and took the bra and panties off as fast as possible, though the bra took a little while with how he needed to reach back. Still, after some hustle, he got it off, leaving himself bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He also grabbed a t-shirt and pulled it over his head, being forced to pull his long hair out from the neck hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, man.

The call seemed to be from a \"Karen\" and it wouldn't stop ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Justin asked a little hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Justina,\" a chirpy voice sounded. \"How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, it's okay,\" Justin said, not particularly enjoying hearing that name again. \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, pretty normal I suppose,\" Karen said. \"Was a little bored so I figured I'd call.

Before he could do much else though, the dressers were opening, revealing a couple of items moving towards him. They seemed like lingerie, a really silky looking bra with some revealing panties.

Just as it was before her, the same articles flew in front of him as well. His heart sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see? That is much better!\u201d She said referencing the floating women\u2019s clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then lifted her arms up, and to his dismay his arms lifted up as well- as though he were her reflection instead of the other way around. The comfortable, familiar and masculine clothing he was wearing softly slipped themselves off- it felt like a sad goodbye as they were removed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, of course, the bra and panties were placed with a stinging familiarity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female reflection was messing around with the bra and poking at its empty space, and his body was following suit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of these days I\u2019m going to have to get an enhancement\u201d she said as she slipped some pads in the cups, and while there was nothing in his hands- when you followed suit the pads appeared in his cups as well. These seemed bigger than what you remembered from the dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiarity of it all counteracted the shock enough for him to be able to utter, \u201chow? Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sides of the mirror shrugged, \u201cI guess the store decided that you needed my help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to shake his head \u201cNo\u201d in refusal of this notion of help, but instead he reflection shook her head \u201cYes\u201d- to which he followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit,\u201d she said jokingly, \u201cdon\u2019t worry though. I\u2019m in this for the long haul. I\u2019m sticking around until I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got it, and won\u2019t fall back into your old habits, Justin\u201d</span></div></div>",

There\u2019s some role that you take when coming over here. I only partially understand how it\u2019s determined, but I only know details and not the precise reason. Suffice it to say, there\u2019s a role to fill for people that come over here, and this world is dead set on that role being filled- no exceptions, no escape. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a person that already exists in this universe and you\u2019re taking their place or if it\u2019s dependent on the person that comes over\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know this stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s what happened to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you trying to go back yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! In my original life I was just a stock clerk. A recently unemployed stock clerk, I came to this mall to look for a video game to ease my troubles from losing my job and the video game store transformed into a high-end car dealership, my identity in this mall was a man of power, a man of wealth. Ive been living the good life over here. Women never used to give me the time of day, now I can get any woman I want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sounds like you got a better deal than I got,\u201d you said, trying to pull your skirt down just a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did.

After what happened with me, I\u2019ve investigated things and how they work. From what I\u2019ve gathered, the role you\u2019re filling- is supposed to be my wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t get me wrong, that\u2019s not a role I want you filling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s insane!\u201d You declared, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t have to get married if you didn\u2019t want to.

You were being carried, it looked like but you couldn\u2019t see anyone around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around to see where you were, when you looked down you saw that you were being carried towards the mall- and that\u2019s when it all clicked. Your arms were tied by stockings, a dress was wrapped around your waist and those shiny things on your feet were heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Wait! Stop! Let me go! I don\u2019t want this!\u201d You tried to plead with the sentient clothes that remained unphased. You switched it up to wrestling and wiggling out of of your hold the clothes had on you, but they had a good hold on you. You tried a combination of the two, which of course was unsuccessful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the malls closed now, they shouldn\u2019t be able to go in.\u201d You hoped, while looking around and seeing the vacant parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were carried towards a door that opened on its own. \u201cThat door wasn\u2019t even an automatic one,\u201d you worried to yourself. Everything seemed to be working in tandem to ensure that you fulfilled the role of Justina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were in the mall being carried to that glowing department store you screamed at the top of your lungs while wrestling with all of your might, \u201cSTOP IT! STOP IT RIGHT NOW! I DONT WANT TO BE JUSTINA! LET ME GO YOU STUPID CLOTHES! LET ME GO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rides and the arcade machines became activated as you were pulled past them. Karaoke booths each activated as you were dragged past. The first one played \u201cMan, I Feel Like a Woman\u201d, the second one \u201cMore Than A Woman\u201d, and the last one \u201cPretty Woman\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the clothes brought you to the front of the glowing department store, the gate guarding the store started to rise- like a kingdom expecting its knights return from a conquest. When the gate was fully up, the clothes carried you the rest of the way into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the gate closed.</span></div></div>",

No no no\u201d you respond defensively- what you thought earlier was hurt feelings and insults was just the choreography for this reflection. \u201cNoooo no. You see how silly this looks?

I can HELP you fix this, just take me back and\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get distracted by a shiny object floating towards you- as it gets closer you can make out that it\u2019s a chain. It floats towards you and wraps around your neck before clicking into place.

Not that loving you would be a joke to me. Oh...yikes...call me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Axels voicemail, though you listened to it again to hear the stuff going on in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight off the bat, Axels calling you \u201cJustina\u201d seems liked it was edited and spliced together, you heard a slight click. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, in the background, you heard a faint whisper. You played it back multiple times until you finally heard it \u201cJustin  Ah. Bring back Justin Ah. Purposely spacing out your name. As though it was recognizing you as both Justin and Justina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat message must\u2019ve been sent through the dimensions, but that wasn\u2019t for you to hear- it was for the clothes you were wearing.

I\u2019m down with that!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh! And before I forget, I need a date for my best friend.

What were you listening to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s plan to meet on Saturday at Frosties, that ice cream place at the mall across from that new department store that just opened up.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good.

I\u2019m on my way to the mall now\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cActually, there\u2019s been a change of plans. I\u2019m actually over by Bakersfield 20 minutes away from the mall- my car is busted and I\u2019m hanging out over here if you want to come?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure, where should Justin and I meet you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cActually, my friend couldn\u2019t make it, so it would just be the two of us?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t just cancel on Justin, that\u2019s rude.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on!

This alternate dimension specifically wanted you to be Justina to the point of orchestrating you, not only to be stranded at the mall, but to be in the vicinity of that damn department store. It did everything it could to get you here, to keep you here, and once out, to bring you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dead set on making you Justina the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why?</span></div></div>",

A good few miles away, a thriving nightlife scene brimmed with life as cars and customers kept the pulse of the city alive all night long. But in this small corner of apartment blocks, things were quieter. Quiet, that is, except for a small glittering ball of light that tinkled and hummed as it careened through the sky like a leaf in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike a leaf, this ball of light had a clear destination in mind. If only she knew where it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dearie me.\" Within the light was a small pudgy woman with steely grey hair and golden gossamer wings who muttered to herself as she flew. \"My first day back on the job and I'm already late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at a scroll held tight in one hand as she fought the wind. \"I've got to get this right, I've got to! I'm already on probation after the last incident. One more mistake and they'll revoke my fairy godmother license!\" She darted into the air vents of a nondescript apartment building, banging and bumping into the walls as the air patterns suddenly changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exited the vent in a hallway, horn-rimmed glasses askew and slightly bruised, but otherwise no worse for wear. \"There we go. Any landing you can walk away from, as they say.\" She adjusted her glasses as she unrolled her scroll. \"Now, my new charge is one Cindy Lawson, age twenty-two.\" She squinted at the excessively curly handwriting of her case manager. She'd been meaning to go see her fairy optometrist about getting a stronger prescription, but for the moment she had to make do. \"Let's see... emotionally abusive childhood, dangerously low self-esteem, body and confidence issues... how terrible, the poor dear. At least there's a bright spot; her sorrow is my salvation. This should be an easy case to get back in my superior's good graces. And all I have to do is go and help that unfortunate darling in apartment 36C.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she flittered away, using her magic to phase through the door of apartment 36C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, between her bad eyesight, her manager's ornately cursive writing, and a smudge caused by her bump in the vents, the earnest fairy godmother had made a terrible mistake. Cindy Lawson lived in apartment 36D, not 36C. The room just below Cindy's (which she had just entered) was actually occupied by a young man who had no idea what chaos was about to enter his life. </span></div></div>",

Neither feminine nor masculine, it was as if no one actually lived there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut clearly someone did. There was food in the cabinets and dishes in the sink. The fairy godmother flitted about until she found the door that led to the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom, at least, looked lived in, but in a state that made the fairy shake her head. Clothing was strewn about, mostly simple shirts and jeans, nothing to flatter a girl's figure. The attached bathroom had the bare minimum of toiletries, but even that was all generic store brands. It wasn't until she heard a snore that she noticed her new charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the poor dear...\" she couldn't help but sigh. Though young Miss Cindy was oddly blurry and half covered by a wadded and tangled blanket, the fairy could see more than enough to know that the girl needed serious help. She was a stick, with almost no figure to speak of. Her breasts were hidden since she laid on her stomach, but they couldn't have been more than A-cups. Her hair was on the shorter side of long, but poorly kept, as though all she cared about was having it out of her eyes. Her limbs were long and gangly, and she didn't even want to think about the state of the girl's nails. No wonder she had such troubles. The vicious cycle between low self-esteem and a bad body image was clearly evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not for much longer, not with a fairy godmother at hand. She whipped out her wand, ready to cast a spell that would grant all this poor girl's wishes and fix all her problems... when she stopped. Maybe it would be better to not be so hasty. She didn't want to frighten the dear, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, she could change the girl's body. Slowly or quickly, to give her a chance to grow into it or the joy of a miraculous change. Maybe add a few enchantments about the apartment to help her adjust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, fixing a problem this advanced with a big job; one that would require a lot of magic. In that case, why not go all the way? Why not change the whole world to help Cindy become what she most desired to be? Or maybe send her to another world entirely, where powers not found on this one could help her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered this as she hovered over the sleeping \"girl\" for some minutes until she came to a decision.</span></div></div>",

Their beloved king, King Elias XVI had just passed away, leaving his kingdom to be ruled over by Elias' son, Elias XVII, or as he preferred to be called, Eli. Eli was not only beloved by his parents, but he was also beloved by his adoring public, princesses throwing themselves at him, always the center of attention at any diplomatic function he attended, but most of all, he was compassionate and all set to be the best ruler that Eowin had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Prince Eli was not the only son of Elias, however, Elias also had another son, Kane, who was a year younger than his brother, and prone to scheming. It's not that he was less loved, but he had known that he'd never be the perfect son who would take over the throne, despite how much he wanted it. Their father's illness was sudden, but Kane wasn't about to watch himself lose any chance of ever gaining the throne. Kane was independently wealthy thanks to a mix of gambling and smart investments, which was why it was relatively easy to bribe the servants of the castle into following his commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKane sat in his office and tapped a button on his desk, which turned off a nearby television, broadcasting the ceaseless coverage of the death of King Elias. A knock came on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come!\" Kane stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and a young bearded man, Kane's assistant, Marco, walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you going to do it?\" Marco asked. \"I mean, he's not just going to abdicate the throne. And you're not a killer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Killing is unnecessary. And he will abdicate. Once I give him reason to do so.\" Kane replied. \"The official coronation is in six months, he'll have power for those six months, but all I have to do is turn the public against him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how can you do that? He's the golden son!\" Marco replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we just have to make sure he's no longer a son of any kind.\" Kane stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun streamed into Eli's room through the curtains, as one of the servants entered the room, carrying a tray with a mug of coffee on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness, it is time to wake up.\" the servant stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli rolled over and put his head under the pillow. The servant continued to stand at attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, you have your appointment with the royal physician today. This can't be kept waiting.\" the servant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli groaned and sat up in his bed, his messy blonde hair covering his face. He brushed it back and reached for the mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. That will be all.\" Eli said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant nodded and walked out of the room. Eli stretched and got out of bed, quickly getting dressed and heading out the door.</span></div></div>",

Eli strolled into the exam room, where the doctor, Dr. Bratford, stood looking at a chart. He looked up when Eli walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, your majesty. Nice to see you.\" Dr. Bratford said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you, doc. Why is this so important?\" Eli asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since your father died suddenly, we have to ensure you have a clean bill of health before you can start as king.\" Dr. Bratford replied. \"Wouldn't want for you to start as King and then suddenly drop dead of something preventable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense.\" Eli said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hop up onto the exam table and let's get this over with.\" Dr. Bratford said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli complied and the doctor began to run the usual gauntlet of items.

I'm up to date with all vaccines.\" Eli said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a new one.
