            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lara King awoke with a start, before choking and spluttering as she coughed up some seawater. The 23 year-old lifeguard looked around her new surroundings in astonishment. She was in a small cave, with a pool of twinkling water the only exit. There was a natural blue light illuminating the cave, and, as Lara slowly tried to get to her feet, she realised there was no way the light could be getting in. Her legs felt weak, and she sat back down, struggling to remember how she got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course. She'd gone out to help save the passengers on a small yacht that had run aground. With the ship on fire, she'd been dropped onto the deck from the coastguard helicopter, and had helped the passengers into the escape unit and to safety. And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yacht had exploded. Lara remembered losing her balance and hitting her head on something, and then a second explosion which blown her into the water...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of which explained how on Earth she had ended up here. Wherever here was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless I'm...dead...\" she thought out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hand to her head, to where she expecting to find blood, or a bruise, or anything from where she'd hit it. There was nothing. No marks, no pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...too weird...\" Her swimsuit had a few tears and burn marks, but she knew it could have been much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared into the water, marvelling out how clear it was. She could see almost to where she assumed there was a bottom, and another tunnel leading off from that. As she gazed into it, a creature swam out from the tunnel, and up towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Mermaid...?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara moved back from the edge of the pool as the figure broke the surface, facing away from her. She shook her long dark hair, and began to place some shiny rocks and crystals on the bank. Lara's heart skipped a beat as the girl began to sing. The song wasn't in a language Lara could understand, but it was the most beautiful thing she'd ever heard. The girl fussed over the rocks as if organising them, and then Lara moved slightly, dislodging a stone which plopped into the water. The girl turned to Lara, and beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're awake! Oh, wonderful! Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl swam over to Lara, who was amazed at the beauty of this creature. From her face, she guessed she was barely 20, with a natural look of wide-eyed innocence, and rather large breasts. She rested her hands on the bank and looked up at Lara, still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, you must be so scared. I promise, there's nothing to be scared of. My name is Carin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I must be dreaming...you're a...mermaid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarin giggled. \"Yes. And you're not dreaming. Take my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lara didn't, Carin smiled even wider. \"Or at least tell me your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...oh. Sorry...I'm Lara...\" She slowly took Carin's hand in hers, and felt the girl's warm wet hand. She was real. She wasn't dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lara...that's beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My home.\" explained Carin. \"Well, not my birth home, but this is where I come when I want to be alone. I can spend days here...there are some very pretty rocks around here, I collect them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I...how did I get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I like to watch you. Not just you, all the humans that play in the water. I know it's a bit dangerous really, but I keep my distance. I've actually been longing to meet one of you - in fact, I hoped it would be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like a human, yet you swim like a fish. Movement in the water seems to come as naturally to you as it does to me. And you help people. You are strong and beautiful. I like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara blushed. \"Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright. Anyway, I was watching you help those people when their ship hit the rocks. You didn't escape, you were thrown into the water. You come to help anyone, but no-one came to help you. At least, not in time. I couldn't let you die. I brought you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...you've saved me. Oh, thank you, so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarin giggled. \"That's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women looked at each other in silence for a while, then Carin asked \"How do you feel now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, much better...I'm sorry, this is just so weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" said Carin. \"But, it's good weird, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara smiled. \"It is. I didn't think mermaids were real...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it's lucky for you we are, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...Carin...I don't want to seem rude, but...what happens now?\"</span></div></div>",

The mermaid pointed at the tunnel and Lara could tell she was serious. Carin jumps in. \"This cave is underground so once we get out of here, you'll be able to find your way back home easy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's why nobody has found this place. I can't thank you enough Carin. So I just hold onto you?\" Lara jumps in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, hold on tight and hold your breath for a long as possible okay?\" Lara followed instruction and locked her arms around Carin under her breasts. Her slippery body though made it a bit of a challenge. Once Lara was settled, she breathed in and signalled for Carin to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a second, the mermaid dived under and a single kick from her powerful tail was all she needed to fight the current. She was so fast and Carin moved around with such grace, she was narrowly avoiding rocks. You cannot believe she exists but if it wasn't for her, you would be dead. Eventually, you both make it out from the cave and to your surprise, you notice Carin had taken you quite far down from the waters edge. The mermaid turned upwards and proceeded towards the surface. You broke through and sunlight almost blinded you. You gasp for air and turn towards your new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are...unbelievable Carin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you are too kind\" She blushes. \"But now you are feeling better and you are out, I must leave. Humans come by here all the time\" She points at the beach in the distance. It was the beach Lara works at and there are a lot of people relaxing and playing around. Luckily it's too far to see Carin's tail, especially from underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see you again?\" Lara asked \"We will meet when it's dark and you can come to my place. Just me and you, I promise\"</span></div></div>",

Make sure you're alone okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara nodded and gave Carin one last thank you and they hugged each other farewell. Then the mermaid quickly dived back into the ocean, within seconds Carin was out of sight. Lara looked over at the public beach and swam towards the shore. It wasn't long before she recognised one of her male coworkers and she was immediately taken to a hospital to be checked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, the test results came out negative and with some clothes bought for her from her coworker, she was changed and was ready to come home. Nobody, not even Lara could believe Lara was back with no cuts or bruises but Lara made sure she would not hint the existence of mermaids. She lied and said she woke up on a beach close to where the boat exploded and she swam back home which was a more believable story. Carin is her new important friend that she needed to keep secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lara's friend left her home alone, Lara wanted nothing more than to rest for the evening and go to sleep but there was something strange that had been bothering her since the ride home. She could swear there were a multitude of spikes catching themselves on the thigh portion on her jeans and she was desperate to investigate. Lara stood by the bedroom mirror and immediately rolled the jeans down. What she saw there was not hair or a sticky substance that she expected. Instead, the majority of the skin on her left thigh had transformed somehow and looked a lot like scales. Lara gasped and slowly bought her hand across the blue mass. It was the scariest thing she had seen because it was similar too... \"C...Carin!\" She cried after recognising the scale pattern. She lay on the bed and painfully pulled a scale off, there she examined the fish scale. Whatever was happening to her was not normal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This can't be happening?\" Lara said to herself as she ran her hand across the patch of scales over and over again trying to remove them with mental abilities she didn't have. The lifeguard had to try and remove this so she hurried to the bathroom and stripped off her jeans. After a through check, fortunately as far as she could see, there were no other blue, scaly patches. Just before Lara could grab her tweezers, she could hear a knock on the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara stood to attention and when she could hear the feint sound of keys being pushed and turned in the lock, Lara had a feeling of who would be arriving at this hour. An older but still good-looking lady entered the dark hallway calling out for her daughter. Lara panicked and fumbled around the bathroom to put her jeans back on which was proving to be difficult as the scales were catching on the material. Sandra, Lara's mother was walking up the stairs, turning on all the lights as she travelled. \"Ahh Mom, I'm here. I'll be out in a second!\" With that, Sandra goes into Lara's room waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara puts off her mermaid issue for now. When she managed to put herself back in the jeans, she went out the room and came back to greet her mother. Sandra was in tears, the thought of losing her little girl was too much for her \"I'm just so glad you're alright sweetheart\" Sandra rushed over to Lara and hugged her tight. Her giant breasts almost crushing her daughter. \"Where were you? And how did you get home?\" Sandra was obviously oblivious of the whole story, and had probably only just been told Lara was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Lara retold her story to her mother similarly to what she told her coworker. Sandra paid attention throughout, shocked at what her daughter had gone through. Lara was about to finish when she felt a strange tingling sensation around her waist.</span></div></div>",

It didn't hurt at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they were surrounded by beautiful designs - if they hadn't been in the water, Lara would have thought these were fireworks. The sparkles wizzed by, creating lovely colours and shapes in the water. As Lara marvelled, she heard the sound of rejoicing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our Queen! Our great Queen of the Fireball! She is here at last!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of the cave dissolved, to reveal hundreds of merpeople of all ages, from babies to the elderly, cheering and shouting, holding banners with Lara's picture on them. Lara - wearing a crown - and - as a MERMAID!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked down at herself, Lara saw that she had grown a tail, and was now, indeed a mermaid.</span></div></div>",

However she was still curious. \"How would...mating work out between us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mermaid smiled. \"Well, with merpeople, mating occurs between the same sexes.\" Her hand had reached Lara's waist now and had gripped her lower swimsuit. \"It actually occurs with the passing of what we call a love light.

But only merpeople can do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carin spoke, she began to slowly pull off Lara's bikini bottom.

Lara was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Carin said, \"what do you say now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Lara, the mermaid suddenly looked more appealing, like one of her old boyfriends had, but something in her was still fighting against mating with what she knew was another woman...</span></div></div>",

Tendons, ligaments stretched and reformed.  <br>\r\nI screamed as the transformation continued, it reformed me from what I was, human, to what I would become mermaid.  <br>\r\nA final changed ripped through my neck, I heard the sound of my very skin rip open in gill slits.

She kissed my neck, I heard her in my mind, \u201c<i>We are one, one for now, and forever</i>.\u201d  With that she ran her fingers along my fins and down my tail seductively.
