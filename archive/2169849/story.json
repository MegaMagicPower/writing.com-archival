            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The heroes of Dragonball have run off to their umpteenth Tournament set up by some God or another for the purposes of fighting for something... and pretty much every Male from the Goku's posse decided to attend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Tien, Krillin, Gohan, Trunks, hell even Master Roshi, Goten, and Android 17 decided to pick themselves up and attend.  Really the only person who WASN'T invited... was Yamcha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis happened for two reasons. Firstly; Nobody really respected Yamcha anymore. While he was strong among human standards, compared to most of the others in the crew he wasn't exactly up to par. Secondly; ... he had vanished. Goku was going to go search for his friend but then Beerus, Champa, Whis, and Vados all showed up and whisked him and all the other guys off to some extra-dimensional battleground for what would be, more or less, a massive tournament that encompassed pretty much EVERY universe. Hell, it would probably go on for a year or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where was Yamcha? Well, Yamcha was off gathering the Dragonballs... and mere moments after the group were sent off he'd retrieved the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha got all the Dragonballs set for wishing, setting them up on a deserted island... and he summoned Shenron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragon burst forth from the Dragonballs with glory and valor, prepared to grant a wish. He looked down at his summoner... and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... you.\" he hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's me Shenron! Here to make a wish\" Yamcha replied cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Which one am I bringing back this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Nobody! This wish is all for me! I want the power... to control Minds! Some kind of hypnosis technique!\" he boomed, bursting with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Really?\" Shenron asked, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah? Really. Why? Is that a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's just... I don't think you people have ever summoned me to wish for something so... fun. Usually I'm bringing dead people back to life. Or Porunga is doing the same thing. Interesting... Your wish is granted.\"  He said as his eyes shimmered momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have two more wishes. What do you seek?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Right. Two more huh? Uh... I can still do immortality, right? Let's do that and indestructibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenron looks at him for a moment, then lets out a hefty sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You intend to do something stupid with that hypnosis power, don't you..?\" He asks. Yamcha simply shrugs impishly. Shenron sighs again and his eyes flash once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. There you go. Don't come crying to me when this goes poorly... though I'm certain you will. Farewell, human\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! How do I use the Hypnosis power?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that spirit ball thing you do? Do that. You'll see the change. Oh, and it won't work on myself of Porunga. I'm not stupid. Now goodbye!\" With another flash of light, Shenron retreats back into the Dragonballs, which then blast apart, scattering across the globe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALRIGHT!\" Yamcha boomed happily, throwing his fist into the air and grinning like a nut-case. He held up his hand and made his Spirit Ball which was a bit... different. Instead of the usual Blue ball of energy, he now held what appeared to be pulsing spiraled ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dreams are coming true! Now all I have to do is wait for the guys to get dragged to another tournament and I can start getting... all those lovely BABES scattered around the Galaxy! All for Yamcha! I finally get to be the king!\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon returning to the city... he learned that despite it not ACTUALLY being a wish, his wish came true. The guys were gone. And likely gone for a while! Not only that, but Vados stayed back on Earth to eat some scrumptious Earth delicacies. A luxury Whis did not get since Beerus wasn't going to let Whis stay when his own presence was required elsewhere. But Champa didn't have toe foresight to see that coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Yamcha was more or less alone with all the lovely ladies he could ever want. But he needed somewhere to start his reign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... who is he going to Hypnotize first?</span></div></div>",

But let's be honest, it's Android 18.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha had always been jealous of Krillin for landing such an attractive woman. He wanted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso... she had beat the crap out of him more than once. He felt like he could go for a bit of Hypnotic Revenge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way to her place of residence, and knocked on the door. There was a long silence but, soon enough, 18 opened. She saw him, crossed her arms, and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... you.\" she hissed.  \"Krillin's not here. He went to some tournament and took our damn daughter with him without even asking me.  So if you're looking for him he isn't here. And when he gets back you'll wanna look for him at the nearest hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... geez 18 I uh... I didn't know that. But uh actually I'm kinda here to see you.\" he said with a weak laugh. She looked at him in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're here to see me..? Alright. I'll humor this... weirdness. I'll assume this isn't going to waste my time. Get in here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha quickly made his way into the house, and 18 slammed the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. So what do you want?\" she said, impatiently. Yamcha grinned and held up his hand. The Transformed Spirit Ball appeared in his grip. 18 looked at him in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... what the hell is that? Did you seriously come here just to show..... me......\" she began, but trailed off as black and white spirals appeared in her eyes. Her mouth hung open and a small bit of drool began to form in the corner of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy hell! It actually worked!\" he yelled in joy. He stopped his Hypnosis technique and looked at 18.  He approached her and gave her a bit of a forceful poke. She swayed a moment before returning to her original stance, still hypnotized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELL YES! Alright! Where do I go from here?!\" he said, grinning ear to ear.</span></div></div>",

When I say them you're going t find your mind changing. You won't be your normal self. Instead you're going to adopt new personalities, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" she droned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. First off if I say 'Maid to please\" you'll think that you are my maid. You're main goal is the clean, but you're more than happy to do any task I request. And you'll talk in a sexy french accent\" he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Maid to please... clean... do any task... french...\" she replies <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! And if I say 'Cheer me on' you'll be my personal cheerleader. You'll wanna do some sexy cheers for me and do whatever it takes to get me hyped up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheer me on... cheerleader... sexy cheers... pep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... also if I say 'Serve and Protect' you'll think you're my personal soldier. You'll be obedient, compliant, and will do whatever it takes to keep me safe and happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serve and Protect... soldier... safe and happy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally if I say 'Obedience is pleasure' you'll turn into my personal slave. You'll do anything I say without hesitation and you'll love obeying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obedience is pleasure... slave... love obeying...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Now I'm gonna snap you out of this trance and you'll be your normal self. Alright?\" He says. After a moment he snaps his fingers. 18's eyes return to normal and she winces for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... what the hell happened? I feel like my head just got stung by a swarm of bees... anyway. Sorry I spaced out. What were you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha smirks as he preps his first trigger for her and turns her into...</span></div></div>",

So did you need something or...?\" The blonde android replied, rolling her blue eyes in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to ask if you think I should have been on the team for the tournament of power. After all, I am pretty damn strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really why you came all the way here? You're ridiculous, you aren't even as strong as my husband.\" Android 18 scoffed. \"Now if you don't mind, I'm kind of busy, so can you just leave and let me go about my business?\" She began to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, what's wrong? You don't want to be my personal cheerleader?\" Yamcha smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?!\" 18 growled, turning around and glaring at Yamcha, clenching her fists. She grabbed him by the collar angrily. \"If you weren't Krillin's friend I'd have half a mind to pound you into the dirt right here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez!\" Yamcha replied, trying to pry 18's hands off his shirt. \"I just thought that if I was in the tournament you might want to CHEER ME ON.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unaware but furious android didn't let her grip relent even slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheering like some stupid airhead? Yeah right, not in a million years. Especially not for some weakling like y-\" 18 stopped abruptly, eyes rolling up into her head for a moment. \"Someone like... s-someone like youuu...\" Her eyes were now looking at Yamcha, though now they appeared empty and blank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that you were saying?\" Yamcha asked smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n18's grip on Yamcha's shirt didn't loosen. If anything, it tightened. She appeared to be struggling to reject her trigger, blinking rapidly and wobbling in place slightly, mouth slightly ajar allowing a bit more drool to fall out. Eventually the willful woman gave out, opening her blank blue eyes for the last time and staring adoringly at Yamcha and finally letting go of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha was impressed with how strong the cyborg's will had been, but not particularly surprised. This was the woman who completely rejected Doctor Gero's conditioning after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was saying how I would love to cheer for you!\" 18 sang out in a bubbly voice, so unlike her usual demeanor. She was now clearly the type of airhead she was just insulting a minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Why don't you give me a sexy cheer then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" 18 said in a breathy tone that Yamcha found quite sexy. She absentmindedly brushed some stray strands of blonde hair out of her eyes, before letting them fall back to cover them once again. As she did this she gave Yamcha the most adorable little smile he had ever seen. Was this really the same 18?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2, 4, 6, 8, who do we appreciate?! Yamcha!\" 18 suddenly cheered, jumping up and down pumping her fists. She made sure to stick her chest out so Yamcha could appreciate her large boobs bouncing under her shirt. After all, he did ask her to cheer sexily! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha stared at the show mouth agape. Sure, this wasn't the most original cheer out there, but it made sense that 18 wouldn't know a lot of cheer routines. She just wasn't that type of lady. Well, at least she didn't used to be. He closed his mouth as 18 finished. She gave him a wink, cute and peppy grin covering her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I do good Yamcha?\" 18 asked excitedly. 18 was never this excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... incredible!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaaay!\" 18 cheered once again, jumping in the air like she was a schoolgirl. Oh man if only she could see herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave Yamcha an idea. Was it..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But damn it's nice to have you finally shut up and stop criticizing everyone.  Anyways. You're gonna do whatever I tell you from now on. Got it?\" he commanded.

They were an item once and even if it isn\u2019t going to be real he wants to recapture that old flame or rather create his own little spark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Bulma listen to me and listen well. I\u2019m in control of your mind, your feelings, your memories, their are some things in that head of yours that must be corrected. I and I alone will rectify these mistakes. Got it?\u201d Yamahas says as he plays with the orb in front of Bulma\u2019s face. Her eyes glued to it as it dances in front of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Yamcha, you are the master of my mind, please fix it.\u201d Bulma was compelled to say. Completely unable to fight this power over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood now remember back to the good old days. Before Trunks, Vegeta, or saiyans.  Do you remember when we were in love with each other.\u201d Yamahas grins as he remembers the good old times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- ummm- I hmmm- Uhhhh- I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t remember ever being in love with Yamcha.\u201d Bulma says in a monotone but clearly sincere voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah\u201d It feels like a dagger was plunged into his heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-What do you mean of course we were!\u201d He objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I don\u2019t think we were.\u201d A bit of a Bulma\u2019s sharp wit shows up as she crosses her arms as she can\u2019t imagine a time where the two were in \u201clove\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well I\u2019m telling you now we were, think back closely. You now remember it clear as day now. We were madly in love with one another. Remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power of the orb once again overpowered Bulma\u2019s mind and her resistance was quickly extinguished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I remember now, we were in love, my first love Yamcha...\u201d She confirms while going back to a neutral pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Bulma, That\u2019s it remember, you and I were and continue to be madly in love.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I...wait no, you died to Vegeta, Actually not even Vegeta but to his Saibamen. You sort of became... undesirable after that.\u201d Letting reality slip in again Bulma scratches her head at the suggestion the pair of them are still in fact in love. It\u2019s growing clear to Yamaha that completely controlling Bulma isn\u2019t as easy as he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUndesirable?! What do you mean?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you sorta became kind of useless in the group. No offense but it\u2019s not like I could rely on you for anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell guess what you are remembering it wrong! You can rely on me! After all think about all the times I saved your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What Tim-\u201c Bulma\u2019s mind is pulled back into the power of the orb. Her memories are being rewritten and she now remembers Yamcha bravely  protecting her in her time of need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it you remember now don\u2019t you? How I protected you? Your amazing handsome boyfriend? Your heart racing as I carried you in my big strong arms?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flashes of memories filled Bulma\u2019s head. Overwhelming her with a sense of love and admiration towards Yamaha she never had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Yamcha, you are so incredible. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without you.\u201d She places her hand over her heart as it\u2019s set a flutter towards her new hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you are getting it babe. I was always their for you. You know why you and I are a couple and we are madly MADLY in love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But Vegeta and Trunks...\u201d a hint of resistance pops up once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no no just forget about them for now. From now in Vegeta is just a angry guy and Trunks is just some kid from the future. All that matters is us and our love. You love me Bulma. You are my girlfriend. This is all that matters to you.\u201d Yamcha increases the power of his orb making sure he can keep Bulma in trance for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough hesitant at first the power of the hypnosis orb is too great and hearing these comforting words from the man she loves is enough to tear down any barriers in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Yamcha, I am your loving girlfriend. I love you with all my heart.\u201d She says much to Yamcha\u2019s pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFocus on that babe, how much you love me, feel it grow every second you think of me, stronger and more passionate. You love me SO much that you can\u2019t help to be submissive and become my obedient little girlfriend. Loving and pleasing me is the greatest pleasure you can receive? Right my little Bulma?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I love you so much Yamcha. I\u2019ll do whatever you say as long as it makes you happy.\u201d Bulma affirms in her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, Now when I snap my finger you will awaken as my loving obedient, loyal, girlfriend. All the memories I gave you are more real than anything else in your mind, you are 1000% convinced you are little more than my perfect girlfriend. Understand,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma gives one final nod as she accepts this reality in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen without further ado, wake up in 1-2-3...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SNAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Bulma\u2019s body language shifts from the stiff neutral stance to a more flirtatious one. Her eyes which were blankly focused on the orb itself now shift and are glued on Yamcha, their gaze filled with lust and desire. She sensually struts up to him, he nervously gulps as she wraps her arms around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey big boy, You came to surprise your girlfriend? I must admit it means the world to have you here with me. I don\u2019t know why but it feels like forever since we\u2019ve been together.\u201d She lovingly presses herself up against him. Giving him a passionate kiss before pulling away slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you have no idea.\u201d Yam has replied both in shock at what\u2019s happening and pleasure in it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Sexy it\u2019s you and me alone in the house for a bit? What would you like to do? I\u2019m so eager to hear what you have planned for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t you worry babe I got something very fun in mind...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hmmm let\u2019s see, how to make this work.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma waits patiently while Yamaha scans the room for possible inspiration. Though honestly he can\u2019t make heads of tails of some of the contraptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez Bulma you should really label these things, I don\u2019t know what any of these things are. The only thing I can even make out is that robot over their.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha paused as inspiration struck. Robots, obedient, mindless, helpful, machines that do what they are programmed and nothing else. It was perfect, Yamcha thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it Bulma! You can be a r-HEY where are you going?!\u201d Yamcha was surprised to see Bulma was walking away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t order you to leave! What do you think you are doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must label everything in my lab.\u201d Bulma replies in a emotionless voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right Ehehehehe...\u201d Yamcha can head the imaginary Bumlma in his head telling him to be more careful with his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after Yamcha stopped Bulma\u2019s little labeling adventure and entrances her with the orb again. Leaving her open to commands once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew... alright listen very closely Bulma I\u2019m going to give you your first REAL command. When I do I want you to repeat back my orders to make sure I know you are getting it. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma gives a slight nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood ok then first things first. From this point forward you are no longer Bulma Brief. You are not the Heir to the capsule Corp corporation, you are not married with a kid, and you are not a brilliant scientist. You are not and never have been Bulma Brief unless I say otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not Bulma Brief, I never was Bulma Brief, I\u2019ll only be Bulma if you say so.\u201d Bulma repeats as her mind suppressed her own identity. Leaving her a blank slate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Tell me do you know who you are Bul- I mean w-Woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I know is that I\u2019m not Bulma Brief. I don\u2019t know who I am.\u201d Bumps answers back honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019ll tell you exactly who or rather WHAT you are. You are a robot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA robot...\u201d Bulma echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes a robot, a machine created by Capsule Corp to be the perfect obedient servant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect..Obedient...Servant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right you are the top of the line robot designed to do whatever your owner desires. You come with plenty of modes and features meant to please them and your master can also easily modify and reprogram you at any time to suit their needs. With your primary purpose being to serve and please your master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy purpose is to serve and please my master...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast but certainly not least when you awaken or should I say be \u201cTurned on\u201d Your Master is none other than me, Yamcha, no one else. This is very important got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI belong to Yamcha, only Yamcha...\u201d As the last bit of \u201cprogramming\u201d sets in and she gives one final nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet! Ok then so it seems you get it. Now just to be safe whenever I show you my hypnotic orb again you will return to a hypnotized state where you\u2019ll just be hypnotized Bulma and no longer the robot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will also give you a quick trigger. If you every hear me say <b>\u201cBack to the Lab\u201d</b> no matter what\u2019s happening or what you are doing you will instantly wake up from your hypnosis. Completely oblivious that you were ever hypnotized. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma gives another nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, So then when I snap- no actually let\u2019s keep this to theme. I\u2019m adding an imaginary <b>On/Off switch</b> on your body. Located on your uh...belly Button. Whenever I press it it\u2019ll switch you from on to off and vice versa. While you are off you\u2019ll be completely inanimate until I turn you on again or command you with hypnosis to awaken.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe walks up to Bulma and lifts up her shirt carefully to get a good shot of her belly button. He giggles excitedly at the thought of his new robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk I\u2019m going to press it. When you do you\u2019ll turn on as my new robot. Ready? 1-2-3 GO!\u201d He pokes her belly button and as soon as she does Bulma\u2019s eyes roll to the back of her head as her upper body goes limp. her head and shoulders slump forward and she is completely silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm Bulma? R-Robot? You O-Ok?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response. Yamaha starts to sweat nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no d-did I break her brain! V-Vegeta is going to kill me! Come on turn on!\u201d He starts picking her belly button over and over again to try and get a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Bulma if you can\u2019t be agreeable as a woman couldn\u2019t you be agreeable as a Mac-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello!\u201d Without warning Bulma\u2019s body straightens out at attention. The speed and suddenness of this shift making Yamaha leap back in fright. \u201cEEEEEPPPPP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for Purchasing a Capsule Corps latest robotic model. It is a pleasure to finally meet you, Master Yamcha.\u201d Bulls says in a strange Emotionless monotone. She wears a artificial doll like smile across her face, Both of her eyes are wide open but still feel lifeless as they stare forwards Yamaha. Her body is extremely stiff and still, only moving when absolutely necessary. In this case as she introduces herself she gives Yamcha a slight curtsy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha gets up after falling back from the floor. His heart racing from both the excitement of the moment and his little scare. \u201cB-Bulma is that really you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse my correction master but I am not \u201cBulma\u201d what you see before you is the most sophisticated and life like machine on the planet, adapting technology from the late Dr. Giro, capsule Corp created a machine that perfectly replicated the female form. Designed to please you any way you desire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma starts to display herself, striking several model poses like hands on her hips as she pushes it out to one side, raising her hands behind her head and stretching out, bending forward with her hands on her knees, finally facing away from Yamcha and displaying her back. All to show off her \u201clife like\u201d body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wow that\u2019s incredible! You really are so life like.\u201d Ycha can\u2019t help but get excited as Bulma shows off her beautiful body just for him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you master, Im glad to hear you enjoy my body. You can do whatever you please to me and it. But before that I\u2019d like to ask would you like to give this unit a name?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh right I guess I never gave you a replace- I mean a name... ummm just for simplicity sake I\u2019ll just call you Bulma?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBulma, as in the young and beautiful genius heir of Capsule Corp? Of course, is this the name you want to finalize? It can be changed later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez Bulls even as a hypnotized robot you still full of yourself.\u201d Yamcha thinks to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm yeah do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cName Accepted, I am now Bulma the Robot. Now would you like to hear about my various modes and features?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh of course, that sounds useful.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well my Moses are as followed:\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Robot Mode</b>: The default mode I\u2019m in right now, Ready to please and obey, following any and all commands given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Personality Mode </b>: Master Yamaha can input personalities I could simulate at any time. Describe the persons you wish for me to assume and once activated I\u2019ll act accordingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Display Mode</b>: I\u2019ll mindlessly pose and show off my body as you see fit. I\u2019ll be in any state of dress or undress you\u2019d prefer <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously if master has more ideas of how he can control and use me just enter me in Robot mode and you can add additional modes, triggers, or whatever you think will be best to please you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all for the moment master, now that I have explained my functions you can use me as you see fit. I await your orders.\u201d Bulma stands to attention. Looking towards Yamaha and waiting for his commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamaha thinks to himself. Robot Bulma has given him a lot to consider. He is so eager to get started though that it doesn't  matter what he picks first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he decides to...</span></div></div>",

He flipped on the TV, beginning to watch the baseball game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Bulma returned. She now wore a skin-tight, black, leather body piece that clung tightly to her. It made since, seeing that the last time Bulma wore this was a few decades ago.  On her legs were fishnet stockings, and red heels on her feet.

I don\u2019t need to go far to get Bulma back but be sure to have those personalities ready to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTriggers are all set to go master Yamcha.\u201d She smiles and gives a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect then let\u2019s bring Bulma... <b>Back to the Lab</b>\u201c Yamcha takes a few steps back not wanting to be right in front of Bulma when she snaps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough as soon after Yamcha gives the trigger, Bulma blinks several times as the glaze over her eyes dissipates and she begins to focus. Her vacant smiling expression she\u2019s kept consistently on her face while she was a robot drops and is replaced with a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh... What just happened? Why do my cheeks feel like they been stretched by a taffy puller?\u201d Bulma remarks, blissfully unaware about how long she held the same smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYamcha? What are you d-AAAAAAAAHHHHH!\u201d Bulma shrieks out as she finally sees both the position and state of undress she is currently in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked at the very revealing outfit she was wearing as well as the fact that she was for some reason pushing her breast out like a perverted idiot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately removes her hands from her breast and tries her best to cover herself up best she could. Though with how revealing the outfit Is this isn\u2019t something she could she easily do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What!? H-How did I?! When?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Bulma? I think you look really good in that outfit. It suites you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou! YAMCHA YOU BASTARD!\u201d All of the confusion she had was replaced by blind rage as soon as Yamcha opened his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? What did I do?\u201d Yamcha tried to feint innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please Yamcha what kind of idiot do you take me for!? I don\u2019t know how but I know you put me into this shameful display! Just wait till Vegeta hears about this!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma then attempts to storm out of the room and Yamaha simply yells out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault that you were <b>\u201cMaid to Order\u201d</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets halfway through the door way into the hall before the trigger takes hold. Yamaha couldn\u2019t see her facial reaction because she was moving away from him, but he could tell that it takes effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was about to storm out she suddenly trips up and falls forward with a girlish. \u201cKyaaa!\u201d Shouted as she falls on her face. Her but was still sticking up and out as she lies on the floor giving Yamcha a great look at her ass as she awkwardly lies their. Even better with the outfit she\u2019s wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Bulma stumbles up onto her feet but it was clear that she wasn\u2019t the same as before. Her stance was a bit awkward, She wears an expression of embarrassment and worry, her entire face is also tomato red from blushing, she fidgets around a bit nervously, and she avoids making eye contact when she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow that was some fall Bulma, you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Master I\u2019m so sorry, I don\u2019t know what came over me. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m such a clutz.\u201d Bulma frantically apologizes in a soft, meek, cutesy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI expected more from you Bulma and where is your uniform?\u201d Yamcha pointing out the bunny outfit she is currently in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEep! I\u2019m so sorry my master, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on!Please forgive my foolishness. I\u2019ll change immediately.\u201d Bulma kneels on the ground and bows towards her master in respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries, I am a forgiving master but first things first you must clean up this mess before anything else.\u201d Yamcha shows Bulma the mess he made while he was watching TV. Beer bottles scattered on the floor, crumbs  of snacks on everything, overall just very untidy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh of course master, you truly are so merciful and kind. I will make sure to clean this all up right away.\u201d Bulma blushes at how amazing her master is in her eyes and begins to clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha watching closely as she bends down to pick up various things he\u2019d get several good looks at her cleavage as she bends forward and even better looks of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would seem the trigger has worked very well and the personality is perfectly implemented. Now that he knows that Yamcha decides to...</span></div></div>",

She had been picking stuff up off the floor, but that now seemed to have been forgotten as her eyes widened and her mouth hung open for a second. The blue haired heiress of capsule corp was clearly shifting mindsets, something that would take a few moments considering how drastic the change was from being a shy maid to being a seductive dancer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Bulma's smile returned... or at least sort or returned. Rather than with a shy, timid, smile, Bulma was now staring at Yamcha with a confident, seductive smile teasing at her lips. Her eyes, despite being duller and emptier than usual, were able to hold Yamcha's gaze with a look of pure hunger. Bulma let out a cute little giggle as she swayed her hips and slowly approached the Z-fighter, finally reaching him and wrapping her arms around his neck while continuing to gaze up at him provocatively. She stepped back, running her hands through her blue hair, tousling and messing it up a bit as she continued to smile lustfully in Yamcha's direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha could barely stop himself from passing out. This was the best day of his life! He could almost watch this forever! He definitely at least wanted to watch for a bit longer, that was for sure! Should he...?</span></div></div>",

But after some time she finished cleaning up Yamcha's mess.

But she lived more or less in the middle of nowhere, her whole family was away at a tournament, and she wasn't exactly unattractive. Besides, he wasn't even certain how well this hypnosis thing worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he showed up and failed to hypnotize her... Goku probably wouldn't really get what that meant. He'd be home free! So he headed out to the home of Goku and Chi-Chi. He knocked on the door and almost instantly is swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOHA-- oh... it's you...\" she pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh... I don't even look like Gohan...\" he said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was HOPING my son came back home to be with his mother... I guess you'll have to do for company. Unless you're looking for my family in which case THEY ALL LEFT!\" she yells, seemingly at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I'm aware. I was kinda left behind too. Tien and Krillin went with Goku and we haven't talked in a long time. I figured...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait. You actually came to visit ME?\" she inquired<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..? I guess.

After a moment Chi-Chi returns with tea for the both of them, then sits down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I haven't seen you for a bit. Or talked to you, at least. How have things been?\" Chi-Chi asked awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good. I haven't been fighting much. Been focusing on Baseball. Though I have been working on a Ki technique that I can use as a baseball. Makes it a lot easier for me because I can control it, so I can make it come back. I don't have to fly off to get a ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I wish Goku would do something like that. Take Goten out into the yard and play baseball with him. Even if he's using his weird abilities. Mind showing him how it works when he comes home? Maybe I can get him to agree by saying it's ki training or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could show you how to do it. I know you don't really have Ki control but honestly a cat could probably manage the Ki it takes to use it. You could show Goku as soon as he gets home. Then he won't take the first opportunity to run off again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi-Chi's eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES. SHOW ME. RIGHT NOW.\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha chuckled in fear for a moment before slowly raising his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-u-uhhh... let me uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe activates the hypnosis technique. Chi-Chi stares at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do I do it?\" she questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep looking into it.\" Yamcha replies with a chuckle as Chi-Chi's eyes adopt a spiral pattern and her body goes slack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Now... what will my first task be for you, Chi-Chi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he make her do?</span></div></div>",

A minute or two passed, and Yamcha was starting to think Videl wasn't home. But she did eventually come to the door and looked more than a bit upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm..? Oh. You're Yamcha right? If you're looking for Gohan he isn't here...\" she said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was but... are you alright? You see kinda down.\" Yamcha replied, trying to be empathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But Gohan got dragged off to some tournament! The worst part is that he was out shopping and had our little girl with him! That damn Vados showed up later to tell me that Pan got dragged off along with Gohan!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... I might be able to get her back here. It's a bit of a stretch though\" Yamcha said as he rubbed his chin pensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Really?! How?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have a technique that could let me contact Goku. I could contact him, and have him convince Beerus to have someone send Pan back down. If anyone has a chance to get it done it's Goku. Although you may wanna be the one to ask him. Me asking to have your daughter brought back here would be... kinda weird.\" he said with a small chuckle.  Pan smiled with glee and literally pulled Yamcha into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do the technique! Do the technique!\" she cried out joyfully.  Yamcha held up his hand and activated the hypnosis technique. A small ball that pulsed with hypnotic spirals. Videl looked into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Connecting...\" Yamcha lied. In no time Videl's body became more relaxed. Black and white spirals appeared in her eyes.

So really I am helping her... in a way..?\" he said to himself, awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for you, Videl... what should I have you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he command?</span></div></div>",

She continued to unblinkingly stare forward in a stupor, completely mindless and unaware of her surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's completely hypnotized!\" Yamcha crowed triumphantly. \"This is amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Videl repeated mindlessly, spirals still spinning madly in her usually deep blue eyes. \"I am completely hypnotized. This is amazing.\" Videl's lips curled upward slightly into a small smile. If master said this was amazing, then she was happy and content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Videl.\" Yamcha began. \"I want you to forget allll about Pan. She doesn't need you right now. You don't miss her. Nothing else matters other than my commands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVidel's smile faltered. \"I w-will forget about Pan...? She d-doesn't need me right... no.. now. I don't miss her. Nothing else matters other than you commands.\" As Videl finished her smile returned. She was happy to obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha fidgeted nervously. He didn't expect anybody to have a will strong enough to resist the power granted to him. Then again, he'd heard that Videl used to be quite spunky back in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Videl, start by taking off your clothes. All of them, even your underwear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan's wife didn't even hesitate. She smiled lazily, eyes half lidded as she bent down to take off her clothes. After all, what reason did she have to disobey? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God you're hot...\" Yamcha mumbled, half to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVidel grinned proudly at her master, exuberant to have pleased him. Her clothes were all off now, revealing her well endowed breasts and cute heart shaped ass. She was also in quite good shape, probably from her days of fighting crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Videl.\" Yamcha started cupping Videl's breasts with his hands. \"I want you to try on this outfit I got just for this occasion. It should be just your size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVidel nodded absentmindedly, not even seeming to notice or care that her boobs were being squeezed. If anything, it made her happier. Any use her master could find for her made her ecstastic. She let out an uncharacteristic giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course master! I would love to try on your outfit!\" The hypnotized daughter of Mr. Satan beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, it was a maid outfit. It even came with a duster and the frilly hat they were known for. If anyone, even Gohan had asked Videl to wear this while she was in her normal state, she would have punted them into next week. Instead, Videl was smiling like a bimbo as she regarded her new uniform!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master I love it!\" She squealed. \"It's the perfect uniform for a servant like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVidel threw it on quickly and did a twirl for her beloved master, showing off her maid dress, frilly underskirt, and attached lace apron. Her maid headband adorned her head nicely, looking good on top of her short black hair. All of this combined with her vapid smiling expression made the entranced woman look extremely delicate, which was something she definitely wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, it's time for you to start cleaning!\" Yamcha said excitedly, passing her the duster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir! I am your obedient maid!\" Videl chirped in reply, moving to dust a table. Normally the housework was shared between her and her husband Gohan, but this time she would be doing it by herself, and she couldn't be happier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha watched as one of the hottest women he'd ever met bent over to dust a bench. He could see her cute ass poking out from under her maid dress, as well as her black underwear. Man, he had just made her a maid, but he already wanted more just from watching her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea popped into his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
