The windows were broken, and the painting of the exterior faded from yellow to a barely visible yellow.  The vines that the previous owner planted were climbing up the sides of the house.  For years, he wandered who lived in this mansion, but he realized that the mansion has been abandoned for one hundred years now.  The mansion was built near the Hudson Bay and used to be owned by the McGowan family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed the rusted gates open, and he walked down the eroded sidewalk to the front porch.  He climbed the steps onto the porch and walked to the front door.  He tried to open the door, but he found the door was locked!  He banged on the door in attempt to open it.

He took a sharp turn and slammed into a door. The door easily opened, and then he tried to shut it before the spider could enter. It got one leg through and Bob shouted and he rammed the door closed. The anthro spider howled in pain as the leg broke off, but Bob quickly locked the door and backed away. He stood still as he listened intently for any noise. He only heard the spider crawl away.

What's a mermaid doing in this creepy haunted house? Just then the duck walks past him and jumps in the tub. The girl starts petting him and says to Bob. \"Hello Bob.

As a mermaid, she's very pretty with long dark curly hair that disappeared below the bubbles. Her dark skin complimented her hair. \"I admit you have me at a disadvantage.\" says Bob \"You know my name but I don't know yours.\" She smiled and said in a beautiful voice \"My name is Nagina, princess of the Cat Tail Kingdom. Behind this mansion is a lake which holds the entrance to my kingdom. Years ago, me and my people were friends with the family that lived here. Unfortunately, a terrible curse befell the house and it's owners. My kingdom once had grand magic. Now the close proximity to the dark curse has all but drained our magic. I am one of a few that had the strongest magic, and therefore still have a little left so I have been sent to try and end it. However I fear I may not be strong enough to do so and need your help.\" \"I thought this family has been gone for a hundred years?\" asked Bob. \"How could you've known them? And second, I hate to break this to you princess, but I don't believe in magic.\" \"As long as they spend more of their lives in water than out of, my people and I can live hundreds of years. And to your second point, do you believe in mermaids?\" Before Bob can answer she decides to continue \"If it convinces you, I'll show you a little magic.\" She touches a finger to a pearl around her neck. Her and the bubbles float to about half way up the room and moves to out of the bathtub. Bob takes a step backwards as not the get hit, and because he's a little taken a back. She rotates to a standing position as the bubbles look softer and softer. Suddenly she's standing in a white robe in front of Bob. Her tail is gone, and has been replaced with legs. She holds out her hand and blows bubbles into existence and into Bob's face. \"Convinced?\" she asks. Bob nods. She offers him her hand and asks \"Will you help?\"</span></div></div>",

Nagina smiles again and says \"Than maybe there is still hope.\" She takes off the robe and hangs it over the side of the tub. She's wearing tight fitting pants that have a scale pattern on them, and a green sports bra. She led him out of the bathroom as he said \"I didn't realize mermaids wore clothes.\" \"We don't always.\" she replied \"And it can be more fun not to, but I'm here to work not to play.\" \"Where did the clothes come from? Were you wearing that shirt in the bathtub?\" \"No of course not.\" she answered. \"It's magic. It doesn't have to make sense.\" Bob changes the topic away from her clothes for a minute. \"What's going on with this curse anyway?\" \"The owner of the house was dying, but he had yet to write a will. He had three sons, all of whom wanted the house because of the lake it was next to, and none of them was going to share it with the others. What happened after that is something we need to find out. None of them ended up with ownership of the house, they all vanished, presumably dead.\" Just as they rounded a corner, they saw a man at the other end of a hallway. His hair was tied back in a pony tail and he wore early 20th century clothing. He was tall and definitely dead as he was floating and see-through. As he came towards them the pair noticed a roof finial sticking through his chest, like a sharp post used to decorate roofs \"I know him.\" Said Nagina suddenly. \"His name is Edward. Edward McGowan. He is, well he was the second son of the owner.\" She says to the ghost \"Ed, it's me, Nagina.\" Edward seemed to ignore her and floated past them and through the wall at the end of the hallway. \"He looks like he could've been murdered.\" notes Bob as Nagina was turning green. \"But if one of his brothers killed him and the third brother, why didn't he get the house?\" Just as he finished she threw up in the corner. Then she straightened up and asked \"You're skeptical of mermaids, but when you see a ghost you don't blink?\" \"If mermaids exist then I'll believe anything.\" remarks Bob \"Are you ok?\" \"Yeah fine.\" said Nagina sarcastically. \"I just saw the murdered ghost of someone I was good friends with, but I'm perfectly fine.\" \"Could the McGowan's do magic?\" asked Bob. \"No. Why do you ask?\" \"Well it just would've made sense, since we're looking into a curse.\" Nagina shook her head sending her curly hair from side-to-side. Good magic must be learned, as I learned magic. Dark magic isn't the same. Even if no one in the family could weld magic, an evil enough event could cause a curse on the house, and murder is undoubtedly evil.\" Suddenly Nagina could feel a strange sensation in her legs. She made a face and felt her pants which for a moment felt more like scales than cloth, before returning to normal. \"Under normal circumstances it is very easy for one of my people to keep their tail as legs. With the curse draining my magic, it's taking a bit of my concentration to keep my legs, and even then... For a moment my legs started to change back to me tail. I don't know how much longer I can hold onto my legs.\" \"Then we better hurry.\" says Bob. \"Maybe we can learn more if we find another ghost. But where do we look?\" They both think about it for a moment. They each come up with a suggestion. Bob suggests they try to find the kitchen, someone may of been poisoned. Nagina thinks they should go to the owner's bedroom to see if he finished a will that no one, or almost no one, knew about.</span></div></div>",

As Bob reached for the drawer in the bedside table he heard a thump on the bed. He turns around to find Nagina lying on the bed. Her clothes are gone and her tail is back. \"What happened?\" asks Bob. \"I couldn't hold my legs any longer.\" replies Nagina. \"I need to rest a little. I'll wait here while you're looking. Eventually I'll need to get in some water like another bathtub or something. But maybe not yet. Also, I could use something to drink. Water preferably, but I need something.\" \"Ok.\" says Bob. \"I'll see what I can find.\" He heads to the kitchen. In it he finds a gallon of water on the counter. When he picks it up, he notices a body on the floor that has a knife protruding from his chest. He takes the gallon back to the bedroom. When he returns to the bedroom Nagina is gone. Instead there is another ghost, who is looking directly at him, as if waiting for him. He doesn't look like the dead body in the kitchen so he must be the third brother. \"Bob. This doesn't concern you. Leave now or die.\" Bob doesn't want to die, but he doesn't want to abandon the mermaid princess either.

The ghost grabbed Bob on the shoulders, which surprised him. Bob to a swing at him, but it went right through his head. \"Good bye Bob.\" said the ghost. He flew like hurricane winds towards the window and threw Bob out it. Bob went flying and cracked his head on a tombstone.

He grabs her arms and drags her out from under the bed. Once he lets go of her, she picks a cobweb from her hair. \"How did you get down there? I thought you were tired\" asks Bob. \"I saw him coming and hid. Now that I wasn't spending any energy on legs, I was able to roll myself quickly off the bed. I was afraid he might still be dangerous.\" \"Still?\" asked Bob. \"In life, he was the eldest brother. He always seemed ruthless. I suspect he killed his other two brothers for the house. But I don't know why he too is dead.\" \"I found the other brother in the kitchen, or his body anyways. He had been stabbed. Though, come to think of it, it was as if he was killed in the last few days, not 100 years ago.\" says Bob. \"Curses can have all sorts of effects on the time in the area. That's one of the things that make them so strange.\" answered Nagina. \"Is that water for me?\" \"Yeah.\" says Bob giving her the gallon. \"It was in the kitchen.\" She unscrews the gallon and takes a sip. \"Mmm. This will have to do, but I wish I had more. My tail has been dry too long. It seems to be drying out faster than usual.\" She drinks half of it while Bob watches her. \"So what do we do now?\" He asked. \"We must find out how the eldest brother died. If we can find the last ghost, maybe he can tell us something.\" \"Where do we look?\" Nagina didn't answer right away. Instead, she poured some of the water on her tail, or what she could reach of it anyways, since she couldn't reach the bottom half. \"Do you think you could do me a favor?\" she asked handing him the gallon. \"And pour the water over the rest of my tail.\" \"Um. Sure. Why not?\" says Bob. He pours the water all over the end of her tail. \"That feels great.\" says Nagina. Bob tosses the empty gallon aside. \"If the brother died in the kitchen, he could still be around there somewhere. We should start there.\" says Nagina. Bob stands. Nagina stretches and suddenly has legs and clothes again. She too stands. \"That water was refreshing. Though I'll probably need more before long. Let's go.\" They head out the door to the kitchen. When they get there Nagina looks at the body and sighs. \"This was the youngest brother, John. He and I were friends, just not good friends.\" She gulps and says \"Now we just need to find his ghost, assuming he has one.\" As if one cue, John's ghost entered the kitchen. But would he be helpful or hurtful?</span></div></div>",

Once inside, he saw a huge grand staircase in front of him, spiraling upwards. To his left was an ornate maple door with a valuable-looking handle.

One of them had a child. Nothing else was known except just over 105 years ago the house was know for having a grand garden. And by 100 years ago, none of them was alive anymore.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anna decides to start by looking for a bedroom. She climbs the grand staircase which creaks loudly at every step. At the top is a door which she easily pushes through to find herself in a pentagonal room. There is a room at each side, one of the sides being the door she just came through. All the doors are open. She browses through the 4 other room. In the first room, she finds a medium size room with a double bed and bare walls. Second one, has a king size bed with a candelabra on a bedside table. There is a dresser covered in dust beneath a small cracked open window. She decides to enter the second one. She looks around and opens the top draw in the bedside table. It contains a scroll and two other worn pieces of paper. She takes the scroll out and delicately unrolls it. It turns out to be the McGowan family tree. Anna spies Gideon McGowan and Agnes. As she was aware, Gideon had 3 children. There names were Homer, Felix, and Easter. Easter had married someone called Howard Phillips. Phillips became Easter's last name, and she and Howard had a son named Herbert. Anna notes that Howard's parents aren't on it, though it is the \"McGowan\" family. Next to each name she can see a date. Gideon had a 1819 CE next to it, Herbert had a 1866 CE. Gideon's parents had two dates, his father, Horace, being 1796 CE - 1837 CE and his mother, Priscilla, being 1798 CE - 1838 CE. However, neither Gideon, his wife, nor any of their descendants had second dates. Although Howard Phillips had two dates, 1845 CE - 1876 CE. She rolls it up and puts it aside, picking up the next piece of paper. It's the plan for the 2nd floor of the house. She can see the pentagonal room and the bedrooms off of it. All the bedrooms are roughly the same size, although the one she is in is slightly larger than the others. Written in small writing at the bottom, says Building Plan Part III. Parts I and II below. She wonders to herself, \"Part III? I'm on the second floor, how is it part III? Why not part II? And the rest of the drawer is empty? Where is part I and II? Shouldn't the first and second part<br>\r\n be beneath Part III in the drawer.\" She feels the bottom of the drawer to see if there is a fake floor, there isn't. She opens second and bottom drawer, which is empty and doesn't have a fake floor either. She looks under the bedside table, a spider comes out from underneath it and Anna jumps on to the bed, startled. The spider goes under the bed. She bends off the bed and looks under the bedside table, also nothing. She falls back on the bed and thinks about what she has found. She has the family tree which gives her the names of the family, but not much else. It tells her that they all must have dead close to the same time if no one was left alive to put in their dates of death. The latest date on it is Howard's death in 1876. No one was left alive by 1914, a good 40 year gap. She wonders what happened to Howard. She thinks about the building plan, she has only part III. She needs to decide what her next move is. Should she look for a diary in the other bedrooms for answers? Or search for part I and II of the building plan?</span></div></div>",

She leaves the information on the bed and leaves the room. She enters the next door over. It was a quaint room. Smaller than she expected given what it looked like on the blue print, though she felt like a bed on one side was missing. The room had a medium size bed on the right with a bedside table, a dresser against the back wall, and a bookshelf the the right. According the the blue print, there should've been another bed on the right, but there's no way one would fit over there. Just another mystery she figures. She sits on the bed, which she regrets when it sends up a cloud of dust. She stands up coughing while the dust settled. She decides to stay standing and opened up the bedside table, which only has one drawer, though there was room for a second. Inside is two dust pieces of paper that looked like they had been ripped out of something. Anna blows them off and reads some of it though some words are more faded and aren't ledgable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>1865 June the 6th. My love and I's wedding is planned for this            .

Homer, Felix, and Easter were born in 1840, 1842, and 1846 respectfully. Any of them could've been getting married, though only Easter is the only one shown to be married in the family. Also, the diary entry states something about the writer taking someones last name, and Easter was the only daughter. So this diary must've been Easter's, or a few pages to it anyways. What does this tell me? Anna asked herself. This must be right before Easter was to get married to Howard. She seems afraid of what her father might do, maybe because she was going to change her last name even though in those day women always took the man's last name. And she sounds worried that something would insult her family. Maybe something she was thinking about doing? This dairy gave some information. Anna thinks she might be starting to get somewhere if only she had the rest of the diary. Where should she look for the rest of it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first Anna didn't notice the mist. She was too busy wondering why there was a wooden box holding a red amulet on the floor. And when she did see it, she didn't believe her eyes. <i>Maybe I'm seeing things... a bit of dust could have flown in my eye while I was running down here.</i> She rubbed her eyes. It was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up slowly, Anna didn't take her eyes off of the mist. It was shapeless but not formless.  It was roughly in the form of a human body, as tall if not taller than her. Whether it was male or female she couldn't tell. Goosebumps rose all over her body.  Taking deep breaths, Anna took a few steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved, the amulet swung right and left, and every time it did, the white mist seemed to jerk as if to follow its movements. Anna frowned. She held the amulet away from her body at her left side, and the mist moved at the same time. Slowly putting two and two together, Anna's face brightened. The house was haunted because the ghost was attached to the amulet! If the amulet went outside, the ghost might follow, and then the house wouldn't be haunted anymore! If she could get it that far, maybe she could get a spirit medium to help the spirit cross over! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she could just find someway to destroy the amulet. That way, the ghost wouldn't have to leave the house, and maybe the other ghosts in the house (if there even were any) would follow its example and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had only two things she could do: try to find a fireplace and burn the amulet, or try and bring it outside to get someone to exorcise it. Either way it was extremely dangerous, but Anna had a feeling that with the amulet gone it'd be better for all people (and ghosts) involved.</span></div></div>",

She began to inch back toward the staircase with the eerie mist following, seeming to come closer with every minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stumbled and caught herself just before falling completely to the floor. Thump! Something had fallen out of her other pocket. Holy Water!! She had forgotten about the tiny vial of Holy Water she had gotten from the church gift shop a few Sunday's ago. She would never again forget to say her prayers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the top off the Holy Water and doused it on the mist and it immediately disapated. Quickly, she turned and ran with her heart in her throat toward the top of the staircase. She wanted to find her Rosary but needed to get out of the mansion as fast as she could with the Amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amulet seemed to glow and was warm to her touch. Was this thing alive? She needed to get to Father Frank and have him exorcise it first. Maybe he would return with her to find her rosary.</span></div></div>",

It is what she found after she had scanned the back of the house. A back door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna walked over to the door and placed her hand on the rusted doorknob. She turned the knob slowly and pushed the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Success!\" she whispered <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peeked in the doorway and wished she had brought a flashlight. She ran a hand over the inside wall looking for a light switch to illuminate the room.  The wall was smooth to the touch, and she finally gave up.  The room had no light switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I explore this place without a light to guide me?\" she asked the heavens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you have to do is say let there be light,\" a strange voice replied from out of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stood frozen.

When she turned around, a bright light blinded her.  Upon waking up, she knew she was in a different world.  She sat up and faced the glances of a fairy and three humans.  One of the humans had horns on its head, and another human had eyes that slanted to the side.  She noticed the walls surrounding her and the window above her that made her feel like she was in a jail.

Instantly she spun round, but there was no one there. It must have been her imagination. Now, there was the whole house left to explore. She turned to pick up a candle when suddenly she could have sworn she felt something tap her back. She wheeled round. Nothing but the flicker of the candles against the walls and her own elongated shadow. Now trembling, candlestick in hand, she took a few steps forward. \"Show yourself!\" she commanded, but no one answered. A few moments silence passed. No. Wait. Was that... footsteps? Yes, she was certain now. They were coming closer, louder, faster... and they seemed to be coming from behind that creaky door. She turned to study the door, hand resting on the dusty old knob, and slowly swung it open. Before her lay a great expanse of darkness, an unknown void. She could see nothing. It was icy cold, too, and draughty. A few steps in and her candle was extinguished. She could see nothing. What to do now? Go back and try with another candle? Take a different route? Or go ahead?</span></div></div>",
