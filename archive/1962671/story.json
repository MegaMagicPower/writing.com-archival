            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just another day for you in the nut house. Most sane people would consider being in a hospital full of crazies to be a nightmare. Well, you have to deal with a hospital full of crazies who happen to be giant monsters. You were the only human in the Kaiju Disarming Plant, a mental hospital where the staff and patients were all as big as skyscrapers. What made matters even worse was that 22 of your fellow patients and 9 of the 12 orderlies were carnivorous human eating beasts. You sit holding your knees in the corner of your room, which is just a padded cage on the desk of the head of the K.D.P., a giant nine tailed fox by the name of Kaguya West.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head to see Dr. West busily typing at her computer as her nine tails move in the air. You hated being here, but you had no choice. You were a human girl from Kansas who was taken to this monster world by a strange tornado and had to live in Terrordale for three months trying to avoid getting smashed or eaten. Then one day while you were walking down the street looking for food, you passed a strange looking house and heard a strange noise as if somebody was running, but you never saw anyone. Mysteriously a ring fell from the sky next to you and you held it up, only for a golem to see you carrying the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out that ring was a family heirloom of a giantess nekomata that lived in the house you passed. Since you were holding the ring, the two tailed cat giantess assumed you were the thief and pressed charges. An invisible monster was the real thief and dropped the ring but there\u2019s no way you could\u2019ve proved it. You would\u2019ve done hard time in Under Gloom and knew you wouldn\u2019t last a day. You heard that Under Gloom was home to the worst criminal giantesses in the monster kingdom and that the guards were sadistic predators. So you decided to plead insanity. You thought you\u2019d be better off but the K.D.P. was just as scary as any prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you recall that horrible day you had to pretend to be insane in order to avoid going to prison, you let out a groan and hang down your head. Dr. West turns her head and looks at you. Since she doesn\u2019t know you were faking insanity, she gives you a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Sylvia,\u201d says Dr. West. \u201cBefore you know it, you\u2019ll be out of the K.D.P. and back on your feet.\u201d You inch back in your cell. Even though she meant well, that fox woman was still frightening at how big she was compared to you and she was keeping you in a cage. Just like you were a prisoner or a pet. You needed to get out of here or you\u2019d most likely end up in some monster chick\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you\u2019re trying to figure out how you\u2019re going to get out of this one, Dr. West gets up out of her seat. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back Sylvia,\u201d she says. \u201cGot to run to the lady\u2019s room real quick. Now don\u2019t hurt get into any trouble while I\u2019m gone.\u201d You let out a groan as Kaguya walks away and leaves her office via teleportation. That kitsune woman and her magical powers made her super scary. But then you gasp and walk to the side of your cage. \u201cDr. West\u2019s press-on nails,\u201d you say. \u201cI wonder.\u201d You pick up one of the bright pink nails and hold the tip up to the lock on your cage as you start to pick it. You hear a click and the door opens. \u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you\u2019re out of the cage, you slide down Dr. West\u2019s chair and then land on the ground panting heavily. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d you say. \u201cI don\u2019t care how as long as I don\u2019t end up someone\u2019s lunch.\u201d You look around the room and remember that Dr. West\u2019s office was a room of four walls that each had a door in the center that lead to one of the four hallways where they keep the monster patients. You honestly didn\u2019t want to risk running into a giant psychotic human eating monster chick, but the hallways were the only way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which path are you going to take?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You run under the door to the North to travel down Block A, shivering as you do so. You look ahead to see the rooms in the hallway and remember that there were five monsters that represented the elements of wood, water, fire, earth and air and one monster that didn\u2019t fit into any of the categories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of them was the only monster in the entire hospital to not be an adult. Her name was Kerry and she was a weredeer. She had anorexia and refused to eat anything no matter what. Her worried parents sent her to Dr. West to try and  get her appetite back. But Kerry is one patient you hope isn\u2019t cured anytime soon because if she gets her appetite back, she\u2019ll be eating humans again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second monster was a water element monster called Ranru, an enormous werefrog under the delusion that she\u2019s a ninja. It\u2019s hard to tell whether or not she\u2019s in her room or not given how fast she can move off the walls. You hated frogs and this one was so big that you were the fly. Her tongue was so fast that you could be outside one second and in her stomach the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonster number 3 in this  part of the K.D.P. was Cassandra, a werebat. You heard that Cassandra got into an accident at work that left her with a head injury that left her with the mentality of a 5-year old. Cassandra was now just like a child, a five hundred foot tall child. But that delusional bat was still dangerous. You could imagine her playing with you as if you were a doll and manhandling your entire body. Just the thought was horrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth A-Blocker was Mira, one of the six regular monsters to escape and be escorted back by Roxy and Stephen. For a big monster made of clay, she acted a lot like Chicken Little. She thought the sky was going to fall and strike her dead. In fact, she slept under her bed instead of on top like she should. She was intimidating, but you were less afraid of her then the other monsters because she didn\u2019t even eat humans. In fact, you don\u2019t know if she even needs to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the most psychopathic monster in A-Block, Phoebe, a harpy with the appearance and powers of a phoenix. You couldn\u2019t understand her because most of the time, instead of speaking, she laughed like a maniac. The woman loved to set fires and if something was flammable she\u2019d want her hands on it. You yourself were a pyrophobic and Phoebe\u2019s habit of setting humans on fire even made it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was one more A-Block monster you knew about named Onihime. Onihime was a Japanese ogress who was in a car accident. Her hippocampus (the part of the brain, not the monster species) was damaged and now she\u2019s incapable of remembering anything. Unfortunately she forgot that she and her husband were human friendly and since she saw that she was an ogre, she assumed she was a predator. Onihime\u2019s husband asked Dr. West to take a look at her after she tried to eat their human neighbors. It was definitely a bad idea to be anywhere near a hungry ogre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear loud footsteps and gasp. A guard was coming. From the demonic neigh you\u2019re filled with dread. It could only be one monster, Tress, that horrible shishi. Tress has been lusting for humans since her qilin girlfriend broke up with her and you just had to be a girl. Tress thinks you\u2019re her girlfriend now and shows it by keeping you in places you\u2019d rather avoid. One time you were stuck where the sun don\u2019t shine on her for three hours straight. But you\u2019d rather be anywhere on that Chinese lion horror than in her stomach because if you don\u2019t give in to her love, Tress is going to swallow you whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that statue was coming fast and you were scared to death. \u201cOh Sylvie! Sylvia! Where are you? Don\u2019t be shy, I know you broke out just to be with little old me.\u201d As she comes forward, Charlene shakes her monster sized hips and you\u2019re more terrified than ever. \u201cCome on out sweetie,\u201d says the living statue as she shakes her rear. \u201cI have your favorite hiding spot all warmed up. Oh Sylvia!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the six rooms with the six monster inmates waiting inside and gulp. It was risky going in with one of those psychos but you\u2019re scared to death of Tress. As that guardian lion horror comes forward, you duck under a door and into a room. But who are you stuck with?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her footsteps got further away until they completely vanished. You breathed a sigh of relief and began to head under the door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as fast as lightning, you were suddenly whisked away from the door to a nearby cornor of the room. Dizzy, you try to get your berings and look up to see what happened. That's when you saw who the room belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of you was a 550 foot tall, hourglass shaped werefrog with turquoise skin and darker blue spots. She had purple, bob-cut hair. She was wearing a tight, black ninja outfit with yellow highlights and a pink scarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right.

Still lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'RE IN MY CELL!\" Ranru yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" You say. Then you glup as you remember that Ranru eats humans. \"What exactly do you plan on doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could just tell Ranru was smirking under her mask. \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

Yes, I eat humans, but I see something special in you. I think you can carry on my legacy once I pass into the next realm.\" Ranru tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, that sounds nice and all, but I don't think the staff will like that.\" You say, trying to get out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then let's ask them.\" Ranru replied.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n20 minutes later, Whitney was in Ranru's cell and looking at her like she had just broken a metal chair with a toothpick. You were in Ranru's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let me see if I'm hearing you right,\" Whitney said, \"Sylvia broke out, got into your cell, and... you want her to be your apprentice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct. Is that alright?\" Ranru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise and fear, Whitney smiled. \"That's PERFECT. I don't see why she can't.

You hear that overgrown library ornament thunder past the door, and breath a sigh of relief. But that quickly turns to terror as you realize who's cell you're in. In the center of the room sat that giant five year old, Cassandra. It was only just now that you realized there were several giant children's toys scattered about them room. They had been provided by Dr. West to keep Cassandra occupied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra was currently brushing the hair of a doll she clutched in her hand, and didn't realize you were there. You couldn't go back outside, for fear of being caught, but then you noticed an open window with bars at the other end of the room. If you could just get to it, you could easily slip past the bars and you'd be home free! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem was getting the unnoticed. You make your way across the room, hiding behind the various toys scattered about the floor. When you're directly behind the giant bat, you accident press on the button of a teddy bear you were hiding behind, causing it to say \"I love you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra's ears perk up, and she looks behind her at the stuffed bear. \"Did you say something Mr. Fluff?\" She picks up the bear, and immediately notices you, smiling with delight. \"Oooh, a new toy!\" You try to run, but she quickly grabs you, holding you in her palm. You shake with fear. Now you were the plaything of a gigantic child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra looks from you to the doll in her other hand. \"What should we do with our new toy, Miss Josephine?\" She holds the doll up to her ear, as though it were whispering, and smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea!\" </span></div></div>",

She made you try out a few clothes, like knight suits, bunny suits, and many other suits. Each one of them was more mockery than the last, and it made you look like a fool to a child, but you are the plaything, so that is okay, until she eats you of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you ended up dressing like a princess just as her Miss Josephine toy plays around with Cassandra. \"So, what do you think of our new princess?\" she asked her, and then the doll (cannot speak) says \"Good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is great Miss Josephine, now it's time to set up the big wedding.\" said by Cassandra just as she brings out her castle and her play sets, and so far, you aren't even close to enjoying the experience at all.

She gets out her place sets, and then places you on top of the castle with the prince (your size on it). Cassandra then grabs you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah perfect.\" you muttered. \"So now... Prince Charming, do you... ah what the heck.\" Cassandra makes her prince start kissing on you aggressively, and overall your day is not going well at all.

Normally she was friendly with humans but a car accident messed up her memory. She doesn't remember liking humans and became predatory. She also forgets things almost as quick as she learns them due to short term memory loss. You want little to do with her but you can't just leave with Tress outside.

You dive out of the way to avoid her giant feet as she heads toward the door. Suddenly she stops and you hear her muttering to herself. \"What was I doing? Ah never mind.\" She then turns back around and almost crushes you again. This time she absentmindedly looks at the ground and spots you. \"A human!\" she says aloud, causing you to panic. You run away terrified as Onihime reaches for you.

You notice that when she said that she seemed a little confused. Maybe part of her still knows she used to be friendly with humans.

You then hear a chuckle from behind you. \"Heheheheheheh.\" You feel the ground shake from the harpy's approach as you take off running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the door is blocked you really don't know where to go. All you can hear is the booming stomps and laughter of Phoebe. Your first thought is to hide under the bed but you find that impossible. Her bed is just the mattress sitting on the floor, as she burned the bed frame to ashes. Turning in another direction you search for another way out. As you run a small fireball is thrown into your path. You scream and stumble backward . You fall onto you butt and then scramble to your feet and start running again. The result is the same though. Wherever you go you're met with flames in your path. Phoebe is just toying with you! The endless flames are made even more frightening by the laughter of the phoenix filling the room. Eventually you begin to get tired and stumble to the ground. You sit there and shiver in fear as the gigantic harpy walks over to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe picks you up and brings you up to her face. You can see the sadistic smile on her beak as she looks you over and laughs menacingly. You can't even speak as you stare into her eyes. Your attention is shifted to her hand as she lights a small flame on the tip of her finger. She chuckles and then.... </span></div></div>",

You tense up in fear when she points the flame right at you. The flame shoots at you and you let out a scream. You feel a warm sensation on your body and look down. Your clothes are burning! Phoebe set your clothes on fire! As you scream and struggle the insane harpy cackles at your panic. You feel embarrassed as the last of your clothes burn away and your naked body is exposed. You feel your eyes start to water, and know that you're about to cry. This is cut short however, as you feel another warm sensation. You smell smoke and look at your shoulder to find that your hair is catching fire! In a panic you frantically bat at the flames in an attempt to put them out. Thankfully only a little of your hair is burned before you put the fire out. All the while Phoebe is getting a kick out of your suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoebe holds you in her fingers you look to the other side of the room and see more flames popping up. Just as you wonder what could happen next the giant harpy tosses you across the room. You sail through the air, screaming as you head for the flames. With a thump you land in the middle of a ring of fire. Standing up you cover your exposed body and whimper. Phoebe begins to walk over, but in a stroke of luck the curtain on the window above you comes loose. It must have already been damaged in one of Phoebe's episodes. The fire proof curtain falls down and smothers the flames, giving you a chance of escape. Not wasting any time you take off running. The sudden disappearance of her fire catches Phoebe off guard and she tries to grab you in frustration, without using her flame powers. You dive out of the way as she lunges at you, causing her to crash face first into the wall. As you head for the door...</span></div></div>",

You peeked out to see who walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw that the guard was a gorgon, around 825 feet tall. She was looking at a clipboard. She had pythons for hair and has wearing sunglasses. Her body was covered in brown scales with a white diamond pattern. She was slim up top, but her butt was enormous, easily wider than she was tall. She was wearing a black bikini, clearly made to fit her. Her right arm was prosthetic, ending in a hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized her as Luz, a new guard from Venezuela. She only worked here a month, and was still trying to get to know everyone. She didn't like Tarja, since Tarja always mocked her and called her \"Medusass\". Sometimes, when not patrolling, you heard her in the break room, caressing and talking to her butt. You knew she didn't eat humans, but you were still afraid of her, since she might sit on you without knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Luz said in her Venezuelan accent, \"It's time for your check-up, Kerry. I hope you've been eating well. We don't want you to-.\" She looked up and saw she had walked into the wrong room. \"AH! NOT YOU!\" She cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remembered. When Luz started working here, she got into a fight with Phoebe, which ended with Phoebe burning off Luz's arm. Since then, Luz has been deathly afraid of Phoebe, to the point of trying to avoid her cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well,\" Phoebe said. \"We meet again, Luz. It's been a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, st-stay away fr-from me.\" Luz stammered, clearly terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? We have so much catching up to do.\" Phoebe said, advancinig towards Luz, who back into a wall. Phoebe lit a flame on her finger. \"Maybe I'll burn your other arm. Even you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I me-mean it. I'll ca-call Dr. Kaguya. You'll be so-sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Phoebe lit more flames, you looked and saw the open door.

Instinctivally, Phoebe covers her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luz, run.\" You yell while still falling. Luz grabs you and her sunglasses mid-fall and you both dart out of Phoebe's cell. Luz slams the door and locks it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much.\" Luz says, breathing heavily and replacing her sunglasses on her face. \"Hey, aren't you that human who pled insanity to get in here? What's your name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylvia.\" You reply. \"And I only did that because I wouldn't survive in Under Gloom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you\" Luz told you. \"I was originally going to work there, but I walked in, saw the inmates, and walked right out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's going on?\" You hear a voice yell from behind Luz. It was Whitney!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" You reply. \"Luz, please don't let Whitney-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can finish your sentance, Luz whips her hand to her back and sets you on one of her mountainous butt cheeks.

I managed to get my sunglasses off and distract her long enough to get out.\" You were surprised she didn't mention you. She must be covering for you. Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean your over your fear of her?\" Whitney said, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Zeus no.\" Luz replied. \"I'm still staying away from that psycho.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well we have a problem. That little pest Sylvia escaped. Have you seen her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The human? No I haven't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. Well, let me know if you find her.\" Whitney said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breath a sigh of relief. That was one problem dealt with. But, when you tried to climb back up, you realized you had another problem: you were wedged too tightly in between Luz's cheeks. You were stuck!

Looking up further, you see the rest of Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were wrong to think she was three tons. Because from the looks of it, she was even fatter then that. Her enormous ass was parked on a matress the size of a building. Her arms and legs were so thick you could barely see her hands and feet in their fat. Her breasts could rival Ayu in size. And her belly dominated her body, nearly filling up the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking over the massive breasts were Victoria's three heads. The center one had red eyes. The right head had green eyes. The left head had brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then remembered that each head had a complex. The center head had the superiority complex. The left head thought she was a god. And the left head thought she was inferior to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE SAID, WHO DARES SULLY OUR PRESENCE?!\" Victoria's voice rang again, coming from the center head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Sylvia, the human?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three heads look at you.

You breath heavily as you listen to Lilith's footsteps go past you're door, her having not seen you. You sigh in relief, then look up to see who's cell you've blundered into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person in front of you was on her bed, moping. The woman was a qilin, about 950 feet tall. She had short, naturally grey hair and grey eyes. Her body was covered in dull yellow scales. She had what looked like deer hooves for feet. She had an athletic body, but you saw that her breasts were truly massive. They even looked to be slightly larger then Ayu's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only barely knew this woman. You did know her name was M\u00e9ish\u00e9nme, but everyone called her Mei for simplicity sakes. You couldn't for the life of you remember why she was here, but you did know she didn't eat humans, so you decided to introduce yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello Mei.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei looked at you. \"Oh, you're the human. Why are you here?\" She asked in a soft Chinese accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hiding from Lilith. Don't want to get eaten.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei sighs. \"Why would she eat you? In fact, why do monsters eat humans at all? There's no point to it. They're just going to die one day anyway, so why waste their time with something so pointless?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reminded you why Mei was here. She was a complete nihilist. She felt that everything was pointless, and that things like life and death, beauty and ugliness, and good and evil had no meaning. She felt there wasn't a point to doing anything, since in her words, \"we'll all be dust and forgotten anyway\". Everyone called her a downer who sucked the fun and happiness out of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard she was this way due to her immortality, seeing people age and die and civilizations collapse and be forgotten. So she had given up on happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also heard she tried magic once, but accidentally gave herself an unbreakable curse that made her breasts never stop growing. After that, she never used magic again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how to respond to Mei's comment on eating humans. \"Well, she enjoys it. In fact, most monsters here enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then they're wasting their time.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed the back of your neck. Mei really was depressing. \"Hey, think you could help me get out of here?\" You decided to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? You won't win. No one really wins. The only person who wins in the end is the Reaper, so why bother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused. You REALLY had no idea how to respond to that. Before you could respond, you heard Lilith's footsteps. She was coming back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look. Lilith's coming back. Must want to check on me? Why bother? I'm not important. None of us are. in the end.\" Mei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't listening. Lilith was getting closer. You needed to do something and FAST! But what?</span></div></div>",

You then rub your eyes and continue to squint. \"By the way,\" says Whitney. \"I don't see a lot of wererhinos in this area. Heck, I thought I was the only one in Terrordale. What is your name?\" You gulp. You definitely couldn't tell Whitney that your name was Sylvia, the very name of her archenemy. Then you figure something out. \"My name is Gwendolyn.\" \"Gwendolyn?\" asked Whitney. \"That's a fancy name. Oh my gosh. You're still naked.\" Whitney reaches into her lab coat and takes out a purple bikini with daisy designs on it and hands it to you. \"Here,\" she says. \"It's lucky for you, I keep a spare bikini on me. And that we're both the same size.\" Whitney then adjusts her glasses and sees how tight the bikini bottom is on your ass. \"Although, your ass looks slightly bigger than mine. You best be getting out of here.\" \"Uh,\" you say. \"Thanks. I'll take that advice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Whitney turns her back, you run out of the K.D.P. and onto the beach, albeit tripping over a cooler in the process. You spit out some sand and get up as several buff male monsters, all of which are shorter than you, can't help but stare. One of them even whistled, causing you to blush as you walked away. You continue to squint as you walk along the sand. \"I guess it's not just Whitney,\" you say. \"I may be out of the K.D.P. but I can't see a thing. That's not surprising. Rhinos have very bad eyesight.\" Then you giggle to yourself. \"But I'm finally free. I'm out of the K.D.P. I made it. Ouch!\" You then bump into and trip over a blonde haired fairy who was dressed as a lifeguard. \"Watch where you going, you fat, stupid, pachyderm bitch!\" yells the fairy before flying off. \"Stella,\" you mumble. \"At least now I'm big and fat enough to squash her. But I have to do something about this eyesight problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then squint and see what looks like an ophthalmologist shop nearby and smile. You walk into the shop and then walk out with a pair of large purple horn-rimmed glasses. \"Well,\" you say. \"That was easy. Now, I need to find a job somewhere. Then maybe if I wait a year I can get enough cash to bail Wade out.\" At that moment, a newspaper blew and got stuck to one of your two horns. You take off the newspaper and see that it's a list of job listings. All of them looked interesting, but which one do you settle on?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ad in front of you was a help-wanted add for a restaurant called Neo Neapolitan. \u201cEmployees Wanted. We\u2019re currently understaffed. You can literally count the staff without the use of all 10 fingers. We\u2019ll pay you plus tip. Contact Patty, Salli, Pam or Dorothy.\u201d You run your rhinoceros chin and give a snort before you grunt, accidentally pricking yourself on one of your new horns. \u201cThis sounds promising. I\u2019ll just work at Neo Neapolitan for a year and I should have enough money to bail Wade out by then. Now, the address... 23 Harlequin Drive... Direopolis!?\u201d You give a grunt. You had no idea where Direopolis was. From the sounds of it, it was an entirely different town that was far away from Terrordale. How the heck were you going to get there? You let out a sigh. \u201cNothing is ever easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at Neo Neapolitan in Direopolis, the restaurant is currently closed and on top of a table in the center of the restaurant were three human brothers squabbling. The oldest was a tan-skinned brunette with a slight goatee wearing a pair of glasses who was dressed like a heavy metal fan. The middle brother was the shortest and was scrawny with long blond hair in an emo-like attire. The youngest brother was ironically the tallest and was beefy with the same light skin tone as the second brother but with a dirtier shade of blonde in his hair. He was dressed like a bodybuilder. From the looks of it, the oldest brother was upset with the youngest brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNorman, you\u2019re a half brain!\u201d yells the oldest brother. \u201cCut me some slack, Wes,\u201d says the youngest brother. \u201cI did what you asked and put an ad in the newspaper.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d says Wes, the oldest brother. \u201cYou did. In the Daily Tombstone! That newspaper doesn\u2019t even reach Direopolis, you chowderhead! Who would apply for a job that\u2019s miles away from their home city?!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s called outsourcing, four eyes!\u201d Wes lets out a groan as the middle brother decides to give his two cents into the situation. \u201cMaybe we should try a different approach and have an online application.\u201d Wes lets out a sigh. As there are three large tremors and three shadows are cast over the three brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadows belonged to three monster women who each stood 1350ft high. First was a strawberry pink-skinned werehippo woman, albeit bigger and fatter than Jedda or Cyprus. She had long golden red hair down to a butt wider than she was tall and a blue tattoo of a pyramid over her right eye. She wore a red tanktop and skin tight black shorts as well as Egyptian style earrings and a tongue piercing. The second monster girl was a vanilla white loxodon, a monster resembling an anthropomorphic elephant. In her case she resembled an Asian elephant with long black hair and a very large belly. She was dressed as a goth girl and was carrying an umbrella in her trunk. Surprisingly she had the fangs of a vampire and a second pair of fangs in her trunk. The third giantess was an obese hourglass-shaped chocolate brown-skinned wereboar with long blonde hair and six sharp tusks. She also had wings like Mandy except that hers were leather wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werehippo giantess lets out a sigh and then turns to the wereboar giantess. \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s the bigger chowderhead, Pam,\u201d she says. \u201cYour husband for screwing up a simple assignment or me for giving him the assignment in the first place.\u201d Pam, the boar giantess gives a snort. \u201cYou bite your pierced tongue, Patty. This could work.\u201d The loxodon woman lest out a sigh and then picks Allen up with her trunk. \u201cAllen, Dear,\u201d she says. \u201cI think maybe we should leave your brothers and their wives alone. They\u2019re having another of their disagreements.\u201d Allen nodded his head. \u201cWell, look on the bright side, Salli. At least nothing weird happened... yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in Terrordale. You are reduced to holding up a sign and hitchhiking while mumbling to yourself as you held up a sign that read \u201cDireopolis or Bust\u201d. \u201cWhat kind of idiot would post a help wanted ad in a different town as the place where the job is supposed to be? It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d You keep muttering to yourself before somebody finally pulls over and you look in surprise. In the driver and passenger seat of the car was a mother daughter pair of wererhinos just like what you had been transformed into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they both resembled extinct rhino species and both looked Hawaiian. Though both were also quite obese. The mother was a 1300ft tall brown-skinned rhinoceros woman resembling an indricotherium, a prehistoric rhinoceros without a horn. She wore a tiger print sari and tanktop with a tattoo of Hawaii on her back. She was also completely bald in contrast to her daughter who had long raven hair. Speaking of the daughter, she was a 1240ft high teenager who had pinkish gray skin and resembed an elasmotherium, a rhinoceros with an enormous horn in the center of her face. She had a floral print sari and tanktop and wildflowers in her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAloha, stranger,\u201d says the mother rhinoceros. \u201cDidn\u2019t think we\u2019d see a fellow wererhino on our way home.\u201d You give a snort. \u201cYou\u2019re both from Direopolis.\u201d The daughter nods her head. \u201cWe were just in town for a wedding in the family. Come on in, we\u2019ll take you to Direopolis.\u201d You were very wary. These women were wererhinos like Whitney. Then again, now you were a wererhino as well. You give a smile and get in the back seat before the mother rhino begins to drive off. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, cousin?\u201d asks the daughter rhino. \u201cGwendolyn,\u201d you say giving the same lie you gave Whitney. \u201cJust Gwendolyn.\u201d The daughter rhino smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Elisabeth Makao and this is my mom, Isabella. My dad, Kaikane is asleep right now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around but don\u2019t see anyone else. \u201cYour dad?\u201d you ask. You hear snoring and then you see a purse by the side of Isabella and inside it is a Hawaiian human man taking a snooze. You give a blink. \u201cI guess Whitney\u2019s not the only wererhino with a human mate.\u201d But then you realize something. \u201cWait, that means...\u201d You look at Elisabeth in shock. That would technically make the teenage wererhino half human. You didn\u2019t even know monsters could interbreed with humans. Of course, you knew Whitney didn\u2019t have any kids but you remember hearing somebody say Whitney didn\u2019t even want kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh,\u201d you say to Isabella. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be wearing glasses as you drive.\u201d Isabella bursts into laughter and you\u2019re confused. \u201cBut I thought wererhinos...\u201d Elisabeth then reaches and takes out a contact lens from her left eye before cleaning it. \u201cWell duh. Everyone knows that Wererhinos have the worst eyesight of all monsters. But Mom and I prefer contact lenses. So, why do you want to go to Direopolis in the first place?\" You bite your lip. You could tell them you needed the money but you definitely couldn't tell them it was to bail Wade out of prison, so you give a cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to get a job at a restaurant. Neo Neapolitan I think.\" \"Oh!\" yells Elisabeth. \"Good for you. That place has the best donuts. Me and my BFF, Beatrix go there all the time.\" \"A donut shop?\" you ask. \"Why would a donut shop need a waitress or a delivery girl?\" Isabella stops at a red light before speaking. \"It's not just a donut shop,\" she says. \"It deals in donuts, burgers, pancakes, sundaes, pizzas and panini.\" You drop your jaw. \"What? You're kidding me. What kind of menu is that?\" Elisabeth let out a giggle. \"The three main proprietresses that run the place couldn't decide what to sell.\" \"Uh-huh. It says I'm supposed to look for Salli, Patty, Pam and Dorothy. What kind of monsters are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light changes before Isabelle drives again. \"Well, Patty is the cook and the leader. She's a big Fiery Redhead of a werehippo.\" You give a gulp. \"Werehippo?\" you think. \"I hope she's not like the behemoth and bahamut back at the KDP. Hippos and I don't mix.\" \"As for Salli,\" says Elisabeth. \"She's the head waitress. She's an odd mix. Her dad's a vampire but her mom's a loxodon.\" You gasp again. \"A vampire elephant?\" you think. \"Her poor dad.\" \"Pam,\" says Isabella. \"Is the delivery girl/village idiot. She's a wereboar who was born with wings.\" \"Great,\" you think. \"Another flying pig. I hope she's not as obnoxious as Mandy.\" \"And most recently,\" says Elisabeth. \"They obtained a fourth partner named Dorothy. She's a manticore. It was her idea to add panini to the menu.\" You were now beginning to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I made a big mistake.\" You think to yourself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Isabella continues to drive down the highway, there\u2019s a blinking noise and you look to see that the car is running low on gas. \u201cOh scrud!\u201d groans Isabella. \u201cI knew I should\u2019ve refueled before we left the hotel.\u201d Elisabeth takes out her phone and then uses it to search for nearby gas stations before nodding her head. \u201cThere\u2019s a station at the next exit, Mom.\u201d Isabella pulls over into the gas station and then gets out of the car. The car pulling over woke her husband, Kaikane. \u201cHuh?\u201d asks the Hawaiian man as he stands up. \u201cAre we in Direopolis already?\u201d Kaikane looks up at you and Elisabeth and you look down at him in surprise. You knew he was human, but he looked like an ant at your size. Being a giant wererhino was going to take some serious getting used to. Of course, Kaikane seems more concerned with the fact that there was another wererhino in the car besides his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElisabeth?\u201d asks Kaikane. \u201cWho is this strange wererhino?\u201d Elisabeth picks up her tiny father and places him on her shoulder as you look down in surprise at him. \u201cDad,\u201d says Elisabeth. \u201cThis is Gwendolyn. She\u2019s applying for a job at Neo Neapolitan and Mom decided to give her a ride.\u201d Kaikane seems really concerned and it concerns you. \u201cYou mean you picked up a hitchhiker? How do you know she\u2019s on the level. After all, for all you two know, she could be a human eater.\u201d You bit your lips. How could he say that about you? Sure, he had no way of knowing you were a human turned into a wererhinoceros but... then again, the only wererhino you knew was Whitney and she didn\u2019t eat meat period. Just because one wererhino you knew was a vegetarian, doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re all vegetarians. You bit your lip before Elisabeth lets out a scoff. \u201cCome on, Dad. Just look at her. She has a face you can trust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re desperate to change the subject and clear your throat. \u201cYou don\u2019t see too many human/monster married couples around, Mr. Makoa. How did you and Isabella meet?\u201d \u201cShe nearly swallowed me with a handful of coconut trees.\u201d Your face turns a paler shade of white upon hearing that. Elisabeth let out a laugh. \u201cYeah, but he was able to avoid being eaten by grabbing onto her gums. By the time she realized he was in there, it took a lot of sweet talking to convince her not to devour him. It worked a little better than he expected. Ow!\u201d Kaikane twists his daughter\u2019s ear to get her to shut up. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me, Mr. Makoa,\u201d you say. \u201cI\u2019d never even think of eating a human. I just need this job and I appreciate your wife going out of her way to...\u201d Mr. Makoa waves his hand to stop you right there. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. After all, you didn\u2019t eat me in my sleep. But I have to warn you, Neo Neapolitan is in the middle of a rather crazy town. The townsfolk are all eccentric bordering on insane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to sweat. \u201cThey are?\u201d you think. \u201cOh no. I\u2019m heading to a village-sized KDP.\u201d You grunt before speaking. \u201cWhat about the staff of the KDP?\u201d Kaikane has to hold back the urge to laugh. \u201cAre you kidding me? They\u2019re two sets of stooges. Patty, Salli and Pam are always getting themselves into numbskull situations and their husbands aren\u2019t any better.\u201d \u201cHusbands?\u201d you ask. \u201cElisabeth didn\u2019t say they were married.\u201d \u201c Patty, Salli and Pam\u2019s husbands are brothers,\u201d said Elisabeth. \u201cAll three of them are humans. Patty\u2019s married to the oldest of the brothers, Wes. Opposites attract. She\u2019s got a fiery temper and he\u2019s got a sharp tongue. Salli\u2019s husband is named Allen. He\u2019s the most timid thing you\u2019ll ever see. Always hiding in his wife\u2019s elephant ears.\u201d Elisabeth laughs at that before you blink. \u201cAnd Pam\u2019s husband?\u201d \u201cHis name is Norman and he the youngest. Not to mention the biggest blockhead you\u2019ll ever meet. He and Pam are perfect for each other.\u201d You blink and bite your lip. \u201cI see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a groan. \u201cAre the customers any better?\u201d \u201cIf anything,\u201d says Kaikane. \u201cThey\u2019re crazier. First is Elisabeth\u2019s best friend, Beatrix. She\u2019s a basilisk who comes from a family of automechanics. She practically eats nothing but mangos. And I\u2019ve met her father. He\u2019s one of those people who is sick of the world after one too many bad days. Another of Elisabeth\u2019s classmates who goes there is a jersey devil named Scarlett.\u201d \u201cJersey Devil?\u201d you ask. You wonder if she\u2019s anything like Charlene. \u201cYeah,\u201d says Elisabeth. \u201cBut don\u2019t stand upwind of Scarlett. All she ever eats is garlic.\u201d \u201cYuck.\u201d \u201cThen there\u2019s that hyperactive dancing Nue she hangs out with,\u201d says Kaikane. \u201cWhat was her name? Mariana?\u201d \u201cJuliana, Dad,\u201d says Elisabeth. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s Perry Hart. That otaku peryton.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s a peryton?\u201d you ask. \u201cIt\u2019s a monster that\u2019s a hybrid of a deer and a bird.\u201d You begin to hope that this peryton isn\u2019t like Kerry. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t happen to eat humans would she.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d says Elisabeth. \u201cBut she\u2019s way stronger than she looks. She can lift a werehippo and a loxodon with just one hand. But let\u2019s not forget about Akira Oda, the Japanese dragon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your head. \u201cI know European dragons eat humans and Chinese dragons are benevolent,\u201d you think. \u201cBut do Japanese dragons eat humans?\u201d \u201cAkira and her mom run a hair salon together,\u201d says Kaikane. \u201cBut we have no idea what her mom looks like.\u201d \u201cBut isn\u2019t she a Japanese dragon like her daughter?\u201d \u201cHer husband is, but Mrs. Oda, nobody has ever seen her. The only thing that we know for sure is that she\u2019s at least 3 times bigger and fatter than her daughter.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t her husband tell you?\u201d \u201cHer husband is blind.\u201d You raise an eyebrow. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d you think to yourself. \u201cThis sounds like a town made of weirdos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t get me started on the adults,\u201d says Elisabeth. \u201cThe Howler-Grunewalds for starters. Crescent Howler is an artist who builds life-sized sandcastles for a wedding.\u201d \u201cHowler? Would she happen to have a relative named Diana?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Gwendolyn. It\u2019s possible. She comes from a very big family. Of course, her wife, Trini is the real crazy in the family. She\u2019s a sabertooth tiger...\u201d \u201cSabertooth? I thought those were extinct.\u201d \u201cWell Trini is lively as ever. She\u2019s a mad scientist who\u2019s always building some crazy contraption.\u201d You begin to sweat. \u201cOn the opposite side of the spectrum is Una Pride, the Nemean lioness witch doctor.\u201d \u201cA witch doctor and mad scientist in the same town?\u201d you ask in concern. \"Are the rest of the town as colorful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know the half of it,\" says Kaikane. \"There's this mountain ranger named Delphine Dare, a weredolphin. She is so utterly incompetent, that I don't know how she hasn't gotten fired by now. There's also a Loch Ness fisherwoman named Lapis. She has no boyfriend so she spends her whole day sitting on her enormous and still growing rump as it grows numb waiting for fish. She doesn't realize how obese she is because she's lost all feeling in her ass.\" \"Don't forget about Ms. Vile, Dad.\" \"Ms. Vile?\" you ask in surprise. \"Gardenia Vile,\" says Elisabeth. \"She's an elderly werecheetah who really knows how to put away burgers. Of course, Pam, Delphine and Dad think that she's a retired thief.\" \"It's possible.\" Mutters Kaikane. \"Then,\" says Elisabeth. \"There's Mia, NN's personal Ms. Fixit. That cyborg wereleopard spends so much time fixing crap around the place, they oughta hire her full time. Oh, don't forget Esther Tortuga.\" \"The newscaster?\" you ask. \"Oh yeah,\" says Kaikane. \"She comes in everyday at noon for pizza. Her tastebuds must be dead because she'll eat pretty much anything.\" \"Oh,\" groaned Elisabeth. \"Don't forget about that crazy \u201csuper-villain\u201d, Deathina.\u201d \u201cSupervillain!?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Her real name is Mallory and she\u2019s pretty much too stupid to do any real damage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Isabella finishes refueling and gets in the car. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about crazy customers, you can start with that crazy teacher of yours. Ms. Ringmoore. That crazy flamingo harpy dresses like a luchadore, but I know I can take her. I\u2019m a boxer you know.\u201d Isabella blows on her fist before driving away. \u201cAlso, I\u2019d be on the lookout for Deneb.\u201d \u201cDeneb?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a so-called superhero who goes out looking for crime to smash. Has to look extra hard since there\u2019s not a lot of it in the mountains. Then there's Ethiopia who wants to combine basketball and sumo.\" You were really starting to regret this decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" says Kaikane. \"But don't forget the three most important customers.\" \"Important?\" you ask. \"You mean big names like Neo's cuisine.\" \"Three in particular,\" says Elisabeth. \"You ever heard of Corona Poe?\" You've heard of her alright. She was a minotaur movie star. Sometimes, Dr. West played her movies for the patients. What would she have to do with Neo Neapolitan. \"Corona is Wes, Allen and Norman's sister.\" Says Isabella. You're confused. \"But she's a minotaur.\" \"Step-sister.\" \"Oh. That makes more sense. And the other two?\" \"You heard of the Rainbow Tongue hotel chain?\" asks Elisabeth. \"Claire Melon, the CEO is a regular customer at Neo Neapolitan. But boy is she a stress fiend. She drinks <i>way</i> too much caffeine.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t forget,\u201d said Kaikane. \u201cShe likes to snatch humans up with that chameleon tongue of hers.\u201d You gulp, being really glad that you were transformed into a wererhino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the last one?\u201d you ask. Isabella smiles. \u201cDid you know that Vienna is an old friend of Patty\u2019s.\u201d \u201cThe jazz singer?\u201d you ask in surprise. \u201cOh my gosh. It sounds like Neo Neapolitan attracts all sorts of customers. Exactly what am I in for?\" You were now starting to regret your decision more and more.</span></div></div>",

But didn't you say that Claire Melon ATE humans? Wouldn't she get arrested for that?\" You try to hide your worry. If that lizard woman just had to pay a fine or something for eating a human, this town may not be as safe as you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth chuckles, slapping her forehead. \"Oh! Right; I forgot to mention she only eats humans <i>when she's out of town</i>. Within the city limits, she wouldn't even think about it. I've heard she even lets humans work at her hotel there...<i>if</i> they're okay with the risks of getting accidentally stepped or sat on, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella laughs from the driver's seat. \"Or <i>not</i> so accidentally, like that poor busboy who came to clean our room when your father and I stayed there for our honeymoon. He was quite the rude little punk, and I put him in his place. Right, dear?\" She asked Kaikane. <br>\r\nHer husband nodded with a smug grin. \"Pretty stupid of him to call that blue bikini you loved so much ugly. You gave him a closer look right quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth facepalms as her parents laugh. \"UGH! Will you guys <i>ever</i> stop telling that story? It was years ago!\" She huffs and turns back to you. \"Anyway...yeah, Miss Melon doesn't eat humans in Direopolis; like ever. Even when she's out of town, I've heard she has...standards for eating them. Her biggest is 'No Kids, Ever'. But I think she'll let adults go, if they can pay her off. Sorta like what Mom did, before she married Dad. Now Mom's quit eating humans completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best decision I ever made,\" Isabella adds with a firm nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. All the human-eating monsters at the KDP gulped down humans like candy, without conscience. A monster sparing humans outright, or just being persueded to let prey go....you'd never imagined that. \"...Huh. I guess that's not so bad. I mean, if kids are...off the menu--\" You shudder at the phrase; \"--then she's not as...sadistic as other monsters I've known. Er, no offense.\" You add the last part hastily, remembering Isabella's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken, sweetie.\" Isabella assures you with a rather comforting laugh. \"Well, anyway, we're almost there....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before you're dropped off in front of Neo Neapolitan itself, the Makoas giving you their address so you'll have a place to crash before they drive off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant itself looks like.....well, like someone sliced five different buildings into pieces, then took one piece from each and fitted them together. Neon lighting right out of the 1950s abruptly stops against Italian stucco; a sign advertising a new ice cream flavor (Raspberry-Vanilla Swirl!) juts out from between two posters for various burgers...and wedged in below them, a cartoon of a human cop chowing down on a box of doughnuts. This place might as well have had <i>Hey! This Place Is Weird As Hell!</i> written on everything in bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill...this was your first lead on a new job, and you wouldn't be turning back into a human any time soon...<br>\r\nYou steel yourself and head inside---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for the door to open at the last moment, revealing a monster woman whom you walk right into, staggering you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>But which of Direopolis' residents did you (literally) bump into?</u><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look up and are in pure surprise at the giantess you had bumped into. She was a rather obese and voluptuous minotaur woman with copper brown fur and long black hair. She looked like a cross between a buffalo and a Native American woman and had an udder that was three times as big as her head. For clothing she was wearing a yellow jacket, black T-shirt, blue jeans and a pair of round glasses. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d says the cow giantess. \u201cAre you alright?!\u201d As you realize who is it you bump into, you\u2019re struck with surprise and awe as your eyes go wide behind your glasses. This was no ordinary woman. This was the actress, Corona Poe. After seeing her from Dr. West\u2019s movies, you could not believe you were in her presence. Even though she was still a very young adult, she had been in a good number of films that did well throughout the monster world. You could not believe there was such a famous monster in front of you and you step back as Corona looks at you in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Y-You. You\u2019re Corona Poe! Oh my gosh!\u201d You laugh nervously. \u201cFrom the sounds of it,\u201d says Corona. \u201cYou\u2019re not from around here.\u201d You have to catch your breath before you speak again with the buffalo giantess. \u201cI-I\u2019m a huge fan! I mean, you were awesome in Nuclear Winter! Your best role so far!\u201d You begin to look around for anything and see that you only have the bikini and glasses you\u2019re wearing. \u201cDamn!\u201d you yell. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to autograph.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d says Corona. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m in town for a week visiting my brothers and their two wives.\u201d You give a blink. Two? But she has three brothers and they\u2019re all married. \u201cOh,\u201d you say. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ll wait until I get my apron and you can sign that.\u201d \u201cApron? Oh... oh! You must be here to apply for the waitress job. Since I\u2019ve never seen you around Direopolis, you must be from out of town. Figures. That moron must\u2019ve put the ad in the wrong newspaper. Guess I\u2019ll be seeing more of you Ms...\u201d \u201cSyl... er, Gwendolyn. Just Gwendolyn.\u201d You give a sigh. You almost gave Corona your real name. No need to fangirl out when it\u2019ll blow your cover. But wait, you\u2019ve never been here before. What do you have to worry about. Well, better not take chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Corona as she puts away her glasses and puts in her contact lenses. \u201cMy brothers and their wives stepped out for a bit. They just asked me to wait here in case any applicants showed up.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s another thing I wanted to ask. You\u2019re a minotaur and yet you have three human brothers.\u201d Corona gives a laugh. \u201cWell, my mom married their dad when I was a kid. She was actually his second marriage. I heard the first one didn\u2019t end well.\u201d \u201cAnd you had no trouble getting used to a human father.\u201d Corona let out a sigh. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard. I never met my real father. I\u2019m actually older than my brothers.\u201d \u201cHow well do you get along?\u201d Corona let out a scoff. \u201cAre you kidding me. We\u2019re very close. In fact, I\u2019m the reason they met their wives. They attended the same high school as I did.\u201d You gasp. \u201cHumans in a school for monsters?\u201d \u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to worry about Wes, Allen or Norman. They\u2019re harder to kill than crabgrass on steroids. Ever heard of Achilles?\u201d \u201cThe Greek hero? The one who was invulnerable except for his heel. What about it?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d says Corona as she sits down in two chairs at once and then starts to fasten her hair into a ponytail. \u201cMy bros are descendants of Achilles. They\u2019ve been swallowed, sat on and stepped on so many times, it\u2019s only a minor annoyance. That allowed me to get some immediate payback on Allen and Norman when I caught them reading my diary all those years ago.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorona gave a laugh before speaking again. \u201cAnyhow, their wives have been friends since they were kids. Hence Wes and Allen met two amazing girls.\u201d \u201cWhat about Norman.\u201d Corona gives a grimace and twitches her eye. \u201cWell,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s just say Wes got the brains, Allen got the looks and Norman got what was left. Hence he got saddled with that no account... pig.\u201d Corona said the word \u201cPig\u201d as if she was having a stroke as she said it. \u201cAnd you know what they say about stupid people and smart people. Smart people wait. Norman and Pam were the first to get married. Then a year later, Wes proposed to Patty and the rest was history. Allen took his time before he married Salli.\u201d You figure that you might as well try to know more about your would-be employers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what are your sister-in-laws like.\u201d Corona let out a sigh and smiled. \u201cPatty\u2019s in charge of cooking. She\u2019s the brains of the trio. She\u2019s a decent enough person and very beautiful. But she also has a bit of a temper and a low tolerance for stupidity. Of course, Wes has always been a smart aleck so opposites attract I guess.\u201d You give a gulp. \u201cI\u2019ll stay on her good side.\u201d \u201cSalli,\u201d says Corona. \u201cShe\u2019s the sweetest one. Very perky and bubbly. She\u2019s the perfect girl for cowardly little Allen. She\u2019s head waitress, so she\u2019ll be your supervisor.\u201d You nod your head. \u201cAnd Pam.\u201d Corona gives a snort and glares. \u201cPam is a feeble-minded porker who\u2019s always getting my brothers in trouble.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s kind of harsh, Corona.\u201d Corona let out a sigh. \u201cI probably should be nicer to her, but I had a VERY bad experience with a wereboar a long time ago and they\u2019re not what you\u2019d call my favorite species of monster.\u201d \u201cI see.\u201d you say nervously. You were beginning to wonder if you made the right idea when you heard somebody come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou chucklehead!\u201d yells a deep female voice. \u201cHow stupid can you get!? How stupid can you get!?\u201d \u201cCut me some slack, Patty,\u201d says a scratchy yet girly sounding voice. \u201cHe was low on cash so he paid for the pizza with magic beans to take us to the land of the giants.\u201d \u201cPam,\u201d says Patty. \u201cWE\u2019RE the giants! Everybody knows those beans only grow as high as an ogre\u2019s chin. I can\u2019t believe even you were that gullible.\u201d \u201cCome on, Patty,\u201d says a bubbly sounding goth girl\u2019s voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not Pam\u2019s fault she\u2019s stupid.\u201d You turn your head and see Pam, Patty and Salli arguing, their husbands on their shoulders. All three monster women were two heads taller than you and you sweat as you watch them arguing. \u201cWe put a want ad for more waitresses,\u201d says Wes with a groan. \u201cBut from the sounds of it, we need a new courier.\u201d \u201cPatty\u2019s gonna need a new husband if you don\u2019t shut up, Wes.\u201d Says Norman as he holds up his fist. You give a blink. \u201cThat\u2019s the youngest brother?! He\u2019s built like a wrestler.\u201d \u201cNorman,\u201d says Patty. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t harm Wes if you tried.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it don\u2019t feel good to try.\u201d \u201cCould you guys stop fighting for once?\u201d complains Allen. You bite your lips. \u201cGreat,\u201d you mutter. \u201cI just applied for a job working for the Three Stooges.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorona then stomps her hoof on the ground to get the girls\u2019 attention and then points to you. Patty, Salli and Pam come forward and you are very intimidated. Not only were these girls much bigger than you even when you were a giant monster yourself now, they were very fat and were somewhat frightening with Patty\u2019s sharp hippo tusks, Salli\u2019s two sets of fangs, the other in her nose that looked like it was stained with blood and Pam\u2019s sharp tusks and leather wings that looked unnatural on a wereboar. \u201cH-Hi,\u201d you say nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Sly-er... I\u2019m Gwendolyn. I\u2019m... I\u2019m here for the... waitress position.\u201d The trio and their husbands all look in surprise before blinking. \u201cWell I\u2019ll be,\u201d says Wes. \u201cSomebody actually went all the way to Direopolis for the position.\u201d Allen fell back into Salli\u2019s breasts as the loxodon vampire trumpeted. Patty bent over to get a good look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any experience in the kitchen?\" \"Uh... yeah.\" Patty gave a snort. \"You have to be prepared for anything in this town. I must warn you. This is the monster world's weirdest town. The lunch rush begins in 15 minutes. Can you handle it.\" You look the enormous werehippo woman in the eye and shiver. \"Yes!\" you yell. \"Yes! I can do that!\" Patty rubs her double chin and then she takes out an apron that is split into the colors pink, white and brown. \"Are you <i>really</i> ready to do this?\" You think about it. You don't even know how much this job pays. But still, if you could survive without going legitimately insane, you'll be able to bail Wade out after a year or so. He'll just have to get used to you being a rhinoceros for the rest of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head. \"I'm ready.\" Patty nods her head and tosses you the apron before turning to Salli. \"Salli,\" she says. \"Starting today, you're her boss.\" Salli trumpets and nods her head. You then give a gulp and turn to Corona smiling at you and giving you a thumbs up. \"Oh good grief,\" you say. \"What did I get into?\" Salli then trumpets to you. \"Don't worry,\" she says. \"Me and Allen will show you the ropes.\" You just give a nervous laugh as Salli smiles at you with her vampire teeth unnatural for an elephant-based monster.</span></div></div>",

You look down and see that the customer that came in was a 785ft tall werecheetah who looked elderly. Her yellow fur had taken a more grayish hue that she almost looked white. Her hair was white with black spots. Her face didn\u2019t look too bad, except for a few wrinkles and as for her body, it looked surprisingly young and from the looks of it, she was rather fat with an enormous belly that entered the room a full 30 seconds before she did. She was wearing a gray unitard and red leg warmers that made her look like a Thundercat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, girls,\u201d says the cheetah giantess. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you hired a new waitress.\u201d You take a closer look at the woman who just came in and you recognize her from what the Makoas said about her. This must\u2019ve been Gardenia Vile, the alleged Black Spot. She sure didn\u2019t look like a cat burglar to you. Heck, she just looked like a cat to you. She also looked slightly tired. \u201cRight this way, ma\u2019am.\u201d You say as you lead the elderly giantess to her seat. You find it hard to believe that this sweet-looking old lady could possibly be an ex-thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Syl... er Gwendolyn and I\u2019ll be your waitress today, Ms. Vile.\u201d Gardenia smiles and then lets out a yawn, giving you a view of her fangs. From the looks of it, they\u2019re real teeth meaning that she doesn\u2019t wear dentures. \u201cJust bring me a seafood lover\u2019s pizza and three Grape sodas.\u201d You give a look of surprise. \u201cThree sodas?\u201d Gardenia nods her head and yawns. \u201cI need something to wake myself up. I didn\u2019t sleep well last night.\u201d You write down Gardenia\u2019s order and walk into the kitchen to find Patty already busy cooking burgers. You\u2019re confused but then you realize the only other customer out there was Corona so she must\u2019ve ordered. You give a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that Corona\u2019s order?\u201d you ask. \u201cOf course it is,\u201d says Wes. \u201cBurgers are Corona\u2019s favorite food.\u201d Your face turns paler than it already was. \u201cBut... but... isn\u2019t it cannibalism for minotaur to eat hamburgers?\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t stop grootslangs from preying on elephants.\u201d Says Wes. You hand Patty Gardenia\u2019s order and she heads off and picks up some pizza dough before you bend down to speak with Wes. \u201cThe Makoa\u2019s told me about your customers, Mr. Round,\u201d you say. \u201cDidn\u2019t she say that Gardenia was a thief.\u201d Wes lets out a sigh. \u201cYou think she\u2019s Black Spot? That makes three of us. Pam and I think that she\u2019s Black Spot but we\u2019re not 100% sure. Nobody got a good look at Black Spot. All they knew for sure was that she was that she was some kind of feline. It happened 100 years ago though. A lot can happen in 100 years. Gardenia may be Black Spot but we don\u2019t know. Besides, even if she was, there\u2019s nothing anyone can do.\u201d \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d you ask. Wes gives a scoff. \u201cThere\u2019s such a thing called statute of limitations. Everything that Black Spot stole that wasn\u2019t recovered was stolen 100 years ago. There\u2019s no way the authorities would still be after her then, even if she was still alive and active.\u201d Patty gives a scoff. \u201cGardenia is no thief,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve known her for years. Gwendolyn, don\u2019t worry about it. There\u2019s a very low crime rate in Direopolis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head and soon you deliver the pizza and sodas to Gardenia who pays you with a generous tip. You look in surprise because she gave you a strange necklace of some kind with her tip. \u201cUh,\u201d you say. \u201cThanks.\u201d Gardenia uses one of her claws to cut herself a slice of pizza. before speaking. \u201cDon\u2019t mention it. It was just something that was laying around the house and I wanted to get rid of it. It\u2019s not really my style.\u201d You nod your head and take the money back to put in the register. Both Salli and Corona hold their thumbs up at you and you smile. But as you put away the money and place your tip in your pocket, you look closer at the necklace that Gardenia gave you. It looks ancient and from the looks of it, it had a piece of amber in the shape of an eye in the center. You shrug your shoulders and put it on. \u201cI don\u2019t know about this,\u201d you think to yourself. \u201cFor all I know, this necklace could be stolen. Then again, there\u2019s that statute of limitations thing. I think it should be harmless.\u201d You then hear the door open and look out to see another customer just entered. From the look of it, she was a yellow-green colored monster resembling a humanoid wildebeest with long shaggy hair that obscured her eyes. She was carrying a Japanese human young man on her shoulder and was wearing a strange outfit. She was wearing a basketball tanktop along with a mawashi and was bouncing a basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEthiopia!\u201d yells Patty. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you not to bounce that ball in here?\u201d Ethiopia gives a scoff. \u201cYou think that I want to damage your property, Patty? Mia charges an arm and a leg.\u201d \u201cWhat do you expect?\u201d asks Pam. \u201cShe only has one good arm.\u201d You take it that this was Ethiopia Gnu, the nut who was trying to invent a sport that combined basketball and sumo. That human she came in with must\u2019ve been her husband. You figured that you had to take her order but as you\u2019re exiting the kitchen, Patty is busy fixing a banana split for another customer and tosses one of the bananas to the side. Unfortunately, the trash can is closed and you wind up slipping on the banana peel, breaking off the door in the process as you bump into Salli who is carrying a plate of chili fries and a strawberry shake. Salli grunts and Allen hides in his wife\u2019s ear as you inadvertently spill the fries and drink all over Ethiopia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as does Ethiopia\u2019s human husband. Ethiopia shakes the food off and you see that she\u2019s wearing goggles under her hair. Makes sense since like gorgons, catoblepi had a petrifying gaze. From the looks of it, Ethiopia is not happy and gives a snort. Corona gets up and runs up to defend you. Salli steps between you and Ethiopia. \u201cPlease, Ethiopia,\u201d says Salli. \u201cGwendolyn is new to the job. It was an accident. Anyone can make a mistake.\u201d Ethiopia gives a look of anger but then smirks. \u201cWell,\u201d says Ethiopia. \u201cIt\u2019s time that this rhino girl earned her keep. Something tells me that right now, she\u2019s about to score big.\u201d You give a gulp as Patty comes out. \u201cWhat\u2019s all the commotion?\u201d asks the hippo giantess. Patty then sees that there\u2019s a crowd outside looking in on Ethiopia looking at you with a confident grin and you looking nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s about to be a spectacle here, Patty,\u201d says Ethiopia. \u201cYou might want to get the arena set because your new employee just challenged me to a...\u201d</span></div></div>",

She was very obese with a prominent gray-striped hunched back and a massive rear that looked like it could take an entire booth and made her curled tail look undersized in comparison. From the looks of it, she had brownish red hair worn in a long bob cut and was wearing a tan suit with a skirt like the kind a businesswoman would wear, one that was currently stained with hot caffeine. She\u2019s 875ft high, which makes her slightly shorter than your current height transformed into a wererhinoceros. You gasp and step back, realizing that this must\u2019ve been Claire Melon, the hotel tycooness that the Makoas told you about. And you just literally bumped into her and from the looks of it, made her spill her coffee.

Now I have to add \u201cChange clothes\u201d and \u201cDo laundry\u201d to today\u2019s list.\u201d You look in confusion before Claire writes down some notes on her phone while at the same time using a few napkins to wipe off her dress. Then she places her phone into her purse and grumbles to herself before she takes out what appears to be a second outfit wrapped in a plastic bag. You then follow her as she makes her way to Neo Neopolitan\u2019s ladies\u2019 room and then she turns around and spots you. \u201cDo you mind!?\u201d she yells in an indignant tone.\u201d You crack a nervous look. \u201cSorry.\u201d You say. Claire tries to open the door but it won\u2019t budge. \u201cAre you kidding me!? What possessed those idiots to lock the bathroom while they stepped out?!\u201d Then the chameleon giantess lets out a sigh. \u201cI really hate to do this.\u201d She complains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, you see Claire turn completely invisible. \u201cWell,\u201d you think. \u201cThat\u2019s... understandable. She IS a chameleon after all.\u201d However, Claire\u2019s clothes didn\u2019t turn invisible with her and she unbuttons her coffee stained suit and hands it to you. From the looks of it, underneath the suit she was wearing a Jurassic Park bikini. Somewhat appropriate given that even though she was a chameleon werelizard, she looked like a colossal dinosaur queen. Claire then reaches into her purse and takes out her second outfit. From the looks of it, it\u2019s a pale cloudy blue suit with a rainbow-colored shirt and zebra-striped tie. As Claire is putting on her second outfit, you look at her coffee stained suit and then you decide to put it on. After all, it may be wet, but you couldn\u2019t show up to work the first day wearing nothing but a bikini. You put on Claire\u2019s coffee stained dress and find that it\u2019s rather tight in the chest and stomach area but it\u2019s loose in the rear area, to the point where you\u2019re practically swimming in the skirt. \u201cDo you have Glutos Syndrome?\u201d you ask. Claire gives a hiss as she finally puts her jacket on. \u201cNo,\u201d she says sorely. \u201cI\u2019m just FAT! Is that what you do? Go around bumping into people and asking weird questions? Where do you think you are? The K.D.P.?\u201d You give a gulp. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Please don\u2019t sue me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire turns visible again and lets out a sigh before turning to face you. \u201cYou got off on the Makoas\u2019 car, didn\u2019t you? Are you Isabella\u2019s niece?\u201d \u201cUh,\u201d you say. \u201cNo. My name is Gwendolyn. I\u2019ve come to apply for a job at Neo Neapolitan? Where are the proprietresses?\u201d Claire rolled her eyes. \u201cJust what we need,\u201d said Claire. \u201cAnother crazy working here. If you must know, they stepped out for a minute. They\u2019ll be back in a while. I don\u2019t even want to know what they\u2019re doing. The only staff they have at the moment besides you is Tanya.\u201d \u201cTanya?\u201d you ask. You look and see another waitress busy setting up chairs. She was a 900ft tall werecat with gray fur, blue eyes and orange hair in a ponytail. From the looks of it, she had glutos syndrome as her butt was twice as tall and wide as she was, to the point where it was as big as one of the tables. From the looks of it, she was busy listening to her iPhone as she had yet to notice you. You give a blink. \u201cA werecat?\u201d you ask. \u201cOoh boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember that being framed for trying to rob a feline based monster was what got you in the KDP to begin with and let out a sigh. As you do this, you see a cicada the size of a blimp buzzing around. At that moment, Claire flicks out her tongue, revealing that it\u2019s colored like a seven-colored rainbow and snatches the cicada before dragging it into her mouth and chewing on it like bubblegum right before swallowing it. Your face turns pale as you realize that if A) you were still human and B) it was legal in Direopolis for monsters to eat humans, that cicada could\u2019ve easily been you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Claire\u2019s cell phone rings and then Claire picks it up. \u201cHello?\u201d asked Claire. \u201cRebecca, what is it? What!? Juliet quit!? But we need all our maids in place for tonight\u2019s guests. Why did she quit!? Brenda! Why am I not surprised! That acid-tongued little shrew! Tell me what\u2019s the worst job at our hotel right now! Good. Now tell Brenda that\u2019s her new job! Now I need to find a new maid.\u201d Elisabeth and Isabella weren\u2019t kidding. This was the most neurotic woman you\u2019ve ever met. All that caffeine she drank didn\u2019t help the fact. \u201cThank goodness I didn\u2019t apply for a job at the hotel.\u201d You think to yourself. That is when Claire hangs up and lets out a yell. \u201cIf it\u2019s not one thing it\u2019s another!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Claire turned to you and a flash came to her as she focused her bulging eyes on you. You begin to sweat as she looks at you. \"I wonder.\" Says Claire. At that moment...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire gives a smirk and then she walks up towards you and takes out what looks like a maid's outfit that was just your size. \"Consider yourself, hired.\" You were dumbfounded. You came to apply for a job at Neo Neapolitan but you were being hired for a job at the Rainbow Tongue Hotel. \"B-But Ms. M-Melon,\" you say. \"I came to apply for a job working for Salli, Patty and Pam.\" Claire lets out a sigh. \"You can apply tomorrow. You can work for them during the day and work for me at night. Do I look like I have the time to argue? There is important company coming to my hotel in Direopolis over the next few days and we need all the maids we can get. Come on.\" Claire grabs you by the ear and pulls you out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes,\" you think. \"She sure is impatient. I just hope she's a benevolent kind of boss. Elisabeth did say that she hired humans to work for her. But wait, she must have hotels all over the monster world. Some of which might be in places where monsters can eat humans without breaking the law. I wouldn't want to work for a giant chameleon woman who could eat me at any time. But the Makoas said she was reasonable. I hope.\" You decide to put on the maid's outfit while you're running. After all, Claire already hired you, whether you like it or not. \"Wait?\" you think. \"Shouldn't we be traveling by limousine? She's certainly rich enough to have at least one. Maybe she's too impatient to let somebody drive her anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the hotel, the manager, Rebecca, a gigantic wending with bright pink fur, a deer-like noise, pointed ears with skull earrings and no horns, was carrying a human in each hand as she went to wait for Claire. One of them was a tan-skinned young man with medium length blackish brown hair and the other was a dark-haired and pale-skinned girl who was too busy filing her nails to pay any heed. \"Brenda,\" says the young man. \"You didn't have to be so mean to Juliet. She never bothered you.\" Brenda just gave a scoff. \"Hello, Craig! She was a werehyena. She was probably planning to eat us.\" \"It's illegal to eat humans in Direopolis.\" \"Well, she almost stepped on us. We're better off without that clumsy tongue dragger.\" Rebecca gives a glare at Brenda. \"You know,\" says Rebecca. \"You were lucky to get this job in the first place. It was the only thing we could find above janitor that you were qualified for.\" Brenda stuck out her tongue \"Oh, thanks a lot,\" she says. \"You know, Rebecca. I am not planning to be a gopher forever. One day I'll be running a hotel that will bury this dump.\" Rebecca just gives a laugh. \"Oh,\" she says. \"Oh ho. I'd like to hear you shoot your mouth off to the boss the way you're doing to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, you and Claire arrive at the hotel and pass by the gargoyle doorman. Claire arrives to find Rebecca waiting for her. \"Good morning, ma'am.\" Says Rebecca. Claire glares at Rebecca who looks nervous. \"You have a lot of gall calling it a good morning after delivering me bad news. Brenda, I can't believe you drove Juliet to quit. I swear, you're more trouble than you're worth.\" \"That's not saying much with what you pay me, fly breath.\" You look on and can't believe what Brenda is saying. Who would be stupid enough to insult a boss the size of a skyscraper <i>to her face</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the look on Claire's face, you could tell this girl was a problematic employee. \"You're walking on thin ice, Brenda,\" says Claire. \"Ever since I let Rebecca hire you, all you've done is complain and insult both staff and guests alike. I don't remember the last time I've seen you do actual work.\" \"Maybe that's because your eyes are so weird looking. You'd need to wear salad bowls as contact lenses. Claire shows her sharp teeth and growls. \"I am warning you, Brenda, if I get one more complaint about your conduct...\" \"You'll fire me? That would be doing me a favor.\" Claire gives a smirk. \"Fire you? Yeah right. I think I'd rather transfer you to our hotel in Horrorville. That way, the next time you act up, I can just eat you.\" The chameleon giantess gives a malicious smile that actually scares her disobedient employee right before she's dragged away by Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is your coworker, Brenda Tap,\" says Claire to you. \"She's a chronic complainer who thinks she's qualified to be the boss. I keep her around to remind my human employees how NOT to behave. But you're not human, so why am I telling you this?\" You give a laugh. \"If only you knew.\" You think to yourself. Rebecca then comes back and Claire speaks to her. \"Rebecca,\" she says to the wendigo. \"Please give our new employee a tour of the hotel. I'll be in my office preparing for the arrival of a certain royal guest.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" Says Rebecca as Claire walks away. You give a gulp. \"I hope I know what I've gotten into.\"</span></div></div>",

You also saw your were up to Lacy's chest in height now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look down at your growing body, you saw that your species change had also begun. You saw your skin change to a blood red color. After that, you felt something grow out of your back. Looking behind, you saw a spade tail sticking out just above your still growing rear. You grunted in pain as you felt two long horns grow out of your forehead. You then felt another growing feeling in your back and looked again just in time to see two large bat wings pop out. Finally, you felt your feet shift into hooves. That's when you realized what you had become: a succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were outtaking Lacy in height, reaching up to 700 feet and still growing. Your breasts and belly eventually began to slow and stop, your breasts being 1500 feet wide and your belly 2000 feet wide, but your butt just kept blowing up, reaching nearly 2500 feet wide. Eventually, you felt your height growth speed up, but then begin to slow and eventually stop, reaching 1200 feet tall. Your butt, however, kept going and going. Eventually, that finally slowed and stopped, but not before becoming a staggering 3500 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Doc really likes big butts, doesn't he?\" Lacy said, rolling her eyes. \"Well, at any rate, your done. Welcome to your new life as a succubus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked all around yourself in surprise. You were enormous, not just in height, but in weight. You just looked like a big, red ball of fat. Before you could take it in any futher, you heard the door open. Turning around (knocking over Lacy with your massive ass), you saw...</span></div></div>",

Your body starts to become rounder and rounder as your skin starts to turn bright bronze with dull green stripes. You feel your clothes tearing and revealing some sort of bronze armor underneath and you look back as you pass the 800ft tall bracket and then you see that you have a shell like that of a turtle, teal in color with jagged spikes that left your shell shaped like a hexagon. You then feel your head in pain as a dome grows on it, filled with water. Lacy smirks and takes out a mirror. \u201cYou know, you gotta hand it to the guy writing this chapter, being the type of guy with standards, who mainly writes for the plot. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t have expected you to get turned into a kappa. Here, take a look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look and you look in surprise. You were a kappa. You were a 1000ft tall kappa resembling a giant obese anthropomorphic matamata turtle. You feel your chin in disbelief as if to prove to yourself what had happened. \u201cYou better get used to it,\u201d says Lacy. \u201cThe guy is into transformation without it being undone. But look on the bright side, kappas can live and stay young for a very, very, very long time.\u201d You continue to look in surprise and then walk out in disbelief. You hear somebody coming and then instinctively duck back into your shell. That somebody was Whitney but from the looks of it, she was too focused on her clipboard to pay you any heed. She doesn\u2019t even seem to notice you, when she stops. By the time your rhino nemesis turns around, you\u2019re already gone and then she lets out a sigh and polishes her glasses. \u201cI have got to get my prescription changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn\u2019t long until you are outside and you let out a sigh of relief, albeit still getting used to your new doughier, scalier body. You even feel your mouth and then pull on your ears slightly. \u201cI\u2019m a kappa,\u201d you mutter. \u201cA large and fat turtle-like yokai. Well, the good news is that I got away from Whitney. Now I got to find a job somewhere.\u201d You waddle and look at the lifeguard house to see a succubus and a gargoyle walking out of it, but then you shake your head. \u201cNo,\u201d you say. \u201cIt\u2019s too close to the K.D.P. Whitney might get suspicious.\u201d You then decide to sit on a bench, breaking it as you scream and land on your shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to get up right before the gargoyle lifeguard lifts you back up. \u201cThank you.\u201d You say. The lifeguard smiles and then flies off on her merry way. From the looks of it, she was even fatter than Whitney. As you stand up, you see something caught in your shell and you mutter before you pull it out. It was a newspaper and it had an article in it about something happening in Dreadberry. \u201cFate\u2019s Hand Casino Opens up in Dreadberry. Help Wanted.\u201d You rub your chins and then you give the article some thought. Perhaps the owner is looking for somebody like you. You really don\u2019t like the idea in a casino but you didn\u2019t have many options. If you were going to live as a monster in the monster world, you needed a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028The problem is, how do you get to Dreadberry.</span></div></div>",

You give a dumbfounded look and even feel one of your teeth. \"Okay,\" you say with a gulp. \"This is definitely going to take some getting used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the transformation, you notice that Lacy has a glum look on her face. \u201cLacy?\u201d you ask. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Lacy let out a sigh. \u201cWell. The thing is that Red said this would be one of his last chapters on the site and from the sound of it, he\u2019s serious. He said he was going to continue his career with his professional work he\u2019s been doing for years before he decided to go to this website. But he\u2019s a fair man and wants somebody to take his stories and keep them on the site so somebody will take care of us.

You bite your lip and shake. Whitney rolls her eyes. \u201cSylvia,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything. I know it\u2019s you. Come on out, there\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d You blink and Lacy shrugs. \u201cDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. This is another sign of things to come.\u201d You follow Whitney out of the room and Whitney gives a snort. \u201cThere\u2019s been a new development. New evidence shows you WERE framed. And you pleaded insanity just to avoid Under Gloom. Now that I know for sure that it was a misunderstand, I will be the first to apologize for misjudging you and treating you like a criminal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028You drop your jaw. \u201cWait,\u201d you say in confusion. \u201cWhitney? Are you serious? I can go free?\u201d Whitney nods her head. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I said, Sylvia. You don\u2019t belong in the KDP. It\u2019s too dangerous for someone as delicate as you.\u201d You\u2019re excited and jump up and down for joy and giggle. But then you remember something. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d you say. \u201cI\u2019m a wereshark now! I can\u2019t go back to Kansas.\u201d Whitney nods her head again. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m no sorceress. I have no idea how Lacy managed to turn you into a shark and I have no idea how to turn you back. If you returned to Kansas as you are, it would cause a panic. Which is why I have a different idea.\u201d You look at Whitney and Whitney looks serious at you. \u201cYou are invited to live with me and Xander until we can find you a more permanent residence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028You could not believe what you\u2019re hearing.

You heard she wanted to be a comedian, but nobody thought her jokes were that funny. This led to her becoming the giant monster equivalent of the Joker with her green hair, white makeup and permanent slasher smile. She played all sorts of pranks that nearly got tens of monsters killed. She\u2019s so far the only monster you know of in the K.D.P. to be in a straightjacket and even then she managed to unbuckle it. What made her even scarier was her skunk spray. While all skunks sprayed a foul scent, Hazel sprayed out a gas that was highly toxic to humans and could render a human metropolis uninhabitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Artemis, a python. She was a dragon resembling an actual python but with legs. Artemis was a drunk who came to the K.D.P. to quit drinking. It was a good thing to do for herself but bad for you. Since Artemis has been deprived of alcohol so long, she\u2019s got a serious case of the munchies and will eat anything considered to be food by humans and monsters. That includes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the more infamous monsters in the K.D.P. was Jen, a haniver, a monster resembling a giant stingray. The woman got a head injury walking home from a movie about the mad scientist Dr. Saturday. When she recovered, she was convinced she was Dr. Saturday and begun to build all sorts of crazy weapons to take over the world. Of all the monsters, she\u2019s escaped more than anyone else combined. You still don\u2019t know how she manages to smuggle all that high tech equipment into the institute. The woman also had an electric stinger in her tail and knew how to use it. She could fly and breath underwater, making her the hardest critter for the lifeguards to catch. To make matters worse was that she often tricked the weaker minded patients into helping her escape. And just your luck, Jen used humans as guinea pigs or a quick snack. Mad scientists are bad enough when they\u2019re not giant monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also Phoenicia, a hippocampus, a type of monster resembling a cross between a horse and a fish, similar to the creature from the Black Lagoon. There was a similar creature called a kelpie, but Phoenicia had a large fin on her lower back that her kelpie cousin Aqua didn\u2019t. Phoenicia wasn\u2019t an ice element monster but she hated heat so much that she would willingly expose herself to below zero conditions to the point of wearing a bikini in the snow when she didn\u2019t have any fur to protect her. It\u2019s a wonder she didn\u2019t get frostbite. She especially loves the taste of chilled humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a giant monster version of Jekyll and Hyde. Eunice the spriggan. She was a fairy whose malformed face ruined your childhood image of fairies and made you fear them. But it wasn\u2019t her ugly mug that was the scary part. One minute she could be the sweetest thing and the next thing she could be an angry, swearing, violent fiend who hit everyone below the belt. But what really terrified you was that she had a human boyfriend, but she ate him because her hostile personality accused him of cheating on her, which he didn\u2019t even do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast of B Block was an obese crow tengu named Core. Core was a klepto who stole everything shiny that wasn\u2019t nailed down. She was actually brought to the K.D.P. for stealing a diamond. While she acted friendly towards humans, she was no friend because Core was a compulsive eater and will unconsciously stuff herself with anything edible available and that included people. What\u2019s scary is that she could be talking to you one second, not realize she\u2019s swallowing you the next second and still be talking shortly afterwards without realizing you\u2019re in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was yet another hall of horrors and you were shivering. Suddenly you hear a strange noise that sounded like snapping and gasp. There was only one creature that made that snapping noise. It was that werecrab Lilith. Lilith was one of the orderlies that wanted to eat you and she loved to taunt you with her snapping claws. Dr. West doesn\u2019t like the orderlies to eat human patients but unfortunately for you Dr. West wasn\u2019t in the hallway. If Lilith saw you out of your cage, you\u2019ll be eaten. Your only hope is to hide in a B-Block cell and even then you\u2019d risk getting eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lilith\u2019s shadow comes closer and you realize you\u2019re going to have to take your chances since it appears you\u2019ll be in somebody\u2019s stomach no matter what. But who\u2019s room do you go into?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You take a few steps forward nervously. Look around. Maybe she's asleep? It would be great if you could wait until Lilith leaves without her noticing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back you sit down and lean against the wall, which was unusually soft. Very soft. Almost fluffy. And.....gurgling.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spin around. That wasn't a wall! It was Hazel's stomach! The pear shaped skunk was rather plump to begin with and her gut could get even bigger when she was preparing to release one of her massive stink bombs.

Ouch that hurt, and then you started to feel the shivers down your spine, as this room isn\u2019t very normal at all.

Everything seems normal until you hear someone muttering. \"This sucks! Why are we even here?\" The voice says. \"They're only trying to help.\" the same voice says. \"They're not doing anything useful though.\" Once again, the same voice. You creep closer to see just who this is. You see a large hell hound woman with a voluptuous figure. She's got crimson colored fur and dark red hair that reaches her a little past her shoulders. She appears to be talking to herself. \"Look, maybe if we just cooperate, we'll be out soon.\" she says. \"Don't be so naive.\" she responds to herself while looking slightly to the left. \"I also think we shouldn't cause any trouble.\" she says this while looking to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stare at her you suddenly remember who she is. This is Hadie, a hell hound. She was admitted to the asylum for multiple personality disorder. She's convinced that she's a cerberus thats missing two of its heads. She talks to herself because the personalities of the other two heads are still there. One of them appears to be the actual Hadie, who is pretty rational, while the other two are abrasive and cautious, respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHadie suddenly starts to sniff the air and turns in your direction. Crap!  \"A human!\"  she says. You run away to the door but she runs after you and is gaining fast. Unfortunately she steps right in front of you and you crash into her furry foot. As you wait for her to make her move you instead hear her talking. \"What should we do?\" she asks. \"I say we eat her!\" she responds. \"No way! We don't know where she's been! We could get sick\" You stare up as she argues with herself and then take off in another direction. \"Look at that! Now she's getting away!\" Hadie tells herself. \"We should try to calm her down\" she also says. \"I think we should just get rid of her and be done with this.\" You run for all you're worth but once again you feel her bearing down on you. Looking back you see that she's practically got you, but which personality is in control?  </span></div></div>",

Even if she seems reasonable now you can't forget that she could change any second. \"What are you running for?\" she asks. You try to think of a response but you are interrupted. \"I bet you're trying to escape!\" Hadie blurts out while turning her head slightly to the left, but still keeping her eyes on you. You start to sweat as Hadie eyes you accusingly. \"Leave her alone. If I recall, you wanted to escape too.\" she says as the center personality regains control. She then addresses you. \"But honestly, I don't know what to do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hell hound walks to the center of the room and begins pacing back and forth. \"Now how should I handle this?\" she ponders. You sit in her palm and wait for her decision. You really hope she'll just let you go. \"I could just let you go.\" she begins. \"No way! We should eat her for trespassing!\" her left personality says. Hadie ignores her own outburst and continues. \"Or I could keep you here. It gets kind of lonely with just these two for company.\" The right personality butts in this time. \"No! We can't keep her!

Its been so long since we had human!\" You wince at her words. \"Oh be quiet. You may like to eat humans, but we don't. It always leaves a bad taste in our mouth.\" the calm Hadie says. You really don't like this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHadie carries you to her bed and sets you down. Before you can make a move she plops down in front of you with her face very close to you. \"So what's your name?\" she asks. \"Uh, Sylvia.\" you answer meekly. \"Well I'm Hadie. I may look like a normal hell hound, but I'm actually a cerberus. I just happen to have one head instead of three.\" she says. You stare at her nervously and she suddenly moves her face closer. \"Hey I'll bet she doesn't believe us!\" she says in her angry voice. You fall on your butt and cover your head with your arms in fear.  As you tremble Hadie pulls her head back. \"Stop that! You're scaring her!\" she tells herself. This whole talking to herself thing is really starting to creep you out. Suddenly you feel feel her furry finger rubbing your back, as if trying to calm you down. It helps a little, but you're still scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Hadie grabs you and starts to lie on her back. She gets under the covers and holds you to her face. \"Well its about time for lights out.\" she tells you. Its that late? You must have spent more time wandering the halls and dealing with this gigantic hell hound than you thought. \"We're sleeping with it?\" Hadie's nervous voice says. \"I really don't like this.\"  You and her both. \"Everybody quiet.

Soon your back runs into something that you realize is her breast. \"Ew, I can feel it moving!\" nervous Hadie says. You can feel her cringe as you absentmindedly feel her giant boob. Suddenly she peers directly at you while tilted to the left. \"You better not wake me up with your squirming, or I'll be having a midnight snack!\" she warns. Her middle self then takes over. \"Okay everyone thats enough. Lets get some sleep.\" She then pats you with her finger and gently forces you to lie down. After that you don't hear anything from her as she falls asleep. While you wait for the right time to make your move you find yourself dozing off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night your wake up and yawn. You quickly stifle the yawn when you remember where you are. Looking toward her face you see that Hadie is still asleep. This is your chance to get away! You try to crawl up out of her shirt and are met with her huge muzzle. You think it would be easy to get by but then her head shifts to the right. As she sleeps she whimpers slightly. Then her head sifts to the left and she growls a little. She even switches personalities in her sleep? You resolve to push forward anyway until you see her bare teeth slightly. Your fear gets the better of you and you decide to go the other way. Crawling back into her shirt you make your way to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make you way past her breasts and find yourself on her belly. The fur feels nice and you are calmed a little by it. This calm is short lived as a shift causes you to stumble onto your own belly. You hear movement outside and then something huge comes down right next to you on the left. It scratches Hadie through the shirt and you realize that she must have felt you. As she scratches herself in her sleep you hold your breath. When she stops her paw remains on her stomach and you have no choice but to try and press on past it. You try to be as careful as you can and eventually reach the bottom of her shirt. Suddenly you hear her grumble and her paw appears over you. In a panic you dash forward as it comes down and scratches the place where you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you feel you've escaped her you realize where you are. In your panic you ended up rushing into her pants and are on her underwear. With her paw behind you you must now keep going until you can get out at the bottom. You move as slow as you can and slide down the front of her panties. When you land you catch yourself on the front of them and end up feeling Hadie's private area. There is a sudden shift as she tenses up and you hear her begin to whimper. Her pants are lifted and the dreaded paw returns. You once again dash forward and escape as she fondles her crotch. The world shifts again as she turns onto her right side. You can hear her panting and whimpering and you try to shut it out of your mind. Moving forward you are impeded again as her legs close together and you have to struggle to get free. When you slip out of her leg lock you crawl forward to the opening at the end of her pant leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the end of the tunnel you don't hear Hadie anymore. She must have finished and is now sleeping soundly again. You crawl into the open and find yourself on her furry foot. You think you're home free until she moves again and is once again laying on her back. This causes you to tumble to her toes and she unconsciously grips you with them. As you struggle in their grip you hear her giggling in her sleep. She scrunches her toes and moves them around while you try to escape. You finally manage to get away and fall onto the bed right in front of her paws. You crawl to a spot where you can see her face and find that Hadie is..... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look to the hallway directly behind Dr. West\u2019s desk and see that it leads to the C-Block area. You heard there were some seriously screwed up patients there, but it was in Charlene\u2019s jurisdiction so you weren\u2019t completely concerned, so you dart under the door. However, as you walk down the hallway you see that it was completely dark and shiver. \u201cI sure hope I see Charlene today,\u201d you say. \u201cI could use a little protection in this area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words were all too true because the monsters in this wing were extremely dangerous to humans. The first of the C-Block patients was Mandy, a literal flying pig. Even though Mandy was a big fat sow, she was as vain as a peacock and a perfectionist in regards to her own beauty, to the point where she got insanely jealous if there was anyone who she thinks might be more beautiful than her. Most of the time she\u2019s staring at her own mirror. You dreaded being a girl human when you were near Mandy because Mandy especially hated the idea a human could be more beautiful than her. Knowing that laughing pig, she\u2019d eliminate that kind of competition, to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was yet another of the regular escapists and a really bizarre one. Her name was Natasha and she was a black widow drider who thought she was a pirate. Whenever she escaped, she usually attacked the beachgoers and tried to rob them. She even spoke like someone out of Pirates from the Caribbean. As much as you were afraid of crabs, you were afraid of spiders even more since Natasha trapped humans in her webs and is just as carnivorous as any other spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third C-Block patient was Eartha, a hot-tempered French gargoyle who was said to be a rouge. She used to live near Paris and never caused any trouble, but some annoying kid started playing all sorts of rotten pranks on her. Eartha endured the tricks until one day the brat sprayed graffiti all over her when she was sleeping. Eartha snapped and went on a rampage. You even heard that she ate three hundred humans before it was over. The court sentenced Eartha to the K.D.P. to take anger management courses. Being in the same room with her was a fatal mistake if you were a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was one monster who really destroyed your fantasies, Amalthea the unicorn. As it turns out unicorns are so rare in the monster world that Amalthea thinks they\u2019re extinct and that she\u2019s the last of her kind. She\u2019s so upset about this (false) fact that she actually tried to kill herself before they admitted her. You used to love unicorns as a kid, but Amalthea was no pony you wanted to be around because she drowned her sorrows by eating humans by the handful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even a patient who had an opposite problem to Mandy. Allegra the siren. Allegra was a beautiful caramel skinned woman who just happened to have scaled legs of a fish and gills. Allegra however for some reason couldn\u2019t see her own beauty and was convinced she was drop dead ugly. This boded badly for humans because Allegra thinks eating human girls like you will make her pretty. She practically demolished Miami Beach before she ended up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast was a monster that was very unusual. Jessie, a questing beast resembling a leopard with a snake\u2019s head. Dr. West herself found Jessie living in the jungle alone as a child. Dr. West took Jessie back to Terrordale and adopted her as her own daughter. But Jessie was feral even after all these years. While she listens to Dr. West and has a respect for her, Jessie acts more like an animal than a monster, like a monster Tarzan. And since she lives by the law of the jungle, being in the same cell as her equals getting eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when you feel tremors and you scream slightly. But these tremors weren\u2019t normal. There was a monster coming who was bigger than the orderlies. Then you gasp and see a horned shadow. It was Dr. West\u2019s right hand woman, Whitney, the wererhino. Whitney was the monster you feared the most. That nurse took the K.D.P. very seriously and she didn\u2019t know you were framed for theft. Whitney hates people who plead insanity to avoid going to jail and that includes you. She felt you were taking advantage of Dr. West and tried to convince her boss that your escape attempts were proof of your sanity. That pachyderm nurse even warned you she\u2019d punish you severely if you tried to escape one more time. That woman was even scarier than any predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Whitney snort and realize that she\u2019s pissed. Being a rhinoceros, that woman was easily set off. \u201cThat no good little cockroach!\u201d she shouts. \u201cI told Kaguya not to let her out of her sight. When I find Sylvia this time... oh... oh, she just better hope I don\u2019t.\u201d You had to hide from Whitney fast or you\u2019re in dire straights. Your only choice is to hide in a patient\u2019s room. But who\u2019s?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Got yerself tangled there, eh lassie? Now, what's a wee bilge rat like you doin' in Captain Natasha's quarters?\" The delusioned spider-giantess skitters towards your tangled form, her spindly legs clattering on the concrete floor all the while. Natasha towers over you, her human upper portion blocking out the light, and you can't help but gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting down a whimper, you try to answer. \"N-nothing, M-Miss Natash--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGH!

She punches a wall to to punctuate the threat, shutting you up right quick. \"Listen here, you yellow-bellied little barnacle-shit: I am NOT a 'Miss'! You'll address me as <i>Captain</i> Natasha, and nothing else! 'Miss' be for callin' little prisses on land that be good fer nothin' but robbin' or blastin' holes through the their bloody petticoats with a broadside! Do <i>I</i> look like one of those fancied-up little wenches, little lubber?\" She scowls and crosses her arms, seeming to eye you for the first excuse to make you a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Still, she hadn't eaten you <i>yet</i>, and she seemed to be giving orders (like, what else, the captain of a pirate ship) rather than teasing prey. Maybe you could still get out of this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, no <i>Captain</i> Natasha. Not in the least...arrr?\" You add the weak growl as an afterthought, shrugging as much as you can with the binding web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha chuckles and shakes her head. \"I enjoy t' proper respect, lassie, but...leave talkin' like a sea-dog t' the actual pirates from now on. Bloody 'ell, you're awful at it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the insult, you fake a chuckle. \"So...what now, er, Captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your surprise (and fear), Natasha reaches down and pinches you out of her web between her thumb and index finger, picking the remaining silk off you with her other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you asked, lassie...I'm plannin' a mutiny! Ain't right at all to go puttin' the Captain in the brig, and without charges at all! Every swab 'round this bloody place goin' on about how I'm off me rocker! <i>Me!</i> The legendary Captain Natasha, the Black Widow of the Seven Seas!

Or brave the treacherous waves of the Black Sea, fightin' off the scurvy-ridden Irish?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou very, VERY nearly start laughing right then and there. Natasha wasn't just deluded into thinking she was a pirate, she didn't know a goddamn thing about sailing! Where did this overgrown arachnid learn her history, a Cracker Jack box? (Seriously, the <i>Titanic</i> being sunk by Admiral Nelson? Aztecs at MIDWAY?!) But thankfully for your well-being, you manage to stay serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Captain! It'd take a strong, clear mind to survive battles like those!\"  Mentally, you add <i>Coming up with them, on the other hand...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour answer must have stoked Natasha's ego something fierce, for lets out a loud, hearty laugh that fills her room, and dispite the fact that she's a man-eating, pirate obsessed lunatic you want to laugh too.

I want out as much as you do, but...\" Dammit, if you didn't help this wannabe pirate, you were lunch! But there was no way her so-called 'mutiny' could work! <br>\r\n...Right?

But first, we need to create as much hell as possible in the process. Like Bartholomew Roberts' raid on Impel Down, we will unlock the cells of the most dastardly rapscallions and while the guards are distracted, those that manage to get away shall join us as we escape and set out to sea!\" As Natasha was laughing, you groan. She's confusing real pirates with fictional pirates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you gasp. \"Wait,\" you say. \"You want me to steal the keys from one of the guards? What if it doesn't work?\" Natasha let out a hiss as all of her eyes closed and opened. \u201cThen we have our contingency plan. You will lure the guard to my quarters where me webbing will make short work of her. We\u2019ll shanghai the lass and force the bilge rats that locked us up to provide us with a seaworthy ship that will allow us to make our great escape! Now off with ye!\u201d Without warning, Natasha wraps some webbing around you and tosses you out through the bars on the door to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a yell and then you grunt as you land on the next of the K.D.P. staff who comes by. You see long strands of cyan hair all around you and you realized that you landed on Tori, the salamander. Tori was a pitch black-skinned monster resembling a cross between an actual salamander and a dragon. She had four arms that doubled as two extra pairs of legs and was wearing a cyan bikini as she moved through the hallway on all sixes and then stood up, forcing you to grab her hair. Of course, maintaining your footing is easily said than done on this amphibious giantess\u2019s slimy back. Tori sniffed the air before she blew smoke out of her nostrils and coughed. From the look on her face, she was really tired. \u201cWhy did I stay up watching White Butler all night? I\u2019m supposed to be awake and alert in case Grandma isn\u2019t. I overheard Whitney talking to Dr. West about forcing her to retire. Without even asking her first? That\u2019s just mean. What are they thinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori\u2019s grandmother Cressida was a large and elderly dragon who was also an orderly. However, Cressida was weak in her old age. She couldn\u2019t fly anymore, she needed a cane to walk, her eyesight was failing her and she couldn\u2019t even breathe fire anymore without hurting her own throat. She was getting too old and weak to do her job properly but she wasn\u2019t willing to retire. Tori became an orderly to protect Cressida\u2019s job and that made her the clear threat among the grandmother-granddaughter duo and she proved it by looking around. You look down yourself and you see Cressida carrying a keyring at the side of her bikini. You inch down from her hair as the salamander doesn\u2019t seem to notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yourself have your doubts on whether or not Natasha\u2019s plan will even work. But you couldn\u2019t walk away now. After all, pirates don\u2019t like being betrayed. You inch down and find yourself standing on Tori\u2019s keyring. You climb onto the ring and tug on the side in an attempt to pull it out of Tori\u2019s belt. But in the process, you manage to tear the side of the belt and then you gasp. \u201cOh no,\u201d you say. \u201cOh no. Please don\u2019t break. Ah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream as the keychain starts to fall, broken off of Tori\u2019s belt. You hold the chain tight as you fall from hundreds of feet in the air and scream. You could swear your heart is beating right up your throat. It looks like it\u2019s all over, but then there\u2019s a clinkering sound. You look and see that you\u2019ve landed harmlessly. Holding onto the keychain saved you from the impact of the fall. You let out a sigh of relief. But then you realize that Tori might\u2019ve heard you and gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut did Tori hear you?</span></div></div>",

You can't relax however because the once Whitney's gone you hear someone else muttering. \"Don't even know why I'm here. Those rotten humans started it. I was just doing what anyone would do.\" The voice has a french accent and you know just who it is. It was the gargoyle Eartha. She was in here because she went nuts when some human kids  wouldn't stop playing pranks on her. They pushed her too far and sent her on a rampage. The courts put her in the KDP for anger management. \"Anger management? I'll show them anger management!\" the gargoyle continues to mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide its best to get out of here but at that moment someone walks very close to the door. The sudden tremor scares you enough to make you jump away from the door. This catches Eartha's attention and she looks in your direction. You lock eyes with her for a second before she reacts. \"What?! A human?!\" You immediately panic as she begins stomping in your direction. You dart off in a random direction in an attempt to get away. You manage to slip under a dresser just before she can grab you. You can hear her cursing in french as she reaches under the dresser. You watch as her clawed hand feels around for you to no avail. You sit down and rest for a minute, but it doesn't last long. Just as your heart calms down it begins beating fast again as the massive dresser begins to move around you. The shade it provides disappears and you look up to see Eartha's face. \"I've got you now!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run away again and Eartha begins her chase again.\"You're not getting away! Its little bugs like you that put me in here! I'll bet you snuck into my room just to make fun of me! You humans just piss me off so much!\" She rants as she tries to grab your scurrying little form. This was not good for your heart. You're scared enough of these patients as it is, and now one of them is chasing you! You don't know how much longer you can keep dodging her clawed hand.

Terrified beyond belief you try your hardest to escape the grip of her claws. Seeing your futile struggle only makes the gargoyle laugh. \"Hehehe. Not so fun being the one squirming huh? Just wanting to live your life until someone comes along and decides to torment you?\" She really does have anger issues. That kid that messed with her really drove her over the edge. Now she's projecting her anger at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't up to anything! I was just looking for a place to hide!\" you almost cry at the giant gargoyle. Eartha snorts and brings you closer to her face. \"If you're trying to hide then you must have done something wrong! You need to punished, and its gonna be delicious!\" With that she opens her mouth and slowly lowers you inside. You let out a scream and she chuckles at your fear. Just as she has you inside however there is a knock on the door. \"Eartha? Its time for your anger management session.\" You know that voice. Its Charlene! Even though you're still in a horrible situation you can't help but feel a little relieved. Eartha curses out loud and jerks you away from her mouth as the door slowly opens. She stuffs you into her cleavage without thinking and walks over to Charlene. \"Is it that time already?\" she asks in an annoyed tone. \"I don't need anger management, I just need stupid jerks to leave me alone!\" Her voice is very loud, something Charlene picks up on. \"See? Outbursts like that are the reason you're here. You need to control yourself to avoid another rampage.\" Eartha scoffs. \"Who cares about that? I only ate some humans. They probably had it coming anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two of them talk you try to crawl your way up through Eartha's breasts. You try to call for Charlene but Eartha notices you and discreetly pushes you back down. She then folds her arms to keep her breast pushed together in order to keep you trapped. She probably knows Charlene would take you from her and doesn't want to lose her snack. Eventually Charlene leads Eartha to a door and holds it open. \"Here we are. I hope it goes well.\" she says as Eartha walks in. The gargoyle just rolls her eyes and sits on a couch. How does her session go?  </span></div></div>",

Eartha rolls her eyes. \"I don't need help, I just got a little carried away.\" she shoots back. \"You ate 300 innocent humans.\" says the doctor. \"So? Lots of monsters eat humans.\"  Eartha counters. \"You used to like humans though. What happened to change that?\" Dr. West asks. The gargoyle begins to raise her voice a little. \"Because I realized how annoying they are! If they're going to be a nuisance then I might as well get rid of them!\" She hugs her arms tighter to her chest when she says this, which increases your discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe session last a little longer but doesn't go anywhere. Dr. West tries to explain that just because one human went too far doesn't mean all of them should be eaten. Eartha isn't very receptive however. When time is up Charlene returns. \"Oh hello Charlene. We're just about out of time for today, so would you mind taking Eartha back to her room?\" says the doctor.

Do you have any idea how annoying that was?\" she responds angrily. You want to mention that she didn't have to do that and only did it so she could keep you, but you know it would only make her angrier. It seems impossible to get through to her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You see the East side of the room and run into the D-Block holding room.  This time, you\u2019re really careful and look around as you walk backwards. This is where they keep the most messed up patients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was the infamous Avery, a 27 year old chimera. Her mother was a landshark but Avery herself was a combination of a landshark, a yuki-onna and some type of octopus based monster. She was only 12 when she came to the K.D.P. but she was really messed up. Her human boyfriend was killed in a bloody explosion by a vampire serial killer and caused Avery to snap and tear the killer to pieces. Avery was usually friendly, but when she saw blood, she went bonkers and went on a rampage. Even though she was only 300ft tall she was super strong. She was able to pile drive that gargoyle lifeguard Roxy and given how fat Roxy was that was quite an accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Nicole, a nuckelavee, a freakish looking creature resembling a skinless horse with veins all over her body. The woman was a masochist who tortured herself in such grizzly ways that her already malformed body became hideously scarred. But she didn\u2019t know when to stop and her boyfriend sent her to the K.D.P. to break her of her odd habits. You heard that she even swallowed humans carrying guns, knives and bombs and went so far as to eat tanks. It\u2019s a wonder her decrepit body is in tact.<br>\r\n\u2028Then there was Paula, a big fat cyclops woman who worked as a maid in a mansion until she mistook a crack in a window for a stain and went into a mental breakdown trying to clean it. The woman had the worst case of OCD you ever saw and considered humans to be dirty vermin. She even screamed when someone so much as left footprints in her room. Unlike most other monsters in the K.D.P., Paula had a child, a daughter named Irene who visited her once a week, though given how athletic Irene was compared to her obese mom, you don\u2019t know how they could be related. But you\u2019re not complaining since unlike Paula, Irene considers humans to be too unhealthy to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the most bizarre cases in the K.D.P. was Mercy, a Southern Belle who doesn\u2019t realize she died hundreds of years ago. That zombie still hasn\u2019t realized she\u2019s dead. In fact, she thinks she\u2019s checked into the hotel and that the K.D.P. patients and staff are wearing monster costumes. That dropped dead ditz even sees you as a type of insect that\u2019s considered a delicacy. If only she knew she was eating humans. But you couldn\u2019t believe how she could be oblivious to her rotten flesh, exposed bones and tattered clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Missy the werealligator. Missy was a soldier in a terrible war a few decades ago. They say she was injured and washed up on shore in the human world. She was so starved that she resorted to eating anything she could, including humans. Even though she got out of the war alive, Missy was still shellshocked and had flashbacks of her terrible experiences that caused her to be violent and hostile without realizing it. She didn\u2019t even take off her armor from the war. But she was the most terrifying creature in the K.D.P. because that gator girl developed such a taste for humanity that her skin, hair and armor were permanently stained red with the blood of every human she\u2019s ever devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last patient was Taylor the Stymphalian Bird. She was an obese avian with golden feathers that were as sharp as swords. Taylor wouldn\u2019t be in the K.D.P. unless something was wrong with her, but Dr. West couldn\u2019t diagnose exactly what the problem was because Taylor never speaks and communicates by stomping her talons on the ground instead. But she was nonetheless creepy because Taylor ate humans, spat out their bones and made them into jewelry. Just the thought of being made into a bracelet filled you with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not as much dread as what you heard next. It was a clucking noise that made you scream. \u201cGail!\u201d you shout. You see the shadow of Gail the cockatrice, that chicken lizard would no doubt either try to eat you or try and feed you to your friend Charlene. Oh, this was bad, bad bad. You had to hide in a cell with the craziest monsters in all of D-Block. Who\u2019s room will be your shelter?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She is a pretty crazy girl in her own right, as whenever she sees blood, she goes all musha and goes crazy in an instant. It's bed not to injured yourself with some blood, otherwise that might end up being your downfall. She looks and sees you, and you kept yourself still just in case she might be hostile or something, but actually, she isn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who are you?\" Avery asked just as she use her fins on you to blow off any problems. \"I am Sylvia, and you are?\" \"Avery.

There is a canopy bed that looks pretty fancy for a mental ward. There are also things like a desk, chair and even a sofa, all of which look old fashioned. Sitting in the chair by the window is a woman with grayish green skin. This is Mercy's room. She's a lich who died many years ago and still doesn't know it. The zombie girl gets out of the chair and turns in your direction. As she walks you see that being dead hasn't hurt her figure. You jump out of the way as she almost steps on you. She walks up to the door and lays a hand on it. \"This is a charming hotel but I do wish the rules about leaving our rooms were less strict.\" she says in a southern accent. Mercy is from the old west, and rose from her grave many years later. The shock must have been too much because she simply refuses to acknowledge what year it really is, let alone that she's actually died. Now she lives here, thinking that she's in a hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercy turns again and walks back to the window. You wonder to yourself why she doesn't question that it has bars on it. You have to dodge again as she almost steps on you. As you run she notices your movement. She looks down and catches you scurrying across the floor. \"Well what have we here?\" she says aloud. Right then and there you freeze in place before taking off like a bullet. You had hoped she wouldn't notice you, but that didn't work out too well. Not wanting to get caught you bolt back towards the door. but the booming of Mercy's footsteps fills your ears. Before you reach your goal you are scooped up by a hand wearing a worn  out glove. Mercy dangles you in front of her face, giving you a full view of her. She must have been pretty when she was alive, and it still shows. However now she's missing part of her lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't had one of these in long time!\" Mercy says happily. \"I was a little scared to try eating bugs at first but these turned out to be quite the delicacy.\" Looks like she's confused you with some sort of bug people used to eat in her time. Now you're terrified that this giant belle wants to eat you. \"Try all you want little guy, but you won't get away. You're too tasty to let go.\" You're going crazy with fear and start to struggle furiously, which amuses Mercy. What happens?</span></div></div>",

As you walk forward to find a place to lay low you suddenly hear the sound of metal clanking. You look over in the direction of the sound and see someone lying on the bed. Its Missy the weregator. She's a veteran of a monster war that happened decades ago, but is still haunted by the memories. Because of this she refuses to take off her armor, which is what made the clanking noise you heard earlier. Missy herself is bad enough, but the sight of her armor fills you with dread. Its supposed to be silver but instead its bright red. You heard that it was permanently staind this color from the blood of all the humans she's ever eaten. Her scales are red for the same reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly make you way to bed. You can hide under it until you feel its safe and then make your way back to the hall. You once again hear the sound of metal and look over. Missy is sleeping and just turned over. She's now facing your direction, making you rather unnerved. As you make your way closer you glance at her constantly. She may terrify you but you have to admit she has beautiful hair. Its long and scarlet colored, and actually goes well with her scales. Thinking about that makes you shudder as remember why her scales are red. Eventually you reach your destination and walk under the bed. Slumping down you let out a sigh and relax. Just as you do however you hear the groaning of the bed as Missy begins to get up. Whether she actually heard you sigh or woke up naturally you don't know. All you know is that now escape will be even more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy gets off the bed and you see her scaly feet touch the ground. She walks over to the window, creating booming noises as she does. \"I can't believe I'm stuck here.\" you hear her say in frustration. \"I fought for bravely in the war and this is what I get? I don't even know why I'm here.\" You peak out and see her looking out the window as she talks. You decide to sneak away while she's not looking. You make you way to the door while checking to make sure she's still not looking. When you're about halfway there Missy suddenly turns around and leans on the window sill. She sighs and then happens to look in your direction. She spots you and her eyes widen. \"A human!\" she exclaims. As she comes after you she's..... </span></div></div>",

You're knock across the ground to the other side of the desk before you crawl back underneath. Those footsteps were MUCH louder than usual when it comes to monsters. Whoever this was, was not only bigger than all the other monsters in the K.D.P. but also several times heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you gasp because you realize there's only one monster that woman could possibly be. You hear a door open and you look ahead to see a pair of white pachyderm style feet and your concerns come true, it was Nurse Whitney the wererhino. You hide behind one of the legs of the table and start to sweat. The massive rhino woman at the time was walking towards Dr. West's desk and as she adjusted her glasses (wererhinos are notorious for bad eyesight) she sees your empty cage and gives an angry snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That little bitch got out again,\" she grumbled to herself. \"I warned Kaguya about her. If there was something wrong with that hussy, she wouldn't have the common sense to know how to pick the lock. That little liar. This time I'm going to put her in a jar!\" You gulp in your hiding place as that enormous horn nosed nurse stomps around looking for you. \"The little snot couldn't have gotten far. You try to be nice, but no, some cowardly thief has to pretend to be crazy just to save her own ass. I know you can hear me Sylvia. If you give yourself up, I might be lenient about your punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenient and her? Those were two words that didn't fit together at all. You're just lucky that Whitney actually <i>likes</i> humans and not in the food way. She actually was against monsters eating humans. According to Dr. West, Whitney was actually married to one. You wonder what kind of man would want to marry a colossal, bloated, thick skinned pachyderm with the temper of a bulldozer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear a loud thud. Whitney had got on her knees to look for you. You stay hidden as you see her enormous eye trying to spot you. That blue tattoo around it struck fear in you and you're literally frozen with fear. Whitney inches herself forward to look for you and you nervously step back. You think about trying to make a run for the back door when you look and see that rhino woman's meteor sized rear, her bright orange hair directly over it and her silver bikini bottom barely covering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see Whitney's short tail shaking back and forth. Then you think that Whitney could be your ticket out, as frightening and unlikely as it sounded. Whitney scared you more than any other monster you've ever met. But you gulp and walk to the sole of Whitney's heavy foot before you climb it. Whitney continues looking for you on all fours and you're amazed that the wererhino didn't feel you climbing her. You take it her thunder thighs were too thick to notice a petit human girl like you. You see Whitney's tail waving and grunt before you jump and grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tail swings you back and forth until you press your legs against the fabric of Whitney's bikini bottom and start to climb. You see Whitney's lab outfit at her side and figure that if you could reach it, you'd be home free. A rather risky move given that you were climbing your worst enemy but Whitney would never look for you on her own body. Would she?</span></div></div>",

As you hold on tight you see Whitney's long orange hair hanging down her back and jump. You grunt and grab hold of the end of the hair before Whitney lets out a confused grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wererhino's ears twitch and she snorts as she starts to get up. You rapidly climb up her hair and grunt before you leap into the pocket of her lab coat. You almost miss it but grab hold of the lining to climb inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rhino giantess arises and looks around and you cross your fingers and hope she doesn't notice you're in her pocket. She then lets out a snort. \"I'm going to find her,\" she says. \"And when I do, I'm going to punish her so hard she'll be begging for prison. Whitney looks down as she walks out of the room slowly, her every movement shaking her labcoat as it dangles. You let out a sigh of relief. You're safe in Whitney's pocket. All you have to do is hang on, hope she doesn't realize you're in there and you can make it out when she clocks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Whitney is walking down the hallway where she sees that Cyprus in the hallway. Cyprus was a behemoth, a monster resembling a gigantic hippopotamus and in her case with a dragon's skin. Cyprus was eating what looked like a sandwich made from roasted humans as her wife and fellow orderly, the bahamut Jedda looked on. Cyprus stops eating and smiles at Jedda. \"I'm sorry baby,\" she says. \"I forgot you swore off humans.\" Jedda gives a nervous laugh. \"No problem Cyprus. Just because I've gone cold turkey doesn't mean you should.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney walks up to both hippopotamus based monsters and gives a glare. \"Hi Whitney,\" says Jedda. \"Something bugging you?\" \"Have either of you seen Sylvia?\" \"She got out again did she?\" asks Cyprus. \"Nope, if I saw her, she'd be in my belly right down.\" Cyprus rubs her fat stomach and you shudder in Whitney's pocket when you hear that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney looks at Cyprus's human sandwich and gags in disgust. \"That's barbaric!\" she yells. It would make sense she'd disapprove of human consumption, if what you heard about her having a human husband was true. \"Well if you see Sylvia, don't you dare eat her. She isn't getting off that easy.\" Whitney stomps off and you sigh in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long day, Whitney is checking out with Dr. West who is visibly concerned. \"Oh,\" says Dr. West. \"Poor Sylvia must be scared half to death. I really hope she didn't get eaten or stepped on, especially after Phoenicia ate Mark. Someone as unwell as hers can't be wandering about.\" Whitney lets out a sigh. \"Kaguya, Sylvia is perfectly fine. I keep telling you that she's just hiding from justice. That woman is a common thief.\" Whitney really thought you did commit that robbery. She had no idea you were framed and you couldn't prove otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. West lets out a sigh. \"Well,\" says the doctor. \"I just hope she's safe wherever she is. See you tomorrow Whitney.\" \"See you tomorrow Kaguya.\" Whitney leaves the K.D.P. and you're absolutely giddy. You couldn't believe it, you were finally out of this madhouse for monsters. Now you just had to stay on Whitney and then slip away without her noticing and you can get back to the human world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Whitney, where is the wererhino giantess going now?</span></div></div>",

Not only was Whitney the biggest monster in the K.D.P. but she was also the heaviest. Makes sense given that she's A) a rhinoceros and B) A BBW. The next thing you knew, Whitney was starting a car based on the noise you heard. You hold on tight and scream. Fortunately, as Whitney drives away, the engine sound covers up your screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wererhino woman drives down the road from the beach and you feel like you're about to throw up, only to pause. Whitney hated you enough already. If you barfed in her pocket she'd really be sore. Whitney drives further down the street and suddenly comes to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a door and the wererhino gets out and hums to herself. You peak your head out of Whitney's pocket and look up to see a beautiful two floor house not that far from the beach. You gasp because you realize that Whitney had taken you back to her place. Of all the rotten luck. You slap yourself in the face. \"Way to go Sylvia,\" you mumble to yourself. \"Now it'll be twice as hard to get away from Whitney in her own home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a key turning and realize that Whitney is going inside. Once indoors, you hear Whitney let out a sigh. \"Rough day at the office dear?\" asks a male voice. \"You can say that again Xander,\" says Whitney. \"I envy you being able to work from the house. Everything was crazy. Amara climbed up the roof and I had to get her down. Cassandra was crying over a splinter and Phoebe tried to set a fire in the kitchen. I feel like I'm dealing with children.\" Whitney takes off her lab coat and nurse's hat and lays them down on a recliner as you peak out in curiosity. You look in pure surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Whitney's coffee table was a human. He was a tan skinned man who had to be in his late 20s if not early 30s with brown hair worn in a ponytail and a beard. You heard Whitney was married to a human, now you know it's true.\" Whitney lets out a sigh and bends over as she smiles at Xander and Xander turns off his laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander smiles back at his giantess wife. \"Is that one girl causing you trouble Whitney? Sylvia I think it was.\" Whitney snorts and nods her head. \"She got out again. But this time I couldn't find her. But that coward will turn up.\" You shiver and decide to get out of the lab coat pocket and slide down the couch while nobody is looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander rubs Whitney's horn and then starts to take off his shirt. \"Baby, you need to relax. Don't let one unruly patient get you down. I think I know how to get your mind off of Sylvia.\" Whitney lets out a pleasured moan and then she undoes her bikini top and throws it to the side before you see her bikini bottom go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gag. Here was your archenemy, naked in front of you with her tiny husband. That was sick and wrong on so many levels. What could Xander possibly see in a giant fat rhinoceros woman. As Whitney waves her long red hair over her large rear, you remember that you have to get out at once and rush towards the door. If Whitney found you in her house, you'd be in serious trouble. She might even think you were trespassing. This was not your day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if you made it to the end, you would most likely have to deal with the dangers of Whitney's lawn, but it sure beats being in the same room as the giantess who mistook you for a criminal.</span></div></div>",

This car was heading for Fearfield. You grunt and then you slip through a gap to get into the trunk. You let out a sigh. Now all you have to do is follow the driver to Fearfield and find some way to get to Under Gloom. You gulped and were horrified that you'd even think about doing such a thing. \"Only for Wade,\" you say. \"Only for Wade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look around the trunk, you see that the windows were all painted black. Then you see a strange cooler like one for drinks and out of curiosity, you take a closer look and then scream because you wish you hadn't. Inside the cooler were large packets of blood. As you step back, you bump into something long and thin. It was a <i>coffin</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb up the coffin and you see the driver of the car was a purple skinned young woman, pear shaped and with long blonde hair. You looked at the rearview mirror and gasp because there's no reflection of the driver. This woman was a vampire! From the looks of it, the vampiress was on the phone. \"I'll be in the office first thing in the morning Lexi. I just had to pick up my new bed. It's not my fault the coffin shop in Fearfield is closed for repairs.\" \"Just make sure you're back in time to interview Governor Liza's opponent first thing tomorrow morning, Tara,\" says a voice coming from the cell phone. \"I want the Daily Tombstone to be the first to know. The early thunderbird gets the sand worm. Keep your head up.\" Tara lets out an angry hiss. \"What is that supposed to mean?! You think my head is ugly Lexi?!\" The voice on the phone, who you now know is named Lexi, lets out a sigh. \"Just be ready first thing tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, you decide to climb up the back seat of the car and look forward. You see something dangling from the mirror. It looked like a press pass, except instead of having a photograph, it had a painting of the reporter instead. Makes sense. Vampires don't appear in photographs. Suddenly, Tara hits a speed bump and you scream as you fall back and land in her coffin bed. The vibrations cause the coffin to slam shut and seal you in. Now you were very afraid. You were in a coffin the size of a skyscraper in a <i>vampire's</i> car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run and pound on the walls for hours as the vampiress drives to Fearfield. You don't know where Tara is, but from the sound of it, she stopped the car. You hear a door opening and a yawning noise. \"I'm not even waiting to go home. Time to see if this coffin was worth the 1500 skulls I paid for it.\" You freeze in fear as you hear the trunk open up and Tara climbs in. The next thing you know, Tara is opening the coffin. You look up and see a 550ft tall vampire girl wearing Batgirl pajamas, but then you look at her face and are horrified. Half her face looks normal but the other half is disfigured with charred skin, exposed muscles and missing lips, as if it was burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes the vampire giantess notice you in her coffin?</span></div></div>",

Her eyes fall on you for a moment, and you're about to yell out in fear, before they suddenly continue to glaze around the coffin, the darkness having kept her from noticing you. You breathe a sigh of relief. All too often you forget that you're bug sized in comparison to these creatures...something that may or may not be a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks comfortable.\" she says, and the coffin shifts slightly as the giantess begins to move around. You wonder what it is she's doing before her leg appears over the lid of the coffin, and you suddenly realize; she's about to sleep in here! You couldn't be stuck in here with her all night! Even if she was going to Fearville, she was still a gigantic vampire, and you were a tasty little ketchup packet. You try and climb up the violet fabric, but are unable to get a grip, the softness and smoothness of the surface making it impossible to scale. Damn the coffin company! Why couldn't they make a lower quality product?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention shifts to the massive purple skinned woman currently trying to fit inside the coffin, having lowered her lower body and now shifting to allow her upper body to get in...only to encounter a problem. \"...it's too small?!\" she complained, unable to fit her head inside the coffin all the way. She groaned, pulling her knees closer to her body to make room for her head. \"Well, it'll do for tonight...I just hope I can get this exchanged at the Fearville coffin shop...\" she mumbles, and grabs onto the lid of the coffin. The lid! You would be stuck in here if you didn't get out now! Running towards the vampire woman, hoping to scale her body just in time to slide out unnoticed, you immediately fall flat on your face as the velvet conforms under your legs like a trampoline, tripping you up. Before you can get up, the world is suddenly coated in darkness as a loud CLANK fills the coffin, nearly making you go deaf. Looks like you were staying in here for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly now, however, you realize that what she said earlier wasn't an understatement; it really was <i>too small</i>. Although your eyes had adjusted to the darkness, you could still barely see a thing, but you saw enough to know that the vampire nearly completely filled the coffin, her curves managing to fill out the coffin quite nicely, if a little uncomfortably. As she rested on her side, the only empty spaces were around her head and legs, and anything in between would be a tight squeeze as far as you could tell. God, you hope this woman didn't roll around in her sleep. You were currently in front of her large, unsightly face as it began to snore, the sound of which was nearly deafeningly loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn't be able to sleep in here...or at least, not next to her head. And you weren't sure you wanted to, honestly. You were in a coffin with a blood sucking monster. You needed to keep your guard up, and find a way to hitch a ride on her for tomorrow! Then again, it would do you no favors trying to rescue Wade exhausted...your pounding and yelling on the sides of the coffin wore you out pretty badly. You needed the energy for the morning. If you crawled passed her arms, legs, and the rest of her, you could rest easy on the opposite end of the coffin... But she could just as easily kill you or crush you in your sleep...decisions, decisions. </span></div></div>",

Her snoring, while already annoying, began to drive you a little insane as it went on and on. At the very least, it served to keep you from falling asleep, but that didn't make it any less annoying, and you found yourself really hoping she'd shut up. Wade had better be grateful that you endured this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA seemingly indescribable amount of time later, with you completely mentally and physically exhausted, you are suddenly blasted with Tara's powerful yawn, the sound of which threatened to burst your ear drums. She stretched her arms and legs, only to hit the walls of the coffin, and she opened her eyes, remembering what had happened the other day. Her eyes seemed to settle on you for a moment, but she didn't notice you, as she seemed to stare through you towards the walls of the coffin. \"Shit, what time is it?\" she muttered to herself, using a single outstretched arm to peel the lid off the coffin. Letting it fall to the side with a thud, she leaned her torso upwards and looked towards the front of the car. \"Crap! I have to be there in an hour!\" she said to herself, suddenly pulling herself out of the coffin. Seeing this, you snapped back to attention. Your ride was getting away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning towards her legs, now the only thing still contained within the coffin, you latch onto the knee of her batgirl pajamas, holding on as tight as you can as she clambers over the seats to reach the front seat from the trunk. You figure that if she's in a hurry, it's easier than getting protective clothing on, getting out of the car, and going around and getting in, although it's not exactly a smooth ride. Either way, within moments, you found yourself watching as she quickly turned on the car and peeled down the road, going 20 something over the speed limit, although it was hard to tell from your vantage point. And <i>speaking</i> of your vantage point...you were on this girls knee! You could stare straight up at her and her gross half-face, and she'll surely see you if she looks down towards you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly assessing the situation, you decide that you need to stay close to her if you ever want to get out of here. That being said, although she's currently busy breaking the law (or maybe not, you don't know enough about monster laws), your current position was still quite vulnerable.

You slide down the vampiress's leg and bounce off her chalk white toes and blood red nails as you land near the gas pedal and then have to get out of the way to avoid being crushed underfoot. You begin to pant and pant and pant just as she drives into a parking lot to park her car. Tara then grabs a notepad and pen. 'If I'm late,\" she says. \"Lexi is going to kill me.\" Tara almost leaps out of the car but has to step back as the sunlight nearly touches her and burns her. \"Ouch! Dammit! I almost forgot.\" Tara reached back into the car and takes out an umbrella to protect herself from the sun's rays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh because the vampiress was gone. From the looks of it, she was a newspaper reporter of some kind. That was perfect. At one point, one of the reporters would have to go to Under Gloom to cover a story of some kind. Then you can follow them and see if you can break Wade out. But then a thought occurred to you. You heard that Under Gloom was run by Warden Destiny Sirtis. You only knew about her through Whitney. Destiny and Whitney were college roommates. Whitney said that Destiny was a gargoyle and that she had quite a nasty temper on her. You really hope that you don't have to deal with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later you hear Tara return and from the looks of it, she got her story but she was embarrassed. \"That interview with Ms. Red would've gone better if I hadn't come in my pajamas,\" the vampiress says to herself. \"Note to self Tara, bring an alarm clock.\" You smile because you're going to get a ride to the newspaper building and hopefully to Under Gloom. Then maybe you'll be able to bust Wade out. Soon Tara reached her destination and you climb onto her sandal as she walks out of her car and into a large office building with a headstone on top of it that said \"the Daily Tombstone\". That must've been the name of the newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the building, you see all kinds of monsters. First, Tara walked past the day security guard who was a tannish yellow skinned and obese behemoth woman who appeared to have a skull tattoo on one of her butt cheeks from what you see at her butt crack. Tara then passes a red wooled-weresheep woman by a water cooler and an elderly green Chinese dragon woman. A black furred werewolf girl walked by and had to fight back the urge to laugh at the vampire girl in her pajamas. You rub your eyes and swear that the black wolf girl looked a lot like Diana, albeit not as morbidly obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampiress then walked up towards the editor's office. Outside was an obese tanuki woman who appeared to be slacking off and reading Manga while stuffing her face with donuts. The tanuki then stares at Tara. \"I don't want any guff from you, Kiki. One would think <i>you</i> would come to work in your pajamas.\" The tanuki goes back to reading before Tara enters the editor's office and you slide behind a potted plant as Tara speaks with her boss. \"Did you get the interview?\" asks who you assume is Lexi. \"Got it right here boss and I'm gonna type it up right now.\" \"Good, good, good gravy! Tara, I hope you didn't interview Ms. Red dressed in your pajamas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara stomps off and you get a good look at Lexi and become nervous. Lexi was a giant violet-furred and gray-haired sphinx with large wings and sharp teeth. She was wearing a business dress and circular glasses and like all sphinxes, walked on all fours. If she saw you, you were as good as snacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

This wolf girl looked similar to what you heard Persephone to look like, except that she was black with blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to see me, Lexi?\" asks the wolf girl. \"Yes, Hecate,\" says Lexi. \"I have a mission for you.\" \"Hecate?\" you think to yourself. \"That's the name of a Greek goddess associated with the underworld. She must be related to Diana. I didn't know Diana had another daughter. I hope this one isn't a man-eater like Persephone.\" Lexi then gives Hecate her mission. \"Listen, Hecate. I'm sorry to do this, but I must ask you to go to Under Gloom. There's going to be a parole hearing. Elaine Cotonza I believe.\" Hecate gives a sad look as Lexi lets out a sigh. \"I know your sister is there and I understand. You don't have...\" \"No,\" says Hecate. \"Persephone is locked up where she belongs. She brought it on herself. I'll go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she <i>was</i> Persephone's sister after all. From the sound of it, Hecate and Persephone didn't get along. Not surprising seeing as one of the sisters was a cannibalistic serial killer. But wait, Hecate was heading for Under Gloom. This was your big chance to rescue Wade. Wasting no time, you run and grab Persephone by the pant leg and crawl up into her back pocket just as she's leaving. You begin to shiver. Breaking into Under Gloom was not going to be easy and it wasn't going to be easy to get out. The monsters you were locked up with were mentally ill, but the monsters in Under Gloom were outright evil criminals. Wade had better appreciate what you're going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a car door open and Hecate enters her truck. Before you can do anything, she sits down, pinning you under her ass to the seat. You grunt as the wolf butt presses down on you and she starts the car. Thank goodness that Hecate is a lot less weighty than her mom. If Diana sat on you, you'd be nothing more than a ketchup stain on a wolf's overstuffed bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Hecate soon reaches Under Gloom and then you stick your head out her back pocket to inhale. Hecate walks up to a couple of guards, one of which was an enormously obese werehyena with spotted brown fur and red hair. The hyena giantess had a psychotic grin on her face and was butt-naked and even was sticking her tongue out. The other giantess was a fat and green grootslang, a monster resembling an elephant with scaly reptilian skin and a long cobra for a trunk that let out a hiss. The grootslang girl had blonde hair worn in a hairstyle that made her look like Clover of Totally Spies and also had large tusks like an African elephant. You then gasped because you forgot that the guards would strip search Hecate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other option you find yourself hiding between Hecate's butt cheeks as the strip search is going on. Thankfully, Hecate doesn't appear to feel you and her tail obscures you completely. You're sweating heavily and panting right before the guards give Hecate her pants back. You breathe a sigh of relief because you've gotten thus far and Hecate walks into Under Gloom. You quickly slide down her pant leg as she walks inside and you see several jail cells down the hall with monsters of all species locked inside. Some of them were even trying to tear down the bars. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remembered something. Under Gloom's warden. You heard that the warden's name was Destiny Sirtis and that she was Whitney's college roommate and best friend. From what Whitney said about Destiny, Destiny was a gargoyle and she had a rather volatile temper. She was said to be constantly pissed off and from what you heard, Wade was number one on her hate list. But, she <i>was</i> gargoyle. How mean could she be? That's what you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear loud stomping as if a particularly large monster was coming forward. You heard that Destiny was <i>much</i> bigger than any staff member or inmate in Under Gloom. \"Is the reporter from the Daily Tombstone here already?\" you hear the warden ask. \"Yes, ma'am.\" It was there you see Destiny show up and you look in horror as you learn what the feared warden of Under Gloom looked like. Destiny was a light blue-skinned and hourglass shaped gargoyle with long pinkish red hair worn in a style that looked like a cross between an Afro and a mullet and she also had large horns on her forehead that you could swear looked like they were in the shape of a crown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a gulp and begin to sweat. Aside from having a pinker tone in her hair, Destiny was completely identical to Demona. Come to think of it, you never noticed before how much Whitney resembled Fox. But that was beside the point. You can tell from looking at Destiny that she was not somebody to pick a fight with. Then you get an awful thought. Destiny might actually be more aggressive than Whitney. She's a prison warden so unlike Whitney who's courteous towards the patients, Destiny would probably have nothing but hate and malice towards the inmates. One thing's for sure, if Destiny saw you trying to break Wade out of prison, you were dead meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny gestures for Hecate to follow her as she and the werewolf walk away and then you run down another hallway so nobody sees you. This definitely wasn't going to be easy.</span></div></div>",

You could easily drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you close your eyes, you turn your head away from Tara's face. You didn't want to see that horrifying visage one more time.

You see lava bubbling and out from the lava comes a giant stone gargoyle's hand that looks melted to the bone. The hand opens up and you see Wade reaching out to you. \"Sylvia!\" he yells as he begins to melt. \"Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you see the dream Wade melting, you grunt and scream because the nightmare Whitney has picked you up and held you over her jaws. The giant demonic nightmare rhino raises you into the air and snorts. \"You are a criminal Sylvia,\" says Nightmare Whitney. \"Which is why you're going straight to hell.\" The nightmare whitney opens her mouth to reveal a fiery pit inside and drops you screaming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nightmare Whitney snaps her mouth shut, you wake screaming from your dream and pant.

She was wrapped up to her neck in yellow gauze but despite being a mummy, she looked like a dark skinned human girl with long green hair worn in dreadlocks with scarab shaped gold earrings. Tara was talking to a gremlin dressed like a clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I paid 1500 skulls for this coffin in Terrordale,\" says Tara explaining her case. \"But big surprise, it's too small.\" \"It's not too small,\" says the gremlin clerk. \"You're just too pear-shaped.\" \"Excuse me?\" asks Tara sounding angry. \"Are you calling me fat?!\" \"No, no, no. But you do have a little junk in the trunk.\" Tara hisses and slaps the gremlin in his face. \"Jerk!\" \"Calm down Tara,\" says the mummy girl. \"I'm certain you can exchange it.\" Tara lets out a hiss. \"Better be careful Cleotiti,\" she says. \"I'm not the only one picking a bed out. They just better not gyp you too.\" The gremlin gets up to escort Tara to buy a new coffin. \"Right this way to our plus sized vampire section.\" He jokes. Tara hisses angrily and then Cleotiti turns to see a succubus girl wheeling out a large golden sarcophagus with cobras and hippopotami painted on the sides and emeralds embedded into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleotiti squees with delight as she looks at it. \"You're in luck Ms. Cleotiti,\" says the succubus. \"Your new bed just arrived.\" \"Ooh,\" says Cleotiti. \"It looks so faboo.

You had to get out fast before<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>KLANK<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust your luck, outside the succubus selling the sarcophagus to Cleo shut the casket as Cleo was paying for the golden tomb. \"I can't wait to try it out,\" she says. \"It'll be the best sleep I've had since before I was mummified.\" Inside you scream and bang on the sarcophagus walls before you feel movement. This was bad, they must've been moving the sarcophagus to Cleo's car. Oh, this was horrible. You break down and cry. You escaped from a vampire's coffin, only to be trapped in a mummy case. It's like taking one step forward and eight steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, you couldn't cry. You had to be preserving oxygen. Oh, you really hope you can last in this coffin without suffocating. For hours, you're trapped in the mummy's tomb. You take it Cleo was busy with errands and wouldn't be home for a while. If you get out of this alive, Wade had better appreciate it.

As you struggle, you get tangled in the mummy's wrappings and wind up wedged between her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a groan. Stuck to a giant mummy's butt.

You're now suddenly very afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look forward to see a giant chalk white cleavage wearing a Batgirl t-shirt and then look up to see Tara's half disfigured face staring down at you with hungry eyes. \"Look who finally decided to wake up.\" The vampiress says as she shows you her fangs. You could see her drooling and you realize just what Tara has in store for you. \"P-Please,\" you plead. \"This is all a big mistake.\" Tara scoffs and holds up a knife and fork. \"Yeah, you made a big mistake sleeping in my coffin. What do you think vampires do to humans? Well, now that I've got breakfast ready, here's what I'm going to do. First I'm going to drain every last drop of blood from your teeny weeny human body and then I'm going to chew your bones.\" Tara licks her giant purple lips at that and you get a look at her gruesome face as you shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't eat me! I was just trying to get to my boyfriend! I don't want to be eaten by a skyscraper sized vampire and get stuck to the fat on your ginormous ass.\" You gasp at what you say and from the looks of it, Tara is offended as she hisses. \"Oh, I'm definitely going to enjoy eating you, you insulting little bug.\" Damn. You had to have run into an easily-provoked vampiress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara holds up her knife and fork and laughs evilly as you scream. First she squeezes an entire ketchup bottle over her breakfast, soaking you in some as you scream and the ketchup gets in your eyes. Figures she'd go overboard with something that reminded her so much of her favorite drink; blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Tara has covered the plate in ketchup, she uses her fork to devour her eggs like some sort of ravenous beast and then gets to work on the tater tots. You look up in fear and disgust. Because half her face is charred, that means Tara is missing part of her lips and has half her mouth exposed, meaning she was effectively chewing with half her mouth open. The sight made you sick as ketchup leaked down her jaw. You then watch her pick up each strip of bacon and munch on each piece until they're all gone. Finally, you watch as Tara guzzles that huge glass of blood and you see some of it drizzle through her exposed jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampiress then looks at you and you look up in fear. You were the last part of her breakfast and she was licking her fangs, ready to suck you dry and chew the rest into dust. You shiver in place and hope for a miracle.</span></div></div>",

In the front of the car, there are actually two monsters. A married couple from the looks of it. The driver was a male golem with red brick like skin, beady eyes and it didn't look like he had a mouth. He sort of looked like the Thing. The wife of the couple (at least you think its a woman) was a skeleton with long reddish brown hair (obviously a wig) and surprisingly her bones were bright red at the moment, as if she was burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear strange noises and you look up to see you're not alone in the backseat. Apparently these monsters had a daughter, a teenager form the looks of it and she looked really strange. She was a gigantic green skinned girl who looked like she was made of felt. She had yellow button like eyes and a zipper where her mouth should've been. You see that she has mitten like hands and didn't appear to have any fingers other than her thumbs and appeared to be playing a handheld video-game. The girl looked like a rag doll. Given that her father is a manmade golem and her mother is an undead skeleton, you take it she was either adopted or artificially created herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the front, the skeleton woman groans as she feels herself. \"It happens every time,\" says her golem husband. \"We go to the beach and you end up getting fried. How do you sunburn bones anyway Meryl?\" \"Shut up, Flint,\" says the skeleton woman. \"It's not as if that was the worst part of our vacation. You should know better than trying to surf. You're a golem. You know you can't even swim.\" Flint just blushes at that thought. \"Well,\" he says. \"At least we'll be back in Dreadberry by the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dreadberry!?\" you ask to yourself. This was just terrific. \"You were on your way to Dreadberry. That was miles away from Fearfield. You didn't know much about Dreadberry, but you knew it was out in the boonies. You're a Kansas girl born and raised but you don't want to take chances with monster yokels. You then look and see that right behind you is the rag doll girl's purse.

Being held in the air <i>like</i> a doll, <u>by</u> a doll. If you weren't so scared, you'd find it ironic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please don't hurt me.\" You beg.\" Emerald unzips the zipper on her mouth before she speaks to you in a childish sounding voice. \"Why would I want to hurt you? What were you doing in my bag?\" You look forward and you're still shocked as Emerald takes you closer to her eye. You freeze but Emerald smiles at you. \"Relax,\" she says. \"I don't harm humans. In case you haven't noticed, my mom used to be one. My uncle's even human.\" You then realize this is true. Emerald's mother, Meryl, she was a skeleton but she looked like a <i>human</i> skeleton. You breathe out a sigh of relief before Emerald holds up a giant hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Emerald by the way.\" She says with a smile. You look at her giant mitten shaped hand and nervously shake it. \"Sylvia. I'm sorry, it's just. What exactly are you?\" \"I'm a rag doll,\" says Emerald. \"You see, Mom and Dad were jealous when Uncle Neil and Aunt Maggie were expecting, because they couldn't have kids themselves in the tradition way. But Mom found a spell book in the library and found a spell that could bring inanimate objects to life. So Dad stitched me together from felt, Mom cast the spell and the rest is history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat really frightened you. This girl might've been born through black magic. A spell that could give life to toys? That can't possibly be any good. \"And you?\" asks Emerald. You didn't know how to break it to Emerald and from the looks of it, her parents didn't even notice your conversation with their daughter. You let out a sigh and then come clean. \"If you must know, I broke out of the K.D.P.\" \"K.D.What?\" asks Emerald. Obviously Emerald had never heard of the K.D.P.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out another sigh. \"It's a mental hospital for monsters and no place for a human. I was in there for a crime I didn't commit and I need to get to Fearfield A.S.A.P.\" Emerald smiles at that. \"Well, you're in luck. Aunt Maggie is the sheriff in Dreadberry. Maybe she could help you.\" You couldn't believe it. What luck. Wait, if this 'Aunt Maggie' was the sheriff, how would you explain that you were needed to get to Fearfield to get Wade out of prison. Also, you don't know what species this Aunt Maggie even was. You doubt that they'd let a human be sheriff of a monster town so she obviously had to be related by marriage and it's doubtful she's the same species as either of her in-laws. But Emerald said her uncle was human so if Maggie was married to a human, she was probably harmless. You hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, what now?</span></div></div>",

She resembled a chubby Hawaiian woman with blonde hair and a starfish at the side of her head. However, you see her driver's license on the visor and read it. \"Joanne Xever,\" you read. \"Species: Mermaid. Screamtown Driving School.\" You had never heard of Screamtown. But wait, how could a mermaid drive a car. Mermaids couldn't survive outside of the water because otherwise they were completely immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a closer look and see that Joanne had a pair of mechanical legs attached to a harness she was wearing. That would explain it. But then you gasp. The only other mermaid you knew was Paisley, a mermaid that lived in the ocean by the K.D.P. and she was a man-eater. What if Joanne saw you and decided you'd make a snack. Given how fat she was, she could probably wipe a human city off the map. Fortunately she hadn't seen you and you walk behind her seat to prevent Joanne from spotting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nice to see my cousins,\" says Joanne. \"But it will be good to go back to good old Screamtown.\" Five hours later, you reach Screamtown and decide to climb up to the window. You wanted to see what kind of horrors this monster town had in store for you. At the entrance, you find that Screamtown looked a lot like Terrordale since it was at a beach. But what you see outside makes your jaw drop. There were giant monsters much bigger than the ones of Terrordale but there were humans around them that weren't being stepped on or eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a kappa swimming in the water as humans rode on top of his shell, an elderly human playing chess with an elderly gargoyle and there was even a succubus sunbathing as a male human rubbed sunscreen on her back. \"What the hell?\" you ask as Joanne parks the car. You immediately run across the window and leap onto the back of Joanne's bra as the mermaid giantess uses her mechanical legs to walk out. You still couldn't believe it. There were humans and monsters living together peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even a family on the beach that consisted of male humans and female hellhounds. Hellhounds <i>eat</i> humans. You couldn't wrap your head around this one. Most of the monsters on the beach were human eating species but none of them were making a grab at the humans around them. You slide down Joanne's bra and tail and then you walk along the beach looking around in confuse. Just what kind of weird place is this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

It was really odd that none of the humans in the area were showing any fear of the monsters. You even see a group of human children playing on the belly of a sleeping behemoth woman. Most of these monsters were man-eaters and yet none of them were attacking the humans. As you're pondering your situation, you look and see what looks like a staircase. At the bottom was a sign that read, \"Bus Stop\". There were other humans at the top, so you quickly run up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see one woman carrying groceries and tap her on the shoulder to get her attention. \"Excuse me,\" you say. \"When does the bus get here.\" \"You're obviously not from around here,\" says the woman. \"It isn't exactly a bus.\" It was there you hear rumbling and soon before you is a giant deer woman with golden bejeweled horns. She had bluish fur and muscular arms and legs but a big bulging stomach. \"All aboard that's going aboard!\" she yells. You let out a scream as soon as you see her, getting her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't eat us!\" you shout as you crouch. All the other humans look at you as if you're crazy and the deer woman raises an eye. \"Eat you? Are you lo lo loopy?\" \"B-B-But you're a weredeer. The only other weredeer I know eats...\" The deer woman gives a glare. \"Who you calling a were deer? I'm a Ceryneian Hind. There's a difference. I'll have you know, I'm the last Ceryneian Hind, so show me some respect. The name's Hera in case you want to know. You want a ride in my belly bag or do you just want to waste my time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what to make of this. This Ceryneian Hind was basically a giant taxi. You figure you might as well get in line as she unzips her fanny pack and reveals several seats inside. \"Where to girly?\" she asks. \"You're in Summer Side so it's either Autumn Avenue, Winter Way or Springtime Street?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You take your seat next to a woman with a giggling baby as everyone walks inside and Hera zips the bag before she starts to run and you feel her movie. You couldn't wrap your head around this. You've been in this strange town filled with giant monsters and yet none of them were trying to eat you. Not only that, but this giant muscle-gutted Ceryneian Hind was acting as a taxi for the humans. You inch to the woman next to you before you ask her what is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why isn't anyone afraid of the monsters? What's going on with this town.\" \"You're obviously not from around here, young lady,\" says the woman as she bottle feeds her baby. \"This is Scream Town. No monster eats humans here. When Mayor Gacks came into power, she outlawed human consumption and turned Scream Town into a safe haven. Here, humans and monsters live together in harmony. Even monsters like succubi, werewolves, hellhounds and wendigos are completely harmless here.\" You couldn't believe it. A town where humans live alongside monsters without fear of getting eaten. \"You're kidding,\" you say. \"No monsters eat humans here?\" \"Not one,\" says the woman. \"The closest thing to a predator is one pink furred weresheep in Winter Way and even she can't gulp us down unless she wants to go to jail. The wereboar librarian even has a human husband.\" You couldn't believe it. You shake your head. \"Autumn Avenue and Winter Way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman lets out a laugh as her baby laughs as well. \"Screamtown is separated into five parts. First is the center but the four corners are each permanently locked in one of the four seasons; Springtime Street, Summer Side, Autumn Avenue and Winter Way.\" Now that was just weird.\" Soon, Hera stops and unzips her belly bag. \"Time to get out everyone.\" Says Hera as everyone walks out onto another terminal. You walk out and are in surprise. All the trees are decorated with yellow, orange, red and brown leaves and there is one garden where a big magenta mock turtle woman is tending to pumpkins. You walk down the steps and see several leaves all as big as buses. You look up and see a behemoth woman walking by as she carries a purse decorated like a school bus. It even has several human children inside. You then turn to see a dragon playing Chinese checkers with an elderly human woman. It amazed you that Screamtown was free of hostilities between humans and monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel tremors and look up to see somebody walk up towards you. It was a monster girl, pachydermic given her huge flat feet. You look up and see that she appears to be wearing, fishnet stockings, a black miniskirt with a pair of purple panties covered in skulls. You scream at the sight and the giantess stops in her tracks. You step back and you can't even see the giantess's face past her enormous bulging belly and her titanic breasts that would be the size of pumpkins if she was human sized. The giantess bends down and you try to run but then you scream as she grabs you by the leg and pulls you up. You then gasp because you look in the face of a giantess were rhino who had to be close to the same size as Whitney. She even looked like Whitney, except for a few minor details; Her skin was a dark, almost blackish shade of gray in contrast to Whitney's albino hide, she had long black hair in contrast to Whitney's red hair and finally, she had black lipstick that contrasted with Whitney's red lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" says the rhino giantess. \"I kinda, almost stepped on you.\" You're in too much fear to speak. After all, all your experiences with Whitney made you scared to death of rhinos. \"Y-You're not gonna eat me are you Ms. Wererhino Goddess?\" you ask forgetting about the law in Screamtown. The gothic rhino goddess rolls her eyes. \"Even if it were legal, I wouldn't swallow you. I'm a vegetarian. I don't even eat dinosaurs. But that doesn't mean I don't like being heavy. It's considered attractive for girls of my race. You're obviously a newcomer. I better show you around.\" The were rhino goth puts you on her left boob and you have to hold on tight as she walks, making her body jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she seemed a lot less aggressive than Whitney. This goth girl sounded harmless. But you couldn't help but think of Whitney when you look at her. \"Uh,\" you say. \"You wouldn't happen to know anyone named Whitney would you?\" The goth rhino raises an eyebrow at that subject. \"How do you know my big sister?\" she asks. You mentally gasp. Whitney's sister? You didn't even know Whitney had a sister. From the looks of it, Whitney's sister was either in the monster equivalent of her late teens to early twenties, making her the younger sister. But you had no idea if Whitney told her sister about you or how close they even were. You have to hide for now. You definitely can't tell her your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't. Just curious. My name is Sil... uh Cynthia. How about you.\" Whitney's sister lets out a snort. \"The name my father gave me is Noreen,\" she says. \"But I don't like it. Everyone calls me Shego and I like that name a lot better.\" \"Shego?\" you ask. \"As in the villain from Kim Possible? Why would you want to be called that?\" Noreen just smiles. \"I like her style. I also think she looks a lot like me. Whitney doesn't understand though. She doesn't like human cartoons. Personally, I think she's wound a bit too tight.\" You let out a laugh. You never though you'd be having a pleasant conversation with your arch enemy's kid sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then slip slightly and Noreen uses one of her black fingernails to push you to the safety of her cleavage. \"I better show you around Screamtown, Cynthia.\" Says the goth goddess. Where does the wererhino queen of the goths take you?</span></div></div>",

Books are my friends.\" She was definitely more mellow than her big sister. You wonder how she could possibly be related to Whitney. As Noreen walks into the library, you gasp and start to hide in her cleavage the moment you get a look at the librarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe librarian was a giant cobalt blue were boar who was the same size as Noreen and just as obese. She had long white hair reaching down to her porcine booty that was sitting in two chairs and four long sharp yellowish tusks with fangs for the rest of her teeth. She was wearing a black tank top and white pants that looked ready to come off at the seams given that her underwear was clearly visible. You had a great fear of pig women ever since Mandy put you in a soda and tried to swallow you, <i>for fun</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Ororo.\" Says Noreen to the boar woman.\" You then take a closer look to see that the were boar giantess had her fingernails on the table and there was a human tending to them. He resembled an older looking African American man with graying hair. \"Oh,\" says the human. \"Hey Shego.\" Noreen looks down at the human and shrugs her shoulders. \"Sorry Gordon, didn't see you there.\" You decide to come out of hiding, from the looks of the ring on Ororo, the were boar woman's finger, that human was her husband. Guess Whitney isn't the only monster to take a human lover. \"Looks like you have a friend there,\" says Gordon. \"Haven't seen her around these parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro simply lets out a snort. \"Just make she she don't 'cause any trouble,\" says the pig giantess in what seems to be a Kenyan accent. \"Ah don't like troublemakers.\" You turn to the table and see another human, one who looked similar to Gordon but in his twenties, walking up to Ororo's other hand. \"Come on, Mom,\" says the young man. \"She's probably new in town, don't scare her.\" \"Mom!?\" you yell in confusion. It was one thing that Whitney had a human husband, but Ororo appeared to have a human stepson as well. \"Cynthia,\" says Noreen. \"Meet Jasper, Ororo's son.\" You wave and Jasper waves back. Noreen lowers her head to speak with you. \"Don't get too attached, he's dating a pegasus.\" You didn't care about that, you already had Wade. But for a monster to have a human mate and child, this Screamtown really was a paragon of human monster unity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel motion again and Whitney is walking further into the library. \"Noreen?\" Noreen didn't answer. \"Shego,\" you say in exasperation. \"Your sister wouldn't happen to be married to a human would she?\" You knew the answer was yes but you didn't want to make Noreen suspicious. Noreen lets out a sigh. \"Yeah. She married some geek she met in New York a few years ago. Between you and me, I don't trust him. He sorta makes my skin crawl and since I have <b>very</b> thick skin, that's an accomplishment.\" You nod your head. \"And how close are you to Whitney?\" Noreen shrugs her shoulders. \"We don't hate each other if that's what you're wondering. I stay in touch with her and all, but we don't have a lot in common.\" That was a relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen reaches into her purse and takes out her wallet and shows you what looks like an old photograph of Whitney and Noreen. In the photograph, Whitney doesn't seem to look any younger, but Noreen is shown as only a child, barely reaching her sister's knee. Wow. That meant the age difference between the sisters was <i>huge</i>. No wonder Noreen wasn't as uptight as Whitney. Noreen wasn't that much older than a teenager. Heck, she looked young enough that Whitney could've raised her herself. You then flip the photograph to see an updated picture of Whitney, Noreen and their family. From the looks of it, Whitney's mother was a grayish green skinned were rhino with long reddish blonde hair. She looked like a Sumatran rhinoceros and seemed to be built like her daughters and just as gigantic but her breasts looked nearly twice as big as Whitney's, which was no small task. It was amazing she could stand up. Whitney's mom looked extraordinary for her age given how old Whitney would have to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see Whitney and Noreen's father in the photograph and you're surprised. Their father was a lanky half white-skinned and half black-skinned spriggan barely reaching up to his wife's knee. He had long white hair worn in a ponytail with red eyed and a grim look on his face that you guess Whitney must get it from. \"Your dad is a spriggan?\" you ask Noreen in surprise. Noreen nodded her head. \"Whitney and I are were rhinos, I didn't say we were <i>100%</i> were rhinos. You couldn't believe it. Whitney was half-spriggan? You wouldn't tell by looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" says Noreen. \"You said you were new. Which part of town do you live in?\" You twitch your fingers, really hoping not to expose who you really are. \"I don't really have a place to live yet.\" \"Really?\" asks Noreen with a smirk. \"In that case, maybe I can solve that problem by keeping you as a pet.\" You let out a laugh at Noreen's joke, at least you hope it was a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust which part of the library is Noreen taking you to look at books?</span></div></div>",

And watch out; not all of us monsters watch where we're going...I know a guy who's been a seat cushion for half the girls in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, taken aback at her offer. You didn't think that Noreen would let you go, after that 'pet' comment. Aloud: \"Sure, Nor--er, Shego. I'll let you know if I need to get down.\" You fit in a smile that Noreen returns as she looks back up, but mentally kick yourself for almost forgetting to use her nickname. Even knowing any of the horrors you'd seen done to humans at the KDP were illegal in Screamtown, hard-learned instincts died hard--you couldn't shake a lingering fear of annoying Noreen...that something as small as using a name she didn't like would end <i>painfully</i> for you. She couldn't--wouldn't---eat you, but still--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tap on your head snaps you out of your reverie and makes you flinch. As you come back to your senses, you notice Noreen looking down at you again. \"You alright there, Cynthia? You were spacing out...didn't say a word since I asked if you wanted to browse.\" She reaches into her cleavage, dark grey fingers closing in around you, and gently lifts you up to her face to examine you closer. \"When I told you we'd gotten to the fantasy section, you didn't even bat an eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a considerable effort to look at her face, and not just her mouth, as KDP-borne panic responses try to trigger. \"Just...daydreaming. Got lost in my head for a bit, there. Nothing to worry over, really.\" You're almost surprised at how casual you're able to sound. Were you better at faking it than you thought, or had you already settled in to this oddball town? \"But don't mind me; let's look through some books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goth titaness raises an eybrow for a moment, but shrugs it off. \"Fine by me. I'll put you on my shoulder so you can get a better view...just remember to hold on.\" With that, she plucks you from her palm with her free hand and sets you on her shoulder. When you grab onto her shirt, Noreen sets to browsing through the bookshelves, pointing you towards the human-sized copies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Which <i>would</i> have been helpful, <i>if</i> anything you saw grabbed your interest. You <i>did</i> like a good fantasy romp, but some part of you was still reeling from being at the KDP. It would be a while before you could even READ about dragons and the like trying to eat tiny heroes without getting nightmares.  And, ever since meeting Wade, you hadn't really dove into a series like you did before hooking up with him. His vitriol toward monsters was so bad he even hated <i>stories</i> about them, even if they were the villains. Just seeing you reading a book about dragons (that you'd had since you were a kid) had put him in such a bad mood one time that it took half an hour of arguing to convince him not to throw it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe a history book about Screamtown, or some newspapers? If you were going to lay low here, it'd be a good idea to get a feel for the place. Then again, you didn't fancy ending up as a seat cushion for a monster either, accidentally or otherwise....</span></div></div>",

There were several books that had titles such as the Blue Comet and the Indigo Emperor and appeared to be written by someone named Olga K. Rowling. However, you decided to walk further towards other sections of the library. After all, what the hell would <i>monsters</i> consider to be fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about staying where Noreen could see you but then shrug your shoulders. You could hardly tell Noreen was related to Whitney. They didn't seem anything alike. Then you remember that Noreen sounded similar to \"noir\" the French word for \"black\". Whitney and Noreen's folks must've thought it would be funny to name their daughters after opposite colors. Maybe you should stay with Noreen. Then again, if Whitney called or visited her sister, your goose was cooked. You'd cross that bridge when you got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down through the human walkway of the library and you see all manner of monsters in all sections of the library. You saw an obese golden furred were tigress in a steampunk outfit flipping through a book in the science fiction section and quickly run by. You know it's illegal in this weird town to eat humans, but there was no way you were taking chances with a were tiger that looked bigger than even Whitney. You feel vibrations and the next monster to walk by was a pink skinned gargoyle who looked even bigger than the were tigress. This gargoyle was dressed in attire similar to Dr. West, however this gargoyle sure didn't look like Eartha. Instead, she had a large beak for a mouth that made her look even scarier than Eartha. You then look ahead to the a section that seemed to be under tight lockup. There was a sign on that hallway that read \"Wizards Only, Fools\". You take it that's where they keep the spell books. There was one monster walking inside that caught your attention because she was even bigger than the gargoyle woman. She was a pot-bellied unicorn with silver fur, blonde hair, a pink horn and wings. She was dressed in a pink gown a witch would wear and a silver tiara. So Amalthea wasn't the last unicorn after all. If only she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to shiver. Most monsters you've seen in this crazy town were around the 900ft bracket and beyond. They sure grow them big here. That only made you feel even smaller than you normally do. You let out a sigh and make your way to the comic and graphic novel section. You never were into comic books but maybe you could find something funny to get your mind off of this weird place. As you pick up a human sized book, you hear stomping and realize that there is a shelf above you with monster sized graphic novels. You then turn your head and look in surprise. The monster in front of you was a 1000ft Nemean Lioness, obese in shape with black fur and golden blonde hair with a pair of small glasses. You don't know much about comic books but that was definitely a Hellcat costume she was wearing. By that you are referring to the comic book character, not the monster species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively step back. This woman might be an escaped patient. For all you knew, there was a Screamtown version of the K.D.P. around here somewhere. You step back to try and get away but unfortunately you were carrying a book when the lioness startled you and you dropped it. You slip on the book and yell as you fall off the railing into the lion woman's purse. You grunt and gasp as you look up. You look at the driver's license in the purse and see that this lioness is named Pauline Pride. You didn't know if she was friends with Noreen's but you really don't want to be in this purse longer than you have to. From one cage to the next.</span></div></div>",

Now you were back to square one. The were rhino giantess lowers her head and snorts angrily as her titanic face looms in front of you. It didn't help that she was naked at the time. \"You have a lot of gall you little creep!\" yells Whitney. \"First you break out of the K.D.P. and now you're trespassing in my own house!? I should feed you to Lilith or Cyprus for this! If this doesn't prove you're a criminal nothing will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Whitney is intimidating you, she feels a tugging on her tail and turns around to see Xander letting out a sigh. \"Whitney,\" he says. \"Calm down.

I let her get me out of the mood for....\" Xander taps Whitney's hip and smiles at her. \"Don't worry about it. Just stay calm.\" Whitney smiles and bends down and you look away as she kisses Xander. How on earth could that guy stand being married to that pachyderm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney begins to walk away towards the kitchen. \"I'll deal with you tomorrow Sylvia,\" the rhinoceros woman says. \"But for now, I've got to prepare dinner, not that <i>you're</i> getting any. You're just lucky I'm a vegetarian.\" You don't feel lucky and let out a sigh, looking down so you don't see Whitney's naked ass as she's making her way to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXander shakes his head and walks up to you. \"I knew she had a temper when I married her, but she's just no fun when she gets this mad. You must be the one she's always complaining about. Sylvia was it?\" You gulp and look at Xander in the eye as he crosses his arms. \"What do you see in that woman?\" you ask him. Xander smiles and shrugs his shoulders. \"So I like big women, especially if they happen to be fiery redheads. Rowr.\" Xander stares at his wife as she bends over to get the oven ready and you shiver before he turns to you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whitney tells me you faked insanity to avoid going to prison. Is this true?\" \"Well,\" you say. \"I didn't have any choice! I wouldn't last five seconds in a monster prison! I was framed!\" Xander nods his head. \"Aha. Can you prove it?\" You're shocked. You realize you don't have any proof that you were framed and that's why you couldn't convince Whitney otherwise. \"No.\" You sadly say. Xander lets out a sigh. \"Well, I don't like your chances. Especially with Whitney. She can be downright monstrous when she's this mad at somebody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crouch and wonder what to do before you hear stomping again and then look up. You cover your eyes and scream as the naked wererhino nurse looks down at you. \"You better not be making any moves at my Xander, Sylvia. You're in enough trouble as it is. Come on Xander, time for dinner.\" Xander jumps into his wife's hand as she takes him to the dinner table.\" You let out a a sigh. The next day Whitney was going to punish you severely and you didn't even have a last meal to look forward to.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you hide in Whitney's pocket, the white rhino giantess walks into her car. Whitney's car was a large green car that looked like a hybrid between a 4WD and a monster truck. Whitney unlocks the car door and then she gets in, puts on her seatbelt and turns the key. As the car turns on, you have to hide in the bottom of the rhino's pocket and hold on tight as she takes off and drives away from the beach. It isn't long before she reaches a house on a hill overlooking all of Terrordale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see Whitney smiling. \"Hmm,\" she says. \"Pepper sure chose a good spot. I'll bet she can see all of Terrordale from here.\" \"Pepper?\" you wonder to yourself. Whitney must be visiting a friend of hers. Whitney parked her car in \"Pepper\"'s driveway and then walks out, with you shaking all the way in her pocket. You then grunt because Whitney tosses her keys into the pocket and nearly gored you. You're panting and then you hear Whitney knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look out, you see another wererhinoceros woman. She was just as big and fat as Whitney was, but she looked radically different. This rhino woman had a more grayish lavender skin and short reddish brown hair that was worn in a bun. She had two blackish gray horns, but they looked bigger than Whitney's. The bigger horn had to be at least three hundred feet long which was the same height as the shortest adult monster. She also had thick fur covering all of her body except for her face and hands. She resembled a woolly rhinoceros. She was wearing a red A-shirt and a large yellow skirt that looked like a bell pepper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whitney,\" says the woolly rhino woman as she walks forward. \"What's shaking, cousin.\" \"Cousin?!\" you think to yourself. Whitney and Pepper hug tight, nearly smashing you to paste as the pocket you're in is squished between their thick armored thighs. You nearly gag as you're squeezed. \"Nothing major, Pepper,\" says Whitney. \"I just got out of work.\" Pepper let out a grunt. \"Don't even talk to me about work. This town is going to hell. Today alone, some punks from Horrorville tried to spray paint town hall. Work sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney lets out a laugh and she hangs up her coat. \"Well, you're the new police commissioner.\" You slip out of Whitney's pocket and then gasp. Whitney's cousin was the police commissioner of Terrordale. You even see a hung up coat with her badge that read \"Pepper Chavez, Commissioner, Terrordale Police\". A misunderstanding with the police is what got you in the KDP in the first place. You were now very afraid. From the looks of it, there were several boxes that implied that Pepper had just moved into this house. From the looks of it, Whitney was helping her cousin unpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a great place you just bought,\" says Whitney as she unpacks a few DVDs. \"Nice view of the entire town. \"I like it,\" says Pepper as she shakes her big booty. \"I just wish I wasn't up here alone.\" \"Oh,\" says Whitney. \"Don't worry, a can like that should get you a man soon. How do you think I bagged Xander?\" Pepper lets out a scoff. \"Man?\" she asks. \"Whitney, you know I'm a lesbian.\" \"Lesbian?\" you ask. Lesbian monsters made you nervous given that you had the misfortune to be a tiny little Barbie doll to these horny girl titans. This woman sounded like she would be as dangerous as Tress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're making your way to the door when Pepper starts hanging pictures and accidentally drops a nail. \"Dammit!\" the woolly rhino yells. The nail rolls towards you and your eyes pop out. That was bad luck. Which of the wererhino giantesses bends down to pick up the nail and spot you? It would no doubt be bad if Whitney saw you out of the KDP but then there was her cousin who was a cop and a lesbian. You are screwed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich rhino giantesses spots you before the other one?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you struggle to scale the giant rhinoceros's bottom, regretting skimping out on rope climbing class in high school, you can't help but let out a yell as Whitney suddenly stands up, her behind turning completely vertical. You gasp and struggle to get a grip on her tail as you lose your footing on her bikini, and helplessly slide down the rough surface, rapidly approaching the end and getting dangerously closing to falling off. Your only saving grace is that the Wererhino miraculously hadn't noticed you yet, but that wouldn't amount to much if you found yourself battered and broken on the expansive tiled floor, waiting to be crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar above you, Whitney grumbled to herself, still angry about losing Sylvia. \"The bitch is gonna pay...\" she says quietly, walking through the halls while still looking for any signs of you. She knew you wouldn't last long wandering around the halls of the mental ward, and while she didn't care if some other monster killed you, she wanted the chance to punish you <i>personally</i>... which could very well be a fate worse than death, for all you knew. She was so lost in thought, she hardly noticed as a hand absentmindedly lowered itself under her the hem of her nurse outfit to scratch an annoying itch on her behind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tail you tried to hold onto whipped around too and fro, threatening to send you flying away or atleast make you throw up, you barely notice the approaching hand as it grasps the base of its tail with its thumb, scratching the length of it with her other fingers. The shaking stops, which is only a momentary respite as you try to gather yourself, noticing the pudgy hand approaching to scratch the \"itch\" that is desperately trying to hang on. Standing up on the shaky surface, you don't know what to do. In a matter of seconds she'd be scratching the tip of her tail, where you were, and then she'd <i>really</i> feel you. Getting to your feet (a task made difficult by the constant movement of the rhino), you turn around, unsure of what to do. Then you see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping at about the base of her tail in height (which exposed her bikini bottom to the world, which really should be against some kind of rule for hospital uniforms) was the bottom of her unfitting nurse uniform, the flaps flapping about freely. They were quite close to the end of the tail, and if you put your all into it, you may be able to reach it and get some-place a little less shaky and finally be off Whitney. Only problem is, if you were having trouble scaling her before, scaling the sheer surface of the nurse's outfit would be a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time to decide, however, as the rhino's grey fingers barrel towards you, and you leap off the shaky surface of the tail, not gaining nearly as much height and distance as you hoped. Screaming as you fall, you close your eyes and frantically wave your arms around, trying to grab the nearest surface to stop your fall. To your luck, you do end up grabbing something, and slowly open your eyes, wondering what it is you've latched onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you made it to Whitney's uniform, only now you were sliding down the slick surface, and screaming again. Whitney, your ride, suddenly freezes up as she hears your voice, causing the uniform to slam against her skin, threatening to send you falling to the ground. \"Did I just...?\" she says quietly, looking around the room to find the source of your voice. Shaking her head, she continued walking to wherever she was going. \"I'll find you, you lying whore...\" she mutters to herself, completely unaware of your presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, while the uniform was stationary, you managed to stop sliding down the uniform, using your legs and arms to hold on as tightly as possible. You were too afraid to climb any further; you might fall off, or she'll feel you, or what have you...but if you stay still, anybody looking at the rhino's behind would spot you, and who knows what'd happen to you. Groaning, you consider your options. You could continue to climb and reach a pocket or something, but you'd be more easily spotted by the rhino herself. You could stay where were and wait the day out or for an opportunity to escape, but your arms were beginning to burn. You don't think you could hold on for hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you could do something a little crazy. You could scream. If it goes like it did last time, she'd stop moving, and her uniform would swing towards her body, and you'd be able to grab onto the lip of her bikini bottom and hide there. You didn't like the prospect of being so close to her planet-like rump that could squash you at any moment, but if you held onto the bikini at the top, you could theoretically hide there for the rest of the day until you get a chance to climb down. You'd be able to rest, and unlike her pockets, she wouldn't be checking there...or you think so, anyway. Either way, your muscles were beginning to ache, so almost without thinking, you decided to pick a plan...</span></div></div>",

As you do, Whitney's ears twitch. \"That sounded like Sylvia,\" says Whitney. \"She's here somewhere, I know it.\" The rhino woman moves slowly as she scans the floor for you, all while adjusting her glasses. \"Where are you, you little rat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fly through the air, you land on one of the limbs of the ceiling fan above Dr. West's office. You stop to catch your breath and look at the surroundings. When you realize exactly where you are, your face turns pale. \"I could've been shredded.\" You say. \"Thank goodness the fan wasn't on.\" You look down to see Whitney scanning the floor for you. \"You know, Sylvia,\" she says directed towards you, even though she doesn't know where you are. \"What you're doing is taking advantage of a system meant to help people with legitimate mental disorders. Your fellow patients are in here because there is something wrong with them and they need help. You on the other hand, I have little doubt, are perfectly fine. It's not really fair. This is a mental hospital, not a hideaway for criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney even bends down and looks under Dr. West's desk again. She sounded really mad. You're in utter fear of the thought of that rhino catching you. You know Whitney doesn't eat humans but the wererhino giantess was out for blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if things couldn't possibly be any worse, you hear the door open and in walks Abilene, that Neapolitan pegasus girl. That was just great, that horse girl hated you and would kill you if she found you. Abilene looks forward to see Whitney searching for you. \"Whitney?\" asks Abilene. \"What are you doing?\" Whitney just let out a snort. \"Sylvia got out. The little bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbilene let out a neigh of angry and lowered her cowgirl hat. \"Out to steal my Stephen, no doubt. Don't worry Whitney, as soon as I spot her...\" Abilene stomps her hoof on the ground and you shiver from your spot on the fan. Whitney just looks in horror. \"Abilene!\" she yells. \"What are you saying? That's barbaric!\" Whitney scoffs and then goes back to looking for you. \"How competitive can you get? Stephen doesn't even know Sylvia exists.\" \"Easy for you to say,\" says Abilene. \"You're hitched, Whitney. You didn't have to worry about any competition when he came to Xander.\" \"Sweetie,\" says Whitney. \"There was no competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just had to lay in wait on the fan and the wererhino and the pegasus would leave you be. But then Abilene lets out a pant. \"Ugh,\" she says. \"It's hotter in here than a dragon's lungs.\" You gasp because Abilene walks forward and presses the switch to turn on the fan. You scream as the fan moves at rapid speed and hold onto the blade you're on, but the fan moves too fast and you're sent screaming and spinning off the fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remarkably survive the fall, but from the looks of it, you landed in a monster's cleavage, but whose?</span></div></div>",

You were so scared that you begun to sweat and shake. But then you realized this was a bad idea and paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of it, Whitney didn't seem to notice or feel you in between her enormous boobs given that she was still searching the ground. Then it hit you. Whitney was a wererhino. Surely a thick-skinned pachyderm with an armored cleavage wouldn't notice you. You were marveled at how Whitney's boobs could be rough and soft at the same time. They felt like gelatinous sandpaper. Then you feel motion as Whitney stands up and you sink further into her boobs with a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney snorts and her nostrils flare. \"Abilene,\" she says. \"I want you to let me be the first to know when you catch Sylvia. I want to personally punish her for lying to Kaguya about her mental health and trying to break out.\" \"Righty-o, Whitney.\" Said Abilene with a smirk on her face. Whitney lowers her head and snorts in Abilene's face as you sink in between Whitney's breasts. \"I mean it, Abilene,\" said Whitney. \"Do not stomp on her and do not eat her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney then walked away shaking her head with you still trapped in her boobs. \"Honestly,\" she said. \"Some monsters are brutes. With the exception of Charlene, all of the orderlies here are sadistic beasts as far as humans go. We really need to hire some nicer guards.\" You shiver. If Whitney knew you were in her boobs, she'd be anything but nice about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see Whitney entering a break area before she reaches into her pocket and takes out what looks like a salad made of dandelions, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, corn and palm trees. While Whitney may hate you, you're glad that her diet is one hundred percent human free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Whitney was sitting down for lunch, you saw this as an opportunity to get unstuck from Whitney's cleavage, so you struggle in the grip of her boobs and even grunt. You want to wiggle out, but you keep sinking down into her breasts and down further. \"Oh no,\" you say as you keep sinking. \"Oh no, oh no.\" You scream as you slip through the quicksand-like flesh of the rhino giantess's boobs and fall into Whitney's....</span></div></div>",

Eventually, you slip and slide down Whitney's mountainous armored belly, praying that the wererhinoceros giantess doesn't feel you when you suddenly grab hold of something. Something silver! You look to the sides to see Whitney's monstrous thighs. You were holding onto Whitney's bikini bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to shiver at such a revolting development. Here was Whitney, your arch-enemy and you were between her thighs. Before you can do anything else about your predicament, you hear Whitney let out a belch as she finishes her salad and then wipes off her mouth with a napkin. You gasp because Whitney was going to stand up, with you on her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney starts to stand up and you quickly, without thinking and without any other options, you climb up and into the rhino titan's bikini bottom as she gets up. Once you're in the bikini bottom, you start to slip and see a large and wet gaping cavern right in front of you. \"Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!\" you scream before you slip into the love tunnel. Outside, Whitney gives a grunt. \"What the hell?\" asks the rhino giantess to herself. \"I must've pulled a groin muscle or something. I must be putting on weight. Of course, there's no such thing as a skinny rhino so I can't tell. Oh well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh because Whitney didn't notice you. But this was still a bad situation as you were stuck in her love tunnel. This was bad beyond belief, but as you are now, you couldn't do anything and have to stick around for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney goes about her day with you trapped inside her massive love tunnel and surprisingly, she doesn't feel you one bit. Of course, the day doesn't go all that well. For one, Luz accidentally  entered Phoebe's room and Whitney had to save her before Phoebe burned her ass off. Then Whitney had to pull a splinter from Cassandra's finger and get Amara off the roof of the KDP. All while this was going on, you were being shook up in Whitney's love tunnel and shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, you hear Whitney punch out from the outside and let out a groan. \"At least it's over.\" You say. Then you hear the sound of an engine turning on and you realize that Whitney is driving home in her car. The movement of the car causes you to slip out of the tunnel and wind up grabbing the fabric of Whitney's bikini bottom and hang on tight as you yell. Fortunately the engine drowns out the sound of your screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Whitney comes to a stop and then you gasp and inhale and exhale before coughing and groan. \"My mouth tastes like rhino sweat.\" You complain right before you have to hold on as Whitney gets out of the car and stands up. You then hear the sound of a door opening and then Whitney enters her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Whitney,\" says a male voice. \"How was your day.\" \"Exhausting,\" says Whitney with a sigh. \"You would not believe everything I had to put up with today. And to top it all off, that little harlot, Sylvia, somehow got out. I still don't know where she is.\" \"Don't worry, Whitney. I don't think she'll get far. Gravefield is a big beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're starting to wonder who Whitney is talking to when you peak out and see that on Whitney's counter there appeared to be a tan-skinned male human with brown hair worn in a ponytail with a beard. From the ring on his finger, you're guessing that's Whitney's husband. You heard Whitney married a human but you still couldn't believe it, even though you were looking at it just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right, Xander,\" says Whitney. \"I mean, I hate Sylvia and all but that's mainly because she's taking advantage of an establishment meant to help people in need.\" You slink back into Whitney's bikini bottom as Whitney gives an angry snort. Xander has to rub her fingers to calm her down. \"Don't blow your top, Whitney,\" says Xander to his gigantic wife. \"You're already hot enough.\" Whitney just lets out a laugh. \"Oh, don't you start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, from the looks of it, Whitney's husband acted as a pacifier to her rage. What happens now?</span></div></div>",

That's the one thing I hate about the first week of summer. <i>They</i> show up.\" You're wondering who Whitney could possibly be expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney opens the door and you look up from Whitney's bikini bottom, being careful not to be seen when you see what looked like another wererhinoceros woman. This were rhino was a grayish green skinned rhino resembling a Sumatran rhinoceros with massive breasts that had to be H-cup in scale to her size. She was built a lot like Whitney except she had long reddish blonde hair. She looked 1175 feet tall, 200ft bigger than Whitney's. She was wearing a red Medieval style tunic. She also looked somewhat older than Whitney<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Whitney,\" says the second wererhino woman. \"Sorry we're late. Traffic on the way from Direopolis was murder. Some idiot didn't know what he was doing when placing the directional signs to Terrordale.\" Whitney rolls her eyes. \"Hi, Mom.\" She says. \"Mom?!\" you think to yourself. That was Whitney's mother? You didn't even think Whitney's mother was still alive given that Whitney never mentions her at the KDP. \"You know,\" says Whitney's mom. \"Your father kept being a front seat driver. I keep telling him that map didn't know what it was saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're slightly confused. Father? You didn't see Whitney's father. But then you look down and you're surprised. Whitney's dad wasn't a were rhino like his wife or daughter. Instead he was a spriggan who was pitch black on one half of his body and pitch white on the other half. He had white hair worn in a ponytail, red eyes and a disfigured face. He was still a giant monster but from the looks of it, he didn't even reach up to Whitney's knee, to say nothing about the size difference with his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Dad,\" says Whitney. \"I take it you tried to argue with the mighty navigator.\" Whitney's father just let out a huff. He had a real grumpy look on his face. From the looks of it, he wasn't a very positive character. Whitney's dad walks in first as his wife follows. \"Someone's in a better mood than I thought.\" Said Xander. You couldn't tell if he was being sarcastic or not. Whitney's father then gestures to Xander that he's watching him and then walks into the living room before snapping his fingers to turn the television on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a break, Grayson,\" mutters Xander. \"Whitney and I have been married for years and you're still not talking to me? With your rotten attitude, it's a wonder she even exists.\" \"Hello, Xander,\" says Whitney's mother in a somewhat condescending tone. \"I almost didn't see you there.\" Xander just let out a moan. \"Oh, don't worry about it, Susan. Must've forgot to put your contacts in, again. I would've thought since her damned driver's license requires her to wear glasses.\" Susan turned to face Whitney and shook her head. \"What are you wearing? Seriously? Oh, I don't mind that you're showing so much flesh at work, but going to the office in your underwear?\" \"It's a swimsuit, Mom,\" says Whitney. \"The KDP is on a beach. It gets hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan let out a scoff. \"Building a vegetable hotel on a beach. Yeah, that's smart. When are you going to get a real job, Whitney? You're basically playing nanny to a bunch of screw-ups.\" Whitney just digs through her kitchen cabinet as she's speaking with her mother. \"I'm trying to help these people.\" Susan rolled her eyes. \"Look, I was happy for you when you became a nurse, but I was hoping it would be in a <i>real</i> hospital. In my opinion...\" Whitney let out a sigh. \"Those are my three least favorite words coming from you.\" Susan just ignores Whitney as you continue to listen in. \"In my opinion, you'd be able to start a family with that husband of yours, despite his... handicap, if you had a job that didn't require you to be away from the house all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman was a regular windbag. She sounded a lot like Virginia. So that's why Virginia's so close with Whitney, she reminds her of her mom. \"There you go again,\" groaned Whitney. \"I don't need kids, mother. I've practically got more than I could want with the patients. Why don't you go bother Noreen with that issue? She's still single.\" As Whitney is digging through the cabinet, she takes out some parmesan cheese and oregano. \"From the looks of it, we're having spaghetti tonight,\" says Susan. \"In my opinion, it takes exactly 72 ounces of tomato sauce to bring out the full flavor of the sauce. And from the looks of it, you don't even have any vinegar.\" \"Mother, I know how to make spaghetti sauce.\" While Whitney is speaking with Susan, you take the opportunity to exit her bikini bottom and slide down her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you've gathered, Whitney clearly got her grumpy disposition from her father and it doesn't help than her mom appears to be an annoying busybody who puts her horned nose where she shouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you have to slide out of the way as Susan nearly flattens you with her foot. Your heart is racing as you look up at the two rhino giantesses and are about to escape when Whitney accidentally drops a bell pepper on the ground near you. One of the rhino giants looks down and spots you, but which one?</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately you push your foot in too hard and Whitney grunts and even twitches as your foot is wedged and stuck between her ass. \"Oh no.\" You muter. Desperately you try to pull your foot out, only for your foot motions to harm Whitney and make her yell in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, once your leg is free, you accidentally pull on Whitney's tail and cause her even more pain as she stands up, pushing your face against the fabric of her bikini bottom. Unfortunately for you, Whitney reaches back and feels around her ass before she grabs you and pulls you up to her face in front of her nostrils. The rhinoceros giantess looks at you with a glare and then gives an angry snort that blows air into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylvia!\" she yells. \"You little sneak! Not only did you try to break out again but you nearly sodomized me!\" You're in so much fear of Whitney that you can't even look at her. \"P-Please don't kill me!\" you yell. Whitney lets out a groan. \"Quit your whining, you little coward. I'm not going to hurt you. Though I should find some way to make Kaguya finally realize you lied about your mental health. People like you are the worst Sylvia. You commit a crime, get caught and then plead insanity to avoid justice. I should hand you right over to my friend, Destiny. She'd straighten you up, but good.\" You gulp in utter fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Whitney rubs her massive ass and then puts her hand through her long red hair as she ponders what to do. Her glasses slip slightly and then she adjusts them as she lets out a sigh. \"Of course, for now,\" the wererhinoceros giantess says. \"I think I'll just hand you over to one of the new orderlies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in shock. \"New orderly?\" Whitney nodded her head. \"You're aware of Luz right? Well, since there are four orderlies in A-block, city ordinance made us hire a new water element monster for B-Block, a new fire element monster for C-block and a new air element monster for D block. I'll be handing you to one of the new orderlies to keep you in custody for the next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now more afraid than ever. You had no idea what these orderlies were like. That's when a door opens. \"That must be her now.\" Said Whitney. Which of the new orderlies is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: I'll be making the B-Block orderly myself. I already have an idea, but I will offer 500GP each to whoever adds the C and D Block OC orderlies)</span></div></div>",

She had the upper body of a bright red skinned goat woman with black freckles, long curved black horns, fins on her arms, long blonde hair and pink sunglasses. On her neck was a tattoo of the letter Q next to a blue spade. But from her lower body her legs with covered in golden scales like a fish, complete with fins. Of course she still had hooves and an udder and was wearing a yellow one piece bikini. She was also as obese as Whitney but shorter, being only 900ft tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Whitney,\" says the sea goat woman. \"Sorry if I'm a little early.\" \"Actually,\" says Whitney. \"I appreciate that. A good orderly comes earlier than expected. You're Panny Queen right.\" The goat woman nodded her head and opened up the gills on her neck and then looks down to see you. \"I take it that's the troublemaker.\" Whitney snorts and nodded her head. \"Her name is Sylvia. She was arrested for stealing jewels and pleaded insanity to get here instead of prison. \"You're kidding me,\" says Panny in shock. \"That's deplorable. That's not right. This is a home that's supposed to help people with serious mental problems. How dare you take advantage of the KDP?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were afraid. This strange goat/fish woman seemed to be a lot like Whitney in several ways. Whitney even smiles at her. \"I know I'm not in any position to ask,\" you say in fear. \"But what kind of monster is she?\" Panny spins around and shakes her udder before smiling smugly. \"I'm a capricorn,\" she says. \"And proud of it.\" That made sense. A fish/goat hybrid. What else could she be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney then notices a wedding ring on Panny's finger. \"You're married?\" asks Whitney. Panny holds up the ring and nods. \"I sure am. To the most handsome human I've ever met.\" Panny even takes out her wallet and shows Whitney a photograph of Panny in a wedding dress holding a young human male with long orchid colored hair dressed in a tuxedo in the palm of her hand. \"Of course,\" says Panny. \"I don't take him to work. That would be dangerous.\" Whitney raises an eyebrow in interest. \"Huh. I'm married to a human as well. The two of us should get along well.\" As Whitney is shaking hands with Panny, you look to see the Door from D-Block open up and Virginia was looking at Panny with a jealous glare. Virginia was the closest orderly to Whitney and didn't seem to like how Panny was acting all chummy with Whitney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney hands you to Panny and you notice a blue spade shaped crystal attached to a gold necklace around Panny's neck. Panny looks down at you with a smirk and then she removes he crystal, revealing it to be hollow before she drops you screaming inside of it and then reattaches it to her necklace. You look down and see nothing but Panny's mountain-sized breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" says Whitney. \"Interesting necklace.\" \"Well,\" says Panny. \"I like to remind my man that I'm the boss from time to time.\" Whitney gives a smile and then walks away as Panny looks down on you arrogantly. This was going to be a long week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly another orderly enters and it seems they have a  bone to pick with Panny. But who is it?</span></div></div>",

She had the shell and arms of a sea turtle but the head, feet, legs and udder of a minotaur. She wore a two piece yellow green bikini and had strawberry blonde hair. Tarja was the meanest orderly. She didn't care about her job, bullied the inmates, embezzled from the K.D.P. and brought alcohol on the premises. You even heard that she did time in prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTarja stomped up towards Panny who equalled her in both height and weight and had an angry look on her face as she was practically nose to nose with the capricorn giantess. Since you were in Panny's necklace at the time, you felt yourself being sandwiched between Tarja and Panny's breasts. How Tarja's breasts could be so soft even inside her turtle shell you didn't know. The blonde sea goat giantess looks into the mock turtle giantess's eyes as Tarja gives a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" asks Panny. Tarja lets out an angry moo. \"You curvy horned little squealer,\" says Tarja. \"Are you the one who told Dr. West I was drunk on duty yesterday?\" You cower in your crystal prison as it sinks between Panny's boobs. \"Yes,\" says Panny. \"I may be new, but I know the rules. Alcohol isn't allowed in the KDP. You don't seem to be taking your job that seriously.\" \"Don't get smug, goat girl,\" says Tarja. \"You already got me in trouble with that nine tailed bitch and you think you can tell me how to do my job, fish for butt? I oughta tear out your horns and shove them up your fat ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanny just turns around and lets out a bleat. \"I think you're just mad because I have a bigger udder than you do.\" Your eyes popped and you turn to see Tarja fuming mad and ready to charge. \"Whatever, bitch. At least I know that humans aren't husbands; they're food.\" Panny seems really offended by that remark as she grits her teeth but chooses to ignore Tarja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Tarja then picks up Dr. West's chair and hits Panny in the back with it, breaking the chair. You're jerked forward and scream, but Panny keeps the necklace on and holds her back in pain before she turns to face Tarja and gives an angry bleat. \"What's the matter, can breath?\" asks Tarja with a smug grin. \"You know,\" says Panny. \"You're a real jerk.\" \"And what are you going to do about it, you insult to bovids.\" Panny and Tarja glare at each other before...</span></div></div>",

All three A-Block orderlies were creatures associated with the Earth since they were all ground based beasts, but each one terrified you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of them was Tress, a lesbian shishi. Tress used to date a qilin girl but the latter dumped her recently and Tress was so lonely that she\u2019d take the next single chick she could, even if they were human like you. Tress was super scary because that Chinese guardian lion woman had a habit of sticking you in places that will haunt your nightmares forever. You have no choice but to let her have her way with you because she told you if you don\u2019t cooperate, you\u2019ll be going from her heart to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Cyprus, a behemoth, basically a hippo with the skin of a dinosaur or dragon. Cyprus was married to Jedda, a bahamut who also worked as a guard. Makes sense since they\u2019re both hippo based monsters. Cyprus respected Jedda\u2019s choice to try and quit humans cold turkey but the behemoth made it clear that she herself wasn\u2019t giving up humans. You once saw her eat several humans in a salad for lunch. But fortunately for you Cyprus along with Tress and Whitney wore glasses, except unlike the shishi and wererhino, Cyprus had trouble keeping them on and was practically blind without them. But that could make her deadlier to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third earth element orderly was Diana, a morbidly obese werewolf who was playing with half a deck. She was unpredictable and  unaware of her own weight, not to mention a scatterbrain. You heard that one of her two daughters was a cannibalistic serial killer and that Diana cracked when her daughter was arrested. It\u2019s possible she started working at the K.D.P. to prevent more monsters from ending up like Persephone. But of Diana\u2019s known relatives, there was only one known wolf in her family who didn\u2019t eat humans and you didn\u2019t know if Diana swallowed people herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich orderly is it?</span></div></div>",

You pass one of her paws and head underneath her belly. As you run you look around and then up. Seeing her stomach looming overhead makes you hope she doesn't fall over for some reason. You race out from under her and under her butt as she continues to search for you. Passing her back paws you give a small cheer.

Its waving around wildly as its owner hunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time you try to pick yourself back up but a shadow appears above you. Looking up you see that Tress is sitting up and her gigantic ass is headed right for you! You try to crawl away as fast as you can but to no avail. Her massive booty comes down and pins you to the ground with your torso sticking out. For a statue she sure has a soft behind. Thats the one positive thing you can think of right now. \"Where could that girl be?\" Tress wonders aloud. \"I have so many things planned for her!\" You shiver at her \"plans\", and start to panic as you realize how deep you're in. Either she'll get up and leave or, more likely, she'll find you! You lie under her butt and await your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue Tress suddenly perks up a little. \"Did I sit on something?\" she asks herself and reaches for her butt. Crap! You probably shouldn't have struggled. Her huge paw comes into view and feels around the massive butt cheeks until they reach you. When they feel your small form Tress squeals in delight. \"Oooh! I think I know who that is back there!\" she says and grabs you. She brings you to her face and grins happily. \"Sylvia! I was just looking for you! Couldn't wait to get at my booty huh?\" she says.

No need to be shy!\" Tress says when she notices you looking away. \"You should feel comfortable around me!\" Yeah, thats not gonna happen.

Someone else is headed your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh!\" Tress says. \"I don't want anyone getting between us, so I'll have to hide you, okay?\" Before you know it she's tossing you into her bikini bottom. \"I would put you up top, but you'd get noticed in my top. Its a little tight!\" Gee, you think? Maybe the staff should wear something other than bikinis. You don't say this out loud, fearing Tress might get mad. You don't like her, but when a human rejects her they usually end up in her stomach. When you land you look up to see her smiling face before she lets the fabric snap back into place. You are pushed against her furry body and see her giant nethers right next to you.

Keep an eye out for her and bring her to me if you find her.\" the wererhino tells her. \"Oh I'll bring her right to you, don't worry.\" Tress says. Yeah right. There's a pause before Whitney speaks again. \"I mean it Tress. No hanky panky.\" she says. You hear a rumbling as Whitney walks away and Tress lightly taps you. \"You can thank me for hiding you later.\" she whisper. You don't like the sound of that.

She could also be going somewhere to be alone with you. Either way it doesn't bode well for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour question is answered when you hear Tress speak. \"So how are you doing today honey?\" she asks gently. \"Lion!\" you hear a voice say. It sounds cheerful and happy, like a child, but coming from an adult. It must be Cassandra. She's a werebat who thinks she's a five year old. Tress walks over to her and kneels down. Cassandra must be playing on the floor. \"Have you remembered anything today Cassy?' she asks. There's a moment of silence, then Tress sighs. \"Thats okay honey.\" she says.

Tress, knowing you're down there tries to get her off. \"Okay dear, enough hugging.\" she says. \"No! Lion nice!\" she says and clings tighter.

There are a lot of bright colors decorating the place and a lot of toys scattered about. Then you spot the werebat, crawling toward you. She's smiling at Tress again, but at the last second she glances down and spots you. In a flash  her hand is in Tress's bikini and she snatches you up. She then hurries away from the orderly and holds you up. \"Toy!\" she says wide eyed. Tress, caught off guard by the invasion of privacy rushes over. \"Cassy! That is mine! Be a good girl and give her back!\" she pleads. Cassandra looks at her and sticks her tongue out. \"Mine!\" she says. Still being patient Tress reaches for you. Cassy struggles and soon Tress has her on the ground. The two of them roll around for a bit, with Cassy keeping you just out of the shishi's reach. Things get worse when Cassandra decides to hide you. All you see is her face getting closer and her mouth opening. Before you can scream you are stuffed in her mouth.

After a couple of seconds Diana remembers. \"Oh! I was looking for <i>Dr.</i> West!\" Okay. You decide to wait this out and hope she leaves. The way her mind works she'll probably forget what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you hear makes you tense up. Diana is sniffing the air. You hold your breath but are surprised by the enormous wolf suddenly lowering herself to the ground. With her immense weight she creates a thunderous boom. Apparently whatever happened to her mind didn't affect her senses as she peers under the desk and spots you. \"Ooh, whats this?\" she says out loud as she reaches out and snatches you. You tremble as the werewolf stands up and brings you to her face. \"You're the human! Uh... Silly!\" You sigh and correct her. \"Sylvia.\" Diana blinks at you. \"Oh, right.\" She looks away for a couple of seconds and you sit in her palm wondering whats going to happen. When she turns her head back to you what does she do?  </span></div></div>",

There was a pink skinned vampiress with pigtails holding up an umbrella and acting as the referee while four monster girls were at the court. One team consisted of a blue skinned tengu girl and a white furred baku, an animal resembling a tapir. The other team consisted of a bright yellow and orange furred Bandersnatch sucking on three lollipops at once and an overweight tan skinned naga girl with the tail of an anaconda. From the looks of it, the naga and then bandersnatch were winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandersnatch girl spiked the ball and it bounced off the tengu girl's long nose and made her scream. \"Oops,\" says the bandersnatch in an Australian accent. \"Sorry about that Hannah.\" The baku girl grumbles before the Naga serves the ball. The baku jumps up and then hits the ball and causes it to come barreling out towards Diana. The ball hits Diana and makes her scream in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, in the process the necklace you're inside is sent flying and you scream. The necklace lands in the sand and nearby Diana is rubbing her head. \"Way to go Reimu,\" complains the naga girl. \"Sorry about that Diana.\" Diana rubs her head and walks away, not noticing that she dropped the necklace. You scream and tap on the walls of the oyster and then break down in tears. This was a regular cluster you got yourself into.

You look out and see that the woman who picked you up was an obese yellow-skinned gargoyle girl. She had pointed ears, cat-like eyes, a small nose, brown lips and long black hair that reached down to her massive butt. She also had large leather wings with dark brown membranes. The gargoyle woman was so fat and enormous that it was surprising that she could still fly. Her lifeguard outfit looked tattooed on. You remember seeing this lifeguard lady flying around Gravefield Beach. But the only detail about her that you could actually remember was her name. You heard several monsters call her \"Roxy\", which was all too appropriate given that she was a gargoyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at this big gargoyle lady made you really nervous. The only other gargoyle you knew was Eartha and she was a mean and foul-mouthed human-eating hothead. But then again, this behavior was said to be atypical of the average gargoyle, making Eartha more similar to a certain fiery redhead with malicious intent, albeit at a smaller scale. From what you heard, gargoyles were actually the least dangerous monsters when it came to humans and there were rumors they had a strict moral code to protect, rather than destroy. Of course, \"Roxy\" <i>was</i> rather obese, to the point where she seemed to have multiple chins. Perhaps she ate humans when nobody was looking. You step back in the shell necklace as Roxy holds it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee,\" says Roxy. \"This looks like one of April's works of art. Why would it be laying on the ground? Somebody must've dropped it. Hmmm. Looks like April's best work yet.\" From the sound of it, this gargoyle lady was a friend of April's. Perhaps Roxy was your best bet. You were about to change your mind and reveal yourself to the titanic lifeguard, but then something happened that made you change your mind. Somebody lets out a yell and states \"Attention, beach goers! Please vacate the area! A whale just beached itself on the shore and from the looks of it, she has a severe case of jaundice!\" Roxy realizes immediately that this rather rude voice was referring to her. She grits her teeth to show her fangs and her eyes turn bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake. You didn't know female gargoyle eyes really did glow red when they're mad. You start to wonder if male gargoyle eyes glow white. Roxy growls and turns to see a blonde-haired fairy with peach-colored skin holding a megaphone. She had golden wings like that of a butterfly and stood less than half Roxy's height. She was also much thinner than Roxy and looked slightly younger. She was laughing to herself as Roxy growled. \"One of these days, Stella,\" warns Roxy. \"You say one fat joke too many and I'll tie your tongue in a knot!\" Stella blows Roxy a raspberry and leaves the gargoyle lady stomping away in rage as she holds the necklace you're in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you think to yourself. \"Somebody is <i>really</i> sensitive about her weight. I don't know if this gargoyle is friendly or not, but an angry gargoyle is dangerous no matter what the alignment.\" As Roxy stomps away, she makes her way towards...</span></div></div>",

From the looks of it, she had long blonde hair and was hourglass shaped. That woman was a fairy.  From the tag she was wearing, it would appear that her name was Stella. Kinda weird since she looked <i>a lot</i> like the fairy of the same name from the Winx Club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you remember something and gasp. Stella was one of the lifeguards who retrieved the patients that escaped. Given her petite frame, she was called on to catch the patients that weren't dangerous or large enough to warrant the gargoyle lifeguard. However, Stella had a tendency to be condescending and even mean towards the patients. The woman had a mean streak a mile wide. You heard that Roxy couldn't stand her. You really hope that Stella doesn't decide to open the shell necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess fairy looks over the necklace and smirks. \"Well look at this,\" she says in an obnoxious tone. \"Looks like some klutz dropped their necklace. Hmm, from the looks of it, this is April's handiwork. Seems actually well made for something created by that ditzy mutt.\" Stella laughs obnoxiously as you let out a groan.

That crustacean was friendly and jovial towards the monster patients, but when it came to you, she only saw you as a snack and taunted you in your cage by snapping her big claws and telling you she was going to eat you. One time you remember her saying that you might taste good dipped in butter. It didn\u2019t help that you were already terrified of sand crabs before finding out monsters were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Jedda, a bahamut, except her species was a combination of the mythical and Final Fantasy version of the bahamut. Jedda was a hippo with the wings and skin of a dragon and the gills of a fish. Unlike the rest of her family, including her big sister Elisa, Jedda ate humans. You heard she was dared to place a human in her mouth as a kid and discovered she liked the taste. However, you heard she was in a self-help group for predators who want to stop eating humans because she was afraid she\u2019d wind up eating a friend of her sister\u2019s. Unfortunately for you, she\u2019s not showing much improvement. One time when she was trying to give you a friendly smile, you saw a human skeleton sticking out of her lower lip before she nervously sucked it back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly of B-Block as far as orderlies go was the worst orderly in the building, the mock turtle Tarja, a creature resembling a cross between a minotaur and a sea turtle. Tarja was the only orderly to not care about any of the patients. In fact, you\u2019ve seen her tease some of your fellow patients, seemingly trying to keep them insane. Not to mention she\u2019s managed to sneak alcohol on the job with neither Dr. West or Whitney finding out. You wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if she even tried to steal from the K.D.P. But she knows you know of her crimes and threatened to gulp you down if you told Kaguya or Whitney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater was definitely not your favorite element.

She may be nice to the monster patients but she's made it quite clear that she likes to eat humans. Every time she's around you she gives you threatening and hungry looks. It doesn't help that you're even terrified of regular sand crabs. When she enters the room you cower behind the desk leg. Staring up you see her hard shelled body and while she's very fit, its ruined by her face. She's got stalks for eyes that make you cringe when you see them. Then there's her claws. One is bigger than the other, and they clack as she opens and closes them. Lilith has put her claws in your face many a time and you dread the day she has you in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where is the doctor?\" you hear her say as she walks around the room. She walks to the desk and inspects the top. \"Hmmm.\" you hear her mutter. You don't know what this means but you continue to watch her carefully. Suddenly she drops to the floor without warning and spots you peeking out from your hiding spot. \"Ah ha!\" she says. One look at her face up close is all you need to take off in the opposite direction. You run out from under the desk and frantically search for a hiding spot. Lilith chases you creating booms with each step. Before you even get close to a good spot her claw slams down and snaps shut right in front of you. You fall back and scream in surprise. Looking up you see the other claw coming to get you and you close your eyes in terror. You feel the claw close around you and cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter opening your eyes you see that you're not being snipped in half. Instead you're being lifted into the air. Lilith is holding you, but not tight enough to snip you. She brings you to her face and smirks at the tears streaming down your face. \"Did I scare the little human?\" she asks. You can't even say anything because you're so scared. She brings you in for a closer look and you rear back from her gross eye stalk. This causes her to tighten her grip slightly, making you yelp. \"I wouldn't move around too much. You might hurt yourself.\" she tells you. \"Looks like I finally got you Sylvia. You remember what I said right? You're gonna be a good snack.\" She opens her mouth, but shuts it again. \"I did say you'd be good with butter though. As hard as it was to finally get you I think I should make it good.\" She then lowers you into her cleavage and pushes you in until you're hidden. \"I'm going to have you with my lunch, and its going to be delicious!\" she tells you and exits the room. Where does she go?</span></div></div>",

The blue-skinned hippo/dragon titaness trudged in, humming a jazzy tune and tucking a folder under one arm. Her footsteps thunderous at ground level and sent faint ripples through her wide girth, especially her belly and behind. That bikini she always wore didn't do much to hide her girth, either. You weren't even sure how it stayed on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there were more important thing to worry about with Jedda around...namely that she might eat you if you were spotted. As friendly as Jedda was, all it would take was one little slip of willpower, and you'd be a snack. Just a little more fat on her big belly, some more bulge on her rump that was already big enough to crush a city block. Whimpering, you flatten your back against the desk leg and hope to Christ she doesn't see you. <i>Please just walk through the office, please don't stick around, please just leave....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peek around the leg again, and catch Jedda close the B-Block door with a hip-check. ...Or try to: she only taps it lightly, and despite the size of her butt and the force it carries, it's only enough to close the door halfway, leaving a small crack open. Jedda, meanwhile, looks at her rear and chuckles. \"Not quite enough...oh well, better drop <i>these</i> off.\" Pulling the folder from under her arm, Jedda opens it and gives its contents a once-over...you guessed they were reports on the various patients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no...oh no....</i> This was bad. Very bad. Orderlies left patient reports on Dr. West's desk! Jedda would surely notice your cage was empty....and go looking for you. And is she thought of her search, even for a second, as <i>hunting...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver as an old nightmare springs to memory. <br>\r\n<i>Jedda pinching you high in the air, held over her wide jaws. The bahamut girl giving you a nonchalant shrug before letting you go, to fall into her maw...seeing her massive teeth from the inside of her mouth....Jedda giggling at your taste...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a great effort, you wrench yourself back to reality, wiping the cold sweat from your brow. No. You would <i>not</i> have a panic attack! Not here, not now. You could be scared later, now you had to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Jedda again, to find her still leafing through the folder. Perfect, she was distracted! You had a chance! With one last deep breath, you sprint out from under the desk and charge towards the half-open door to B-Block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>But does your gamble pay off...?</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The rush of adrenaline is barely enough to keep you going, even with escape as a prize and your life on the line. And still, you run as fast as you can, the open door getting ever closer....and only make it halfway to the door when you hear a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...Sylvia! Stop!\" Jedda calls out, the floor shaking as the bahamat steps towards you. You wail in fear and try to push yourself faster, feeling on the verge of passing out. Just a little bit further, and you'd make it to the door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But your confinement in that cage hadn't done any favors for the shape you were in. A small space, coupled with constantly being surrounded by man-eating giant creatures had put excercise off your mind. Add to this the very, very, <i>very</i> big difference in scale between you and Jedda--who could cover what would take you half and hour of running in just a few steps--and it was all but impossible for her <i>not</i> to catch you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow suddenly envelopes you, and before you can even look back, two giant blue fingers close around your form, stopping you in your tracks \"Gotcha!\" Jedda quips, chuckling. Enveloped by her chubby fingers, you feel yourself lifted up, up, and up...until you're staring your captress right in her massive face; her hippo's snout and mischievous eyes all but filling your view. You try to cower away, but Jedda's pinching you in such a way that you can't look away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you get out, Sylvia? Were you really trying to sneak out?\" she interrogates, tilting her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can look at, though, is her mouth. \"P-please don't eat me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJedda snorts. \"You know I'm getting help...and don't change the subject! How did you get out, and were you trying to sneak out of here? Go see another patient?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I...put me down, please, Jedda. Just p-p-put me back in my cage--and don't tell Whitney! Please!\" You'd seen humans beg before, it never worked. Monsters just ignored the pleading and ate their prey; or even worse, found it amusing and toyed with humans before gulping them down. It didn't matter. All you could think of was getting away from Jedda before she had a lapse in willpower...and not earning Whitney's wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJedda loosens her grip and pulls her head back. She even smiles at you...thankfully, no skeletons are stuck in her teeth this time. \"Calm down, Sylvia. I'm not going to hurt you, and I won't tell Whitney. Even if I <i>did</i> think you were faking, that rhino just takes it too far. Just calm down, alright? Now, I'll just put you back in the cage and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that a rumbling, liquid noise resounded. Like a rockslide under water, or....<br>\r\n<i>Or a massive stomach growling.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJedda looks down at her rotund belly, poking it with her free hand. Then she looks up at you. You are both silent for a long moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jedda...please, t-t-try to control yourself. <i>Please...</i>\" This time, you start to cry.</span></div></div>",

You heard that Jedda was from a family and <i>species</i> of monsters that normally don't eat humans. According to Charlene, both Jedda's older sister's were friends with humans. But when Jedda was a kid one of her friends dared her to put a human in her mouth and apparently she liked the taste. You really hope Jedda's willpower training pays off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this doesn't look like the case because as Jedda looks straight at you, she opens her mouth and licks her fangs to your absolute terror. You get a good look at Jedda's enormous fangs. Because of her hippo like physiognomy, she had two large fangs on the sides of her bottom jaw, each one had to be at least 100ft tall. Jedda rubs her stomach as she looks down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Sylvia,\" the hippo/dragon giantess says. \"You look absolutely heavenly today.\" You scream and try to back away but Jedda grabs you in between her chubby fingers and hoists you up into the air. \"Please Jedda!\" you yell. \"Control yourself! Please don't eat me! Please don't eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your cries fall on deaf ears because Jedda holds you over her mouth just like in your nightmare. You're frozen with fear right before Jedda shrugs and drops you screaming into her enormous maw. Jedda snaps her jaws shut as you land on her long wet tongue that had to be the size of ten football fields. \"Jedda!\" you yell. You then scream as Jedda's tongue wraps around you like a snake and tangles you as you shake and struggle to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's no use, the bahamut's massive tongue pushes you to the side of her teeth and starts flaying you about as you break down crying. Jedda moans in ecstasy as she enjoys your taste. \"I gotta say Sylvia,\" thinks the giantess to herself. \"You taste absolutely divine.\" Inside the giantess's mouth, you try to pound on her teeth to get her to snap out of it but then you find yourself trying to grab onto the tongue as Jedda tilts her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're going to fall down to her throat if Jedda doesn't snap out of it. And then you'll just be another layer of fat on her already massive body.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You struggle, gasp and scream for mercy as Jedda tilts her head a full 90 degrees, and your world suddenly turned vertical, leading straight down into a hole that lead straight to your death. Unfortunately for you, the tongue is not the worlds most reliable surface to grab onto, as you're quickly learning. Your grip on the top of the tongue doesn't hold, and you fall with a fright, frantically grasping and fumbling about to get a hold on <i>anything</i>. The comparatively thick bumps on the hippo-dragoness's tongue serve as functional hand holds, but they're just as slippery as the rest of it, and you quickly lose your hold and begin to fall further and further. With nothing to grasp on to, you merely hug the surface of the tongue as the edge of Jedda's throat comes closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world seems to slow down, and you feel weightless, like you're underwater. You watch as globs of saliva go trickling past you, hit the back of Jedda's mouth, and slide down her esophagus, disappearing down the dark cavern of her gaping maw. You really, really didn't want it to end this way, but your fate seemed settled. And in the end, you having survived as long as you had was impressive. You could at least take solace knowing that you'd fared better and lasted longer than most humans in the monster world have, and you were momentarily proud of yourself, before the realization that you were going to die came rushing back to you, slamming in to you like a ton of bricks. Your innate 'fight or flight' response was of no use in this situation, and after what seemed like hours, but were merely seconds of struggling, you knew you couldn't win. So you did something crazy. You let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly in free fall as you drifted away from the mass of wet pink, the sliver of light pouring in through Jedda's sharp teeth becoming fainter and fainter, you closed your eyes, and you found yourself at peace. You no longer had to worry about surviving. About avoiding the grasp of these giant, carnivorous beasts every day. You would finally have the peace you'd craved ever since you'd been locked up in this hellhole. Your life began to momentarily flash before your eyes as they began to close slowly, thoughts of all the happiness you'd experienced in your life flooding your mind as you embraced-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*COUGH* *COUGH* *HACK*</b></i> came the sounds of a distressed Jedda, grasping at her throat as she coughed and wheezed, before suddenly hacking up a large glob of saliva on her hand. Taking a moment to begin breathing normally again after her coughing fit, she looked down towards the strangely colored pile of spit in her cyan palm, and rubbed at it with a finger, revealing a small human, who she was momentarily worried was dead but began to shiver after a few moments, much to her relief. \"Jeez, Sylvia, why do you gotta look so tasty?\" the Bahamut asked accusingly. \"Let's get you cleaned off and back in that cage, I guess. Can't believe I almost let down the people at the anti human-addiction meet-up... I really can't allow this to happen again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, couldn't move. Or rather, didn't have the strength to. You had been so prepared to die that the thought of being alive paralyzed you. You'd been in some close calls before, but none were ever so...surreal. You'd been in danger of being eaten before, but it never got far enough for you to endure what you'd just dealt with. The struggling. The panic. The denial. The acceptance. You were so ready to accept death that you had actually accepted it. To come back from that, to still be alive after the feeling of terror had washed away, and only peace remained...it was difficult, to say the least. The trials and tribulations of you living were nowhere near their end, despite how seemingly close they were a mere few seconds ago. Would it been better if you... <i>had</i> died? No, no... you wanted to live. But... no longer having to worry about surviving every second of every day... it had a very pleasant ring to it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jedda began to spray you with insurmountable amounts of water (the spray of a simple bathroom sink) you stood up, your clothes soaked, and wiped the layer of saliva off you, and then wiping your tears away. Standing under the faucet, you simply stared up towards the Bahamut, not saying a word. You were a little too terrified to say anything. Jedda's stomach grumbled again, and for a moment your knees felt weak, but she merely turned her head away from you, clearly resisting the temptation. But that didn't help ease your concerns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being properly cleaned, and placed back in your cage, you just slumped to the ground, your muscles aching from your adrenaline-fueled struggles to stay alive. Jedda shoots you a frown, despite you knowing how little she cared, and walked away, leaving you to lie there, and stare up at the cage's roof. You sigh. You just couldn't believe what had happened. And you were still alive to tell the tale! The thoughts of a death that could've been left your mind, as you got to your feet, if only to stretch. Groggily, you look over towards the cage door, and your jaw drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jedda forgot to close the cage.</i></span></div></div>",

You hold out some hope that Jeddah might come to her senses before she swallows you, but then you loose your grip on her tongue and you start sliding down to the back of her throat at a much faster rate. You scream in terror as you land in the throat and Jeddah swallows you with a loud GULP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus you make your slow journey down the esophagus to the stomach. Mucus starts to cover you from head to toe and you begin to cry as the muscles slowly massage you down towards your demise. In the distance you can hear the gurgles of the stomach as if they were calling to you. You can help but think how unfair this is when you suddenly hit a wall of flesh. The stomach sphincter. It recognizes you as food and opens up to allow you entrance to your final resting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream as you fall into the stomach and land with a splash in the digestive juices.

You see your fingernails extend into gold claws as well and gasp. Then you hold your mouth in pain as you feel your teeth falling out as three sets of razor-sharp fangs regrow in their place. Your hair then extends and glows as you feel your butt and breasts expanding further. And it's not just then, you're getting bigger. You see the ground getting smaller and you quickly realize that you're becoming as big as a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're crying in fear as you pass the 300ft mark. \"This has got to be some bad dream!\" you scream. \"Ow!\" You bump your head on Core's bed and startle the crow. Core wakes up and squawks as you stand up and grow even bigger than her. You step back in fear and feel your ears become pointed as your face extends into a feline snout. Then you get on all fours and let out a roar of pain as your skin turns bright black and you sprout a pair of leather wings on her back and finally a scorpion tail that destroys your pants and leaves you standing half naked in front of Core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and see that you were more than twice her height.

That wererhino clearly had it in for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the other pachyderm they had on staff was Cyprus, a large white skinned, blonde and bespectacled behemoth, a monster resembling a hippopotamus with the skin of a dinosaur or a dragon and a large tail. Cyprus was Jedda's wife. They met at work and hit it off not long after a few years ago. You really hope Cyprus doesn't walk in on Jedda. While Jedda was trying to quit eating humans, Cyprus had no interest in making any changes in her own diet no matter how much she supported her mate's decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was Whitney, she'd punish you severely but if it was Cyprus, you might end up in a hippo-like monster's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho walks in on Jedda?</span></div></div>",

The guards from C-Block were fire element monsters but that block had the least dangerous orderlies as far as you\u2019re concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was your only friend in the institute, Charlene. At first you were afraid of her since she was a Jersey devil. But just because she was a demon, she wasn\u2019t a bad girl. She was very sensitive and sweet and understands your situation. Charlene might even help you escape which you find noble of her given that helping you break out could get her fired. For a demon she was rather warm hearted and you saw her as the nicest orderly in the Kaiju Disarming Plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Cressida, a big purple European dragon like those you see in fairy tales. But she was mostly harmless. Cressida was the oldest monster on the staff (she just turned a thousand). While she was still beautiful, the years were not kind to her. The once fearsome dragoness was now near-sighted, hard of hearing, rheumatic and couldn\u2019t even fly without hurting her back. Even breathing fire was hard for Cressida and she would cough her brains out after letting loose a few embers. While she did eat humans, it was very rarely because her digestive system isn\u2019t what it used to be. She was no longer fit for the job as a guard but was too stubborn to retire. If Cressida was the guard sent to return you to your cage, you had the best chance of outrunning her. But an over the hill dragon was still a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCressida however had a family member helping her on the job. Her granddaughter Tori was another orderly. Surprisingly Tori wasn\u2019t the same type of dragon as her grandmother. Instead she was a six-legged salamander. You assume one of Cressida\u2019s children had a mixed species marriage. Tori didn\u2019t think her grandmother deserved to be unwillingly retired so she signed up as an orderly to maintain Cressida\u2019s job security. She was the most threatening of the orderlies to you because she was as fast as a meteor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really hope that it\u2019s Charlene or Cressida because you\u2019d never stand a chance against Tori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note the original Tori chapter was deleted because the pevious one got her personality <i>completely</i> wrong.

This isn\u2019t a good sign naturally due to your small size, but you are at least in one of the least dangerous orderlies areas to be far. You are hoping is not Tori, because if it is, then your chances of getting out of here is about is likely possible as your chances of survival in general here if you meet anyone else. You started to look around and then you see elderly but still hourglass shaped dragon with colored scales that are bright purple, a yellow underbelly and long hair that is the color white. The dragon was also wearing a pair of small of glasses with a black one piece bikini and carries a cane to support herself. You were in relieved that it was Cressida. It might not be Charlene, but at least Cressida is very easy to deal with in general, as you would have not even a slight chance of dealing with Tori at all, but what you find out next is something that is just downright funny, and you hid behind one of the walls and saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that Cressida and Tori (the pitch black colored salamander slash dragon with six legs, the four in front doubling as two pairs of arms. She has long cyan hair and one-piece bikini that matches her color.) are both arguing at one another over something. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that Cressida should retire and live the rest of her life out somewhere, maybe at a retirement home. You kept one head looking at the two while you also tilt to say out of site in case they see you doing something. After all, with both Cressida and Tori around each other, you better not spark anything, otherwise you might just get eaten or returned to your prison. But still, you couldn\u2019t help but giggle about what they are talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, that one human always finds a way to break out somehow. Sometimes it is just best to eat that human, but I want to surely keep my job as she might just bitch for help.\u201d Tori muttered just as she tells her persistent grandmother Cressida about how that human is always a hard knock in the head to capture. \u201cI am sure she is hard. Also, the years really haven\u2019t been kind on me, and it almost makes me want to retire, but people who retire from the job are quitters, and I am determined to work till I die.\u201d Cressida told her just before she coughs out fire and even hurts her a bit, with Tori holding her up with her arms. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Tori asked her in concern just as she holds Cressida up before she nearly tills over. \u201cI am fine. Man I wish I was young again.\u201d \u201cMe too in certain aspects.\u201d Tori added as well just as she proceeds to get in front of her again. You couldn\u2019t help and giggle and even lightly laugh at the comedy that just happened with Cressida and Tori. \u201cEscaping is surely going to be really easy.\u201d You thought out just as you watch a little bit more, she then notices Tori turning her head towards your direction, and you quickly cover yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, still, how are you holding up?\u201d Cressida asked her grandchild in a loving concern. \u201cStill holding up fine grandma, I was just about to go checkup on some of the other patients and with Charlene as well. Besides, this job has surely some insane people. It almost makes me wonder if their brains are even well developed at all. Do you want to come?\u201d Tori asked her in a polite way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thank you. It is my job to keep the halls free of any escapers. After all, I am not giving up on my job at all, and I have no intention on losing it for any reasons whatsoever.\u201d Cressida smiled at her granddaughter before Tori proceeds to walk to the office in your direction. Thankfully she doesn\u2019t turn her head at all and you were not spotted, which was a nice sense of relief. \u201cThat is a good sense of relief. About time I get out of here, but of course I could take my time considering that Cressida is as slow as a snail.\u201d You thought just as you begin to fast walk across the hall, looking for somewhere to go to. After a bit you begin to see Cressida coming with her stick, but there was a chair in the middle of the hall she had the talk with Tori. She then proceeds to sit on it, and even fall asleep a bit. \u201cWell, that just made my day very easy, and so is my escape.\u201d You said to yourself just as you start to notice that Cressida is starting to sleep on the job, but she suddenly wakes up and notices a noise. \u201cWhat\u2026. Who\u2019s there?\u201d Cressida thought out just as she aims her cane like a shotgun. You keep your mouth shut and hopes that Cressida doesn\u2019t notice you, but thankfully she goes right back to sleep easily. You then proceed to take a look at the dragon just for a brief moment to notice how inactive that she is. \u201cThis escape is so easy. Tori hasn\u2019t caught me at all so\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori then appears from a far and then notices you right down on the ground, and you gasped just as Tori notices you. She came back from checking up on Charlene, and then suddenly Cressida then wakes up and then notices some sort of figure on the ground. \u201cWhat are you doing here you escapee?\u201d she said just as she slowly gets up with her cane, but turns to Tori. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I got this.\u201d She said just as she slowly walks towards you. You proceed to\u2026.. walk as she is walking at a snail\u2019s pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Sylvia escaping. She's probably on her way to Stephen. That little pest thinks she can muscle in on MY man? I'll turn her into salsa before she has the chance.\" You gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw that Abilene had left the door open.

One led to Missy's cell, another to Paula's cell, and the last led to the strangest patient in the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Mala. She was a baku, which meant she resembled a Tapir with a long nose, white hair, a white spot on her back, and grey eyes. She was also morbidly obese, easily the size of another patient, Victoria. From what you heard, she was in the KDP because she had a disorder that left her with a lowered intelligence. But there was one thing you heard that confused you: other patients said that her intelligence was low enough that she could ignore the laws of reality. You didn't believe it yourself, but if it was true, she could help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsteps were getting closer. You had to decide now. Closing your eyes, you duck under a door at random.

And then there's that smug little wyvern, Sora. The last thing I need is a girl around of Stephen's own species to steal him from me!

She doesn't treat you any different than she does any other patient, but thats not saying much since all the other patients don't like her very much. The thing that you don't like the most is that she's the closest orderly to Whitney. You hide near one of the desk legs as the giant owl inspects the top. \"Huh. Looks like Sylvia escaped.\" she observes. \"If I was in charge this wouldn't happen.\" You decide to stay hidden until she leaves, but Virginia bends down to check under the desk. \"Okay, I know you can't have gotten far little human.\" she says as she scans the floor. You hide behind the desk leg and hold your breath. Virginia begins feeling under the desk and when her winged hand lands in front of you a gasp escapes you. \"Ah ha!\" you hear from above. Thats all you need to start running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush from under the desk as Virginia stands up. Your best bet is to escape the room so you head for the door. Half the way though Virginia slams her talon down in front of you. You fall onto your butt and look up in fear. The wereowl stares down at you and opens and closes her mouth like a bird that just cornered its meal. It doesn't help that owls are birds of prey. You try to scramble away in the other direction but her other talon knocks you down. \"Did you really think you could get away you silly human? I guess I can't expect much more from you though.\" she says and shrugs. Did she just imply that you're dumb? You'd be upset if you weren't terrified. You find yourself being swooped into the air as she picks you up. You're brought to her face and are met with the sight of her giant beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what should I do with you?\" she ponders. \"I should turn you in. Dr. West or Whitney would be interested to know how easily you got out.\" It would be bad if she turned you in, especially to Whitney. That wererhino already hates you. \"Then again, I do enjoy a good human. I could easily have a snack and no one would know. This place is full of danger after all.\" You flinch as she clicks her beak at you. \"Or I could prove that I'm better qualified to cure you then that kitsune. I'm sure I could help you with your problems.\" Thats bad too. Virginia thinks she knows how to better help the patients, but her methods either don't work or sometimes make things worse.

That she considered humans to be little more than snacks that happened to talk was just flat-out evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hearing her talk to you like you were some gormless retard? That was just...petty! How low would this feathered twat go to boost her own ego?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your escape attempt collapsing within seconds, and now having to put up with Virginia's childish taunting, your fear turns to anger. You level your best death-glare at Virginia, stop your shivering, and growl, \"Fuck you and your overblown ego, you giant winged wanker. If you were even <i>half</i> as smart as you're always blabbing about being, you wouldn't be one of West's flunkies!\" You even think of spitting in her face, but at her size Virginia wouldn't even feel it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the look on her face? It's bloody <i>priceless</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...For all of two seconds. Then it shifts to fury. Snarling Virginia constricts you in her talons, the pressure bearing down on your ribcage like a sack of rocks. You yelp in pain, and feel some of her claws stab <i>through</i> your jumpsuit and prick your skin. Hard...you feel a few spots where you're undoubtedly bleeding.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirginia snarls, \"Think you're clever, eh? Think <i>I'm</i> the dumb one? Well, you're one to talk; badmouthing a girl hundreds of times your size that views your stupid little kind as snacks. And as much as I'd like to <i>gulp you down right here and now</i>\" --she snapped her beak inches in front of your face, making you cringe back in horror-- \"I think handing you over to the higher-ups would net me some points with them, and put yours truly on the fast track to promotion. Pretty clever, don't you think Sylvie?\" She asks it sweetly, like you were chatting over coffee, and NOT painfully grasped in her talon. \"Oh, and another thing? Before your little outburst, I was <i>considering</i> just putting you back in your cage and leaving a not for West. But now? <i>I'm taking you to Whitney, you smug little insect.</i> And I'm gonna tell her how you escaped AND mouthed off to an orderly. Who knows? Maybe she'll make...a <i><b>little change in her diet</b></i>, just this once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo...NO! Whitney already hated you for her (correct) suspicions that you'd pleaded insanity to avoid jail, and all your escape attempts. If she found out you'd tried to bust out <i>yet again</i>, AND trash-talked one of the orderlies...that rhino's punishment was going to be flat-out sadistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe even...fatal. The prospect of dying here, in a building full of crazed, man-eating monsters was more real now that it ever seemed...<br>\r\nYou didn't even try to hold back your tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVrginia just laughs. \"Aww, crying?

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Your are Sylvia, a female human in the monster world and you\u2019re in a very unsettling situation. As cowardly as you were, you somehow landed in Terrordale, a city full of giant monsters. But that was the least of your problems. You were seen at the crime scene and mistaken for a thief. You would\u2019ve been sent to monster jail, but you knew you wouldn\u2019t survive one day in such a prison. You pleaded insanity even though you knew you were completely innocent. This turned out to be a big mistake. You were admitted into a mental hospital for giant monsters run by Dr. Kaguya West. This institute is called the Kaijuu Disarming Plant because most monsters in this institute are as violent as any monster in a kaijuu movie and extremely dangerous to humans. There\u2019s only a handful of monsters in the entire institute that don\u2019t eat humans and since they don\u2019t serve humans in the K.D.P., most of them are ravenous. Five of these very creatures have escaped multiple times and have been seen in Monster Shores. Now you have to find away to get out of this bedlam house for monsters before you wind up in a giantess\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHospital Staff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Dr. Kaguya West<br>\r\nSpecies: Kitsune<br>\r\nHeight: 700ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A kitsune resembling a violet haired Japanese woman with the golden ears, feet and nine tails of a fox. Wears a labcoat with a tight ultramarine bikini.<br>\r\nDescription: An addition by Ultimate Neo from Monster Shores. Dr. West is the head of the K.D.P. She believes you\u2019re legitimately mentally ill and since she doesn\u2019t eat humans, she keeps you close to her most of the time to keep you out of trouble. You wouldn\u2019t mind if it didn\u2019t mean being kept in a cage on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Whitney Steranko<br>\r\nSpecies: Wererhino<br>\r\nHeight: 975ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A massive white skinned wererhino woman with long orange-red hair, two horns on her nose and a blue tattoo over her left eye. Wears a white nurse\u2019s outfit that looks about ready to burst off from her obesity and a silver colored bikini underneath. Whitney also wears a pair of thin glasses due to her species\u2019s bad eyesight.<br>\r\nDescription: Whitney is the head nurse at the institute and Dr. West\u2019s second in command. Unfortunately, Whitney is one of the only two monsters who knows that you\u2019re perfectly sane. Whitney resents you for pleading insanity and thinks you deserve to be in Under Gloom, so she\u2019s out to make your stay at the institute as nightmarish and painful as possible. Of all the monsters in the asylum, you\u2019re afraid of her the most and panic when you see her. However, Whitney doesn\u2019t hate humans so much as she hates you and actually discourages the idea of monsters eating humans. In fact, you\u2019ve heard that she has a human husband at home by the name of Xander. Despite being a wererhino, Whitney is half-Spriggan on her father's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Orderlies- Dr. West has 12 orderlies in the K.D.P. three of them for each of the four elements of Fire, Water, Air and Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Charlene Leads<br>\r\nSpecies: Jersey Devil<br>\r\nHeight: 900ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A muscular red skinned demoness with bat wings, hooves for feet and a horn\u2019s face with long horns. Charlene also has long pink hair that reaches down to her devil\u2019s tail. Wears a blue two piece bikini.<br>\r\nDescription: Charlene is one of the four orderlies that act as a security guards at the institute. She\u2019s the most gentle monster you\u2019ve ever met and somewhat timid. Charlene is your only friend in the entire bedlam house because she\u2019s the only monster who doesn\u2019t scare you. She knows why you chose to stay in this awful institute and though she doesn\u2019t want to lose her job, Charlene may or may not try to help you escape. However, for some reason, Charlene dislikes male humans and growls at any human man that gets anywhere near her. You\u2019ve even heard her growl at that lifeguard Stephen who helps return escaped patients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Cressida Fireworm<br>\r\nSpecies: European Dragon<br>\r\nHeight: 900ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A large elderly but still hourglass shaped dragon with bright purple colored scales, a yellow underbelly and long white hair. Cressida wears a pair of small of glasses with a black one piece bikini and carries a cane to support herself. Cressida resembles a stereotypical western dragon.<br>\r\nDescription: Cressida is the oldest orderly in the entire K.D.P. and has been there the longest of all the staff. However, the thousand year old dragoness is going senile, can barely see straight and has several chronic illnesses that slow her down, making her the least effective of the guards. In fact, she\u2019s the one guard least likely to catch you. But she\u2019s a persistent old lizard and isn\u2019t ready to retire just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Tori Miller<br>\r\nSpecies: Salamander<br>\r\nHeight: 850ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant pitch black colored salamander with six legs, the four in front doubling as two pairs of arms. Tori has long cyan hair and a matching one-piece bikini. She looks like a cross between an actual salamander and a dragon.<br>\r\nDescription: Tori is Cressida\u2019s granddaughter. She became an orderly in order to help her grandmother keep her job. Tori eats humans, but she\u2019s trying hard not to eat you because she thinks it will get her and Cressida in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Lilith Sebastian<br>\r\nSpecies: Werecrab<br>\r\nHeight: 650ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An enormous and muscular blue crab giantess. Lilith has long violet hair, huge stalks for eyes and giant claws for hands, one of which is bigger than the other. Generally she wears a red one piece bikini.<br>\r\nDescription: Lilith one of three aquatic orderlies in case anyone tries to swim away from the K.D.P. You\u2019re afraid of Lilith almost as much as Whitney because while Lilith is very courteous towards the monster patients, she loves to eat humans and the crab giantess tends to taunt you with the prospect of being swallowed in your cage. Lilith outright said that if you tried to escape she\u2019d put you in her belly. You\u2019ve even heard screaming coming from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Tarja Cooper<br>\r\nSpecies: Mock Turtle<br>\r\nHeight: 900ft\u2028<br>\r\nAppearance: A monster with the torso, shell and scaly arms of a green sea turtle but with the head, feet and legs of a minotaur with white and red fur. Tarja has shoulder length strawberry blonde hair and wears a yellow-green colored two piece bikini that is somehow attached to her shell.<br>\r\nDescription: Tarja is the only staff member at the K.D.P. who doesn\u2019t care about the recovery of the patients and is very callous towards the more mentally screwed up monsters when nobody\u2019s looking. She\u2019s incredibly vulgar and you\u2019ve seen her sneak alcohol on the job. Tarja knows this and has threatened to eat you if you report her to Whitney or Dr. West.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Jedda Starking-Crater<br>\r\nSpecies: Bahamut<br>\r\nHeight: 950ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An enormous light blue skinned monster with black hair dyed red in a bob cut. Jedda resembles a hippopotamus with the wings and skin of a dragon and the gills of a fish. For clothing she wears a tight violet colored two piece bikini.<br>\r\nDescription: Jedda is the younger sister of Elisa from Monster Slopes and one of the friendlier orderlies in the K.D.P.. However, unlike the rest of her family, Jedda eats humans but she\u2019s in a self-help group for predators who are trying to quit. Unfortunately she\u2019s finding it hard to resist the temptation and while she is friendly towards you, her willpower might reach its limit. You even have nightmares of seeing her enormous teeth from the inside of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Tress Briggs<br>\r\nSpecies: Shishi<br>\r\nHeight: 900ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A fat yellow skinned living statue of a Chinese guardian lion with golden blonde hair and blue cat\u2019s eyes. Tress has a fluffy tail the same color as her hair and generally wears a green two piece bikini and a pair of thin glasses<br>\r\nDescription: Tress is another orderly and a lesbian statue who is very fond of you despite the fact that you\u2019re not gay. She\u2019s also been very lonely since her previous girlfriend dumped her. If she catches you out of your cage, she\u2019d do deviant things to you that haunt your nightmares. But you have no choice but to yield to Tress because humans that turn down her advances end up in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Cyprus Starking-Crater<br>\r\nSpecies: Behemoth<br>\r\n\u2028Height: 950ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A gigantic white skinned hippopotamus with the scaly skin of a dragon and an elongated tail. Cyprus has long golden blonde hair and wears a pair of thin glasses and a yellow two piece bikini.<br>\r\nDescription: Cyprus is Jedda\u2019s mate. While she respects Jedda\u2019s decision to give up eating humans, Cyprus is even more predatory than Lilith and you\u2019ve even seen her eat a few humans on the job. Fortunately for you, Cyprus\u2019s glasses tend to fall off, giving you a chance to escape her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Diana Howler<br>\r\nSpecies: Werewolf<br>\r\nHeight: 900ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An silver furred werewolf with long blue hair that reaches down to her butt. Diana is morbidly obese to the point where it\u2019s a wonder she can stand up and for clothing she wears a gray two piece bikini that looks like it\u2019s painted on.<br>\r\nDescription: Diana is a scatterbrained and somewhat ditzy werewolf with many odd behavioral habits. The woman is also oblivious to her own weight and unpredictable when she encounters humans, though most of the time it ends with her sucking on them like gum. You don\u2019t know if she\u2019s actually swallowed a human before. Diana is in fact the one staff member who could probably use therapy herself. She is also the mother of Hecate from Monster Tower and Persephone from Monster Gaol. The latter\u2019s arrest drove her to a breakdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Gail Fog<br>\r\nSpecies: Cockatrice<br>\r\nHeight: 900ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An hourglass shaped monster with the upper body of a chicken and the lower body of a green lizard. Gail has wings attached to her arms that allow her to fly. Wears an orange two piece bikini.<br>\r\nDescription: Gail is Charlene\u2019s girlfriend and another orderly. You wish that Charlene would dump the bird giantess because Gail is another human eater like Lilith. What\u2019s worse is that Gail is trying to convert Charlene into a predator since your Jersey Devil friend\u2019s friendliness towards humans is due to having never tasted a human in her life. You\u2019re afraid that the cockatrice will finally convince Charlene to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Abilene Stallion<br>\r\nSpecies: Pegasus<br>\r\nHeight: 700ft<br>\r\n\u2028Appearance: A heavy set winged horse with chocolate colored fur and long white hair worn in pigtails.

Unfortunately she hates female humans because she\u2019s afraid they\u2019ll ruin her chances with him. Because of this Abilene has a habit of stomping on every female human she sees. She especially hates you despite you and Stephen never even meeting and told you that she was going to kill you if she saw you wandering the hall alone. Ironically she\u2019s the older sister of Blair, an enemy of Stephen\u2019s from Monster Slopes.

She has talons for hands that differentiate her from a harpy and mainly wears a pink two-piece bikini.<br>\r\nDescription: Of all the orderlies, Virginia is the one closest to Whitney, though the rest of the orderlies don\u2019t like her that much. She\u2019s the kind of monster who thinks she knows everything, especially since she considers herself to know more about treating the patients than Dr. West, even though that\u2019s definitely not true. You still would rather not take any chances with a giant owl because Virginia is still a bird of prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Luz Micah Del Caza<br>\r\nSpecies: Gorgon<br>\r\nHeight: 825 ft.<br>\r\nAppearance: Luz is a python gorgon.

While you've heard that she doesn't eat humans, you're still afraid that she might sit on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBlock A<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Kerry Boo<br>\r\nSpecies: Weredeer<br>\r\nHeight: 650ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A sienna furred teenage weredeer with an hourglass figure, large antlers and long brown hair that reaches down to her tail.

She refused to eat anything and her parents sent her to the K.D.P. to sort out this problem. Unfortunately there hasn\u2019t really been much improvement in terms of her dietary habits, but you wonder if that\u2019s a bad thing or not because one of the delicacies her folks tried to get her to eat was humans. Kerry is the youngest monster in the entire institute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Ranru Gama<br>\r\nSpecies: Werefrog<br>\r\nHeight: 550ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant hourglass figured frog with turquoise colored skin and darker blue spots.

For clothes she wears a striped shirt and skirt that are meant for children and are noticeably tight on her taller body.<br>\r\nDescription: Cassandra is an adult Werebat with the mental and emotional level of a 5 year old, making her unpredictable and extremely dangerous to humans. If she sees you in her cell she\u2019ll most likely mistake you for a toy or candy as she does with many humans she sees. They say her personality is the result of a head injury and she was a construction worker before she was put in the K.D.P.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Mira Clay<br>\r\nSpecies: Golem<br>\r\nHeight: 950ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A gigantic golem girl made out of purple clay.

She has messy hair and wears khaki pants with a black A-shirt.<br>\r\nDescription: Phoebe is a pyromaniac from Monster Shores who has caused the most damage of all the patients that escape. The harpy\u2019s entire dialogue consists of insane laughter and you\u2019ve even seen her set humans on fire before eating them.

Not to be confused with the Victoria in Monster Slopes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Lacy Wilson Teller<br>\r\nSpecies: Gremlin<br>\r\nHeight: 500 ft.<br>\r\nAppearance: Lacy has green skin, brown eyes, and black hair in a ponytail. She has the big pointed ears and sharp teeth typical of a gremlin. She has an hourglass shape with beefy arms.<br>\r\nDescription: An OC by the 12th Doctor. Lacy is in the KDP for one very bizarre fact: she thinks she's a character in an interactive story on a site called Writing.com. Nobody knows why she does this. All they know is that she \"talks to the readers\" all the time. She also comments on \"story ideas\" and \"cliches\" a lot. No one likes being around her, so she is usually kept seperate. The only normal thing about her is her mechanical skills, which are very good, befitting of a germlin. (As you can tell, Lacy will be breaking the 4th wall.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBlock B<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Hazel Hamill<br>\r\nSpecies: Wereskunk<br>\r\nHeight: 375ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A large pear shaped skunk woman with white markings on her face and pale green hair that stands out among her black and white fur. Hazel wears a purple straightjacket that has been unbuckled and sports red lipstick along with a permanent slasher smile on her face.<br>\r\nDescription: Hazel is a failed monster comedian who switched to a crueler sense of humor and started attacking people with strange pranks that nearly got several monsters killed. Hazel\u2019s twisted penchant for dark jokes hasn\u2019t faltered since she was put in the K.D.P. She\u2019s dangerously to both other monsters and humans and loves to spray humans with her toxic skunk mist, the last time she sprayed you the stench nearly killed you. If Charlene hadn\u2019t taken you out of there, Hazel would\u2019ve eaten you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Artemis Montague<br>\r\nSpecies: Python<br>\r\nHeight: 700ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A titanic wingless dragon resembling a purple python snake with arms, legs and horns.

She wears a primrose colored bathing suit.<br>\r\nDescription: Artemis is a recovering alcoholic who is staying at the institute to try and become sober. Unfortunately the python giantess is being eaten up inside by the withdrawal and if she cannot satisfy her thirst, she will go after anything that seems remotely edible, including humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Jen Handel<br>\r\nSpecies: Haniver<br>\r\nHeight: 300ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An hourglass shaped monster resembling a humanoid manta ray with blue skin and white spots.

Due to a head injury, she thinks she\u2019s a Sci Fi mad scientist named Dr. Saturday and is out to conquer Terrordale. She\u2019s built all sorts of weird inventions to escape and she\u2019s the hardest for the lifeguards to catch because she can fly and breath underwater. Jen either uses humans to test her inventions of mayhem or simply grabs one for a quick snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Phoenicia Splash<br>\r\nSpecies: Hippocampus<br>\r\nHeight: 680ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A white skinned monster resembling an obese anthromorphic horse with fins for ears, the scales of a fish, gills on her neck, a fish\u2019s tail and a large fin on her back like a sailfish. Phoenicia has pale blue hair and wears nothing more than a purple bikini.<br>\r\nDescription: Phoenicia is the type of monster that\u2019s only comfortable in sub zero temperatures and was admitted because her air conditioners caused a blackout in her apartment building. Since she isn\u2019t really an ice based monster, Sable\u2019s mindset is really bizarre. Unsurprisingly Phoenicia is a predatory beast when it comes to humans. In fact, the last human patient in the K.D.P. perished in her stomach. She\u2019s also cousins with Aqua, the kelpie from Monster Arms, but she hates being confused for a kelpie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Eunice Dent<br>\r\nSpecies: Spriggan<br>\r\nHeight: 300ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An hourglass shaped fairy with a grotesque looking face and white hair.

She suffers from split personalities that can change instantly. One of her personalities is nice and sweet while the other personality is angry, violent and prone to punching other monsters between the legs regardless of gender. The lifeguards don\u2019t know it, but Eunice will eat humans due to her split personality. In fact, she accused her human boyfriend of cheating on her and ate him without realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Core Kurotori<br>\r\nSpecies: Karasu-Tengu<br>\r\nHeight: 450ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An obese monster resembling a giant crow with indigo colored hair worn in a Japanese style bun. For clothing she wears a fuchsia colored kimono.<br>\r\nDescription: Core is an incurable kleptomaniac. She loves shiny objects and was sent to the K.D.P. because she kept taking random shiny objects of different value that didn\u2019t belong to her. Like you, she was originally going to be sent to Under Gloom, but unlike you it is clear something is wrong with her. Core is also a compulsive eater and will unconsciously devour any human that comes near her, even if she was having a friendly conservation with said human merely seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Hadie<br>\r\nSpecies: Hellhound<br>\r\nHeight: 750ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant voluptuous hellhound with crimson fur and dark red hair reaching past her shoulders.<br>\r\nDescription: An addition by Infinitebull. Hadie is a hellhound who thinks she is a cerberus with two missing heads and has multiple personality disorder.

Ayu has a form of body dismorphia, where she thinks her breasts are not big enough even though they are gargantuan. So she always tries to make them bigger. She is friendly towards Sylvia and, while she won't eat her, she will put her in her mouth if Sylvia needs to hide from someone. Has a crush on Charlene, but knows about her and Gail, so she tries to get Charlene to dump her due to Gail eating humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBlock C<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Mandy Hale<br>\r\nSpecies: Flying Pig<br>\r\nHeight: 550ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A fat purple skinned pig giantess with long black hair and a mole on her cheek.

She mainly wears a pink shirt and white skirt with a black jacket but in her opinion she\u2019d look good in anything.<br>\r\nDescription: Mandy is the vainest monster you\u2019ve ever met. She\u2019s as narcissistic as a peacock and can\u2019t stand anyone who she thinks might be more beautiful than her. The pig giantess tends to snatch up humans to ask if they think she\u2019s beautiful and if she thinks they\u2019re lying or if they tell her she\u2019s ugly, she eats them. Mandy especially doesn\u2019t like the idea that a human woman could be prettier than her and might just eat you for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Natasha Bailey<br>\r\nSpecies: Drider<br>\r\nHeight: 550ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant Caucasian woman with the lower body of a black widow spider. Natasha has long red hair and dresses up in a captain\u2019s jacket and tricorne like a pirate.<br>\r\nDescription: Natasha is one of six psychos that originated from Monster Shores. She has a delusion that she\u2019s a pirate and is one of the more violent patients as a result. Whenever she breaks out, Natasha tries to rob and assault people. The lifeguards at the beach don\u2019t know it, but Natasha likes to trap humans in spider webs before eating them. She doesn\u2019t get along well with Ranru at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Eartha Rockbottom<br>\r\nSpecies: Gargoyle<br>\r\nHeight: 900ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A pear shaped obese gargoyle girl with whitish green skin and long blonde hair. Typically wears a white loincloth and shirt with fishnet stockings.<br>\r\nDescription: Eartha is a belligerent French gargoyle who doesn\u2019t get along well with other monsters and suffers from Tourette Syndrome. She was admitted because she was given a court order for anger management. Unlike other gargoyles, Eartha is extremely dangerous to humans. A human kid played mean spirited pranks on her before she was admitted and because of this, she has an insatiable appetite for humans and especially loves eating human children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Amalthea Delast<br>\r\nSpecies: Unicorn<br>\r\nHeight: 700ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An obese pink and white striped unicorn with a bright long horn and long purple and white mane flowing down to her butt. For clothing she wears a gray toga.<br>\r\nDescription: Amalthea is a depressed unicorn who has never seen another member of her species in her life. Since unicorns are rare even in the monster world, Amalthea is convinced she\u2019s the last of her kind and was admitted because her neighbors saw her trying to kill herself. Dr. West is trying to cure her of her pessimism, but Amalthea is the only unicorn in the tri-city area. Just because she\u2019s a unicorn doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t dangerous because she sees humans as comfort food and one time when she was in England, she ate hundreds of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Allegra Flat<br>\r\nSpecies: Siren<br>\r\nHeight: 475ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A caramel skinned giantess resembling a Latina woman with long black hair and blue eyes, but with black scaly legs like a fish, gills on her neck and gray feathers growing on her arms. Wears nothing but an open blue jacket that only hides her nipples.<br>\r\nDescription: Despite being a siren, Allegra doesn\u2019t think that she is at all beautiful because she\u2019s never been able to entrance a man with her song. The siren girl is convinced she\u2019s ugly and hates herself. Unfortunately this also makes her dangerous to you because Allegra believes that eating human girls will make her beautiful. She was in fact admitted after eating thirty swimmers at Miami beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Jessie West<br>\r\nSpecies: Questing Beast<br>\r\nHeight: 675ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A purple and gold colored monster with the head of a snake and the body of a leopard. Very muscular in appearance and never wears clothes. Has tribal markings painted on her face.<br>\r\nDescription: Jessie is a feral monster that acts more like a wild beast than any of the civilized monsters. She was found by Dr. West as a child in the jungle and brought to the K.D.P. Unlike the other patients, Jessie is considered to be Kaguya\u2019s daughter and she will only listen to Dr. West.

The left side of Kelly's face is horribly burned, giving her face a split appearance.<br>\r\nDescription: An OC of the 12th Doctor. Kelly is suffering from a delusion that the world has been completely destroyed in a nuclear war, and that she is the only survivor. Due to this, she believes that everyone in the KDP is a ghost or hallucination. No one knows how this delusion started, but the burned half of her face may be part of it. She has made up her cell to be a fallout shelter, and is hoarding supplies to \"survive\". Since she thinks Sylvia is a ghost, she sees no point in eating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBlock D<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Avery<br>\r\nSpecies: Chimera<br>\r\nHeight: 300ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A 27 year old chimera resembling a human with sharks fins and a tail, suction cups all over her arms like an octopus. She is also part yuki-onna and has ice powers as a result. What you find unusual is that her mother is a pure landshark.<br>\r\nDescription: An addition by UltimateNeo from Monster Shores. Avery is generally friendly but she goes into a fury and yells \u201cMusha, musha, MUSHA!\u201d whenever she sees blood. She started going insane when she was 12 and a human friend of hers died. Like Mira she\u2019s one of only two patients in the K.D.P. who doesn\u2019t eat humans. Despite her small size, she\u2019s capable of pile driving monsters more than twice her size. In fact, you\u2019ve even seen her toss around that fat gargoyle girl lifeguard who usually brings in the escapees. She is also able to turn invisible and generates a icy chill wherever she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Nicole McBain<br>\r\nSpecies: Nuckelavee<br>\r\nHeight: 500ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A crimson red humanoid horse with no skin and exposed muscles with yellow veins and scars all over her body.

Nicole also has long gray hair and mainly wears a gray A-shirt and khaki pants.<br>\r\nDescription: Nicole is an incurable masochist who was sent to the K.D.P. by her boyfriend after she kept torturing herself in ways too grizzly to describe. Nicole gets off on pain to the point of swallowing humans carrying weapons and allowing Phoebe to set her on fire. That crazy horse woman has inflicted every scar all over her already gruesome looking body and you\u2019re terrified of what she\u2019d have planned for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Mercy Ford<br>\r\nSpecies: Lich<br>\r\nHeight: 325ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An hourglass shaped grayish green skinned zombie with part of her lip missing and long brown hair in ringlets with one white highlight. Mercy wears a yellow dress with a hoop skirt and white gloves that have become worn out from hundreds of years in the ground.<br>\r\nDescription: Mercy is the zombie of a Southern Belle who lived in the time of the wild west. She died in her sleep and after centuries in the grave, she still hasn\u2019t realized she\u2019s dead. Mercy in fact thinks that the K.D.P. is a hotel and doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s been admitted. In fact, she thinks the other monsters are people wearing costumes. Mercy doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re human and thinks you\u2019re a type of insect used as a delicacy in her new area, one that she\u2019s grown fond of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Paula Stargazer<br>\r\nSpecies: Cyclops<br>\r\nHeight: 700ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An obese rose skinned Cyclops with long blonde hair that looks like its graying due to her age. Mainly wears a black maid\u2019s outfit from her job before she was admitted.<br>\r\nDescription: Paula is an cyclops with an extreme case of O.C.D. Everything in her house had to be arranged a specific way or she\u2019d have a fit. Somewhat of a neat freak in that regard. She\u2019s one of those monsters that considers humans to be vermin because they were always getting in her house and leaving footprints. But this doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t eat them, except she prefers to wash them first. She\u2019s also the mother of Irene from Monster Arms and Irene visits Paula once a week. Thankfully Irene doesn\u2019t share her mom\u2019s appetite for humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Taylor Claw<br>\r\nSpecies: Stymphalian Bird<br>\r\nHeight: 700ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A fat bird with the face of a falcon and gold metallic feathers as sharp as knives. She has long bluish balck hair with sapphire eyes and wears a yellow jogging outfit with black highlights and a pair of black pearl earrings.<br>\r\nDescription: No one is sure exactly what is mentally wrong with Taylor but it\u2019s implied that it\u2019s something bad. She never speaks to anyone and instead communicates via morse code by stomping her talons on the ground. Taylor eats humans but unlike the other monsters, she prefers to chew because she has a hobby of making jewelry out of the bones of every human she\u2019s ever devoured and sells them to the other patients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Missy Kremlin<br>\r\nSpecies: Weregator<br>\r\nHeight: 800ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant and chubby weregator with long scarlet hair and scars all over her body. Missy\u2019s scales are permanently bright red from every human she\u2019s ever eaten. For clothing she wears a suit of silver armor that has also been stained with human blood.<br>\r\nDescription: Missy is a veteran of a monster war that took place decades ago and she\u2019s still haunted by memories of the war, which is why she never takes off her armor. She\u2019s violent towards the other patients and has even attacked the orderlies through her war flashback induced panic attacks. Unfortunately for you, she loves to eat humans so much that her skin and armor have been permanently stained with human blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Amara<br>\r\nSpecies: Werepanther<br>\r\nHeight: 400ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A petit-figured werepanther with black fur and yellow eyes.<br>\r\nDescription: An addition by Oregulus. Amara is a werepanther with extreme paranoia. As a teenager she was betrayed by her friends and now at 22 she has severe trust issues with her fellow monsters. She will only trust a select few such as Dr. West. But surprisingly this mistrust doesn't extend to humans. But she might see humans as food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Mala Drake Tarek<br>\r\nSpecies: Baku<br>\r\nHeight: 700 ft.<br>\r\nStory: Monster Bedlam<br>\r\nAppearance: Mala resembles a tapir, with a long nose, white hair, grey eyes, and a white spot on her back. She is morbidly obese, to the point of near total immobility.<br>\r\nPersonality: Mala is incredibly dumb. However, this lack of intelligence comes with an interesting ability: she is so dumb, she can ignore the laws of reality. She seems to inhabit her own little corner of reality, able to do what she want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: M\u00e9ish\u00e9nme (alias, real name forgotten)<br>\r\nSpecies: Qilin<br>\r\nHeight: 950 ft.<br>\r\nAppearance: M\u00e9ish\u00e9nme has naturally grey hair and grey eyes. Her body is covered in dull yellow scales. She has deer hooves for feet. Her body is fairly athletic, but she has enormous breasts due to an unbreakable curse, being slightly large then Ayu.<br>\r\nDescription: An OC of the 12th Doctor. M\u00e9ish\u00e9nme is a complete nihilist. She believes that all we do is pointless, and that concepts like life and death, good and evil, beauty and ugliness, have no meaning. She believes that everything will eventually become dust and forgotten, like her last name. Being immortal, she had to watch people age and die and whole civilizations collapse and be lost to time. Her one and only attempt at magic resulted in an unbreakable curse that made her breasts never stop growing. She stays in her cell all day. She sees no purpose in eating humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll monsters are giants, 300 feet is the minimum height.<br>\r\nNo Mutate, Mecha or Human giants.<br>\r\nKeep interaction with male monsters to a minimum.<br>\r\nPlease no Male Preds or any interaction with Male Giant privates!
