            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Music played over loud speakers as Luke was pushed along inside a dimly lit tunnel to a well lit stage. A day earlier, he has signed up to appear on a new game show. The series had apparently shot a few episodes, and though none had aired, buzz had begun through word of mouth. Luke didn't know almost anything about it, but when he saw the cute girl behind the mall kiosk asking if anyone wanted to be a contestant on \"Game Show of Transformation,\" he decided to give it a try. At worst, he would come out no richer. Of course, there was a decent chance he would win. In that sense, it was a low risk high reward situation, at least in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, one of the show's crew nearly shoved him on stage, leading him to stand on a red circle behinda podium. As he did so, the screen behind him lit up, showing a set of facts about him alongside his picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke, 5' 10\", 170 pounds. Bonuses: none. Penalties: none.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't remember being weighed or measured, but he let go of that thought rather quickly when what appeared to be his opponent lumbered out on stage. An incredibly fat brunette girl waddled on stage opposite him, dressed in a blue T-shirt to his red one, and stepped behind the podium assigned to her. A similar display of facts appeared, but they almost made Luke laugh this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyanna, 5' 7\", 330 pounds. Bonuses: none. Penalties: none.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyanna looked at Luke, who in suppressing his laughter, smirked as he saw these facts. Her brow furrowed in a combination of determination and anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights rose, music played, and the crowd cheered as a somewhat pudgy blonde woman strutted on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome! Welcome to Game Show of Transformation: the only game that will change YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore applause followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today, we have a treat for you guys. In red, give it up for Luke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spotlight fell on Luke and he shot a fist into the air. The crowd cheered some for him, but he expected more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in blue, give it up for Lyanna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd erupted in cheers. Luke scoffed. Clearly, she was the underdog, and the crowd always loves the underdog. Too bad Luke was going to mop the floor with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rules are simple,\" said the host \"Our contestants will play a series of games, each worth a number of points. First to 100 points wins. A win may earn you a bonus, while a loss may earn you a penalty. Shall we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd's emphatic cheer seemed to be a yes, and the host turned her head to see what game they would start with. A screen flashed options, slowing to a halt when it reached...</span></div></div>",

Just need to set the stage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the crowd cheers the host presses a button on the remote as both the red and blue stations began to shift and a large table suddenly came out from the floor. Various servers came in from the backstage, carrying tons of plates of spaghetti, Lyanna's dyed blue to match her color. Along with the plates, there was a large pitcher of water and a full glass left to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For this Olympic game will we see who can eat the most in ten minutes! Time to see if Lyanna's size will help her this round!\" The chubby host flashes a bright smile as Luke and Lyanna were suddenly called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you can't be serious?\" Luke said as they shoved a fork into his hand and tied a bib to his shirt. \"Deadly serious! Time for you two to chow down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyanna not wanting to miss a head start starts right on the first plate, carefully cleaning each plate off before setting upon their next task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke mentally cursing set about doing the same, being messier and leaving bits of chunks on each plate before reaching out to take the next one, their eyes glancing over towards the clock as it continued to tick down at a horribly slow rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the clock hits zero, Luke smiling at his large stack of plates before turning and glancing at Lyanna's smaller one. His stomach was distended outwards and hurting but he was assured of his victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The winner of the first contest is-\" The Host made a show of it as they took out a cue card. \"Lyanna! Finished off four plates as Luke finished off none of his!\" Horror struck the man as he realized she had been scraping off each bit, he was ready to cry bullshit before the equipment vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to spin the wheel! Give it a twirl Lyanna!\" Waddling over towards the wheel the chunky woman watched it begin to roll before finally landing on- \"Limp noodle! That happening so early too, I would not look forward to your chances!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd all laughs as the change began to take place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke glowers at the host laughter before he felt his body begin to tingle. He felt his clothing begin to become looser on him, his arms and legs feeling heavier. Shocked he pulls out at it only to reveal his body was becoming thinner, his muscles vanishing and leaving him thin as a rail. \"The f-\" A loud bleeping noise occurred as the Host began to waggle her finger at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No such language here or you'll receive a second punishment! Let's see the new ratings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke, 5' 9\", 135 pounds. Bonuses: none. Penalties: Limp Noodle<br>\r\nLyanna, 5' 7\", 330 pounds. Bonuses: none. Penalties: none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyanna snorts out as they turn towards Luke, flashing him a slight grin at his new change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for the next round!\"</span></div></div>",

This will help out contestants start out on equal footing if you know what I mean.\" Declares the host to the laughter of the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke scoffs at the choice, his eyes rolling at the apparent choice. He was confident in his own trivia skills, he had read up on common topics before coming in. He doubted that this fatty could even hit the buzzer before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that choice done two platforms were raised, one red and blue for each of their colors. A large buzzer was set atop each one, ready to be slapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get started!\" The host shouts out, excitement buzzing off him as he takes out the first card. \"The first topic is...\" He gestures towards the screen, it was quickly screening through them. \"Fast food today folks! Let's see how knowledgeable our contestants are today!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia lets out a giggle, taking a few steps towards the platform and pushing her sizable belly against it as she hovers her chubby hand over it. There seemed to be an air of confidence over her at this news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke frowns as he comes forward, settling it over the buzzer and appearing slightly worried. \"Just the first round, doubt it'll matter that much.\" He thinks, shifting his eyes towards the host as he takes out a card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First question, are the seasonal shake flavors at McChubbies?\" The host asks, flashing a smile towards the camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Luke could even try to think of an answer Lydia slams her hand down on the buzzer. \"Mango in the summer, candy corn in the fall, peppermint in the winter and strawberry banana in the spring!\" Lydia declares, seemingly very confident as a ding is heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She got it right! Point goes to Lydia.\" With that, the screen shows a 0/1 point cage with red and blue on either side. Luke sneers at the screen, flashing Lydia a glare. \"Course she got that, only a fatty like her would know something like that.\" At that the crowd began to boo, Lydia shrinking down beneath his insult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next question!\" The host shouts out, just going forward as they continue along the fast food questions. By the end it was 1/9, blue completely overtaking red. Luke was feeling a sinking feeling as Lydia was overly excited, having crushed her opponent in this round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we have it, folks! Nearly a complete rush over Luke! Now Lydia, come up here and spin the wheel!\" The host declares before a wheel began to come up from beneath the stage. On it was various anatomical parts of the body, much to Luke's confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia winks at Luke as she steps up, waddling her way towards the wheel to the crowd's roaring cries. \"Well Lydia, how have you been enjoying the show so far?\" The host asks, flashing the overweight brunette a wide smile. \"Oh, you know... Just enjoying my time here, did not expect to win this easily.\" She answers back, having gained some more confidence as he gestures towards the wheel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how this works is you spin the wheel and what it spins on... You are allowed to swap! Go ahead and give it a try or double the points you have from this win!\" </span></div></div>",

He didn't know much about this game show, but he did know there were a couple of physical components, and his teammate did not at all seem up to that challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on the couch before him in the waiting area, long brown hair framing a sweet smile and large, blue eyes. The good news ended there, however. Her hair fell onto soft, rounded shoulders that were attached to big, gelatinous arms. Fat hung over her elbow, the pillowy fat not even leaving big, meaty forearms untouched. Her generous bust rested on an even more generous jelly belly with a deep navel. She appeared too big even for the big set of clothes the show had provided for her, as the shirt she wore rode up about two inches, revealing pliant, pale flesh above a waistband that mercilessly cut into her chub. She was wide, with thick love handles rolling over the side of her pants, threatening to make contact with hips one could only call child-bearing if they were meant to bear an elephant calf. In her seated position, her thighs touched the whole way and spread out wide on the couch. She was a pear, that much was clear. Her gargantuan rear end was wedged firmly into the couch in the waiting room. Clay could tell she preferred the seated position, and wondered why the hell she had even signed up for this show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-So we should use our strengths accordingly,\" Bessie continued, though Clay had zoned out briefly as he pondered the obvious unfairness of the situation. He had seen their opponents already. There was Anna, who one could only call thicc in the most pleasing way. She was a busty hourglass but she clearly lifted weights. Her thighs and glutes had some firm defintion despite their womanly shape, and her stomach was flat and trim, showing the starting signs of visible abs. She seemed to be in better shape than her male partner, Lance, but not by much. He was merely thin, but it seemed clear he didn't do much in the way of exercise. Clay felt that even if he had been stuck with a rather portly woman he would have had an advantage in this game, given the fact that he was certainly in the best shape of anyone in the competition, but even he found the task of lugging around his 300 plus pound teammate downright daunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty good at trivia,\" she added, counting on her chubby digits, \"you should probably take lead on some physical challenges, but I'm also actually... are you paying attention to me right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Clay could respond with an earnest \"no,\" a man with a clipboard and an earpiece rushed into their room to tell them the game was about to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me up, will you?\" Asked Bessie as she held out her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe early fanfare of the show had subsided, with the host-a rather eccentric lad with a pencil mustache- introducing Clay's red team and the opposing blue team. Clay had to admit the podiums they stood on that revealed a few stats about their vitals, while useful, was odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRED TEAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLAY:  5' 10\", 173 pounds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBESSIE: 5' 5\", 338 pounds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBLUE TEAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANNA: 5' 4\", 126 pounds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLANCE: 6' 2\", 166 pounds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA set of games appeared on screen with each one flashing in order. Clay noticed there was an odd weight-theme going on with them, which again was very odd. Finally, it settled on...</span></div></div>",

That's an audience favorite around here,\" the host said in response to thunderous applause and hooting, \"Teams, select your players!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay looked at Bessie and smirked. If there was a physical challenge she was built for, this was it. She nodded knowingly and stepped forward into a ring that appeared in the middle of the stage. Some highly stereotypical Japanese string music played as she did so. The crowd cheered her on, but the team was getting some laughs as well. What was so funny? Had they committed some crucial miscalculation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the opposite side of the stage, Anna stepped forward to more applause and music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice blue team,\" the host commented as spotlights fell on Bessie and Anna. Red team has the bigger player, but remember we like to keep things fair here! Let's even the odds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA screen above them lit up, again showing their heights and weights. Clay didn't understand exactly how the host intended evening the odds between these two opponents until it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe number attached to Anna's name was rising, and fast. It hit 160 before Clay looked back at her to his surprise. Impossibly, Anna was growing. She became wider, her hips growing with her shoulders, thighs expanding to support her increasing weight. If that was the end of the development, it may have not been so troubling, but Clay noticed something else. She wasn't only putting on fat. It appeared that she was more or less retaining her current muscle composition as she grew. She looked like a thick body builder, and she was still growing. By the time she topped out at Bessie's weight, she was a sight to behold. Much of her weight settled on her hips and ass, set up by thick, powerfully muscled thighs. She had a bit of a belly, but it seemed tight despite the coating of fat covering it. She had gained a slight double chin, but it was nothing like the set of jowls that adorned Bessie's neck. Her arms, while not ripped, did not quite sag or wobble much at all. She looked every bit the \"strongman\" archetype despite retaining femininity. It was a bodytype that would not occur in nature, yet here it was. Clay understood why the crowd had laughed... under these conditions Bessie was seriously outmatched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBessie's eyes lit up with fear. It seems that she had actually been the worst person to select for this challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna widened her stance and dropped her hands onto her knees, strong hands gripping them. Bessie did the same, her body wobbling as sweat already appeared above her brow. Clay couldn't watch. He did watch, but- you know- he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ladies, wrestle!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over in a matter of seconds. Anna covered the distance between her and Bessie before Bessie had taken her second step, and she nearly lifted her clean into the air as she pushed her out of the circle in the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was quick!\" The announcer called out amid cheers, \"Blue team wins in commanding fashion 10 points to them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna slimmed back down to her original size as Bessie struggled to her feet after having been knocked on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clay and Bessie, for that pathetic attempt, you'll be spinning the wheel of LOSERS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd let out a collective \"oooh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" said Clay angrily as a wheel was pulled out before him, \"I'll spin it, but it'll be the last time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBessie stepped back to her podium as the sumo ring was removed and the audience focused on Clay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the punishments, if not most of them, made little sense to him. He grabbed the wheel and spun it as the crowd's chatter died down. It spun for some time before landing on an odd one \"the weakest links.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that one is a DOOZY,\" the host said with a smirk, \"know how it works, red team?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay and Bessie shook their heads in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, blue team will select who they think is the weakest link on your team. Any losses you suffer make your strongest character more like your weakest link. Now blue team, who is the weakest lin-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BESSIE!\" they shouted simultaneously before the announcer could even finish his question. The audience laughed and cheered in response, which was starting go get Clay a bit angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice!\" The host responded, \"Then that means that Clay will become more like Bessie with each loss. And you two just lost, didn't you? Let's give you a taste!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay began to feel very odd- an uncomfortable bloating sensation overtook him as he felt his clothes began to stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-what's happening to me?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBessie looked on in horror, thinking she knew exactly what was going on. Clay was growing fatter, and by no small amount. First, all muscle definition left him as his muscles dwindled slightly, fat creeping into where it had once been. His abs turned into a slight belly with a puffy set of lovehandles rising like dough from above his waistband. They didn't call her \"Bessie Backside\" for nothing, though. His buttcheeks began to plump up, growing from a rather flat affair to a small but noticeable buble. His thighs followed suit, but they didn't grow quite as much as some of his muscle was replaced with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay pressed into his newfound softness with disgust. He looked up at the number associated with his name, which had risen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLAY: 5'10\" 195<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The audience vote can also give the girl added prizes if they agree with her choice or even punish the girl if they believe they were being superficial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are a grand total of three possible dates per show, if there is no kiss at the end there is a final penalty at the end that involves each of the burners to come in to add another punishment down on the contestant. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>William was ecstatic as they were being led over to the stage. A college student and secret fan of these shows like the Bachelor he was excited to be fawned over by a bunch of pretty girls. The man would be led onto the stage as they eye the sleazy looking Host. He had not had much time for dating, let alone any type of fun and being paid for doing it had him ready for a much needed break. The idea of finding a girlfriend too was lofty but not one he was against. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Host was a blonde man in a white and red checkered suit, looking much like a candy cane. They were holding up a few cards as they waved for William to come over. The audience was already seated, making William more nervous at the size of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry kid, we'll get started in just a second. Stand on that-\" They gesture towards a single platform. Upon sitting on it he realized his face and odd stats were on the screen. Showing his weight at 150 lbs and standing at 5'11. He was wearing the silly looking tux they had dressed him in, he was not muscular but appeared in shape. \"Now, smile for the camera, we're about to go live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden burst of catchy music, the audience began to cheer, William smiling uneasily as he found the host stepping up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome everyone to another game of-\" Gesturing out towards the crowd they all shouted out. \"Love or Burn!\" The host continues. \"The only game where we get to test the true limits of love. We have our latest vic-\" The Host winks at the crowd. \"Guest, everyone give a hand to William!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam idly waves out at the crowd as the host continued onwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today you'll be going on dates with up to at least three fabulous women, let's start to show you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden button press, the wall in the back began to come up, a curtain with three very round and wide silhouettes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady number one is the Heiress of the Mendy's corporation, party girl and fantastically wealthy Michelle!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas deflated, he was worried that this girl was just trying to be one of those rich girls who was trying to be famous for being rich. He was suddenly uneasy about the continued dates. Pondering on how to handle this he hardly even notice the curtain begin to fall to reveal her, but he did not stop staring as it fell. He thought that they were hiding the shape, it appeared to have fit the silhouette to a T. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle was massively heavy, pear shaped and in ill fitting tight clothing that would look much better on a woman one third of her size. She had a tan, dark curly black hair, and heavy makeup on but what her took in was their incredibly out of shape body. The statistics on the screen came up, revealing her weight at 376 lbs and standing at 5'8. As they waddled over towards the other platform, blowing William a kiss. She was wearing a minidress and wedge heels, her massive thighs being on display and she could be seen adjusting her mega sized breasts as she gazes at William. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to reveal what your date will be-\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly the stages began to shake and shift, the platforms William, the Host and Michelle were on remained standing but everyone else went beneath the ground. Slightly confused he was then relieved when the ground came back up, but more confused at what it brought. A great deal of sand, the light above them now shining brighter and a small pool was presented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first date will be a fun time at the beach! Time for you two to get changed-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe host began to mess with a panel that appeared in front of him as William's clothes began to shrink and shift. The top part of the tux he had worn on had flung itself off him, and the pants he had on were changing into a blue bathing suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat trick.\" He muttered briefly, before taking in the sight of Michelle. The tight fitting micro dress was shrinking even further for her, and turning suddenly into a skimpy bikini. Her tan was surprisingly even, fitting with the suit perfectly and showing off every last ounce of fat on her blubbery body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now William!\" The Host shouts out, gesturing for him to come over. \"It's time for you to impress Michelle, date time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the date commenced, Michelle waddling straight at William and gripping him into a big hug, her big chest smacking against his own, making him wince. Her hand reaches for his own as they walk over towards the water, a small picnic basket was there along with towels. Setting one out she began to lay down upon it, her huge ass jiggling as she swayed her hips back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not half bad looking, Willy! Best that you start working on getting that suntan for me, try and really dig your fingers in there. All dem watching back at home need to see my delicious body, don't you know?\" Snickering she began to unbuckle her bra, allowing him to hit everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right...\" A slight look of disgust hit the man's face, he had nothing against the heavier people but this was not what he had in mind about the show. Taking the suntan lotion he began to spread it all out along her wide back and flabby shoulders, the audience making a few cooing sounds as she made girlish squeaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Willy... Your fingers know just how to touch me. How about you go and feed me some strawberries now, hun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle appeared to enjoy being pampered and the center of attention, his guess at her trying to use this show to become famous becoming clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the date, he was set to feed her strawberries, fan her delicately with a leaf fan and basically be at her beck and call. Near the end William was tired and flustered, rather hoped she would not be the one to kiss him at the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time is up folks! Michelle, come on over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping her up the contestant would watch her contently sway her hips and adjust the straps on her bikini as she took her sweet time over to the Host. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time to answer... Michelle, will you Kiss or Burn!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he was an awful date.\" The woman snorts out, her arm lifting up as she jerks her wrist up and down. \"What man would be at my beck and call like that? I need a man who can take ahold of me and tell me what to do, what's the point of a skinny little boy like him taking in-\" They gesture at their frame. \"All of this. It's ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam stands there mouth agaped as she went on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we hear that right!? Michelle, are you saying that you are burning him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle smiles sweetly at him, preparing to answer. </span></div></div>",
