All around you are large stocks of green plants. Upon closer inspection, you realize that it's grass. You must of shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've shrunk! you think. You begin to panic. Who knows where the heck you are? What if someone sees you? What if you get hurt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, calm down... You steady yourself. You strain your eyes and look as far as you can, trying to find something that might help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes land on something huge. You go closer to see what it is. You don't believe it! Six feet in front of you is a family of giant wolves! They seem to be having a picnic. Other than shoes they're dressed like humans. They have fluffy, gray fur and yellowish eyes. You can see a bit of blue in the little boy wolf's eyes. You move slowly closer. You see that there is a father wolf, a mother wolf, a teenage girl wolf and a little boy wolf. They're probably your only chance of knowing what's going on. Who should you go to?</span></div></div>",

Before long, you were finally at the end of the wolf's tail and you grabbed onto it and began to give it a tug. You were pulling the massive tail with all your might while the wolf barely even noticed you. After more attempts of pulling the wolf's tail, you began to move it back and forth, side to side, etc. Soon you were finally noticed by the wolf, as he began to put his paw at the end of his tail. You could've sworn you heard him say, \"What the hell?\" as he reached down for you. The wolf then grabbed you and quickly moved you to his face, all of it seemed like a roller coaster ride to you. When you brought in front of his face he said, \"What the hell or who the hell are you?\" You then said, \"My name is Keane! I am a human from earth, I do not know how I got here, or why I am this small, but please don't kill me!\" The wolf looked over your body before responding, \"My name is Mark, don't worry I will not hurt you, but I do not know about the rest of my family, so it is probably in your best interest that you avoid them. I'm going to take you home with me, so I will put you in my pants pocket.\" Mark then stuffed you in his pants pocket next to his wallet while he continued to spend the rest of the picnicking with his family. <br>\r\nYou then began to fall asleep and woke up and discovered...</span></div></div>",

When your body is past the ring, it seals shut again, trapping you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wasnt alone inside the stomach. Chunks of mashed food were inside too, and more entered the fleshy chamber through the stomach sphincter somewhere above you. You feel Mark let out a belch, all leftover air in the stomach getting sucked out as it tightened around you, the soft flesh squeezing you and the food inside. A loud gurgle indicated the start of digestion as a warm liquid seeped from the walls. As soon as it touched you, it burned. The stomach quickly gets filled up with Mark's digestive acids and you get digested, turning into a nutritious goop that sank back into the wolf's intestines. There, everything that was usable for the predator was taken out and you soon take on the form of another chunk of the wolf's crap. The colon around your former body clenched and squeezed you, the wolf's anus puckering as it pushed you outside, into the outside world.</span></div></div>",

Fine!\" Mark said as he gasps \"If you continue on that way it wouldn't be able to hold you in for much longer.\" As he said this the voice of his wife can be heard in another room. \"Honey who are you talking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I am on the phone with one of my bros!\" He replied back to his wife. With a more whispered voice he tells Keane \"Hold tight for a minute and I will let you out somewhere private, away from my family.\" Mark thinks for a couple of seconds and then heads to the master bath adjacent to his bedroom shutting the door behind him.Meanwhile Keane has calmed down for the moment waiting to be released from his prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark goes over to the bathtub and turns on the shower. The noise of the shower is deafening to Keane as he could no longer hear Mark mumbling to himself. Mark opens up the mirror cabinet and begins searching for his wife's strawberry scented/flavor lubricant. Upon finding it he sets it on the counter and proceeds to undress himself. Fully naked he gathers his clothing and places them in the near by hamper. He begins the head for the shower but catches site of himself in full body mirror on the wall of the bathroom. Mark is very well toned and in his prime. Everything about him screams Alpha from his well defined abs to his thick sheath containing a well endowed member. He looks himself while doing various poses, pleased in what he sees. His eyes then gaze at his own balls. Remembering that he has a small human trapped within gives him a chill of pleasure that travels from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet. This renewed revelation causes his member to peak out of it's protective sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark grabs the lube and enters the shower closing the shower curtains. He taps on the ball containing Keane and says\"Alright do your part the help and you will get out of there faster.\" Keane could only feel his prison move as he is jostled around a few moments before the tapping stops. Unable the hear a word Mark said due to the shower running. He still takes it as a sign to help arouse Mark so Keane begins to rub the inside of Mark's balls. The twing of pleasure furthers Mark's erection, he proceeds to lube up and begins rubbing his shaft nice and slow as to not make it end quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god.\" Mark says with a low stifled voice. \"This feels amazing.\" He continues to slowly work his shaft when a small thought invaded his mind. 'Did I forget to lock the bathroom door'. But that thought was but a fleeting moment as the pleasure he is feeling is overwhelming all his senses.</span></div></div>",

Mark on the other hand is in no hurry as he occasionally stops catches so small unessicary breathers as he just soaks up all the wonder feels going on in his nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis goes on for minutes until unbeknownst to Mark and especially Keane someone has entered the bathroom. A shadowy figure can be seen on the other side of the shower curtain. A shadowy hand reaches for the end of the curtain and whips it open in a flash. This snaps Mark out of his pleasurable trance as he recoils to the side of the bathtub, knocking a bar of soap to the bottom of the tube, looking to see who it is. He immediately recognizes his wife Cathleen dress in a bathrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark honey?\" Cathleen says aloud as she slowly turns to fix her gaze on him. \"You don't mind if I jump... on... iiiii...\" She finally takes in the whole scene as she catches her husband wide eyed frozen with dick in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Baby it is not what you think?\" Mark stammers as the only thing that comes to his mind. The shock causes him libido loss as his member begins to lose girth and slowly retreat back into the sheath. Meanwhile Keane now very tired tries very hard to continue to arouse Mark unaware of the situation going on outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathleen noticing Mark's retreating member perks up \"Oh honey. You don't have to stop on my account. In Fact...\" She disrobes herself and tosses aside he bathrobe revealing her well toned curvy body equipped with supple natural breasts. She begins to caress herself starting at her neck and working down her abdomen before placing her hands on he thick thighs. \"You want me to help you?\" She gets into the shower with Mark and closes the curtains behind her. She begins kissing Mark but he is still a little frozen with the guilt of being caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark honey relax, your all tense.\" She says as she attempts to massage his neck and arms. She giggles as she steals a glace at his almost retreated cock. \"I know how to make you feel relaxed.\" She licks her lips and starts kissing Mark's chest and begins to slowly work her way down. She finally makes it the his sheath which is now hiding the fugitive. Cathleen makes a playful frown. \"Awww, why don't you come out and play?\" With that she begins to work her tongue inside his sheath trying hard to wake up his member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell hard is an understatement it takes but a few seconds for Mark to go cross eyed with pleasure as his cock comes forth once again. \"There he is!\" The wife says in playful song. She licks her lips once again and begins to take in the massive girth allowing it to go deep down her thought. Mark is overwhelmed by the sensation causing him to become fully erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Keane is exhausted inside Mark's ball. Having almost given up hope that he will not be released he can feel the temperature rising even faster now. \"Alright he must almost be there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark snaps out of his new trance to realize and remember that Keane is still trapped within and if he were to release now would cause Keane to shoot him into his wife's awaiting maw. With that he reaches down behind himself and begins tapping the ball containing Keane. It is a series of 3 quick taps followed by 3 slow taps. He continues this hoping Keane gets the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the heat rising Keane is once again jostled by some tapping. Not sure what to make of it he decides that he must muster up his remaining energy and go for the final push.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She licks her lips yet again. \"Mmm strawberries.\" She stands back up. \"Oh Mark this is one of the things I love about you.

Not sure what is going on outside the wieght of Mark's wife is adding some unknown pressure to Keane's prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathleen starts to ride up and down Mark's shaft moaning with plessure. The moans pierce through the flesh as Keane suddenly hears and feels the reverberations. The pressure of the prison would build up then release, build up and release in methodical timing. \"Oh shit... Mark you better not be doing what I think you are doing!\" Keane yells allowed falling of deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark stunned with ecstasy makes feeble attempts to unmount his wife as she continues to pin him down and do all the work. It becomes to much for Mark he whispers softly as his wife moans aloud \"I'm sorry Keane.\" And with that he gets a second wind, and despite his wife trying to keep him pinned down, he manages to sit up and grabs ahold of his wife's love handles and begins rigorously pumping. This excites Cathleen and the sudden involvement of her Alpha Male cause her to scream louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Keane tosses around in his prison as the balls begin to move and slap against Cathleen's inner thighs. The heat intensifies and Keane along with the stored cum gets moved out of the ball through the vas deferens and deposited temporarily into the prostate. As Mark continues pumping the pressure of the cum around Keane increases. Keane no longer able to breath can feel himself starting to black out. But before he does Mark makes one last final hard push into his wife cause his knot to lodge inside her as they both loadly moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flood gate is released and Keane flows quickly with the cum ejecting deep within Cathleen. Keane now free from Mark now finds himself in another prison. With little room to move Keane lies there in a pool of cum trying to make sense of his whereabouts. he feels around the slimy walls finding two fleshy bumps seemingly block his way in both directions of the slimy tunnel. Not know which one is Mark's cock as both show no sign of retreating anytime soon Keane decides it's a fifty fifty chance if he were to grab a hold of one that he would be able to escape Cathleen's nethers.</span></div></div>",

Finally he decides which direction he believes is Mark's penis and slowly makes his way over. Cathleen's Vagina, as Keane discovers, is very difficult to travel through. The slick walls make it hard for Keane to grip on to anything for support causing him to lose traction and fall quite often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile both Mark and Cathleen are still embracing one another glowing with satisfaction. Both breathing heavily, without saying a word, they stare at each other longingly and begin kissing each other passionately. Minutes pass, \"Wow that was amazing,\" Cathleen says heavily. \"You playing hard to get was a fun little game. We should defiantly try that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looks off to his side. \"Yeah... hard to get...\" His thoughts now are on Keane. He feels kinda terrible for what he had just done. He could try to have justified his actions but he should have put a stop to his wife's advances sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathleen moans a little, \"Oh baby! I don't know how you are doing that. But it tickles.\" Mark stares at her confusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane finally makes it to the tip of Mark's cock. He attempts to grab a hold but the smooth surfaces and all the bodily fluids makes it impossible to grip the tip. Mark feels Keane rubbing and tickling his head making his eye twitch with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong baby? I am not hurting you am I?\" Cathleen says are she notices Mark's eye twitch. She attempts to re position herself the best that she could to minimize any pressure she maybe causing Mark due to their situation. She has Mark lay down in the tub as she proceeds to sit on his lap while the both wait for his swelling to finally recede.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knot still firmly in place as she moves around a little causes Keane position to shift a little. The walls around seem to lift up making the tunnel go vertical. Stuck to the side of the Vaginal wall Keane peels himself off and lands on the cock head. \"Hopefully I can just slide out once Mark does\" he waits yet again for Mark to pull through for him finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes continue the pass as Cathleen takes the bar of soap and begins cleaning herself thoroughly. Mark still pinned down watches his wife as the shower water rains down on them both. Once done she tries her best to scrub Mark down. As she is cleaning Mark she is finding it a little easier to move around. She attempts to separate from Mark but she couldn't yet. \"Almost there baby. \" She coos at Mark. Mark holds his breath, hoping for some miracle that Keane can somehow make it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Keane was sitting there he was begging to notice the walls around him seem to be collapsing in as time went on. Soon before he knew it the walls were beginning to pin him against Mark's member as Cathleen arousal begins to taper off. Still having trouble gripping anything Keane begins to worry that he may still get trapped in here if he doesn't act quick. Suddenly Mark's penis moves down a little from Keane as Cathleen attempted to separate again. The worse part is Keane didn't move with it he got stuck on the vaginal wall as it continues to collapse around him. He struggles to make is way back to the penis head but makes it. \"I got to think of something quick!\" Keane says as he feels around the cock head again. Then he felt the cleft of the head and as an act of desperation jams on of his arms into Mark's Urethra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark feeling something entering his penis assumes it might be Keane. So he clenches his urethra grabbing hold of Keane's arm. Keane now feeling the pressure of the cock gripping his arm hopes it will be enough to be pulled out. The vaginal walls now fully collapsed save for the areas where mark is still holding it up. Keane can feel his thighs and legs getting pinned down by the vaginal wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's Swelling has died down enough and Cathleen begins to get up off Mark.</span></div></div>",

A flood of light blinds Keane as finally gets to see the outside world again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark catches sight of Keane still stuck on his penis and sighs with relief. His dick goes limp falling towards Mark's pelvic region. Keane, now dangling due to his arm still being gripped by Mark. He snaps out of his disorienting ride and begins looking around he notices Mark starting at him. Once thier eyes meet Mark lifts his hand to his face. Taking his index finger to his face he motions to Keane to be quiet then he slightly motions Keane \"up\". Keane confused he looks up and bears witness to a hot sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathleen was still hovering about Mark's member as she proceed to finger herself to \"fix\" any discomfort. She then takes the bar of soap and cleans her pubic region. The water and soap drip down on Keane below. Mesmerized by the site gave Keane an incredible erection. Going over what had happened in his mind made him realize that this whole ordeal was kinda kinky and fun. As Keane continues to day dream and blush he has become unaware that Mark's receding cock is slowly reeling him into his sheath. It wasn't until Keane's body collided with the sheath that he finally realzed what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no not again,\" Keane thought as he begun to thrash about. He turns towards Mark's face and desperately tries the signal him. Mark stares back at Keane giving him a look that says 'just chill for a moment'. Not loosening his grip on Keane's arm he allows his penis to drag Keane down into his sheath to hide him from Cathleen.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nCathleen still unaware of Keane's presence says to Mark, \"Oh dear where are my manners. Want me to finish washing you?\" She motions to Mark to get up. Mark pulls himself out from under her and they both stand back up. She turns him around and scrubs down Mark's back. Once done she steps out of the shower and begins to dry herself off. \"Mark honey aren't you getting out as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a moment dear, I still have to clean my junk\" he looks down at his sheath and sees Keane's legs peeking out a little. He quickly pushes them further in and pinches off the tip of his sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ok I will see you in bed then,\" She finishes drying herself off and puts back on her bathrobe and leaves the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark closes the shower curtains, waits for a moment before relaxing his grip on Keane letting out a big sigh. He finagles his sheath a bit trying to work Keane out of there. Finally out, Keane begins gasping for fresh air. He is free at last. \"I am. So sorry.\" Mark says to Keane as he holds him in his hands. He brings him under the shower water and begins cleaning the sex off of Keane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane struggling to say anything as the water rains down on him. He wanted to be mad but he still admits it was kinda fun. They both get out of the shower and dry off. \"What now? I still need to think of some way to get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah about that,\" Mark begins. \"I kinda wanted to discuss that with my wife, but as you can see things kinda got out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she actually might know of a way home?\" Asked Keane excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Mark replies \"She is a scientist who works for a highly funded R&amp;D lab. Who know what they are cooking up in there. She is really nice and sympathetic to you humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane looked at Mark confused, \"what is that suppose to mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh. Never mind, best you didn't know.\" says Mark. He picks up Keane and heads for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W W wait. What do you mean by th-\" he then he stops himself as they pass through the door and enter the bedroom. He looks around the nicely decorated bedroom before fixing his gaze on Cathleen who is now in a skimpy lingerie robe reading a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey...\" Mark says softly to his wife. She looks up at him as he sits down next to her and shows her Keane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark.. where did you find this?\" She examines Keane closly before petting him on the back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was in the bathroom hamper he must have gotten on my clothes during the picnic this afternoon.

I don't live on a farm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you... don't?\" She grabs and lifts of Keane's shirt looking at his bare back. \"Oh interesting you don't have a brand. Who are you and where did you come from\" she sets him down carefully back in Mark's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane tells here about his world and the golden box with the strange green crystal that seemed to have teleported him to this world. Cathleen listens intently fascinated by every word he says. \"Wow what a tale, you were brave to grab on to my hubbies clothes all the way home in hopes that we would help you.\" She then blushes. \"Oh my then you must have heard and maybe seen...\" she covers her face for a moment. \"Anyways this green crystal you speak of sounds familiar. I will investigate my work place tomorrow and tell you what I find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane is revealed that he found 2 fast allies in this strange world not to mention a possible lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sets Keane on the dresser next to the bed.

You've been struggling to escape since you woke up an hour or so before, and it has given Mark a giant case of morning wood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I see someone is up for some action this morning.\" she mumbles, aroused, to her husband. She bent over on the bed and motioned for Mark to mount her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark seized the moment and was thrusting into his wife before he remembered you. He really didn't have any way to back out now without arousing his wife's suspicion, and the combination of sliding into her and you jostling around was more amazing than anything he'd experienced in quite awhile, so he decided to just go with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were intensely upset at having spent the night inside of one of Mark's balls. You were in some sort of large, cum filled reserve that just seemed to go on forever. Your attempts to escape led nowhere. They only seemed to arouse mark. You could feel heat radiating from every direction. When he mounted his wife you were suddenly and violently slammed around inside of your prison. There was nothing to grab onto and  nothing that you could do as Mark got more and more into the rhythm and slid deeper and deeper into his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gripped the bedsheets as he pounded her over and over again. Mark normally didn't have this much energy first thing in the morning. She would have to try this more often, in hopes of a repeat! She was in ecstasy as Mark really leaned into it and pounded her like a piston. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was going crazy trying to hold back. This was the best sex he'd had in ages. He knew that he was building up to a climax and decided that there was nothing he could do to stop it. He shoved himself deep into his wife, and with a series of low grunts he came in huge bursts inside of her. You were propelled out at mach speeds from one prison and into another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and his wife drifted peacefully together in the afterglow for a few minutes. When their alarm clock went off, Mark discovered something interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I think I knotted myself into you.\" he said to his wife with a touch of embarrassment. He hadn't managed to do that since he was a teenager. Since he had been so ridiculously aroused, his penis had lodged itself firmly inside of his wife and refused to budge as he tried to pull it out. She giggled and rolled over on top of him, pinning him to the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go back to sleep for a while. The world can wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were on top of Mark's erection, pounding at the hot and slimy surface in frustration.

No matter how hard you pushed against the walls around you, there wasn't any way to get past it and get out of your humid, pulsing prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mark finally fell completely asleep again, his erection finally began to fade. You could feel it slowly deflating beneath you and renewed your attempts to escape. It finally dropped to the point where you were able to squeeze your way out. You found yourself standing on the base of Mark's cock, looking upwards at him and his wife through a sea of fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused for just a split second to catch your breath after having been trapped in between Mark and his wife for so long, and in that moment Mark began to swiftly retract back into his sheath. You barely even had time to react as the still slightly swollen knot pushed you against Mark and then took you with it back into him. He was soon completely deflated, and you found yourself stuck in his hot and musky pouch. The strong smell combined with the lack of oxygen and knocked you out after a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so later, Mark got up to begin his work day, having completely forgotten about you. </span></div></div>",

At first he had been delighted by the sensation, before realizing exactly what it was and that you had been ejected from your fleshy prison. He kept trying to calm himself down, but the sensation was incredibly stimulating and his knot stayed in place until you collapsed, slimy and exhausted. His knot slowly began to deflate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it had gone down to a certain degree, he slowly and carefully pulled himself out of his still sleepy wife. He examined his cock this way and that, trying to find you, and then milked it a few times just in case you had gone down his slit, but had to admit with a certain amount of chagrin that when he had pulled out he had \"left a man behind\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was okay, he reasoned. He could always get you back. He would just have to be careful how he did it. Smiling, he rubbed one of his wife's breasts and kissed her firmly before beginning to move his head downward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he pulled out, you briefly roused at the sudden lack of pressure. Then you realized exactly where you had been left behind. You panicked and tried to scream, but only ended up coughing after inhaling a glob of his spunk. Most of it was further inside of his wife, but you had landed in a puddle of it, it seemed. You sputtered for a few seconds, trying to clear the liquid from your throat when the ground beneath you bucked and contracted. The walls around you heated up noticeably and rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Mark stretched one arm upward to fondle his wife's chest. The other arm he used to support himself as he trailed a stream of soft licks and nibbles down to his wife's slit. She moaned, and he began lapping at its exterior. Inside of her, you flailed around as she clamped down on you and bucked. Mark very carefully used two fingers to pry her open, and inserted his tongue. He probed deeper and deeper, sending her off into ecstatic waves as he searched for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw two fingers pry open the entrance just a few relative feet away from you. For a moment you whooped, Mark was coming to save you! Then a fleshy pink monster invaded the cave. You gawked for a second as it plunged in your direction, unable to make sense of what was happening, and then it rasped along the bottom of your foot and you panicked and took off the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark had a brief second of near triumph as he felt that contact, and plunged his muzzle deeper into his wife. She moaned even louder and writhed around him as he snaked his tongue deeper and deeper into her, searching for you. He was really getting into it, and you were trying your hardest to avoid him. It was really difficult to climb further up into his wife since the path was slicked with a combination of her own juices and Mark's cum from just minutes before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls around you contracted as Mark's wife wrapped her legs around his head and clamped down. She gasped and came, and you were pummeled by the contracting walls. Mark's tongue finally managed to get a purchase on you, and he pulled you into his mouth along with most of the cum that he had left behind before. His wife finished, and he pulled his head away from her and tried to catch his breath. You bounced around inside his mouth along with his recent load, and he grimaced. He pinned you against the roof of his mouth with his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wife was sprawling bonelessly across the bed. He rolled out of bed, enjoying work well done. His wife asked him softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does this mean you're ready for your own round two then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked downward and found himself hard again. He began to respond before realizing that he had a mouthful. He thought for a moment...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Keane was absolutely terrified in your current situation. He was being pressed against the roof of this huge muscular looking wolf. He was horrified the find that either he was so small, or that Mark was so big that he could luckily just about grab onto his taste buds as humiliating as it was. Another good thing is that he was no longer swimming in a mixture of Mark and his wife's cum, as it was slowly dripping out from on the tongue to below it. However he was still coated in the white viscous liquid and couldn't see within a few feet in front of himself! Although his current situation was awful, it was about to get much worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was in a sticky situation. He needed to swallow this cum without swallowing Keane otherwise his wife would get suspicious and he'd be playing 20 questions with her. Pressing his tongue firmly against the roof of his mouth he swallowed. And right after he frantically moved his tongue to check if Keane was still there, feeling a small bump he relaxed however then he remembered that his wife was waiting he momentarily forgot about Keane and blurted out the first thing that came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the real question is, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally cursing himself for accepting the offer but realizing he couldn't back out now, he walked towards his waiting wife and began to lie down with her. Tugging on his still hardening cock, he turned his muscular body towards her, any current thoughts left him and he and his wife descended into primitive instincts as they began fucking furiously. Both Wolves were moaning and panting almost drooling on each other! However Mark had forgotten all about his \"passenger\" stuck in his mouth during this ordeal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane was in one moment gripping onto tongue buds and although it was horrible he was at least away from the crevice of Mark's throat. He screamed as suddenly everything went to hell and muscles all around him were violently shaking and he could see Mark's throat open up and he watched as all the cum was violently shook then forced down the throat. Shuddering, he could see this happening to him if he wasn't careful but as he said that the tongue he was on began violently shaking and moving. He screamed again, going unheard by the huge wolf he was inside as he gripped onto the taste buds even harder. The tongue suddenly pressed him hard against the roof of the mouth the relaxed a little moving down back into a comfortable position. Wait, wasn't Mark supposed to keep Keane safe by keeping him pressed against the mouth roof? He was about to began pounding on the muscle he was gripping onto, when the tongue he was on began frantically moving and his eardrums nearly burst as an extremely loud noise, too loud for Keane to make out came from the tunnel behind him. Had Mark forgotten about him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings suddenly began looking up though as the cum that coated him was being washed away! Mark released the tongue and began wiping off the cum. Wait, how was the cum being washed away? Finally Keane's string of luck was cut as he unknowingly had gripped onto the savory taste buds of Mark. Even unknown to Mark, his body tasted the small morsel of meat inside its mouth and prepared the necessary jobs for digestion, one of which was producing saliva. Keane, finally being able to see with the cum washed off him could now see his surroundings in full and shuddered as he saw the massive fangs of Mark, and all his other dangerously sharp teeth, moving as saliva was dripping down the inside of Mark's mouth. Gripping onto Mark instinctively as he felt sudden movement, he buried his head into the soaking tongue as the movement was very violent and looked out of Mark's maw to see Mark's naked wife beside him. Looking away as it felt indecent he hoped that Mark wasn't about to do what he thought he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever his unlucky streak continued as Keane felt Mark lie down on top of his wife. Turning back he could see Mark's wife and as Mark's head began moving Keane moved forward to get a closer look when he jumped back foolishly as the mouth shut almost impaling his head on one of Mark's canine fangs! However his sudden movement sent him tumbling down the unfortunately sloped tongue and he couldn't get a grip on any part of Mark's tongue due to the saliva coating it making it slippery. As he rolled closer and closer to the open tunnel almost right behind him, fate threw him a bone and Mark turned his head downwards causing gravity to suddenly change for Keane as he was now sent flying towards the canine's closed fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding painfully on the rock hard fang of Mark, Keane rolled down it due to the slope of the fang and was sent right beneath Mark's set of teeth underneath the tongue but just out of reach of its normal state. Possibly in the safest place he could be inside of a wolf's mouth, Mark lay exhausted ignoring the pooling saliva that collected beneath him, some absorbed into the gum of Mark. Too tired to focus, a foolish mistake when stuck in the mouth of an unaware wolf, he was woken up suddenly as the wolf subconsciously swallowed the saliva that built up. Keane would have been sent flying to the throat with the amount of movement the spasms of the muscles around him made, but he was caught on the frenulum of the tongue and managed to just about hold onto the underside of the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever sadly for Keane holding onto the tongue had horrible consequences when Mark with nothing to stop him opening his mouth now, began moaning with pleasure making his tongue move violently to produce the noise. For Keane, he could hear nothing but Mark's moans and foolishly let go of the tongue to cover his ears. With nothing holding him down the movement of the tongue sent him flying about, luckily not down the throat, in the mouth of this canine. Although Mark didn't feel the small thing inside his mouth, his subconscious did and began toying with the small thing subconsciously, sucking on it, sticking it out a little then pulling it back and generally a lot of weird things like keeping him pinned to the gum with suction only to release him. For Keane it was utter hell, and eventually Keane was toyed with for the last time as the giant turned all attention to pulling himself out of his wife leaving Keane to be sent flying near the mouth entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was exhausted after the sex, and glancing at his clock and seeing he still had an hour till he needed to be up lay back down on his bed, forgetting about his passenger. Keane could hear nothing but Mark's snores and opening his eyes could see he was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He briefly remembered being thrown out of Mark's mouth after the canine reached climax and let out a roar opening his gaping maw in the process. The surface he was on was rising and falling so Keane assumed he had landed on the chest of this wolf. Lying down to check he heard a loud heartbeat, and combined with the soft fur of Mark, the steady rise and fall of the canine's breathing and finally the warmth radiating from the wolf had a hyponotising effect on Keane, and he suddenly felt very drowsy. Forcing himself to rise however, Keane walked across the furry chest, tripping once or twice when he misjudged the rhythm of the breathing and eventually he noticed a huge rising fleshy thing, fur only covered it a little and Keane realised that whatever it was he could get a good vantage point of it and began the hard climb for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Keane was a little more awake, he might have used logic and combined the fact that these wolves shared one thing in common with humans and it was body structure. Sure a few things were different like sheaths, ears and fur but they had a surprisingly similar structure in this universe. If he was on the canine's chest, then a large rise in the middle of nowhere, after climbing a steeper part of the  chest, could only be one thing, a nipple. His poor attempts at climbing the nipple only made it harder however this went unnoticed to the drowsy mite and he failed to notice the arousement that he was providing the wolf. Eventually he managed to climb the \"strange bump\" and what went from getting a view was forgotten and all he could think of was sleep from the hypnotic effect Mark had on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Keane fell asleep atop the hard nipple of Mark, he had dreams which at first were normal, but then descended into sexual as he recalled his previous encounters with Mark. His mouth, his sheath, Mark seemed to be able to make Keane face death unknowingly and enslave him without meaning to. All this dirty dreams had an effect on Keane and he began dry humping Mark's nipple subconsciously gripping onto the fleshy and furry nipple with a hard grip. All this motion began making Mark's nipple harden again, only making Keane slam into it harder. As a side effect this also stimulated the wolf's cock, and it began rising up. Not even Mark could sleep through this and after about 30 minutes of his cock getting harder and harder he woke up sleepy feeling the erection. His hands were above him so he clumsily brushed them against his chest moving towards his destination, his furry package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane woke shortly after Mark did. He had become almost reliant on Mark, and his mind now relied upon this deity-like canine and timed itself to fit this canine's body clock. Still very drowsy he tried to go back to sleep but his grumbles were interupted by the wolf moving himself and it went from one moment on a wolf's hard nipple to being brushed along by a furry part of a wolf. Keane had no idea where he was going and was too scared to look. However the smell alerted him before his sight did, he had experienced this smell only once and it was quite recently. The musky smell of a muscled father wolf who was erect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the soft patch of fur he had felt before and he found himself pressed against the sheath of this wolf and forced inside by an unaware Mark and to make things worse, a furry hand came up against the opening of the sheath. He felt movements all around him as the gigantic muscle he was in contracted more and more. He felt movement behind him and turned to see a slowly moving cock edging towards him desperate to escape its prison in the sheath. Keane backed up till he was against the hand covering the sheath and desperatly banged against it, to no effect obviously. In his desperation Keane tried other things, yanking on the fur, pressing against the hand and finally pushing against the cock to no avail and eventually he felt the cock press against him, hungry almost. The hand felt the cock finally escape its prison and released the hand blocking it allowing it outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane hadn't stuck to the hand though and was just on the base of the cock, too scared to move. If Mark began wanking now he would surely be crushed against the hand of Mark! As the hand slowly began approaching Keane, he frantically kicked and tried to pull himself off, but the cock had found a morsel and wouldn't release it. Just as the hand wrapped around the cock, the alarm went off pulling Mark into reality. He stepped out of bed and began getting dressed for work, starting with his boxers. He opened the drawer while throwing yesterday's loose boxers into the laundry pile. Deciding on a pair of tight, black briefs, he stepped into the leg holes and quickly pulled them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane had fallen off Mark's slit as the wolf rose out of bed. He landed on the ballsack of the wolf and lost his grip before ending up gripping for life underneath the wolf's gigantic ballsack. His grip finally faltered when the wolf rose his legs up high for reasons unknown to Keane. He released as the wolf did this to his other leg, he wouldn't survive a fall like this and resigned himself to his fate. However luck finally arrived in the form of sexy, black, tight briefs as he was caught in it and rolled to the \"basket\" area. Although this saved him it also introduced him to the massive form of Mark's two testicles, something less lucky. Mark was becoming less of a wolf or friend to Keane, but more of a god who decided his life and conditions. Mark moved his legs again and Keane's surrondings became pitch black as trousers were put on. Realizing he could be here for a while, Keane slumped into a lying down position preparing to endure the conditions slowly rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark quickly rushed downstairs and poured cereal for himself and devoured it before rushing outside to catch a bus into the city, his workplace. However it was on the public transport that he remembered the tiny teenager Keane and the last place he was, in his mouth. Shocked momentairly he stopped moving for a second and raised his tongue to the roof of his mouth, turning away from other wolves, searching his mouth for any signs of Keane he knew heavily that chances are he was swallowed while he had slept or this morning's breakfast. Feeling a pang of guilt he brushed it aside knowing that although he was dead he was just a human, he wouldn't be missed and having a simple human affect a wolf was simply stupid. Forgetting all about Keane he focused on his job right up ahead in the...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Keane was currently underneath the furry testicles of his canine god, they were like a blanket ushering him to sleep. He probably would have fallen asleep too, but the tight briefs his titan decided to wear had him pressed uncomfortably against the gigantic testicles of the canine. He could hear the body workings of the two balls, and it made a slight sloshing noise as the titan walked, only audible to creatures of his size. The canine's heartbeat, faster than a human's, was annoyingly loud though and any chance of sleep was prevented by these two sex machines. Mark had truly transformed in Keane's eyes now, no longer was he a friend, slave or a captor, he was a god now, and any small things he did, or even felt could possibly kill Keane or at least change his life. In fact, as Keane though this, as if to provide an example a female wolf sat the other row of Mark, and they only exchanged glances for a second and then promptly focused on more important things with no attraction between the two. However Mark's body detected this and began upping the sperm production. This small unimportant thing for Mark was having a rather large effect on Keane, now stuck underneath even louder and hotter testicles that began to sweat from the humidity of Mark's briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane was now struggling with the threat of drowning! The sweat kept pooling underneath him and his face was already being forced into the puddle, to survive he'd have to drink up. Crying softly to himself, he began lapping up the salty ball sweat, choking once or twice but overall making enough progress to survive for now, though he'd have to keep doing it. This was actually the first time he had a drink since he was transported to this universe so at least his body welcomed it. However after the first few glugs, his body detecting the salt spat it out and would accept no more. Getting scared now Keane began struggling, trying to escape the ballsack of his canine god and was about to give up when the water reached up to his back when the water acting as a lubricant let him slide a little underneath the heavy testicles and make an escape from the death trap part of the briefs he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding from underneath the balls he was now in the canyon with half being against the testicles and the other against the tight briefs. The water had been condensed off him now from the heat inside the briefs, and he had only gotten halfway through the canyon. He desperately struggled trying to get out, but had no hope. In horror realizing he'd have to go back he sighed and made to crawl back but in total shock realized he couldn't move back either. Panicking now, he realized he was stuck in this deadly position which could get him cut in two he in desperation began banging on the huge furry balls, but unknown to him all he was doing was attracting the sperm towards his position, heating up his spot even more. The temperature around him was rising above his healthy body heat. Close to passing out he went limp, but before he could pass out, his position began shaking violently and with horror he realized the canine god was moving now and he'd probably get cut in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever luck was on his side, and instead of giving him a death sentence, the movement was pushing him up! Gasping with the new found air, Keane desperately began scaling the ballsack, made easier by the hairs  which were the size of him! However the god began moving even more, and Keane grabbed onto a patch of fur to steady himself and began making a slow descent.  He reached the sheath after what seemed like hours and began climbing it. Ignoring the huge musky smell released from the sheath he grabbed the top of the sheath and began slowly lifting himself up. However to his dismay he couldn't make the distance, he'd need a stepping stone and the only one available was a sleeping monster of an organ requiring stimulation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane began touching the insides of the sheath, trying to wake it that way, with no effect however he knew he'd have to do something more drastic. Taking a deep breath, he walked inside of the sheath, spending a minute walking through the dark musky sheath, he finally found, or rather bumped into, his target. The flaccid wolf cock. Putting his hands onto the sensitive tip, he began rubbing. This provided a small effect, but only the smell and humidity rising, the cock barely moved. Desperate times called for desperate actions, and Keane jumped onto the slit and began grabbing it and massaging it, he even put his hands inside the slit and poking the insides. This provided the desired effect, and Keane was suddenly soaked with precum as the massive cock stirred and began moving towards him. Beginning to back off to get ready to climb the cock, Keane screamed as his hands were stuck inside the slit, trying to pull out only stimulated the cock further, Keane was dragged underneath the slit  and was pushed forward, what seemed like hours was actually 3 minutes, and he was finally in open air! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped from the slit, and shuddered as he climbed on top of the erect cock. Jumping quickly he quickly reached something he wasn't prepared for. The jungle of pubic hair, even worse as wolves had fur rather than hair. However he didn't have time and he ran into the forest. He was 4 seconds in the forest of pubic hair when his world was shaking suddenly. He was thrown back but instead of falling into the package, he was caught in the pubic fur, and trying to move only tangled him further. Looking up he saw the divine face of Mark looking confused but also rather pleased, Keane then realized that of course the canine had felt his efforts and came to investigate. The canine suddenly put his paw into the briefs, and pulled out his erect cock. Prodding it for a few seconds he suddenly looked up and quickly stuffed it back in his briefs and darkness set again. Trying to move Keane realized he was truly stuck and couldn't even turn his head due to fur being tangled everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was confused but also pleased. While walking to the construction site, his cock suddenly felt really good, like REALLY good and he continued to walk for a few minutes till it became too much, he'd have to check this out! Turning to his crew he said he'd be in the bathroom for a few seconds and he quickly ducked into a stall and opened his briefs. Shocked by the state of his cock, he prodded it, ready to began masturbating when a knock on the door startled him and he stuffed his erect cock back in and did up his trousers. Leaving the cock for later, he stood up. He needed to work on the...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This would be a hard and lengthy job. A rich wolf wanted their mansion to be extended, and it would require weeks of work. Luckily Mark had brought along a lot of wolf workers to help, and they were strong men all muscular and there were a few bigger wolves! He had by now left the bathroom and was walking along with his workers towards the construction site and grabbing all their tools from the back of the truck they finished their journey on foot reaching the construction site. Mark now  went into autopilot, having done this sort of work a lot and blocked anything else from his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane was still tangled in the pubic fur of the canine, with no hope of untangling himself. He realized the only way out of here would be alerting Mark to his position, though that could be a little awkward. He hoped Mark was still friendly to him and wouldn't just eat him on sight due to the time they had spent away. However one small problem was that he couldn't actually move any of his arms or legs so he had no idea how to get Mark's attention. The only thing he could do was struggle in the pubic fur, and that didn't seem to help. However seeing as it was the only thing he could actually do, Keane continued to struggle with no affect. All he could do was hope Mark did something to untangle him, or combed through his pubic fur, though that seemed unlikely. Keane was going to die a slow death at this point and his body would be stuck to the fur of this canine god until it was washed away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Mark suddenly began moving for Keane, and he guessed Mark had began walking. He was slowly rocked back and forth as Mark continued on a simple walk, leaving Keane to swing like a rope above the canine's package. This went on for a few minutes, with Keane being smacked between the tight briefs and his god's furry groin until eventually Mark stopped leaving Keane to smack against the canine's groin for a final time then go back to being held between these two planets by long thick pubic fur. Noises around Keane began, and he could hear banging and a drill noise. It seemed Mark was a builder, and a louder noise started as something right next to the canine began making a drilling noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he lurched forwards as he was pressed against something, and he felt himself suddenly vibrating and he was thrown up and down still held firmly by the pubic fur. It was like a roller-coaster ride and he felt sick. After this continued for a few seconds he began vomiting, though since he hadn't eaten it was more dry retching. It was then that Keane realized how hungry he was, and he needed something to eat pretty soon. The vibrations had kept him bouncing against the canine's groin, and Keane noticed dead skin in patches around the canine's groin. You could eat a wolf right? So could you eat its skin? Keane had no idea, but was too hungry to play it safe, and when the vibration next slammed him against the groin he grabbed a piece of the dead skin in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was then thrown against the briefs again and to his delight the skin had come off easily enough. Ravenously stuffing it in his mouth he bit in to find although it tasted a little off, it could work as food for now. Suddenly a musky smell became strong and he looked around confused before looking down to see the canine's sheath to be a little erect, he tried to ignore it and kept tearing at more dead skin but on his 4 time the vibrations that let him get the dead skin suddenly stopped and he felt the movement of the canine telling him that he was walking somewhere again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark got out the drill, he needed to get foundations done. The drill was always his favorite tool as he liked to press his crotch against it as the vibrations made him a little erect. He pressed his crotch against it and turned it on. He felt himself slowly get erect and he didn't try to stop it at all, he felt a slight scratching at his groin, but ignored it and continued to hump the drill. Slowly humping it, as to not catch the attention of his coworkers he felt himself get half erect. He had told himself he'd check out his cock later, and he could always take a shower, he didn't have the time when he was at home after all. After musing over it he decided to go through with it, and he laid the drill against the ground and began striding towards the showers nearby. They always had showers set up on big tasks and this was no exception. This was a huge job as well with well over 100 wolves, the mansion was huge after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the showers he sat on one of the benches and began undressing. The morning was often busy in the showers, and today was the same. Strong, burly wolves were striding around naked, either wet or soon to be. Unlike humans, wolves were much less embarrassed about each others bodies, and what seemed quite intimate to humans was normal to them and they had no trouble being stark naked next to each other, and would even let total strangers help dry them if they needed help. Mark chose one of the less packed benches and began by taking off his work top. He hadn't bothered to put a vest on as today was hot and he found himself top naked. He moved onto his boots next and took them off, finding them already sweaty he turned them over to dry out. Turning to chat to a wolf next to him, he multi-tasked and removed his trousers while at it, and then moved on to his tight briefs. Hooking his thumbs into his briefs he removed them and then found himself all naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing his conversation with the wolf he turned and walked into the public showers. He luckily managed to exchange a shower with his friend that had just finished, and giving his friend a bro hug he then stepped into the shower that was left running and began washing. He lathered himself up with soap, making sure to catch every area of his body, then unhooked the shower head from it's hook and began washing off any soap that stuck to his fur. Getting them shampoo out, he squirted it into his hands and began rubbing it through his hair getting it all saturated. He then washed it off and began finishing off his shower he turned around to find the well known wolf called Roman. The reason Roman was well known is because he was the biggest, strongest and most muscular wolf in Mark's construction company, and often got the most work done. He was extremely intimating and Mark quickly ducked out of the shower and left it to Roman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane was still being thrown against the groin and briefs again until he stopped abruptly and was slammed into the fabric. The canine had stopped somewhere and Keane could hear movement above him. Suddenly he was thrown into the air as the canine's leg lifted into the air. He came down again but this movement repeated a second time. Suddenly hearing chattering that was loud enough to cause hearing problems, Keane attempted to clutch his ears but his shoulders were still tightly attached even if he managed to get his arms untangled. The conversation was too loud for Keane to hear so he was forced to listen to loud booms before suddenly, his surroundings lit somewhat. Not fully, he still couldn't see past the fabric, but he could observe the pubic fur he was tangled in. He found himself quite lucky! He was in a relatively dry spot, and he could see greasy patches around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he was suddenly blinded and the tight briefs were suddenly off. It took a few seconds for his eyes to adjust, but what he saw made him jump a little, he saw another wolf gazing at him! It wasn't Mark however, it was some random canine, and Keane guessed this was the one that Mark was chatting to. The other canine was naked himself, and Mark found it a little weird that wolves would just chat to each other while naked, but guessed this was wolf society normal. He saw he was in some sort of changing room, but had no idea why his canine would simply strip to the ground. You usually only did this when you wanted to wash...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane realized with horror that Mark washing himself could very easily get himself killed! He began struggling with renewed energy, but Mark didn't feel it, and even the wolf admiring Mark's crotch didn't see the tiny speck struggling against the pubic fur. Suddenly Mark began moving and Keane was thrown about a little, but could see himself slowly move towards his death warrant. Suddenly with a bang of a door he found himself in a public shower filled with naked wolves of all sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane saw naked wolves rubbing themselves with water before his sights were forced upon a naked wolf in front of him, motioning his hands towards a running shower. Suddenly the two canines came together, and Keane was pressed against this new wolf's sheath and pubic hair being rubbed against it a little as the two wolves above him conversed. Keane desperately tried to grab onto the other wolf's sheath trying to escape his approaching death warrant but couldn't get the grip and screamed as the other wolf walked off. Suddenly water was being thrown against him and he coughed as some went into his mouth. He had no idea what Mark was doing but minutes later his face was rubbed against soap and he screamed as it was rubbed against him but only got a mouthful of lather in return. However the soapy water was the final thing he needed and he felt himself be released from the pubic hair and found himself falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing he could possibly fall onto was the soap, and Keane screamed as he landed on the soap and quickly was pressed into the mold of the soap. Luckily Mark was only finishing off, and he wasn't rubbing it against himself anymore. Keane felt himself placed onto the soap hold and sighed in relief managing to escape his death for now. However if Mark left without him then he was as good as dead. With a lurch he was picked up again, and felt a surge of hope that Mark might have found him, but his hopes were quickly shattered as he was given to a new wolf...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing this prompted the heavily muscled wolf to let out a heavy sigh. Sure he knew that with his height and huge muscles that he looked pretty intimating. Which was noth good was because barely anyone tried to pick a fight with him or mess with him in any way. On the other hand though it though the giant wolf feeling quite lonely as not that many people talked him for a long period of time. \"<i>You know it'd be nice if I could find someone who really needed someone like me around. Someone who needing protecting. Someone who I could maybe become friends with....or something more.</i>\" Roman thought to himself, as he picked up the bare of soap after he had made sure the water was at the right temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue eyed wolf then bent downward a bit to get a beter look at the bare of soap. Just so he knew how of it was had to work with when it came to washing his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane continued to stare up at new giant wolf that was holding onto the soap that was in the palm of one of his massives hands. The human could tell that this wolf was very more muscular then Mark was. In fact if he didn't know better Keane was certain that this was wolf maybe about ten years younger then him too. \"Well, he seems pretty scary looking. But maybe if I can get his attention, maybe he'll be willing to give me back to Mark. Although maybe it'd be better just to stay with him since Mark most likely thinks I'm dead.\" The tiny human then waved his arms up and down while he added in a loud voice, \"Hey, down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had siad this though the small human saw the massive wolf bend downward a bit.

And he was in for another ordeal as the bar of soap was lowered at breakneck speeds. Keane grimaced as he felt himself going even faster than falling. It felt as if he was on the fastest roller coaster in existence. Only to stop so suddenly he felt as if he'd be ripped out from the bar of soap. Dizzy, the small human didn't notice the huge paw pad he was being raised toward until it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to even scream in time, Keane's face was smooshed against the gigantic paw. The coarse skin did nothing for his comfort, and he was pushed even deeper into the bar of soap as Ronan lathered up his paws. Dirt and sweat gradually came off, though thankfully the bubbles created helped shield Keane from experiencing it at all. But as soon as that ordeal was over, it was time for Ronan to clean his other foot paw. The bar of soap traveled the vast distance to his other paw, and Keane was forced to relive the experience all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it was time for Ronan to clean his legs. This was a terrible experience in its own way. Keane was rubbed against gigantic strands of fur, rubbed into the somewhat soft pelt of the wolf. However, this lasted much longer, and the up and down motion kept him sick and dizzy the entire time. Disoriented by all means, he barely noticed when his soapy prison moved upward yet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane caught sight of Ronan's hairy navel as he rushed past, and realized he was working on his torso now. The large bumps and ridges he traveled over brought him to the conclusion that this particular wolf was, well, ripped. He had a personal tour of every gigantic abdominal muscle, and could practically feel the rippling power beneath them with every pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, his scenery changed again. He was rubbed into Ronan's pecs, Keane getting very aquainted with the muscles. At one point, he was even rubbed directly over one nipple, the soft flesh a welcome, if not awkward, reprieve from the previous areas. He was briefly reminded of the moment when he began to hump Mark's nipple that morning, and blood rushed into his penis from the memory despite the obvious danger he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms were next. They were much like Ronan's legs, long and sickening. His only reprieve was when Ronan switched hands to lather up his other arm and Keane was flipped over to view Ronan's paw. However, that didn't last long, as the wolf preferred the first hand and switched back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Keane was up to visit the best part for last. His sheath. Keane began to struggle even more vehemently as he saw that fleshy opening approach. He had spent more than enough time for a lifetime surrounded by wolf crotch. He would not be doing so again. However, as the soap had been very worn down by Ronan's washing, Keane found that it was much easier to escape. But far too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonan's first pass over his crotch was the last push needed. Keane detached with a cry of victory, but then began to freak out when he realized he'd been deposited right over Ronan's sheath. With little in the way of balancing himself, especially as slippery as he was, he fell inside the dark and warm chamber, eventually falling onto Ronan's vast penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonan finally washed off all of the soap and began to dry off, none the wiser of his little bath companion.</span></div></div>",

He mumbles something about humans and their wild ideas, and then delicately stick out his long tongue and places you on it. He slowly draws both you, and his tongue back into his mouth. After second has past the teeth come together, and you are in a pitch dark moist cave, with his tongue moving all over your body, tasting you, and for a moment you are afraid he's going to eat you anyway, but after a moment it stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" he asks, a bit loudly and oddly to your ears, but considering your in his mouth, blocking his tongue, it isn't that surprising. You shout something to the affirmative, grabbing hold of one of the teeth after the tongue pushes you up against the huge white spire. It becomes difficult to hang on to the tooth, as saliva fills the wolf dad's mouth in reaction to the meaty little treat, A.K.A. you, but with a little help from his tongue you are able to keep from sliding down that long tunnel behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark gets back to the picnic to find his wife and kids are all busy enjoying the last of the sandwiches, a fact he envies them for. He decided it best not to reveal your presence though, and sits down shaking his head when his wife offers him one of the last two. The wife looks a little hurt, but eases her pain by downing the two sandwiches in a single gulp, which makes you shake to you core as you see that lump, bigger than you are slide down her throat through the teeth of her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to herself she tells the children to clean up, and takes the hand of Mark. Together the two walk from camp, and you can't help but feel apprehension. You had expected him to spit you out, revealing you to his family, but obviously he decided it was safer to hide you. That could mean many things, most of which were pretty bad, and you tried to focus on holding on to the tooth, a fact that was much easier because Mark's mouth was drying out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, are you ok?\" asks his wife, and he sort of mumbles a reply around you saying he was. His wife of course knows something is up at this point, but staring at the horizon she ignores it. She then lowers herself into a reclining position on the grass to stare straight up, and without thinking Mark joins her. Your whole world flips as Mark leans backwards and your grip on the tooth begins to slip, below you the throat opens up in expectation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark, you're acting very odd. You've never turned down one of my sandwiches before. Tell me what it is that's bothering you?\" she asked again, and with you out of the way of his tongue Mark is able to reply in a mostly clear voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing honey, I just think I shoved too much in my mouth at once,\" he said. Your eardrums nearly explode, and it takes a force of will to keep you hands from trying to cover them, thus dropping you into his throat. His wife looks at him with an puzzled expression, but he smiles at her innocently. Just as innocently she pokes him in the chest, causing him to breath out everything in his lungs, and swallow his mouthful involuntarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!!\" you scream as muscles contract all around you. You try to hold on to the tooth, but the mouth is full of saliva again, and it carries you along with it down Mark's throat. It takes only a moment of pressure to drop you into an odd enclosure full of foul smelling water. With a start you realize that its not water, but digestive juices. Mark swallowed you whole, and your in his stomach along with what looks like the remains of a few sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Cathleen asks, having thought she heard a faint, high pitched cry as her husband had swallowed the spit in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing dear,\" said Mark imagining the poor human in his gut, feeling his tiny fist pounding on the stomach walls. Mark shrugged as Cathleen walked away, and then lay back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry human, but that's a one way trip,\" he whispers, and you hear it like the death toll of a bell. All around you the sandwiches are being smashed into mushy lumps, and soon you join them. Mark feels sorry for you, but you are only a human.</span></div></div>",

As he closed his eyes bracing himself for the imminent fall towards the ground, he soon found himself descending within an odd liquidy surface. While the odd substance surrounding him was certainly thick, he quickly tried to clamber his way at what her thought was the surface. Once he managed to reach the surface, he quickly gave a long gasp of air as he scanned upon his odd surrounding. It seemed as though he was within some sort of sea of odd white mushy substance, but after giving the odd content a quick smell, his eyes widen in shear horror as he soon realized that he was within one of the families portion of food, a bowl of potato salad to be precise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the quickest of haste, he tried his best to make it towards the supposed rim of the bowl, however his supposed attempts at escape were soon thwarted as a portion of the salad, along with him, was soon swept up upon a massive spoon. Slowly both he and the delicacy was raised upwards, and surprisingly heading straight towards the massive teenage wolfess from earlier. With a twist of the wrist, she dropped the pile of salad along with Keane on top of her paper plate. Soon Keane was raised upwards, along with the plate, where he got a better glance upon the family of wolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eyuck! Potato salad's nasty!\" The young wolf boy states while cringing and sticking his tongue out in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how can you be so sure about it when you never gave it a try?\" The mother replied while looking upon her son with a raised brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never have, never will.\" The young wolf answers in a stern tone while shaking his head and crossing his arms together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, you don't know what you're missing.\" The Wolfess from above replies as she soon dug her spoon within the salad. Of all the luck that Keane had, he found himself, along with some portion of potato salad swept up upon the Wolfess's spoon. As he desperately tried to escape from the thick muck that was the potato salad stuck to his body, he soon turned his head to see the massive maw of the wolfess open wide before him. The sight of her large sharp teeth was enough to freeze him momentarily, as he stared helplessly within the wet cavern that was her mouth. Within moments, she soon stuffed the food within her mouth and clamped her jaws close, trapping Keane inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin The Wolfess's mouth, Keane found himself tumbling upon the massive slimy muscle that was her tongue. As he tried his best to maintain a good balance upon the soft wet surface, he soon found himself, along with the clumps of potato salad, to be moved about the inside of the organic cave. As he was jostled and pushed about by the movement of her tongue, occasionally towards the roof of her mouth, Keane tried his best to avoid getting into contact with the rows of sharp teeth about the sides. At times he met close calls with getting crushed by the solid sharp fangs as they chewed up the potato salad, but luckily he managed to stay within the area of her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dizzying experience of being tossed about, his short moment of peace was soon interrupted as the contents of her mouth slowly began to descend backwards towards her throat. In terror, Keane tried his best to grab a hold of the surface of the wolfess's tongue, yet the saliva coated surface seemed nearly impossible to hold on to. Horrified, Keane began to slowly slip towards the fleshy entrance of her throat, all while trying his best to futilely try and cling on to the huge muscle. With a small pool of Saliva, and a small pile of potato salad, Keane soon ended up falling along with the contents straight down the wolfess's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Keane was getting sent downwards, he tried one last attempt at grabbing the uvula of the massive canine in hopes of escaping. But with a quick suck from the fleshy tunnel that was her throat, he was soon pulled downwards. Outside, the massive wolfess was murring in shear pleasure by the odd yet satisfying taste she experienced. While she did have potato salad before, it seemed that todays portion was truly special compared to the others. Inside, Keane desperately tried to halt his movements by attempting to hold his ground within her throat. Though the slippery surface and pulsating movement of her throat insured that his try at escape was thwarted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too long until he finally descended upon her throat and was sent straight through the fleshy ringed sphincter that was the entrance to her stomach. With a Splash, he soon ended up falling within the massive belly of the wolfess. Quickly, he swam his way up to the surface of the mucky liquid and searched for something to quickly clamber on. As his eyes looked within the fleshy chamber, he found many portions of food floating about the disgusting liquid, though what looked like a piece of bread immediately garnered his attention. With great speed, he swam his way through the tingling liquid and quickly clambered upon the piece of bread, using it as a sort of raft replacement. As he was sitting upon the portion of bread, he looked about at the pink moving walls with shear uncertainty. Just how was he going to get out? Would he end up getting digested within this massive wolfess?</span></div></div>",

Just then an idea popped into his head. Maybe he could make his presence known by touching the walls of her stomach. As crazy as the idea sounded, it surely did sound like a better alternative compared to waiting to end up being digested. As the rhythmic sounds of her heart beating overhead sounded off along the slimy organic room, he hoped that the movement he produced would be enough to gain her attention. Once he was within close range, he quickly yet reluctantly stretched out his arms in order to make contact with the soft surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands were soon placed upon the soft slimy wall, producing a low squelching sound against the mound of flesh. With little hesitation, he began rubbing, pounding, trying any kind of forceful move against the stomach wall in hopes that the massive wolfess would be aware of his location. After a couple moments of pushing against the surface, the whole stomach began to shake slightly signaling that he might have gotten her attention. Outside, the Wolfess's eyes widened by the odd sensation emerging from within her belly. It almost felt as if something inside her was pushing against the walls of her stomach. As she placed her hand upon her abdomen, she originally thought that it was nothing more than the food sloshing about. However after she felt the odd movements emerging from time to time, she began to take notice of the oddity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll be right back.\" She says as she soon stood upwards to head to the nearest outdoor restroom. As she began walking, she looked down at her stomach with a curious yet confused expression on her face. 'just what's going on in there?' she thought to herself, before entering one of the stalls. Experimentally she gave her stomach a small poke with her finger, but to her utter shock she soon ended up feeling something inside her pushing against the walls of her stomach as if reacting. \"Oh my Gosh!\" She quickly exclaims in utter disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of the stomach, not everything was easy for Keane. It certainly did seem like she was up and moving simply by how much everything began to move and slosh about around him. Within moments he soon looked about in pure shock as the walls began to violently move about him. \"w-wha!?\" he stammers as the stomach gurgled and moved about rapidly, causing him to lose balance from atop the bread, sending him straight into her digestive juices. As soon as he was within the mucky liquids, he began to see the walls of flesh begin to close in around him. Was this truly how his life was end? Desperately he tried his best to reach the surface of the juices, only to end up being sent all about by the movements of the organ. Fearing that this was his end, he braced for what was to come, however what happened next came as a complete surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was expecting to slowly dissolve within the tingling liquids of the stomach, he soon found his body beginning to get sucked within a fleshy sphincter. As he was being pulled up, he soon recognized the familiar location as the throat of the wolfess. Within moments he soon rose fully up her throat, along with some of the contents of her stomach and sent straight towards a bright light. Before even having a chance of getting his bearings, Keane soon found himself fall within a body of water, long with some bile and remnants of what was supposedly lunch. As he surfaced upon the body of water with a gasp, he soon found himself staring upwards at the massive wolfess from earlier who was catching her breath. Her golden eyes looked upon his small form in utter shock, as he returned a similar gaze. It seemed as though the massive wolfess must've regurgitated Keane in order to release him from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Keane floated in the water he looked upon the wolfess nervously, unsure just how she would react to his presence.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't until the massive Wolfess spoke that the silence was ultimately broken. \"w-w-what are you?\" She stammers in a soft yet concerned tone. \"Wha...what were you doing inside of my stomach!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane looks up at her while floating amidst the contents of her stomach, and began to explain everything that occurred from the start of his odd adventure. \"And after rubbing the walls inside your stomach, well...you threw me up in here.\" he finishes. The Wolfess lets out a gasp of pure surprise upon hearing the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! I'm so sorry I didn't recognize you!\" She quickly apologizes. \"Us wolves are known for our great sense of smell, but the potato salad must've covered your scent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's alright.\" Keane replies while trying to make his way to the porcelain side of the toilet bowl. \"could you please help me out of here?\" The Wolfess immediately acknowledges his request and gently lowers her hands towards the water. As soon as her furred fingers were right above Keane's location, she gingerly plucks the back of his shirt and raises him upwards from the bowl. Keane lets out a long sigh of relief as he soon began ascending from the toilet water. His body dripping a trail of drops from being completely soaked in the liquids. While he was filled with relief by the fact that he escaped from her stomach, he was even more relieved to find out that the gargantuan lupine meant no ill will towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the Wolfess freed him from within the bowl, she carefully sets him upon the palm of her free hand, while using the other to flush away the contents within the toilet. She then began to make her way towards one of the of sinks within the restroom, where she twisted on the water faucet. Keane watches as the great torrent of water fell within the bowl of the sink, before the Wolfess soon places her hand within the waterfall. \"w-well..it's a little bit warm.\" She admits while looking down at him. \"but it should be good enough to help you wash off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Keane turns his attention up at the great lupine, he gives her a nod in response. \"well, any water would do for washing this stuff off.\" he states while looking down upon his soaked clothing. With a small giggle, the Wolfess then began to move her other palm, along with Keane, underneath the rushing water. Once Keane was under the torrent, he took the liberty of trying his best to wash off all the parts of his body, as well as clothing, to get rid of any remaining content stuck on him. As he was washing up, he suddenly felt an odd feeling behind him. Something that felt oddly like liquid, yet was extremely light soon began to form behind him, along with the soft rubs of the Wolfess's supposed finger. As he turns to see just what the odd substance could be, he surprisingly found an array of bubbles forming from behind as the Wolfess carefully began to assist him by applying soap on his body. \"Thanks\" Keane replies while taking some small portion of soap upon his hand to use about his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments underneath the water, Keane was soon completely free of any remaining evidence of his small misadventure, or at least he hoped so. \"Thanks for helping me get washed off.\" Keane says to the massive canine as she began to turn off the running water. \"Don't mention it!\" she replies while giving him a large, albeit warm smile. \"Now, let's get you dried off.\" She then made her way towards the side of the sink to fetch out a few sheets of paper towels, before setting Keane down upon the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...do you mind if...well, I dry you?\" She asks while kneeling down to get a better vantage point of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think I could dry myself off.\" he admits with a blush growing on his face. \"but...if you'd like to, then feel free to.\" he offers. With a nod, the Wolfess then proceeds to dry him off using the paper towels she collected. While it certainly wasn't the most comfiest thing to get dried with, it seemed to be doing the trick for Keane. After using the last towel she possessed, The Wolfess then turns her head at the dispenser only to stare at it in surprise. \"Out of towels?\" she says under her breath while peeking underneath the contraption. Keane stood semi dry on top of the counter watching her search for any spare pieces of towel before she slowly began to make her way before him. \"well...the bathroom is out of paper towels.\" She states while giving a small defeated sigh. \"and...well...you're still kind of wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's alright!\" Keane quickly answers while waving his hands dismissively. \"I think I'm dried enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze continues to look down upon him, noticing that he was still slightly wet from his wash. \"well...if there's no paper towels to use here, I guess we'll just have to improvise.\" she states before gently lifting him upwards with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"h-hey, what are you?-\" Before Keane even had a chance to complete his question, he soon found himself being placed against the soft, warm fur of the Wolfess's body, right underneath her neck. A huge blush emerges on his face by the incredible sensation that her fur held. Not only was it soft to the touch, but the warmth being produced by her body made the experience all the more comfortable. In moments, Keane soon found his body being moved all about the soft fur, as she tries her best to dry him off. After a few moments of experiencing her incredible soft fur, she soon raises him upwards to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go! all nice and dry now.\" she chuckles while giving a big smile.</span></div></div>",

While it was common for stomachs to commonly make gurgle and churn like noises, this one seemed oddly loud compared to the smaller ones beaming about the corners. Terrified and filled with uncertainty, Keane floats about his makeshift raft as the pink slimy walls within the organic chamber moved in their irregular patterns. \u201cH-how am I going to get out of here?\u201d he mutters to himself, seeing as how the whole stomach seemed way too large, along with the upper section being too high up to reach. As he was busy glancing about trying to come up with some plan of escape, another loud gurgle fills his ears as he gazes about in confusion. For some odd reason, this gurgle seemed even louder then the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile outside, The wolfess was sitting contently upon the grassy ground, rubbing her now full belly. \u201cThat was a great meal mom.\u201d She compliments the older shewolf with a light smile. \u201cGlad you enjoyed it dear.\u201d The mother replies back while starting to seal up the food within their plastic containers. \u201cRight, with lunch now over, how about we start heading home?\u201d the older wolf asks as he soon rises up into a standing pose while giving a stretch as well. \u201cAwww, do we have to go now?\u201d the young wolf pup asks, still sitting with his ears drooping in a disappointed fashion. \u201cDon\u2019t worry dear.\u201d The mother assures her son while patting his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll do this again next weekend okay?\u201d she asks. \u201cYay!\u201d the boy beams happily before giving an ecstatic leap. With her family now up from the ground, the wolfess soon rises up as well, oblivious of the tiny human within her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the fleshy chamber, Keane\u2019s eyes widen as the whole area began to shift all about, throwing his sense of gravity out the window. \u201cW-what\u2019s going on!?\u201d he stammers before quickly kneeling down to grasp the bread as close as possible. It wasn\u2019t too long until he finally notices the movements slowly starting to calm a bit, until all of a sudden he soon finds himself bouncing up and down the juices in an almost rhythmic pattern. Judging by the movements, the wolf girl must\u2019ve been walking outside. Taken completely by surprise, Keane holds on for dear life as the bread raft began to slosh about the waves of acid.

It wasn't too long until the intensity of the stomach juices began to increase drastically, nearly sending him flying right off his makeshift raft. Luckily, Keane's fingers manage to firmly grip into the surface of the bread piece as it begins to float and follow the unpredictable path of the juices. \"I-Is this digestion!?\" Keane thinks to himself, thinking that this might be the eventual end of his life. This being his first time in a stomach since forever, he had no idea just how the organ would react, let alone how a wolf girls digestive system would relate to that of a normal human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the wolf girls abdomen manages to emanate a small groan from the commotion going on within her. Unaware of the plight occurring within her stomach, she simply dissuades the noise as nothing more than a natural process. After a couple minutes of walking, the four soon make their way to the family car as the girl casually clambers into the backseat. \"Everyone in?\" The father asks in a playful attitude as the young wolf boy smiles. \"Yup!\" He exclaims with an eager nod as the ignition soon brings the car to life. Now seated, the girl slowly takes out her phone and uses her clawed finger to check on her messages. \"Oooh! Molly's texting her boyfriend.\" the wolf boy shouts as his sister glares down at him in annoyance. \"Shut up.\" She orders as a shade of red emerges underneath her cheeks from the random assumption. \"I'm checking up on friends you little dork.\" She replies as her brother snickers and teasingly sticks his tongue out at her. \"Enough you two!\" The older wolfess demands. Both younger wolves nod in silence as Molly soon begins to resume her attention back on the mobile device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, the whole area begins to shift around Keane leaving him even more disorientated then before. Still clinging on to tight to his safety raft, he soon looks about before noticing an odd sight not too far from his location. Resting against one of the great walls seemed to be a rather large, pink opening attached to the wriggling surface of the belly. \"I-Is that her throat?\" Keane wonders, as the sphincter gently wiggled and pulsated as the waves brushed against it. As curiosity fills his mind,  a yelp of surprise escapes him as the opening soon begins to part slightly, accepting some of the juices downwards. \"W-wait...throats don't do that.\" Keane stutters before finally realizing just what lied dead ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonononononno!\" Keane stutters realizing that the stomach was beginning to drain the contents deeper into the wolf girls body. While he did want a means of escape, he never at all wanted or expected it to be through this method. If the sight of the stomach draining wasn't enough to leave him terrified, the fact that the bread piece was following the current certainly did. horrified of making contact with the bubbling liquids below, Keane could do very little but hold on with all his might as the current starts to lead him downward. Rising up and down the waves, some small splatters of stomach juice manage to land upon his body leaving him ultimately uninjured by the small quantity. After a mere couple of seconds, Keane soon ends up losing complete hold as the bread, due to the acid, begins to fade away entirely in form. Luckily, the tiny human was so close to the lower opening that by the time the bread broke apart, He manages to get sent downwards towards the entryway of the wolfess's guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly's ears perk up as another gurgle sounds off from within her. Slowly, she lowers her right hand to gently pat her abdomen in a curious fashion. Unsure if it was the food she ate, or the natural processes of her body, she couldn't help but stare in slight confusion as to why her innards were groaning so often.</span></div></div>",

There was no way a human like you could've survived within a stomach, especially when the acids inside were going nuts. Though, upon rising into a sitting position, you shockingly found yourself resting upon an odd squishy patch of pink. \"wait...what?\" you stutter seeing as how you could still feel your legs below, better yet move them. To make sure this wasn't some trick on the mind, you quickly give your right shoulder a jab. As the small pain courses down your arm, a great smile takes up your face. Whether it was a miracle or some other kind event of fate, you surprisingly managed to escape the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to celebrate your victory though, your mind soon jumps into a shocking conclusion. \"w-wait.\" you think aloud. \"h-how do I get out?\" While you were hoping that the wolfess would manage to notice your presence within her belly, that idea has now sailed off the horizon completely. Your neck immediately shifts to the right of your location as you manage to make out the huge pink sphincter of her lower stomach sealed up completely. The sight gives you a sigh of relief, seeing as how no acid could possibly manage to seep through that tightly closed opening. At first you were pondering whether or not you should actually make your way back in. However the very thought of a flood of acid rushing straight towards you quickly threw that idea out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I-If I cant go up..t-that means...' A shiver courses down your spine as you awkwardly turn your body to gaze into the tunnel like depths of the wolf girls intestines. 'you gotta be kidding me...' Your once relieved face contorts into utter disgust seeing how your only supposed means of escape were to voyage even deeper within this huge lupines digestive system. Reluctance soon falls upon you, as you remain still for several seconds. There was no telling what other dangers rested further down there, let alone all the supposed...things you might encounter. While the idea was completely farfetched and wholly nauseating, it did seem like the best if not only option at the moment. Besides, there was no telling when her stomach would start to empty out once again, and you certainly didn't want to be right near the opening when that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No one's gonna believe me when I tell them this.\" you mutter to yourself, wondering just how someone back on earth would react to such an absurd declaration. Then again, which sane person would actually believe in a world filled with gigantic sized wolf people that act like normal human beings? After gathering a bit of composure, you slowly begin to start your way down the huge tunnel like depths of her gut. Luckily for you, the shear size of her intestines made it so you could manage to crawl while having a bit of head room above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Molly continued to look at her phone while chuckling at some of the messages her friends sent her. Many of the messages seemed to pertain to the same thing however, basic school life and gossip from other students. After what seemed like around half an hour or so, the family car soon pulls up on the drive way as the father puts it to brake. \"We're home.\" he calls out, just incase his children were too busy being self absorbed by devices or something else. Billy, his son, took no moment at all to unfasten the seat belt as he rushes out of the car. Molly soon follows as she simply places her phone in the back pocket of her shorts while walking towards the front door. Upon entering into the building, the family soon disburses as each heads off to focus on their own supposed activities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly made a straight B-line for his room to supposedly play with his toys as Molly casually walks her way into her pink room before shutting the door behind her. Having grown up with the annoyances of younger siblings, she takes a quick second to lock the knob before walking towards her bed. With a long relieved sigh, she soon rests her back on her bed as her head lands comfortably upon her pillow. \"That was fun.\" She thinks to herself before another gurgle from her gut draws her attention. \"Okay...my body's rarely done this.\" She ponders, unsure what was causing the small commotion inside her. Despite the irregular sounds however, she simply decides to put the idea to rest, hoping they would go away soon.</span></div></div>",

Seeing as how there really wasn't any choice in the matter, You soon start to take your first steps down the large pink tubes. With each time your foot descended upon the pink mass before, you could feel his form slowly sink downwards as if you was on some slippery water bed. While the whole sensation of walking on such an odd surface proved to be a challenge at first, after a couple experimental steps forward you luckily manage to get a slightly good balance with your motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole voyage inside the intestines proved to be quite an arduous start. If it wasn't the moving floors that was leaving you disoriented, then the constant sounds of gurgles and groans did the trick at catching you off guard. You lost count at how many times a sudden loud gurgle caused you to gasp and leap in shock. Regardless of these distractions, you continue your way down the large organic tube. It all seemed like smooth sailing at first after a couple minutes. While the path before you did end up winding into different corners, the whole surroundings remained in a similar plane giving you an easier path forward. Just when you thought you were going to have an easy trip overall, a sudden rocking motion emerges all around you as the gravity holding you down quickly starts to contort towards the right. Unprepared for such a change in placement, your entire body ends up tumbling down the slippery soft walls before landing with a splat on the new position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!?\" you mutter while raising your head from the dizzying event. It didn't take too long to hypothesize that the wolf girl was moving about outside, which only meant a more challenging trip ahead. If she kept on moving and squirming about over time, your trip would only prove to be that much more of a task. Eventually, the movements die down after a second or so as you quickly rise up and continue your way further downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the trip did seem to be quite an ease to traverse through. Though, due to the wolfess's new position, rather then simply turning down a corner to continue downwards, you were forced to carefully clamber your way down a rather slippery edge into the lower area. Your first attempt ended up with you slipping down the edge and landing right down on your rear with a bounce, though after that you did manage to gain some insight on a preferable method of descent. Time overall seemed to be lost within the depths of the wolfess. As you attempted your ways down her gut, you couldn't tell just how long you've been residing within her body. Whether it was minutes or hours was beyond your knowledge, though personally you could care less. Here you were given a second chance of living, and you for one we're not going to let an idea like time hinder your thoughts of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to descend down another incline downwards, the sudden groans from earlier reemerged about your area. The forceful growls shake up the walls and floors as you quickly knelt down to brace the bodily movements. Just when you though the trip was turning out to be rather safe, the gurgles and groans only manage to increase in volume. Immediately, you raise your head up to inspect the situation before-</span></div></div>",

Treating the whole situation as if it was akin to an earthquake was a completely ridiculous idea, but on the other hand there really wasn't anything else to compare it to. Upon crouching, the squishy floors below gently sink downwards from your weight as the rumpus continued onwards. growing only louder with each waking moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when things couldn't seem to be that more unstable, a sudden deafening roar explodes right besides you, joined by a massive torrent of hot gust with such force that nearly knocks you down completely.

The sudden change in spacing was enough to get your heart racing, as a glint of hope reemerged within your soul. After who knows how long of traversing this lupine's body, you were almost at the home stretch. Full of vigor, you quickly wriggle your way down the writhing tunnel as the muscles immediately begin to contract about you.

I've read about the common use's for human slaves most were for sex or other such activities and that made me curious. I was wondering if that's something that you'd be interested in trying after all I did let you ride in my cleavage.\" you think on this for a moment that ride was a bit arousing. \"Sure why not I do owe you for not killing me. What was it that you had in mind\" you say after a moment \"Well...\" she said shyly \"I read that most sex slaves where used as dildos. Would you mind helping me out?\" you nod and you see her face brighten. She stands up and grabs you in a hurry very excited about your approval. She sets you on the bed and begins to strip and you can't help but watch as she takes off her shirt and pants. Your face goes read as her beautiful body is revealed to you. She looks at you and sees that you haven't started to strip, she picks you up and asks \"Are you nervous? Or would you rather have me help you\" she changes to a sexy tone in her voice. \" go ahead\" you say a little nervous about being a sex toy to a giant wolf. She removes your shirt and takes off your pants, when she sees your bulge in your boxers you can see her blush a little. She then tears off your boxers with her claw, your member bounces out in the air. She sees this and slowly gets closer \"would you mind if I um...\" she says in a quiet shy voice \"go ahead but only if you want\". She moves even closer and wraps her lips around your dick as she starts to suck you off. You throw your head back as you get the best blow job of your life, you moan and gasp reassuring her that she's doing great. You soon climax into her muzzle and she quickly swallows your cum enjoying the taste. \"I read on the internet that most women put the human slave in their mouth to lube them up before using them as dildos. Would it be okay if I\" you cut her off and say \"of course you can I would do just about anything for you\" even tho you barely know her you feel as tho you can trust her besides she hasn't done anything to harm you in fact she saved you. She puts you in her mouth and licks you all over taking in all of your tastes and textures, she soon feels that you are properly lubricated and pulls you out of her mouth. \"Are you ready to start\" she says in a bit more confident tone\" \"ready as I'll ever be\" you say still a little nervous, but still willing. She sits on her bed and spreads her legs, she sets you down right in-between her thighs your looking at what you could only be the biggest pussy you have ever seen. She watches as you walk closer to her pussy. Standing right in front you tentatively touch her outer labia, she tenses up a bit as you do so. Taking a deep breath you decide to just go at it. You reach out with both arms and start to massage her pussy it soon starting to become dripping wet and she starts moaning she asks \"Would you please go inside\" you nod as you push an arm in and start fisting her deciding to make it two arms you start to push your way inside, pushing up to your armpits you slowly make your way into her tight pussy. She moans as you enter her pussy the pleasure causing her to massage her breasts and play with her clit. You push your way in up to your waist, rubbing the walls with your hands that's as far as you can go on your own and as if sensing this she grabs your feet and starts pushing you in and out using you as a dildo. She is moaning and gasping this is the most intense experience she has ever gone through. She soon is close to climax she shoves you all the way in and you wiggle around in a bit of a panic, she use's both hand to fondle her breast as she climaxes your shot out of her pussy. She lays down in the afterglow breathing heavily heart pounding in her chest. You try to pick yourself up out of the puddle of sticky juices you were in but they were just too sticky you were stuck to her sheet, you look up at her as she sits up she sees you laying there in front of her she picks you up and licks you clean. \"Thank you that was the best experience I have ever had and I hope it was good for you too\" Molly says with a grin on her face \"That was truly the best thing that has ever happened to me too\" she lays back down and sets you in-between her breasts, you lay down in-between her large mounds of beautiful flesh. \"What do you want to do next\" you ask \"Well its not long till night if you want we could sleep together but until the how about a bath?\"</span></div></div>",

In panic you tried to grab the pink fabric, which somehow made you not fall to the ground. Clinging to the lower edge of her shirt you slid down under her. It was only a matter of seconds, but for you it felt like a long battle against gravity. You opened your eyes trying to figure out if your're still alive. The clicking sounds of the phone made you realise that the girl decided to check the messages or text someone. Whatever she was doing - it gave you a bit of time to reconsider your situation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got caught in her shirt and were now sitting under.. Well, considering her pose - ON the fabric with the warm grey fur above you. 'Ok, calm down' - you thought to yourself. You had to think what to do now to get her attention and don't kill yourself trying. Behind you was the bottom of her t-shirt, which got out of her jeans when she leaned forward. To get out on this side, you would either have to jump down or try to reach the belt. Landing on the soft seat probably wouldn't hurt you but the idea of being on a same seat with a giant wolf that can crush you any moment didn't make you feel comfortable for some reason. Jumping to reach the belt on the other hand.. You could try that but it looked a bit far, considering the fact that you didn't have too much maneuvering space. Besides, why would you want to go there? It's not like Molly will easily notice you sitting in her pants! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in the opposite direction. And couldn't see much, in fact - the t-shirt was too tight. You didn't know how she would react to finding you in between her breasts, but not having much of a choice you began crawling forward, feeling her furry body pressed against yours. Moving through the forest of grey fur wasn't easy but somewhat enjoyable. After a moment you reached two mountains hanging down from the \"ceiling\". Molly was wearing a pink, see-through bra, the fur around here was much more sparse, except for a fluffy patch right above, between the breasts. The t-shirt was really tight in here, so you had to squeeze in between to go further. It felt really good, having the enormous mass of flesh around you, so soft and fluffy.. You thought you could..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unexpected giggle snapped you out of your dreams. You looked forward from the cleavage, seeing seeing the wolfess'  face as she was texting on the phone, her silver necklace hanging in front of you. You could jump now, catch it.. She would definitely see you. But do you want to risk and leave this furry heaven you're in?</span></div></div>",

No failing grades or anything?\u201d The father asks in an almost accusing tone. \u201cNope, none at all.\u201d The wolfess known as Molly replies as you hear her snapping down on a piece of food. \u201cI bet she\u2019s the problem.\u201d The younger wolf states with a chortle causing Molly\u2019s body to move slightly towards him. \u201cSay\u2019s the littletroublemaker!\u201d Molly lashes out accusingly. \u201cEnough you two.\u201d The mother wolfess asks while letting out a long sigh. \u201cHe started it!\u201d Molly groans as you manage to catch sight of her pointing a finger towards the younger brother. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m finishing it.\u201d The mother states in a stern tone as the two young wolves lightly growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the conversation did sound like that of an average human family, you were astonished by the similarities these giant canines had to people back on Earth. After a nanosecond, you soon kick your brain back into gear as you gaze up at the wolfess with complete uncertainty. Now that you were before her ginormous imposing body, the next question was just how will you manage to get her attention?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The wolf's breasts jiggle a bit every time she moves, squeezing you softly between them. You kind of like being here. The soft warm fur on the breasts feels good against you. Even if she is a giant wolf, she's female, and around your age too. You start to relax, closing your eyes and sinking deeper into the valley of cleavage surrounding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolves talking causes your eyes to open, and you panic as you realize that you're completely exposed to the rest of the wolves! You don't want to be seen by them. On impulse, you scramble up the teenage wolf's right breast and squeeze under her t-shirt. It's a tight fit, but you can crawl under there. It's too tight to turn around, so you crawl downward. The fur fades away and soft pink skin appears as you crawl closer to the breast's nipple. You crawl along on the skin until you reach the nipple. It is as big as your head. You've never had such a great oppurtunity to explore a girl's cleavage before, so you reach out and touch the nipple. Your hand trails down the nipple onto the soft skin beside it. You suddenly have a plan to get the wolf's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl in front of the nipple and start stroking it with your hands. You massage the nipple and the skin around it, loving the feel of it. This is making you aroused, and you get more involved. While massaging the breast, you start sucking on the tip of the nipple. You feel it with your tongue and suck on it greedily, as if you were trying to get milk. You feel the breast getting harder and notice the skin is becoming redder. You continue with your sensual exploration, enjoying yourself more every moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the teenage wolf moving, and you know you've gotten her attention. Her t-shirt gets tighter as she stands, pushing you further against her now hard breast. Judging by the way her breast is moving, the giant wolf is walking away from her family. You continue sucking and massaging, not really caring what the wolf is doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a giant object comes into the t-shirt, and you realize it's the teenage wolf's paw! Her paw feels around her breast until it falls on you. The paw wraps around you and plucks you off her breast. You're pulled out of her t-shirt and into the open. The girl wolf raises you to her face. You stare at her in fear, afraid of what her reaction will be. </span></div></div>",

You hear the other wolves moving about, and the sounds of containers being closed as well. They must be leaving now. You're jostled about as Molly helps her family pack up. When everything is ready, the wolves head for home. You let your body be bounced around Molly's breasts as she walks, and listen to the wolves conversing. Mostly they talk about their picnic and all the fun they had. Molly doesn't mention you, but you're sure that she is thinking of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the sound of a door opening and assume that the wolves are home. You listen to the wolves set down their things and spread themselves throughout the house. By the feel of Molly's walking she is going up stairs. You hear another door open, and shortly after Molly's paw reaches into her t-shirt and pulls you out of your comfy confinement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and realize that you're in Molly's room. The walls are painted pink and the floor is pink carpet. There are drawers and a bed that are covered with clothes, stuffed animals and other things. You see a closet that is full of clothes and such. There are posters on the walls of wolven bands that you have never heard of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly raises you to her face and smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my room! You'll be staying here a lot so I hope you like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Molly's tongue flicks out of her mouth and licks you!

You sit on the pillow and marvel at the room. Even if you were Molly's size it would be a fairly large room, but to you, it's huge! You like the feel of it, and decide that if you have to stay somewhere in this strange world, it should be here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the bedroom door opens.

Your pleasure builds quickly, and you cry out as it reaches its peak. Your cum spurts out of your dick and lands on Amanda's tongue.

Keane couldn't help but chuckle at just how giddy she was acting. For a moment, he thought she'd be on the verge of leaping about excitedly beyond all that contained happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\" Amanda nods with a small smile, seeming a bit disappointed by the outcome, but not by too much. \"If that's the case, let me help out.\" She states before gently using her huge furry fingers to lift up Keane's miniscule form upwards. Keane, taken by surprise by the sudden ascent, lets out a small shout before slowly calming from the supposed safety of the warm fingers. With a smile, Amanda turns over to Molly's form as Molly's tail was wagging behind like crazy. \"Hmmm...I think we should make this a bit easier.\" Amanda insists to the other two's confusion. \"Easier?\" Molly asks dumbfounded as she cranes her head to the left. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's grin only manages to grow from the question as she gazes down at Molly's carpeted floor. \"lay down Molly.\" Amanda instructs. \"Lay do- Ohh!\" Molly claps her hands lightly from the realization as she immediately lowers her body downwards until she was lying still on her back. Confused by what was going on, Keane gazes down at Molly's new position as Amanda begins to kneel down on her knees to the side of her friends body. \"Now say Aaaahhhhh.\" Amanda insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any hesitation, Molly opens her maw as wide as she could, while even sticking out her huge pink tongue for good measure. \"ahhhh-\" She sounds out from deep in her throat. With a chuckle, Amanda soon positions Kean right above Molly's gaping maw, as his body was blasted by the hot breath's emerging from within the wolfess's maw. \"Ready Keane?\" Amanda asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed by the sight of Molly's huge maw below him, Keane trail of thought was soon disrupted by the sudden question. \"h-huh?\" he stutters gazing upwards. \"E-errmmm yeah, I'm ready.\" he assures the two. \"Seems like someone's eager to get in someone's mouth.\" Amanda jokes as the two wolves couldn't help but giggle. Keane's face contorts to an embarrassed expression as his cheeks redden up by the statement. \"Well. In you go.\" Amanda then releases her grip on Keane's waist as the tiny human lands with a splat right on Molly's tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm~\" Molly moans in sheer bliss by the flavor of the being in her mouth. Being a carnivore she was use to the succulent flavor of meat, but Keane on the other hand carried an odd yet pleasing taste to her. It was almost sweet to say the least, yet still carried the luscious flavor of the best kind of steak out there. \"That good huh?\" Amanda asks watching with almost jealous eyes as her friend simply nods still in a state of content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of the slimy confines of Molly's maw, Keane found trouble trying to keep a steady balance upon the mighty muscle. Not only was it slippery due to the coat of saliva upon it, but the unpredictable movements it did made it nearly impossible to not get moved about. With groans and grunts, Keane would find himself being shifted and tossed about as Molly's tongue made contact with nearly every side of his body. It wasn't even too long until she was pressing his body upon the solid roof of her mouth while sucking down the excess amount of saliva pooling about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Molly was enjoying the fascinating experience though-</span></div></div>",

The wolf girl giggled in excitement and lowered he head right down to the desk on level with Keane, \"Hop on in!\" she explained.<br>\r\nWith that Amanda's jaw opened wide, a blast of hot air once again hit Keane. He looked ahead and saw Amanda rows of sharps teeth, wet tongue, and the back of her throat. Amanda's tongue rolled out of her mouth like a carpet, stopping at Keane's feet. He looked up over Amanda's gaping-smiling muzzle into her eyes and smiled, she stared right back at him through her glasses until he vanished under the horizon of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane stepped onto her waiting tongue, his feet sinking into the wet spongy surface and tickling his soles, and shooting a shiver right up his spine.

All the sudden Amanda's tongue jerked around violently and the booming sound of her laughter came over Keane as he fell flat on her tongue. Amanda was giggling over the feeling of the small human's tiny feet walking on her tongue, the sensation was almost to much to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane tried to lift his bare body up, but before he could do so Amanda had withdrawn her tongue back into her mouth whilst rolling it around him like a blanket closing her jaws behind it.<br>\r\nThe tongue squeezes him slightly, tasting him and insuring he was now completely soaked in her saliva. \"Mmmm!\" Amanda moaned, her vocal resonance shaking Keane at his small size. Keane laughed out, \"Do I really take that good?\". Amanda's tongue unwrapped Keane leaving him laying there. He tried to get up again but his movements only made his host start laughing again, though Amanda felt her mouth shut. The laughing bounced Keane all over her mouth, which only resulting in more laughing. Amanda clammed herself down, then continued to taste Keane. pressing him on the roof of her mouth, swishing him against her inner cheek, and lapping at him with the tip of her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes go by and...</span></div></div>",

Strangely though you find that you are not really frightened so much as surprised.

The problem with the latter is it might reveal that your world has humans on it to people you don't want to know it,\" she say to you.

That soon led to me explaining other genres of music from Earth. Suddenly you felt a vibration in your pocket, you reach in and gasp as you felt your cell phone. You quickly pull it out and smile a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's that Keane?\" Molly asked, You smiled more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my cellphone! I forgot all about this\" You respond happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I have a cellphone.\" Molly pulls out a very large rectangular object, her giant phone looked a lot like the iPhone, which was a little odd in your opinion. You brushed that aside and started to look through your many songs on your phone and laughed a little when you found one song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This song was used to invade a country back where I'm from, when ever I hear it I laugh and say 'America's guide to invading a foreign country, play really loud English music that mainly consists of screaming' I love this song haha\" You press the play button and put your phone on full blast in hopes of Molly hearing it. Bodies by Drowning Pool started playing, you smiled as Molly showed signs of being able to hear the song and seemed to be very interested. Soon the song was over and Molly smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was interesting, I've never heard of music like that before\" You smile and started to play other songs by Avenge Sevenfold, Eminem, Dr.Dre, Xzibit, DMX, N.W.A, Drake, Skillet, ACDC, Guns and Roses, Nickel Back, and many other bands and singers. Soon Molly started to ask questions about some words, never hearing them before now. One word, you were hoping she wouldn't hear and ask about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, what does Bitch mean?\" You froze and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.... I don't think you want to know...\" You say a little scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Of course I want to know, come on just tell me\" Molly said. You looked up at her with a scared face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Fine.... It.... It means....\" You struggled to say the meaning of the word due to fear and wanted to just run and hide but you knew you had no where to go, so you took a deep breath and just said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It mean.... Female dog.... Please don't hurt me!!\" You yell and cower in fear on Molly's bed. You sat there for a minute, nothing happening, nothing but silence.

She rips meat off and chews, her teeth mashing it to bits as she pursues her food with frightening single-mindedness. Seeing her eat from the table was nothing like seeing it up close. You shudder and look away. You look at the meat. It reminds you all too vividly of Molly's frenzy and your grease-covered condition. If you hadn't been so hungry, you might not have eaten it. You tear chunks off and chew it. It is a bit tough, but at least it is cooked. You shiver as you remember the raw, blood-dripping venison. Your glad molly didn't get that. You don't eat very much before your full (or run out of appetite). You look around and sigh.<br>\r\n\"Better get used to this.\" You mutter to yourself. You look over at Molly.

Fog comes out of her nose as she sniffs. She puts down the plates and wraps the leftovers in plastic wrap. There are several shelves, all made of stainless steel, like the door.

Wolves have a high protein diet you think. In the center of the room are large sides of meat, hanging from the ceiling. They swing slowly in the air.

You also notice that it gives you a great view of her breasts, which you take advantage of. She walks out of the fridge and shuts the door. You start to warm up in the heated kitchen air. The kitchen is a bit different from what you are used to, there are very few spices or tools. The stove is enormous, with four large heaters and a grill.

Her mom is sitting in a rocking chair, reading a book. Her father is sitting in an easy chair with his feet up on a footrest. He is reading a newspaper. You can't make out what it shows. Billy is sitting on the floor, playing with some toy cars. Molly sits down on the couch and puts you on her knee.Sitting on the jeans with the soft fur under them feels a little like a bed. You feel very nervous about this event, you're going to be the focus of attention for three giant carnivores (and Molly, but Molly's nice). Molly starts petting you even as she speaks:<br>\r\n\"Everyone, this is Keane, my new pet.\" Three sets of eyes that have been studiously ignoring you snap up. Molly's mom and dad close their reading; Billy scrambles over to get a better look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in apprehension at the giant wolf boy getting closer to you. He sniffs a big sniff, taking in your scent, and speaks:<br>\r\n\"He smells a lot like dinner.\" You look at him in horror. Your clothes are still covered in grease from the dinner, and he is a carnivore. He is eying you in a distinctly hungry way. You scoot back along Molly\u2019s leg until you fall off between her legs. At least he can't see you anymore. Molly reaches in and picks you up, her claws curling around you. She looks at Billy and starts to growl. It starts out as a low growl deep in her throat, and you can nearly taste the menace radiating from it. Billy looks defiantly at his sister and you for a moment, and Molly's growl gets steadily louder and more menacing, her claws curling around you until they touch at the top, forming a sharp and dangerous cage. You feel strangely protected by it, even as you shudder from the growl. You had never heard anyone utter anything like it. It swells in volume and menace as you look on. Eventually even Billy is daunted and backs down, his ears flat on his head. He turns away and mutters clearly:<br>\r\n\"I was just saying...\" At this point Billy's mother intervenes:<br>\r\n\"Billy, it's time for bed.\" Billy gets up sullenly and glances back at Molly. She has stopped growling, but her hackles are still raised and her eyes are slits. She hasn't relaxed her claws around you at all. Billy scurries off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly lets out a long, slow breath, opens her claws and relaxes. She puts you back on her legs, but you notice that you are a lot closer to her body this time. Her father looks at you for a moment, than looks at Molly:<br>\r\n\"I take it you don't intend to eat him.\" It is a statement, her recent behavior answering any questions that may have been raised. Molly nods at him. He continues: \"I don\u2019t have to talk to you about responsibility with pets, do I? Or following the proper forms, since you showed me that at dinner.\" Molly nods again. Her father raises the newspaper with one last comment: \"He really does smell like that, you know. You should avoid further... incidents with Billy.\" Molly replies:<br>\r\n\"Okay dad.\" She actually looks submissive; she has her head bowed and her eyes lowered a startling contrast to how she looked before. As you look up at her, however, she winks at you. Her mother looks at her:<br>\r\n\"You can go now dear.\" Molly picks you up and stands up hastily. You are both equally relieved to be out of this situation. Molly heads out the door and up the stairs to her room.</span></div></div>",

She sees you pointing:<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Keane, I didn't even realize I was doing that.\" She stops flexing her claws and her paw steadies some. She carries you up some stairs, which makes for a bumpy ride, even if she is trying to hold you steady. She comes to her room and opens the door, firmly locking it behind her. She goes over to her bead and puts you on the pillow and lies on her stomach on top of the blanket. This gives her an eye level view of you. There is an awkward silence for a moment, and then molly sighs:<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry about Billy. He is fascinated with food, always hungry. If I had known he was going to do that, I would have waited until he went to bed.\" You look back at her; she's resting her chin on her paws and looking straight at you, waiting for a reaction.<br>\r\n\"It's okay Molly, you couldn\u2019t have known.

It's actually comforting to know you'll do things like that for me, especially in front of your parents.\" Molly looks at you, startled, and then she starts smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Molly looks at you and starts to breathe a little quickly:<br>\r\n\"Remember the look on Billy's face? It's time that brat learned he can't get away with everything.\" And then she starts to laugh, a full bodied laughter. She opens her mouth and her tongue rolls out the side of her mouth as she continues laughing. You start to laugh to, remembering how sullen Billy looked. Then a particularly big burst from her mouth hits you and you fall on your butt on the pillow, tumbling down to the bed. You look at each other for a moment, than laugh even harder. Your breath starts coming in gasps, but you can't stop laughing. The hilarity of the day hits you all at once, now that you\u2019re past the heart pounding terror of the actual events. Eventually, you both stop laughing and gasp for breath. Molly has a huge grin on her face, though she's careful to keep her teeth hidden. She sits up and picks you up. She brings you to her snout and cuddles you into her fur near her eye. It feels really nice, warm and safe. You cuddle her back, basking in the affection of your friend/owner. She stops and holds you out in front of her face.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Keane, I really needed that.\" She smiles fondly at you. You look back:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me to. So what do we do now?\" Molly stands up from the bed and looks down at you. She takes a great whiff through her nose, obviously smelling you, and then she looks back at you, a playful light in her eye added to her grin.<br>\r\n\"Now we act on dad's instructions.\" She heads for her bathroom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Molly walks into her bathroom and flips two switches. The lights turn on, brilliant white and the fan turns on. The fan sounds like a distant hurricane to you howling faintly. The bathroom has tile with strange geometric designs, like most bathrooms and a white countertop. The bath is a stand alone, with legs that end in paws. There are no rugs on the floor; they couldn\u2019t take the punishment from a wolf's claws. The bathroom is fairly large, even by normal sized standards. Molly walks over to the counter and sets you down, the claws at her feet clicking on the tile. You look up at her. The playful grin has, if possible, broadened on her face. You get a little suspicious.<br>\r\n\"What now?\" you call up to her. Molly chuckles: <br>\r\n\"You are covered in grease, Keane; it's getting you into trouble. We're going to fix that. You\u2019re getting a bath.\" Molly plugs the sink and starts running water into it. It gradually fills up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly picks you up again:<br>\r\n\"Time to get undressed, Keane.\" Before you can object, she curls a claw under your shirt, on your back. It feels smooth and presses into your back. She lifts your shirt gently and your arms automatically lift in reply. She puts the shirt in her pocket and reaches for you again. You want to head this off:<br>\r\n\"Molly, wait.\" She stops her paw before it reaches you, startled:<br>\r\n\"Keane, you need to get undressed to take a bath. These clothes are greasy.\" The playful look is still there as she says this. You know she is enjoying this. Deep down, you think you might enjoy it to. You squelch that thought and object:<br>\r\n\"Molly, I can do it myself. Would you put me down and let me please?\" Molly looks at you:<br>\r\n\"Come on Keane, you can't possibly get in or out without my help, or get soap or any of that. Come on, let's get on with it.\" She sounds like someone stating a clear, reasonable argument. She hooks a claw into your pants and underwear and starts to tug gently. You grasp them quickly and tug against her. Your face flushes deep red at the thought of this giant girl, wolf or not, seeing you naked. Molly tugs for a few seconds, and then she notices your flush. She giggles:<br>\r\n\u201cWhy Keane, are you blushing?\u201d She giggles some more, \u201ccome on, let\u2019s see what you have under all that.\u201d She moves quickly this time. Her hand blurs forward and curls into your pants. Before you can react, she flips you onto your butt and tugs off your remaining clothes. She pockets them and looks on with interest, inspecting your revealed penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cVery\u2026 nice\u201d she says, not even bothering to cover her laugh as you cover your privates and blush down to the roots of your hair. This cannot get more embarrassing. She finishes laughing and looks at you some more \u201cI think I can help you get over this embarrassment of yours. Here.\u201d She puts you onto the countertop. The cold runs up your spine from your butt and you jump up, still blushing and covering your privates. You have had enough:<br>\r\n\u201cMolly\u2026\u201d You yell up at her, but that is as far as you get. Molly is lifting her shirt off! She takes it off and discards it on the floor. You look up in wonder at her enormous, beautiful torso. She is covered in fir, sleek and gray, covering a firm stomach and moving up to her chest. Her breasts are firm, round and perfect. They are not gigantic, but they are not petite either. Fur runs out onto them and thins out as it gets to her gloriously exposed nipple, which you notice is hard. Your hands move unconsciously away from you manhood, which is stiff as you gaze at this furry beauty. She smiles at you:<br>\r\n\u201cSee I\u2019m exposed to. This is where you were, incidentally.\u201d She caresses her left nipple, idly running circles around it.. Remembering the experience from earlier makes you get, if possible, even harder. Molly is extremely appreciative of this fact, her gaze wandering up and down your small body, lingering on you privates. You speak without thinking:<br>\r\n\u201cYour gorgeous.\u201d You breathe as you continue to gape. You were saying it under your breath, but her extremely sharp wolf hearing caught on anyways. She smiles, a little self conscious this time:<br>\r\n\u201cMy, what a nice thing to say! You\u2019re not so bad yourself, you know.\u201d She smiles and picks you up. You make no move to fend her off as she raises you to eye level, getting a better view. She sniffs in and smiles. Her lounge suddenly darts out, licking you up and down. It caresses your entire body, lingering a little around your privates before moving on. This is erotic, but it is even more ticklish. You double over laughing as it hits a sensitive spot. Molly\u2019s eyes light up an she runs her tongue up and down your body, searching for sensitive areas. When you double over to protect your stomach, she goes after your armpits. You fall over and gasp:<br>\r\n\u201cMolly, please stop\u201d You can barley breathe from laughing and you kick your feet in the air. Molly giggles herself and goes after the soles of your feet, sending even more sensation up your legs. After a while, she withdraws her tongue and you lie there, gasping for breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly looks a little concerned:<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u201d she asks a little worriedly. You sit up, smile and shake your head. You get wearily to your feet. You are covered in saliva and sweat, dripping onto her palm. You\u2019re even dirtier than before. Your penis as gone flaccid, you\u2019re totally wiped. You also stand unselfconsciously in front of Molly. She means you well, and fair is fair after all. You got to explore her. You know that you\u2019ll be nude for her anytime she wants. Molly smiles at you:<br>\r\n\u201cWell, your naked now. You\u2019re so much dirtier now, though. You really need that bath!\u201d You hear the request in the statement. You smile and nod at her. She smiles back at you and lowers you into the water. You float on top as she soaps up her pads and claws with very strong-smelling soap. It smells  like flowers and spring. You think it is for covering up any lingering smell. You relax and let her do what she wants. She has decided to move away from teasing and to actual cleaning, however. She strokes your body from head to toe, massaging you as she cleans you. She gets every knot and ache with her gentle paws. You trust her implicitly and lie there in bliss as she gives you a perfect massage. You keep your eyes closed and let her run her claws and pad up and down your body, caressing you at times, scrubbing vigorously at others. After she is done, she gently lifts you out of the water. Water cascades off her palm back into her sink, a gentle sound that is reassuring and relaxing. You know you could not be in better hands (or paws). She gently dries you with soft, warm white hand towels, running them over your body until your completely dry, than sets you down as she gets ready to\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You lie on the hand towel, relaxing from your wonderful bath. Molly was so gentle, and it felt so good. You hear the drain being pulled and you open your eyes. Molly has pulled the plug in the water, which is draining out of the sink. You are surprised at the amount of grease there is, you must have been really dirty. You sit up. Molly is still naked above her waist, so you just stare at her breasts, admiring them. You are limp in every sense of the word; you just think they're nice to look at. Molly smiles down at you, also satisfied with how things have gone. She gently strokes you as she speaks:<br>\r\n'Did you have a nice bath?\" she asks remnants of her earlier playfulness in her voice. You nod up at her, completely relaxed. You just sit there and let her stroke you, waiting to see what comes next. She takes her hand away and starts getting things from the cabinet:<br>\r\n\"Time for bed Keane, I just need to clean my teeth.\" You nod and stand up on the towel. You are still naked, but you don't feel any embarrassment. Molly doesn't have that wicked look in her eye, and he does not tease you either. She just smiles down at you, both of you are beaming with your last experience. She reaches into the cabinet and grabs a toothbrush. It is very large and thick. It is much bigger than the ones you have at home. Molly puts the toothpaste on it and opens her mouth. Her teeth are incredibly dirty, from the grease and meat of dinner. She meticulously scrubs each one until they are gleaming white. She flosses too, getting all the meat out. She uses mouthwash and spits, and then looks down at you. She picks you up carefully and puts you at mouth level, than opens her mouth. Her ranks of gleaming fangs are presented to you, looking entirely too sharp and lethal too you. You shudder reflexively. Molly closes her mouth and looks at you:<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Her breath no longer smells like meat, it smells... fresh. That\u2019s the only word for it you have. She did a great job cleaning.<br>\r\n\"Very deadly,\" you reply, too relaxed to say anything but what you feel.<br>\r\n\"Great, there supposed to look that way.\" She beams down at you and puts you back on the sink. You take the opportunity to admire her body as she pulls down her jeans, leaving her only with her panties. Her legs are slim and muscular; her tail is long and beautiful, in its own way. You smile as she turns around and leans over a hamper. You take the suggestion and admire her butt. It is firm and well formed. You dream for a moment about standing there, looking down, but you shake yourself out of it. If you had a choice, you would stay with Molly's breasts, squirming around as her nipples harden, feeling her heartbeat... but your daydream is interrupted as Molly pulls on an oversized tee-shirt. It doesn't have anything on it, but it effectively covers and hides all those features you had been admiring. She picks you up and heads out of the bathroom, turning off the light as she goes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her bedroom, she sets you down on her pillow, than goes to the door for a moment. She opens it and sticks her head out:<br>\r\n\"Goodnight!\" she yells. You hear muffled replies from downstairs. Molly switches off the overhead light, leaving only the bedside light as a source of illumination. She comes over and draws back the blankets, than sits down. She smiles down at you, and strokes you with one paw:<br>\r\n\"Time for bed, Keane. I hope you had a good time in there.\" Her paw gets down to your penis for a moment and she giggles. She continues stroking you as you reply:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks for doing that. IT was the most wonderful bath I have ever had.\" You return her smile. You stare at each other for a moment, than she lets loose an incredibly wide yawn:<br>\r\n\"Time to sleep Keane. It may be different from your old life, but at least you're here with me and not someone else.\" She stares down at you intently. She stops stroking you. You consider your response, than reply:<br>\r\n\"Yeah Molly. I could have landed with Billy, for instance. You are a nice person and I enjoy being with you. Thanks for being here.\" She smiles again, than turns off the light. She lies down, with her head on the pillow beside you. She curls up and reaches for you. You let her pick you up. She scoots up in bed a little, than she puts you right in front of her head, a little below her nose.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Keane.\" She says sleepily.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Molly.\" You reply as you lye down and get comfortable. Molly curls up on her side; so that her back is bent. She reaches up with her paw and strokes you gently as you both fall asleep. You are lulled by her strokes and by her warm breath spilling onto your body. She keeps her paw on you as she sleeps, and you fall asleep, comforted by the fact that Molly is there and that she cares for you. The next day is a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up disoriented, someone is nudging you. The bed is so soft though, so yielding. Wait, your bed isn't this soft. You open your eyes. A foot from your face, you see the snout of an enormous wolf! You yell and tumble backwards down the pillow. You hit the bed and look up, than you remember the day before. You sigh and stand up. Molly is looking down at you in concern. You wave at her:<br>\r\n\"Sorry Molly, you startled me!\" Molly giggles and sits up. You see her paw lift away from the pillow, she must have nudged you awake.<br>\r\n\"Good morning Keane, its Sunday morning!\" She stands up and yawns, her mouth gaping wide. She reaches her arms in the air behind her, stretching. You notice that the bedside light is on and it's still dark outside. \"Morning\" is a bit of an overstatement. Molly picks you up and walks over to the bathroom. She puts you down on the top of the dresser as she pulls out some clothes. You can't see what from this angle, but you watch with interest at this rare top view of your owner. Molly gets all she wants and closes the drawers, clothes tucked under one arm. You are at mouth level for her, she stares right at you.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take a shower and get dressed, than it's breakfast! You wait out here.\" She goes into the bathroom and shuts the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't suppress a pang of regret about not going in with her, showering with her would have been an interesting scene. Anyway, you are stuck up here, so you look around. Molly's bedroom is still enormous, but you can see all of it at once from up here.  The posters on the wall show a band or two, and several other scenes you can't identify. From the bathroom you hear the sound of running water, the distant waterfall of the shower and the rush of water in the wall behind you. On the dresser itself, there are huge photos on the surface and a three medals hanging on nails above it. You walk along the dresser, looking at photos. There is one enormous one that features a horde of wolves, her extended family. There is a photo of the whole family standing in front of the house. You can't suppress a shudder of fear at Billy, the hungry wolf boy. You distract yourself by looking at the other pictures. There are a lot of nature scenes, and several pictures of Molly standing in front of what are obviously famous sites. The medals show a wolf running, but you can't identify what they are for. The water stops and you go to the edge of the dresser, waiting for Molly. Before long the bathroom door opens, revealing Molly. She is looking well groomed, her hair is sleek and shiny and she is spotless from head to toe. That is not what catches your attention, though. She is wearing a very tight top, covering and revealing her well formed breasts. It doesn\u2019t cover her stomach, which is slim and toned under her silvery fur. Her shorts can only be described as \"really short shorts.\" They are incredibly tight and don't even extend halfway to her knees. As she walks past you, you notice they barely get down past her butt, a fact you appreciate. She is searching or you and you call to her. Her ears twitch and she turns around.<br>\r\n\"So what do you think?\" she asks as she turns around like a model. You observe her outfit again.<br>\r\n\"Very nice!\" you say appreciatively. Molly chuckles and walks over. She plucks you off the dresser and sits down at her desk, putting you down. You get a great view of her top, which is tight against her breasts. You hear a giggle from her. You look past her breasts and you see that she is looking down at you, her eyes staring fixedly on your privates. You blush, you have gone very stiff. Molly laughs again, and your embarrassment increases. You don't move to cover your privates, though. What would be the use? Molly looks down at you and thinks for a moment, then speaks:<br>\r\n\"I appreciate you like this, but I don't think the general public will. You need some clothes!\" You shudder, thinking about the scene you would cause.<br>\r\n\"Well, your clothes are being washed, so I\u2019ll...</span></div></div>",

You stand on the desk and wonder what kind she will make. You aren't very handy with a needle. You hope she knows what she's doing. The door opens and Molly walks back in, closing it behind her. She has some cloth, scissors, needle, thread and a string. She sits down at the desk and puts the things down to your right. The cloth is totally white, and so is the thread. Molly takes the thread and reaches for you. You sit still and let her do her measurements. First, she measures around your waist, \"accidentally\" touching your penis as she does. She smiles and measures around your legs, careful around your manhood, and turns to the cloth. She quickly measure s a circle in the cloth and cuts it out. She uses your leg measurements to cut two arches around the center. She turns to you and picks you up, you utter a yelp but your just a few feet above the desk. She carefully fits the cloth through your legs and pulls iy up your leg, giving you a rudimentary loincloth. She ties some string around it, asking you when to stop. You have her stop when it's tight. She nods, than instructs you to lie down on the cloth. You do so. She has you spread your arms. She quickly sketches around you, admonishing you when you jerk from the pencil touching you. She finishes and you get off. She does a few things you don't understand and voila, you have a short sleeved shirt. She makes to put it on you, but you shake your head:<br>\r\n\"I'll do it, Molly.\" She looks at you, then shrugs and hands it to you. You pull it over your head. It seems your outfit is completed, so you inspect the handiwork. The cloth is very soft against your skin, but it does lack in appearance. It also is very minimal. She isn't much better than you, it seems. Molly picks you up and lifts you to eye level. She inspects you herself while you recline on her pad.<br>\r\n\"It's very minimal, I'm not very good. She shrugs again, and then starts to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She stops.<br>\r\n\"I almost forgot one last thing, hold on Keane.\" She puts you back down, then picks up the scissors. To your astonishment, she snips off a piece of her fur! She looks down at you:<br>\r\n\"I have got to put this on you Keane.\" She starts to twist the strands of fur and loop it.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you call up to her, bewildered. She pauses and looks back down at you, a strange light in her eye:<br>\r\n\"You have to wear this; It will identify you as being with me. Wolves will smell  it and leave you alone.\" She may have said \"being\" but you know you heard \"belonging\" in her voice. You shake your head:<br>\r\n\u201cMolly, I don't want to wear that. Can't we just leave it?\" You plead with her. Molly looks at you and sighs:<br>\r\n\"Look Keane, you have to wear this or I can't safely go out with you. Come on, It's not so bad and I can show you stuff once we're out.\" You two look at each other for a moment, locking gazes. There is compassion and sorrow in her yellow eyes, but iron resolve as well. You are reminded of the incident the night before. The staring contest goes on for a moment longer, but then you sigh and look away. Molly crosses her paws on the table and puts her head down on them. This gives you a face-to-face view of her immense head, her long snout bringing her nose to a foot or so away. You look at her and she talks to you:<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m sorry Keane, but it has to be done.\" She is pleading with you. She could easily force you, but she wants you to trust her. You look back at her, staring into the depths of her yellow eyes:<br>\r\n\"Isn't there any other way?\" You ask her. A look of annoyance crosses her face and she lifts her head a little:<br>\r\n\"Would you prefer I pee all over you?\" Your head snaps up in shock:<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" you yell. The annoyed look is still there, but she patiently explains:<br>\r\n'That\u2019s the other way I could mark you. You would definitely smell like met then. If you prefer that...' She reaches her paw towards you.<br>\r\nYou shake your head franticly:<br>\r\n\"Molly, wait, that won't be necessary. Molly? MOLLY?!\" Molly stops her paw and picks up the fur. She reaches over to you and wraps it around your neck. It is entirely too much like a collar for your liking, but it is better than having her piss on you! She finishes tying it on and looks back down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sees that you are looking up at her in fear and a look of remorse crosses her face:<br>\r\n\"Oh Keane.\" She puts her paw down beside you. You look at it for a moment, considering, than decide to trust her. You climb onto her pad and sit down, looking up at Molly. She brings you to her face:<br>\r\n\"Keane, I'm so sorry I scared you. I should have thought about how you felt. Pleas forgive me.\u201d The pleading in her voice makes you guilty. It is necessary, after all, and she has been so nice to you. Why are you making her so sad? You look at her:<br>\r\n\u201dMolly, bring me closer please.\u201d She looks at you, startled, but complies. She brings her paw up to her massive snout. You are presented with a gray wall of fur. You walk over to it and hug her, burying yourself into her fur. It is warm and soft against your exposed skin. You stand there in darkness, pressed up against her face. Yu can feel some of her soft skin below her fur and enjoy the moment content. Molly presses you into her skin, cuddling you back. You wait there for a perfect moment, enjoying how you feel for each other. All too quickly it passes. She flexes her arm a little and you back out of her fur. You are surprised to see she is crying. You notice you are too. A great tear slides out of her right eye. You walk over and scoop it off her fur. It is warm and salty, and it flows out of your arms down to her pad. You both sniff and she returns you to the front of her face. She uses a claw from her other paw to gently wipe a tear from your own face. You both stay there for a moment. Then you wipe your eyes and she wipes hers, sniffing a little:<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Keane\u201d Happiness fills her voice and an enormous smile appears on her face.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, thank you Molly. For everything.\u201d You smile at each other for a while, than she\u2026</span></div></div>",

Anyway, let\u2019s eat some breakfast.\" She walks into the kitchen and heads over to the fridge. She opens the door and walks in. It is even colder than you remember it and you start shivering immediately. She notices this and quickly gets some ham, eggs and milk, than exits. She heads over to the stove and gets out two pans. She turns on the stove and cracks the eggs into one pan, and puts the ham in the other. Soon, the scent of frying food wafts out. You are standing near the stove, watching as the enormous pans cook. Suddenly, the grease from the ham pops and a bit of grease hits you arm. You grab it as fire shoots up, it is incredibly painful. Molly quickly grabs you and lifts you too her face. She licks your arm, her tongue soothing and cool on the burned area. She looks at you in concern:<br>\r\n\"Be careful Keane!\" She sets you down on the countertop, well away from the pans. She finishes, than picks up a plate. She puts all the food on it and pours some milk in a tall glass. She reaches over and puts you on her plate. This time she is careful to keep you away from the food. She sits down with a knife and fork. She cuts you some ham and eggs, carefully scooting it over to you.<br>\r\n\"Keep away from the food, please. We can't have you smelling like grease this early!\" She giggles, remembering what you looked like the day before. You both dig in. You finish long before she does. You wait for her to finish. She takes a long gulp of the milk. You call up to her:<br>\r\n\"Can I have some milk please?\" She looks at you and considers the glass. She puts you on the table and carefully tips the glass over until the remains of the milk were lapping just in front of you. You take some in your hand and drink it. You drink a lot then step back. She grins at you, than finishes the rest in one gulp. She puts it on the plate and carries it over to the sink, then comes back to the table. She goes over to the cabinet and takes out a pen. She also takes a large amount of string and sticks it in the back pocket of her shorts. She comes over to the table and leaves a note. You can't read what it says, it is written in another language. It has lots of straight lines and few curves. Before you can read any more, she picks you up again and walks out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe early morning air is very cool, Goosebumps form on your skin and you rub your arms. Molly looks at you:<br>\r\n\"Cold?\" she asks<br>\r\n\"Kind of.\" You are actually glad of the collar; Molly's soft fur is keeping your neck warm. It\u2019s the only part that feels adequately covered. She walks down the nearly empty sidewalk. Most wolves seem to be asleep. You realize that you are in a small town; you walk past small shops and the town hall. Everything is covered in that strange wolven script. You also pass a church, although it is only recognizable by the bell. It is (proportionately) small and has a rather primitive architecture. You look up at Molly:<br>\r\n\"Don't you have to go to church?\" You ask her. She looks down, startled:<br>\r\n\"No, why should we? Church around here is attended by only a few; religion is not a high priority. It only has a few truly faithful.\" You are intrigued. You tell her about how you have to go to church on your world; Molly seems intrigued and asks you more. You tell her about different religions, divisions, and all the other weird things that go on. It is a pleasant way to pass the time as she heads out of town. She seems to be having a hard time holding her paw steady, you are shaking. Finally you come to a woods off the highway. Molly is about to go into them. She stops and looks down. You are shivering from the cold, rubbing warmth into your limbs:<br>\r\n\"Keane, you look like your freezing. Also, I'm going to need that paw. Want to go in that warm place?\" She giggles and points to her breasts. You look up at her and say...</span></div></div>",

Molly presses her hand down into the material and places you near her nipple. She grins down at you and closes her shirt. The tight material quickly presses you into her breast. IT is really tight, you find it difficult to work your way up to the nipple. You manage though, and you start squirming until she gets hard. Molly laughs, then moans as you wiggle and squirm on that sensitive area. She pets you through her top and sets off on the path. At first, everything goes well. She walks for about ten minutes. You are pressed into her breast and feel them jiggle with her steps. You burst into a fit of squirming every so often, giving her some pleasure. Than she starts jogging. Her breasts start jiggling violently, carrying you up and down, up and down. The material of her top starts making it hard for you to breathe, movement starts making you feel like you are being pummeled. You get nauseous, nearly ready to hurl. Molly doesn't seem to notice. You start to pound on her nipple, emitting muffled cries through the fabric. The nausea starts to get worse, and you start to run out of air. Molly keeps jogging.

She pulls you out and snaps her tap back in place. You lie on your back, exhausted and gasping for breath. She examines you worriedly:<br>\r\n\"Keane, Keane, are you all right?\" she asks you, her warm breath rolling over your body. You start to breathe more normally and wearily sit up. Molly\u2019s nose is inches from your body, exhaling warm, wet breath onto you. She is v very concerned:<br>\r\n\"Keane, say something, please!\" You manage to gasp out:<br>\r\n\"Molly I'm fine, really.\" She sags with relief and gently cuddles you. You just sit there, grateful for the rest. She moves back and looks down at you:<br>\r\n\"Well, let\u2019s not try that again. I could have really hurt you!\" You nod your head at her:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's nice in there and all, but only when walking. It's a good thing you heard me!\" Molly nods:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I had thought that you were still playing around, but than I started hearing your calls and figured it out. Anyway, I'm glad you\u2019re OK. Do you want to go on?\" You consider it. She would probably be more careful now, and there really was nothing else to do. You nod at her:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just not back in thee.\" Molly nods<br>\r\n\"You can ride on my shoulder! Hold on, I have to rig something up.\" She sets you down at her feet and reaches into her pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there and just watch her figure. She really is gigantic! She towers over you, blotting out the sky. You look at her feet. They are two pads at the bottom of a slanted incline, all covered in fur. The pads are smaller than a human foot, but your not even tall enough to reach where her feet slant into her leg! You are about as big as the pads resting on the ground, though. Molly squats down, her massive crotch coming into view. You look up past it. Molly has attached the string from the kitchen to her neck. The loop itself is buried in her fur, but the string extends out and comes down halfway into her breasts. She picks you up and you look at her:<br>\r\n\"What's that for?\" you ask her<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s for riding on my shoulder.\" She replies. She ties the string around your stomach and sets you on her shoulder. She stands back up and starts to walk through the forest again. On her shoulder, you have a great profile view of her head, her snout going forward, ended by her nose. Her mouth is on the bottom. You can see that she has you in the corner of her eye. You are still mystified about this thing around your waist, however:<br>\r\n\"Why do I need this thing to ride on your shoulder?\" you ask her. She turns her head slightly, letting her see you in full. She grins, the side of the mouth showing teeth. She doesn't reply however, and turns back to face the path. You frown: \"Molly...\" That\u2019s as far as you get as she comes to an abrupt halt. You overbalance and fall off her shoulder. You plummet down, looking as the ground starts getting closer until: BOING. The string goes taught and you bounce up and down a little, before you settle down just over her right breast. You look up to see Molly grinning down at you:<br>\r\n\"That\u2019s what. Did you enjoy the trip?\" She chuckles to herself. You try to get used to the twisting motion of the string, but it is in vain. You look expectantly up at her, but she shakes her head:<br>\r\n\"Come on Keane, we can't get back underway without you up here!\" You obviously won't get much help from her. You mutter to yourself and start climbing the line. It is very difficult, Molly moves every once in a while and makes you lose your grip once or twice. Eventually...</span></div></div>",

Ready to do it again?\" You look up in her in shock and objections are forming before she laughs \"I was just kidding, don't worry. I'll help you next time. Ready to get a move on?\" You look at her and nod. She nods back and moves forward. You keep your balance this time, and watch as the forest moves past. The trees are gargantuan, there size just to massive to comprehend. The sun filters through the leaves, casting enormous pillars of light which Molly walks through. She looks at you:<br>\r\n\"I've got to run now, you ready?\" You nod back at her:<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" She starts moving faster, building up speed. At one point you fall off her shoulder again. She does not even slow, she lets you bounce against her chest for a moment or so before reaching up with a paw, grabbing you and unceremoniously dumping you back on her fur covered shoulder. She really lets loose then. The wind rushes past you as Molly runs at what for her is an easy pace, but for you is a screaming wind. You get colder still, and you look around for some warmth. Molly's neck is covered with a lot of fur, you crawl over and settle in among it. Here her fur is puffed out, and provides excellent cover for you as Molly rushes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peer through the fur as Molly continues to run. You are warm at the moment, and you relax and enjoy the view. Trees rush pass, you watch in awe as these monoliths are left behind. The forest is totally untamed; Molly frequently has to go around logs in the way. There is definitely no path here. You pass through meadows and under trees, nature continuing her seasons. The rough beauty enamors you as you observe this enormous world. You look down once and see the forest floor flying past under Molly's feet; you seem almost to be flying. You feel remember the firmness of her stomach and her legs, the muscular shape. Also, there were those medals on the walls. She must run all the time, keeping in shape and enjoying the wind blowing past. You fall into the rhythm as well, shifting your body to the roll of her shoulders. This is wonderful, you realize. There can be nothing better than this, sitting on her shoulder and gazing out at the beauty rushing past. Suddenly, Molly calls out:<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" you look out to the front. Rapidly approaching is a gorge, entirely too wide for your liking, and Molly is rushing straight for it! She intends to jump it! She lets loose everything at this point, even as you jump to your feet and scream: \u201cMolly, Wait!\" Molly does not listen to you. She rushes to the gap, bunches her muscles and LEAPS! You lose your balance and fall backwards this time. You come to the end of the string between her shoulder blades and look down the gorge at the river that seems hundreds of miles below you, terrifying beyond all measure. You yell as Molly...</span></div></div>",

Your breath is coming in gasps; it was the most terrifying thing you had ever been through! You are between Molly's shoulder blades as she twists her head, her back muscles respond to the movement:<br>\r\n\"Keane?\" she wonders as she sees the empty shoulder. She feels the string and the weight still attached to it. She reaches back with her paw and covers you. She pulls you back up to her shoulders. She is breathing heavily, but she is grinning like a madman. You slowly get very angry as she turns her head towards you:<br>\r\n\"So, what did you think?\" You feel your rage hit the boiling point. You open your mouth and start to shout at the top of your lungs:<br>\r\n\"YOU IDIOT! YOU COULD HAVE KILLED US BOTH! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING! WERE YOU EVEN THINKING? HOW COULD YOU HAVE POSSIBLY HAD...\" You rant for a while as Molly flinches at the sound of your voice. You are shouting as loud as you possibly can, and you are situated very near her incredibly sharp wolf ears. Her expression turns guilty, than mortified as you pace her shoulder, wave your arms and continue to shout:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually:<br>\r\n \"Keane...\" she says in a small voice. You ignore her and continue to rant. She tries again, a little louder:<br>\r\n\"Keane, look...\" you just keep yelling at her. Eventually she turns her head as much as possible, nearly right at you, and bellows:<br>\r\n\"KEANE!\" Her mouth is fully open, her nose curled into a snarl, giving you a direct view of her very sharp teeth and the back of her throat. You are knocked backwards, partially by the force of the shout and partially by the look on her face. Your lungs can possibly hope to beat her in a shouting contest. You wave your arms in the air, and then you slump down onto her shoulder:<br>\r\n\"What?\" you demand, still very mad at her, but you know that she'll just shout you down if you continue. She looks at you and relaxes her face:<br>\r\n\"Look Keane, I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd take it so badly. It was just a nice opportunity, you know. No, wait, let me finish,\" she adds with a glare as you open your mouth to respond, \"I\u2019m really sorry, but I was caught up in the moment and it really wasn't that long a jump! I mean, it didn't look it...\" She trails off at the less thank convinced look on your face.<br>\r\n\"It didn't look that short to me, and I was looking down over the jump! Tell me, have you ever jumped something that long before?\" you demand at her with a glare. She slowly shakes her head. You groan, roll your eyes heavenward and bury your face in your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly hesitantly touches you, and you lean into her paw. Encouraged, Molly starts petting you gently. You let her, glad of the reassurance after that ordeal. Molly picks you up and holds you in front of her, the string slack. She pets you softly:<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry Keane; it must have been so scary!\" You nod at her and look at her for a moment. Than you sigh and look at her neck. She puts you there and you hug her, burying yourself in her warm fur. Then you back off and look up at her again:<br>\r\n\"Please, just don't do it again!\" she nods and starts walking again. She is silent for a moment, but then she gets a sly look in her eye and starts grinning again:<br>\r\n\"It was fun though, wasn't it?\" There is a falsely innocent quality to her voice. You narrow your eyes at her and she smiles playfully. Then you roll your eyes again and reply:<br>\r\n\"Yes Molly, in its own heart stopping, brain freezing, terrifying way it was fun. Don't do it again!\" You feel the need to repeat that. She walks for a few moments until...</span></div></div>",

She just stands there as you try to comprehend the view, mouth open in shock. The cliff is a sheer face standing 1000 feet over the plain below it. To you, this is around 5 miles! You can barely grasp the enormity of it. It just looks unreal. The plain spreads out away from the mountains, fading into the distance. There is a city at the base of the mountains, several roads that look like tiny lines on a map heading into it. The tallest buildings don't come quarter as high as the cliff does, none higher that 25 stories, you realize. There are cars too, miniscule dots along the roads of the city and plain. The suburbs spread out from the city some, but not very far compared to the awesome emptiness of the grassland in front of you. You continue to stare for a while, and then you look at Molly. She is looking at you through the corner of her eye, waiting to see your reaction. You just stare at her in astonishment before managing to squeak out:<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" She grins at you:<br>\r\n\"Nice view, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly\u2019s opposite paw comes to her shoulder. You jump in and she extends you out. It doesn't change the view much, but it helps her point. \"This is the Hrawl plain, at the base of the Grond Mountains.\" She moves her arm in a sweeping gesture, indicating the whole plain. \"It extends for about 200 miles from this range, before it meets the ocean. The city below is Rickly, and it is also our destination.\" You try to cope with the numbers. To her the plains might be 200 miles, but you are much smaller and distances are much bigger. You think about the mind blowing numbers, but it gives you a pounding headache and you stop. Molly goes on \"Over there is the road leading from our town.\" She moves her paw to the left and points with one claw. You see a small road emerging from the base of the range, a tiny gray line. It comes out a mile or two the left and, obviously, a thousand feet down. Slowly you turn around; you cannot cope with anymore of these inconceivable distances. Molly grins down at you:<br>\r\n\"I come this way for the view, its great don't you think?\" She looks down at you questioningly. You think about it. It may be a nice view, but it is highly intimidating to you. You shrug and look up at her:<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\" She raises the fur above her eye in question, so you go on \"It is just so... big.\" That was the understatement of the century. \"Big\" did not cover it. Molly looks at you, a bit puzzled, than understanding dawn in her eyes:<br>\r\n\"I guess it would be, for you. Anyway, let's get going.\" you nod and she puts you back on her shoulder and walks back into the treelike, taking you away from that confusing view. She breaks back into a jog, then into a run. The air is still cold, so you burrow back into her fur, thinking about what you just saw. Thoughts of it boil and churn in your mind. Eventually you shrug it off. It would be there whether you like it or not, so you should just accept it. You go back to looking at the forest and mountains, while rolling with the motion of Molly's shoulder. There are worse things to do, you think. Finally, she gets to the bottom...</span></div></div>",

You thought that she would just cut them off with her claws. The unties it around her nexk to, than sticks it in her pocket. Then she looks back at you:<br>\r\n\"Got the collar on?\" she obviosly isn't pretending anymore about what it really is. You nod a bit sullenly. \"Good. Time to go.\" She walks to the suburbs. You finger the collar. It really isn't uncomftorable, and it helped keep your nexk warm in the mountains, but it is still humiliating. Molly reaches the sidwalk and goes into town. The suburbs are a bit different from what your used to. First, they are enourmous! Well, at least to you. Also, the houses are not very close packed. Each house has a lot of land between it and it's neibors. They also bear no similarity to each other, like on earth. Each house seems to be constructed individually, with no thought to any of the others. It is different, but it looks somewhat appealing. Uniforrmity is boring, this makes each house individual. You comment on the size of the plots to Molly, who nods: \"We aren't as crowded as you are on earth, not so overpopulated. Also, we have different views on land than you do.\" She stops with this weird comment, and you et it go. You pass people now,, little kids drawing on the sidewalk, adults with errands and many other people. They usually ignore Molly, but the people who look at her glance at you, huddled in her paw. It is very intimidating to be under the eye of so many giants. They all note your collar before going on with their buisness. You finally reach the city. Where is Molly headed?</span></div></div>",

It does not, however, have smog. You are very grateful for this; you don't think you could have handled it at your size. You look up at Molly:<br>\r\n\"Where are we headed?\" you ask her. She looks down at you and smiles. It is very unsettling, you can't recall where but you have seen it before:<br>\r\n\"To the mall, it's time to shop!\" You grow a little apprehensive. You recognize the look, you've seen it on those crazy girls with the \"Shop till you drop\" policy. This could get ugly, you think. She finally reaches a large parking lot. In front of you is the mall. It is gigantic. Five stories tall, extending ten city blocks on all sides. Your eyes have trouble comprehending the reality of it. To you it looks ten stories tall and a mile long. Molly approaches the entrance, where wolves of all ages were streaming in. Molly packs in with them. You have a little trouble here. On all sides are giant carnivores, many of whom look at you with interest. You shiver as you look up at all of them. You are surrounded by them, monoliths rising up on all sides. The moment passes as Molly gets inside and away from the crowd. She looks down at you in concern: \"You okay?\" You nod at her and smile weakly:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's just that you\u2019re all so big!\" She gives you a half smile and pets you, then walks on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she heads for one of the escalator, there is suddenly a howl. It's not very loud, but it is obviously to catch Molly's attention. You look over. A group of teenage wolves, boys from their appearance, are staring quite openly at Molly's workout outfit. They make a few comments that you can't hear, but Molly's sharp hearing easily comprehends. She gives them a look of pure disgust and walks onto the escalator. The wolves make several more comments, probably about her form fitting shorts, and Molly shakes her head. \"Jerks.\" She mutters. You look up at her:<br>\r\n\"Who were they?\" She looks down at you, startled. She must have briefly forgotten about you when looking at the boys:<br>\r\n\"Oh, their just some morons from school. They actually think we like that.\" She obviously means the other girls from school, you realize. She keeps speaking \"Anyway, here we are.\" You look over. Molly is entering a small shop on the third story. IT is rather secluded from the main corridors, and was small and tightly packed. The merchandise drew your attention, though. There were tons of dollhouses, dolls, clothes and just about everything else. There were a few other things to, like board games and trains. Everything was expertly constructed by someone who new a lot about making things that size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly walks onto the counter and puts you down. It is rather dimly lit, so you have to squint for a moment before you see the wolf, which is hidden in the silvery light. He is small, smaller than Molly. He has spectacles no his long snout, and his fur looks badly cared for. His claws, however, draw your attention. They are expertly sharpened, honed to razor points. They are well cared for, and you realize with a flash of insight that this must be the maker of all the merchandise. His hands and claws look dexterous, and there is a workbench behind the counter. You get an even better view of his claws as his paw comes down a little to close to you on the counter. From this distance you can see that they are gleaming and sharp. He studies you for a moment, than speaks: \"Hello. It has been a long time since I have had customers in my store, and even longer since I had a human here. What's your name?\" His voice is rough and quiet, his voice hesitant. He must not get out much, you muse. You also notice something of a country accent.<br>\r\n\"I'm Keane.\" you reply. He nods, satisfied. He looks up at Molly:<br>\r\n\"So, what did you have in mind, young lass? Mind you, I hope your tastes are a bit more... gentle, than others. I don't sell those kinds of things.\" His voice sounds both questioning and faintly accusing. Molly bristles, her fur standing out, and her face curls into a snarl.<br>\r\n\"I assure you sir; I am not here for that. I wouldn\u2019t even think of...\" He waves his paw at her:<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine. I'm sorry if I sounded judgmental, it\u2019s just that when I advertised that I made human things, some people came here with the mistaken Idea that I made torture devices. So, now that that's out of the way, what are you here for?  My names Spencer, by the way\" His tone has gotten friendlier, and his face has come out of the shadows. He turns on an overhead light, which brightens the small shop considerably. Molly relaxes and responds:<br>\r\n\"Keene needs clothes, he only had one set. I made him these.\" She gestures towards you. Spencer scrutinizes you closely. You back up nervously as he brings his face within inches of your body. He looks back up at Molly:<br>\r\n\"This is interesting work. Very rudimentary stitching, but innovative design. Well done.\" Molly looks both pleased and embarrassed at the same time. Spencer goes on:<br>\r\n\"If you would be so kind as to bring him here, please.\" He stands up and lifts up the bar on the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly picks you up and carries you to the worktable behind it. Spencer removes all the junk, than pulls it out. Molly sets you down. It is perfectly smooth and smells strongly of cleaning fluid. Spencer turns off the overhead lights and turns on a series of lights. They all point to you and you are momentarily blinded. When you can see again, Spencer and Molly are no more then enormous shadows. Spencer leans in closer, a notebook in hand. The index claw on his right paw has a tip on it, like a pencil. IT must be how they write, you think. He starts scratching in the notebook, muttering to himself:<br>\r\n\"Male, obviously. E stock perhaps. Female owner. Gray fur. Yes yes, matching.\" He keeps up this incomprehensible muttering as he studies you, his claw scratching furiously. He has you turn several times, than gets a string and measure you quickly. Finally, he turns off the lights and turns to Molly:<br>\r\n\"Back in a moment.\" He goes into the back and gets a box to put on a counter. He also goes through the store, collecting things. Molly picks you up and sets you back on the counter and goes in front again. Spencer finishes and sits back down. He spreads some stuff out. There are clothes for all ages, occasions and peculiarities. Running clothes, tuxedo's casual, just about everything, even shoes. They are separated into two piles, you notice. Spencer speaks:<br>\r\n\"The ones on the left are made for humans, the ones on the right for dolls. I'm not sure how the doll clothing will fit, but the human clothing should work.\" You look at it all, starting with the shoes. You manage to find several pairs that fir, and set them aside. Socks are easy to. Molly has a large assortment of clothes by then:<br>\r\n\"Try these on.\" You look up at her.<br>\r\n\"Right here?\" You manage to whisper. Spencer chuckles. He reaches under the counter and pulls out a box. It has a door and several wires in it. He sets it on the counter:<br>\r\n\"You can change in here.\" Molly quickly sorts out the stuff she wants you to try on. You go in with the first set. It is plain t-shirt and shorts, with underwear to you immense relief. It fits perfectly. You go out and look at them. Molly nods at you, and then presents the next set. You groan, than go back in. You hear Spencer chuckle behind you. These don't fit, and are discarded. You try on a lot of clothes, some of which don't fit, some of which you have arguments with Molly about. An especially memorable reject was a bathing suit, which you flatly refused to get in. Molly objected, but you held your ground stubbornly. Spencer looked on, amused. Finally, you had everything you wanted. It looked like a veritable mountain of clothing to you, but Molly looks a bit disappointed at the amount. Spencer carefully stores it in a bag, a small bag. Molly pays him, signing a piece of paper it had. You thank Spencer, who smiles:<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. If you need something else, do come back.\" You both Nod at him, than head out from the store with you on Molly's pad. Molly emerges into the hallway and heads for...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Molly heads for the food court. She goes down two escalators until she reaches the ground floor. The food court is circular, with food shops on all sides. Molly heads for the line. She picks up a tray and sets you down on it. It has raised portions, like tiles all over it. You look up at Molly, who is studying the various signs, which you can't read. She looks down at you:<br>\r\n\"Want anything in particular?\" she asks. You respond:<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go through the line and see?\" Molly nods and puts you down on the metal slider. The uneven sliding motion quickly lands you on your butt. Molly giggles as she keeps pushing. You slide around on the tray as she keeps going. There are several shops. The first one serves raw meat, which you quickly decline. Even the faint odor makes you nauseas. Molly keeps going. There is a fried food place, with wings and drumsticks from some type of bird. You point to it and Molly reaches over and puts it next to you. You find it very hard to ignore her breasts, which are pretty much directly above you. You get hot looking. Molly notices to, she giggles and smiles down at you. You keep going. The people behind you have a small girl, who keeps glancing at you in interest, making you nervous. One time she reaches over the tray and you scoot back as her arm passes overhead. Eventually you reach the end of the line with some cheese, soda, fried bird and another meat you can't identify. Molly takes the tray through the crowded hall. The place is packed; you look in awe at the enormous wolves eagerly chowing down. It makes you glad you have Molly with you; this place definitely isn't for unowned humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Molly sits down behind one of the pillars, giving you some privacy. You look up at her:<br>\r\n\"What bird is this?\" you ask her. Molly looks down and replies:<br>\r\n\"Chicken.\" The birds here must be bigger than those on earth, you think. Molly begins to eat ravenously; she had been running and hadn't eaten for hours. She barely notices you, and you are very hungry. You build up your courage and ask:<br>\r\n\"Uh, Molly?\" Molly pauses and eyes you for a moment. She puts a little cheese, meat and a chicken bone beside you. All of it had been eaten by her already. You try to get around your distaste and eat the meat and cheese. You are still ravenous, you hadn't eaten for a long time and she didn't give you all that much. You walk over to the chicken bone, which is taller than you IT is wet and slimy, Molly had already put it in her mouth. She had also cracked it open to get at the marrow. You see a clinging piece of meat and grab it. It is slipery with saliva, you shudder as you touch it. But you are very hungry. You pull it off and eat it. It is well cooked, but you can taste Molly's saliva on it. You are really hungry and keep going. You find pieces of meat molly had missed, getting greasy and soaked in spit in the process. You climb into the bone and get some marrow out. Suddenly, the bone tips up and you slide out. Molly had picked it up and sent you plummeting to the table. She picks up the bone and sticks her tongue in, getting the last morsels. Molly has finished by now. The meal has made you thirsty, however:<br>\r\n\"Molly, can I get something to drink?\" You ask this a bit nervously. She looks down and smiles:<br>\r\n\"Of course Keane. Here\" She opens the lid to the soft drink and suddenly picks you up. She drops you into the fluid. You panic a little as you fall and start to flail about. You struggle to the surface. You hear a giggle above you. You see Molly looking down at you from above:<br>\r\n\"Come on, drink up!\" She is grinning. You glare up at her, but drink some. The soda is very good, but you can't identify what it is. Molly picks up your soaked body and carefully sets you down on the tray, than gulps the rest of the drink. You shiver, the air is cool and your wet clothes have started to hug your body. Molly picks you up than dumps the tray in the garbage. She looks down at you:</span></div></div>",

You feel a bit of dread and anticipation. You have never been in a girl\u2019s bathroom before, but this one will be gigantic. She reaches a side hallway and walks to two doors. One has a female wolf, the other a male. You have a bit of trouble seeing which one is which. Molly enters the left-hand door. It is a single toilet bathroom, which is strange for a mall this size. Molly locks the door and walks over to the sink. She puts you in it, close to the drain on its curved walls.. She puts the bag up on the rim and looks down at you:<br>\r\n\"No peaking!\" she orders sternly. She has a serious expression, so you agree. As she turns, you say:<br>\r\n\"Uh, Molly? I need some new clothes, these are soaked.\" Molly turns again and looks down again, than grins. She digs through the bag and gives you some underwear, long pants and shirt. The shirt and pants are dull white. You remember Spencer mentioning Molly\u2019s gray fur, this must be why. The colors suited your collar perfectly. You look up. Molly hasn't moved, she is looking down with a smile on her face:<br>\r\n\"Go on.\" she urges. You hesitate for a moment, than shrug. Why should you care, she bathed you yesterday. Nevertheless, you quickly get out of the soaked clothes, dry your skin with them and quickly put the others on without looking up. When you finish, you look up and see Molly's grin. She smiles at you, than turns away from the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Molly walk over to the toilet. You hear her pull down her pants and try to imagine what she looks like, but your fantasy is stopped when you hear the streaming sound of Molly peeing. You still remember the threat from the morning. You tug at your collar absently, which is useless. It does not budge. You sigh and consider yourself. You\u2019re tiny in this world, living at the whim of your owner. Molly may be nice, but she could have a serious mood swing. You hear the splashing in the distance and shudder, not thinking about it. You feel the cold surface of the sink under your feet and realize you are not wearing shoes. You haven't actually done so all day, you hadn't been wearing them when you had been transported, what seems like a lifetime ago. You tried on several pairs of shoes, but can't remember if Molly actually bought them. You laugh to yourself softly. What did you need shoes for? You had been standing on Molly's shoulder or on a table or in a sink all day. None of it hurt your feet. Still, you resolve yourself to toughen your feet. While you are thinking about it, you decide that you need to go yourself. You quickly go over and pee into the drain, thankful that you don\u2019t have to go #2. You hear Molly flush the toilet, than stand up. You scramble up the sink, a difficult task for you. When you reach the top, Molly is walking over. She looks at you:<br>\r\n\"I said no peaking!\" she tells you, her voice mock-stern.<br>\r\n\"I didn't!\" you protest.<br>\r\n\"Really? I thought you would, boys always seem to want to look. Thanks Keane.\" She smiles down at you and pets you with one claw. She reaches over and turns on the sink. You watch the seeming tons of water pound into the place where you just were, trying not to think about what would happen if you were there now. Molly washes her hands, than dries off and turns off the sink. You hadn't gotten very wet, just a light splattering when Molly flapped her paws. Molly grabs the bag, than you and heads out the door.

You see many massive bags filled with purchases, building sized to you with giant log's you can't decipher. Molly looks at her mom:<br>\r\n\"Hi mom!\" she says brightly as she sits down. She carefully puts the purchase on her lap and sets you on the table. Her paw remains where it is as you get off. Billy looks up briefly at you and Molly, who raises his eyebrows at him. He looks away and goes back to scarfing his food as fast as he can. Her mom spare's a glance for you, than looks up at Molly:<br>\r\n\"Did you have a nice run?\" she asks her. Molly nods enthusiastically:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we had lots of fun!\" You notice that Molly's mom was pointedly referring to Molly in singular, while Molly was using a broad plural. You smile to yourself, Molly certainly knows how to deal with her mom, you think. Molly and her Mom chat about their purchases while Billy finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he is done, Billy still looks hungry. He looks up at his mom:<br>\r\n\"Mom, can we...?\" Billy's mom interrupts:<br>\r\n\"No dear, that's enough. Come on, it's time to go.\" Molly stands up first. Her mom takes one look at her outfit and rolls her eyes heavenward:<br>\r\n\"Molly, I know it's comfortable but couldn\u2019t you wear something less... skimpy?\" Her tone suggests that she is trying to use a mild work for an outrageous item. Molly shakes her head:<br>\r\n\"No mom, these are great for running. Besides who would notice in here?\" She's right, you think to yourself. All of the girl wolves hear are wearing revealing outfits and flirting with boys. At least Molly dresses this way practically, you think a bit petulantly. Her mom lifts her arms, exasperated:<br>\r\n\"Fine, I\u2019ll just let my daughter run around half-naked all the time for the sake of running.\" You note the sarcastic emphasis on the word. Molly nods:<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom!\" You chuckle to yourself, thinking about the sarcastic way Molly responded. Touch\u00e9, you think. However, Wolves have very good hearing and Molly's mom's head swivels down towards you with a mix of annoyance and... Something else, on her face. She raises a wolfish eyebrow at you. You back down nervously. Definitely not a good idea to try to stare down her, you think. Molly's Mom stands up. <br>\r\n\"Come on you two, time to go. And help me carry this stuff!\" Molly sighs and picks up two enormous bags in one paw, than grabs your clothes and holds out that paw to you. You jump on and Molly lifts you to stomach level.<br>\r\n\"Where'd you park?\" Molly asks her.<br>\r\n\"Two blocks over at the west entrance.\" Molly nods and starts walking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she gets out of her Mom's sight however, she immediately puts the bags on the ground and brings you up to her neck:<br>\r\n\"Keane, if you don't mind...\" You nod, even though she can't see it, and jump on. You quickly brace yourself on her fur as she leans over and picks them up. She grunts a little as she keeps walking, a bag in each hand. You cling to her neck for dear life as she walks. The bags have made her usually smooth gate bumpy and uneven, and you nearly fall as she stumbles once. She straightens herself quickly, however and keeps going. She is panting a little by the time she gets to the car, green short at the end and expanding into a bigger space at the trunk. She puts the bags down quickly and opens the trunk. She puts them in and closes the trunk. She straightens out and stretches her back, which nearly makes you fall the OTHER way. Molly sees this out of the corner of her eye and offers you her paw. you gratefully leap on. She then raises you to her face:<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Her breath smells like fried chicken.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, those bags must have been heavy!\" She nods in agreement:<br>\r\n\"Very. I wonder what they got. Anyway...\" Molly sits down in the car in the....</span></div></div>",

You notice once again her tight, white top, and more importantly the way her breasts stretch against it. Molly notices you looking and grins:<br>\r\n\"Maybe later, but Mom will be here soon.\" She bounces her knee, which sends you tumbling to the seat outside her legs. You look up but can't see anything except Molly's shorts and legs, a high wall. The seat is leather, and very hot since it's been it has been sitting in the sun. You yelp:<br>\r\n\"Yow!\" and jump onto Molly's leg. Molly leans over:<br>\r\n\"Go on, keep climbing.\" You glance sourly at her, but she just smiles. She is amused by your antics. You climb her leg, using the fur as handholds. Almost immediately Molly yelps and shakes her leg. You tumble back to the blisteringly hot seat. Molly picks you up and dumps you back on her leg:<br>\r\n\"Sorry, you were pulling my fur. It felt like it was coming loose!\" Just than, Billy and their Mom arrive. Billy takes the driver side back seat and their mom sits in the front. She smiles at Molly:<br>\r\n\"Thanks for carrying those, honey. Now put on your seat belts you two.\" Molly complies quietly, but Billy groans as he puts his on. The movement jostles you, but you stay on her knee. Than the car starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It sounds off an incredible roar before subsiding into distant thunder. You are shaken at this, and when the car starts moving you fall off again, but Molly catches you and puts you back on her knee, keeping you there with her paw. She pets you absently as the ride continues. You relax some, than notice Billy is watching you. The look he is giving you is sullen and hungry. You really hope you are never alone with him. Slowly, you inch closer to molly along her leg, until you reach her shorts. You climb onto the thin material around her slightly wider thighs. You can't see Billy and you hope he can't see you. Molly looks down at you questioningly, and you nod towards the back. Molly rolls her eyes. The ride seems to be taking a while, so you decide to whisper. You think it will carry to molly's ears but no one else's:<br>\r\n\"How long is the ride?\" you ask her, a little above your breath. Molly's ears twitch and she looks down from the window. She raises a claw in the half symbol. \"Half an hour?\" you breathe. She nods slightly. You are getting bored with the view, so you ask to get put next to the window. She agrees and lifts you up until you are on the window edge. You look out. The road is passing by below at unimaginable speeds, so you quickly look up. All of the enormous trees, fields and hills are going by quickly, but you can tolerate this view. You admire the clean, rugged landscape. It is much less crowded than earth, you think. Suddenly the car...</span></div></div>",

It knocks the wind out of you, however, and you lie there for a moment. Suddenly, you hear a clicking noise and look up. Billy, o the other side of the car, undid his seatbelt. He lets it slide back, making a sliding noise and makes to start crawling over. You freeze in fear. Your heart pounds in your ear and you find it hard to breath. Not him, you think, anyone but him! You nearly cry in fear he's getting closer, his immense figure filling up your view. You feel a little detached, and whatever part of your brain holds your sense of humor decides to act up. You can almost hear the JAWS music playing in your ears. The small part of your brain still thinking rationally wonders how you can possibly be THAT weird. You start scrambling upwards; the car is still on an incline. You grab carpet fibers and pull yourself up as fast as you can. Billy gets even closer and you know you can't get to the seat in time. You scramble upwards until, suddenly, a paw appears a little ways in front of you.<br>\r\n\"Keane!\" you hear Molly hiss. Billy is really close now, and has started reaching for you. You see hunger and cruel menace lighting his eyes. With what you think of as superhuman speed you climb the next few feet and touch Molly's paw. She stretches and folds her paw around you. You start sobbing in relief, your safe from Billy. You get to molly's face, still breathing heavily, fear still lingering. Behind you, you hear Billy sigh in frustration and hurry back to his seat. Molly strokes you and talks to you:<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" she asks you softly. You look at her. She looks really concerned. You decide this is not the place to talk about Billy.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" you manage, still gasping. Her nose is sniffing you for some reason. She suddenly casts a suspicious glance at Billy, who is innocently looking out the window. You can just see the anger forming on her face. You wave to her and she swivels her head back. You shake your head at her. She cocks her head, and her eyes narrow suspiciously. You just shake your head some more. She puts you back on the seat, but not before giving you a look that informs you that she will talk about this later. This time she stets you on the seat belt, smushing you into her stomach fur. She keeps her paw close to you and casts several suspicious glances at Billy during the ride. It is very hot for you, and you start to sweat. You hope the ride ends soon.

Molly had been keeping you tightly pressed into her fur and it was very hot. Molly opens the door and picks you up. She goes to the trunk and opens it. It is a weird sight, seeing that enormous door open up with a rush of air. Molly takes one of the bags and starts to head into the house. Her mom is waiting by the door with her arms crossed:<br>\r\n\"You wash your paws before you come in here.\" she tells Molly. Molly is taken aback:<br>\r\n\"Mom...\" Her mom interrupts:<br>\r\n\"Don't 'mom' me young lady! You have been running all day. You need to wash your feet!\" You are really glad you are not the subject of her wrath. She is very intimidating, and stands eye to eye with Molly. You realize where Molly's forceful personality came from. Molly rolls her eyes and hands her mom the bag, than heads around to the side of the house. Behind a bush which is taller than Molly's head are several brushes, a basin of water and a small bench. Molly sits down and makes to grab the brushes, than stops. She looks down at you, than raises you to her face:<br>\r\n\"Keane, what happened in the car?\" her breath rolls over you and you blink. You have already resolved to say nothing:<br>\r\n\"Nothing Molly, I just fell.\" Molly gives you a long suffering look:<br>\r\n\"Keane, the fear was rolling off you. I could smell it! in fact, it was so strong I could practically taste it! Now, tell me what happened.\" She says it forcefully, glaring at you. You shiver some, but stand your ground:<br>\r\n\"Nothing happened Molly; it was just a scary fall.\" Molly narrows her eye at you. She lifts you a little above eye level, so you can see her whole face as she speaks:<br>\r\n\"Keane, whaaat haappeeneed?\" She draws out the words, emphasizing every syllable, talking very slowly. You shiver at the command in the voice as she glares at you some more. Your resistance crumbles as she brings you down to chest level to give you a view of her massive snout, and glaring eyes from below. You tell her what happened. She listens to what you say, her face getting angrier and angrier with every word. When you finish she immediately start yelling:<br>\r\n\"Why that little, I'm going to...\" she starts cursing, loudly. You can't understand their meaning but you can understand their intent. You have to cover your ears from the sound of her voice, she is really getting loud. She draws a breath to go on, than sees you holding your ears and stops yelling.<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" you nod at her. She looks mortified, but still very angry \"sorry, I was just so angry. When I get my hands on that squirt I'll...\" she looks ready to start yelling again. You interrupt quickly:<br>\r\n\"Molly, it's okay, just let it go!\" you really don't want to see a showdown. She looks at you, sighs and nods:<br>\r\n\"Okay Keane. I'm sorry he did that. Anyway, I have to wash my feet.\" She picks up one of the brushes, a large one, with her other paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops suddenly, than looks at you. She grins playfully:<br>\r\n\"Would you like to help?\" she asks you with a twinkle in her eye:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" you tell her before you think it through. She grins happily, than selects a smaller brush and soaks it in water. She puts you on her left leg and brings her right paw up on it. She hands you a brush:<br>\r\n\"Be sure to do a good job!\" she says, giggling. You heft the brush. It is hollow, but still heavy. You wonder why you volunteered. You walk down to her paw. There is mud, dirt, rocks and other stuff everywhere. IT seems to be caked on pretty far out. It is rather dry, though. You look up to see Molly leaning over you. She grins and gestures with her paw:<br>\r\n\"Go ahead; it's not getting any cleaner.\" She gives you a shove with her paw. You stumble and end up in front of her paw, which is big and very dirty. You get to work, scrubbing every inch of the paw with Molly looking on. You finish between her toes, utterly exhausted. Her foot is cleaner than it was, but it is still a long way from ready. You feel a tug on the brush and start getting lifted into the air. Startled, you let go and land with a thump on her leg. Molly, seeing that you were wiped, took the brush and is rapidly cleaning her paw, using several other brushes. She does the job easily, much easier than you did, and very quickly. She finishes that paw, than sets you on the other leg while she does her left. You just sit there, your muscles are burning from the exertion required to do that. You are even sweatier now. Molly finishes quickly, than picks you back up and stands up. She grins at you:<br>\r\n\"Thanks Keane.\" You just nod at her. With that, she heads into the house to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Molly heads for her bedroom. When she gets in, the house is pretty quiet, no one is around. She mounts the steps and heads into her bedroom. She sits down on the bed with a sigh, setting the bag on the nightstand. She looks tired, and then lets loose a gigantic yawn; you feel her head is going to crack open.<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" you ask her, concerned. She looks down:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I'll take a nap. She sets you down on the bed, than gets up and locks the door. She heads over to the dresser. You watch her stride around her room from the bed, contemplating her awesome form. It has only been a day, it is still strange to see things happen at such mind boggling sizes. She pulls out an oversized t-shirt and changes into it. You are a bit disappointed; she faces the dresser, giving you a view of her large back. She changes from her shorts to longer, looser ones. You admire her butt, but it is not very fun from this distance, especially when she changes so fast. She pulls the curtain, giving the room a grey dimness if not true darkness.  She comes back to the bed and lies down on top of the covers. She absently picks you up and drops you on her pillow:<br>\r\n\"I'll just sleep for an hour; I've got stuff to do.\" With that, she falls asleep. You sit there, enveloped every few seconds by her warm, regular breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not sleepy; you just sat on her shoulder while she ran. You decide to explore. You slide off the pillow, straight into her arms. You push yourself away from them. You don't think you can climb them without waking her, so you go to the edge of the bed and look down. The floor looks about 50 feet away, and the blankets seem to extend to it. You climb down until you reach the end of the blanket. You miscalculated; you are still a ways from the floor. You are feeling adventurous, so you let go. The wind rushes by you and you hit the floor with a muffled thump. Pain explodes on your back and your breath whooshes out. You lay there for a moment, than you try moving. Nothing seems to be moving, but your back is sore. Wincing slightly, you stand up, resolving to look more carefully next time. You look around. The floor expands around you, several football fields. The legs of the bed are near you, rising into the large expanse under the bed, which is all you can see from down here. You walk across the room, which takes a few minutes. The carpet fibers are short, about to your shin, but it is prickly like long glass on your bare feet and ankles. You have to rub the area several times to get rid of the prickling sensation. You reach her dresser, a massive cliff to you. Its details are rather vague in the bad light, and you can't try climbing it. You consider the crack under it. You kneel down and look in. It is a bit short for you. You stand up and walk to her desk. The legs are all you can see, except for a wire or too running to the wall sockets. You consider climbing them, but they are too thin for some reason. You decide to explore under her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go under. The bed is a massive ceiling, the legs pillars. You see several massive shapes ahead of you. You investigate and find that they are her book bag and other things. You look at the others, several board games, a stray book or two, several containers that you look at with interest. One of them actually has drawers, which you pull out. They don't have anything, but you think you might ask Molly to use it for your clothes. You get bored after a while, all of the objects are written on in Wolfish and you can't see well under here, so you wander out from her bed. You walk towards the opposite wall and turn around. You can see molly's gray, gigantic form rising out from the bed. You can hear her breath, which whistles occasionally but does not snore. You sit down for a moment and consider her. Incredibly attractive, sporty, affectionate, she's all you could ever want in a girlfriend. However, she's your owner, not your girlfriend. Or is she? Also, there<br>\r\nis the problem of her being a giant carnivore and you being a tiny omnivore. You sit there, thinking about it, wrestling with the problem. Your musings are interrupted as Molly yawns, stretches and sits up. She glances down at the bed. She looks around:<br>\r\n\"Keane?\" she calls softly, looking under the covers. She gets off the bed as you stand up and yell:<br>\r\n\"Down here!\"...</span></div></div>",

A shadow falls over and you look up to see his furry butt, falling down on you. He sat on you and left you there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes trapped under the young wolf's butt.

You were thrown around his mouth, being smashed into his cheeks, leaving a visible bulge. Thrust on to his upper pallet and overall slathered in his saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly savored your frail body for several minutes, then he swallowed you slowly. First by positioning your feet at the throat, and swallowing you up to your waist. You could feel him getting up and moving, but sure why. Then your answer came, when he opened his mouth and you saw your reflection in his mouth. He wanted to show you your own misery and death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly made another swallow, by lifting his tongue and taking you down. His tongue lowers again and you can only see your head above his throat. On the inside you can see him smiling evil and lifted up his tongue one final time. Making one last swallow and gulping you down. Your body was being massaged by the throat muscles and touched a tight sphincter. You heard another swallow and the sphincter opened up again to accept you inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter landing in his stomach, you start to beat on his walls, begging to be let out. \"THAT FEEL'S GOOD FOOD, KEEP AT IT FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN.\" His voice is so loud, while your in his stomach. In a few minutes, you feel liquid touching your body and burning your arms. Knowing what was happening next, you fully panicked and started to beat even harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhaustion happened quicker than the burning and you were forced to deal with the pain. Billy's stomach began digestion as.you could feel the burning throughout your entire body. Not knowing how much time had passed, you could only recognize the constant pain, but you knew your flesh had melted leaving your muscles exposed. The smell of blood was strong in his stomach. The next hour was burning pain and constant agony, eventually your faded away and your body finished digesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Billy wakes up and feels presure deep within his bowels, \"Alright food, looks like your ready to come out.\" Billy sat down and spent the next 5 minutes squeezing out your remains. Finally getting up, Billy saw your skeleton lying amongst his crap and decided to humiliate your death further. Holding his dock out, he begins to piss on your skull.

She cocks her head curiously and walks towards you. You crane your neck higher and higher as she crosses the distance between you. She gets even bigger to your POV, towering over you. Soon she is standing right over you, hands on her hips, looking down curiously. You stare up in awe at her figure, you haven't got to see this perspective very much. She squats down, giving you a direct view of her crotch. You wonder if this is deliberate even as you look higher up. She puts an immense paw on the carpet and sits down, causing the floor to shake a little. She sits cross-legged in front of you, which blocks your vision with the gray wall that is her leg. You back up some so that you can see her face, which is staring down at you.<br>\r\n\"How'd you get down here?\" she asks you, curiosity plain on her face. You respond:<br>\r\n\"I climbed down on the blanket.\" She turns her torso for a moment to the bed, than looks back, her eyes narrowed:<br>\r\n\"The blanket doesn't reach the floor\" she states, her eyes curious and a bit worried. You decide you might as well tell her the truth:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was a bit of a drop. Nothing's broken, just a little sore.\" That is a bit of an understatement, your back is still more than \"a little bit\" sore. She is not fooled, but lets it go:<br>\r\n\"Okaaay,\" she says slowly, \"well, anyway I have to do my homework. It's school tomorrow!\" She crawls on her paws to the bed and reaches under. She doesn\u2019t look as awkward as a human would have, you think. She pulls out her backpack and comes back. She dumps the contents on the ground, causing a thud that makes you jump. It is books, paper and school supplies, like any other... 10th grader? You wonder what grade she's in, and her age. You ask:<br>\r\n\"Molly, how old are you?\" She looks up, startled:<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't tell you? I'm 16.\" She arranges her books and lies down on her stomach. She angles herself so that she and her book are facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You watch her open the book and take out a piece of paper. She puts a claw-pencil on and starts to scratch. Curious, you walk over to the book, which comes up to chest level when open. You scramble onto the page. Molly has put her paper on the other. You look down. Lines and lines of Wolfish script flow down the page, punctuated by pictures and maps. You guess that it is history or geography. Suddenly, her claws grab you on the middle and whoosh you over to the paper, where she sets you down gently. It happened at a dizzying speed, so you lose your breath in dizziness for a moment. Than you look up. Molly is staring down at you with a mixture of exasperation and annoyance on her face:<br>\r\n\"Keane, you were standing on the line I was reading.\" You look up at her:<br>\r\n\"Sorry Molly. But you know, you could have asked me to move\" you point out. She looks a bit taken aback:<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Keane.\" You can hear the\u201dbut\u201d in her tone:<br>\r\n\"But...?\" you prompt her. She grins:<br>\r\n\"But I like holding you.\" She informs you with that same playful grin. You consider this. At first you are alarmed, but then you realize, why should you be? You like being held, as long as she isn't rough. You grin back at her:<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Please be a bit gentler next time, though.\" Molly nods happily, than resumes her work. Several minutes pass, during which she moves you down the paper so she can write. Looking at her rapidly pen the lines of Wolfish, you resolve to learn it eventually. It's depressing, not being able to read anything. You stare at her writing, than the book, than you can't resist:<br>\r\n\"Molly, what are you reading?\" She looks down in evident surprise:<br>\r\n\"Oh, this? It's just a chapter on the Puma and Grizzly border clashes.\" She says this, evidently expecting you to understand. You look up at her blankly:<br>\r\n\"The what?\" You ask her in confusion. She looks even more surprised:<br>\r\n\"The Puma and... oh\" Evidently she remembered you don't have a clue about Wolfish history \"you wouldn\u2019t know, would you? I'll read aloud for you. Here.\" She picks you up again with her left paw and puts you back on the page, near the bottom. She than starts to read aloud.</span></div></div>",

You manage to get a picture out of it. One of the continent's of the world was divided up between the Great Cats and the Bears. It is a roughly hourglass-shaped continent, and at the narrow point is a mountain range that divides the continent in half. The Pumas live to the east, the Grizzly Bear's to the west. Whenever war breaks out (as it has frequently) the two sides are the first to attack each other. The Pumas and Grizzlies have developed long lists of grudges, so when the nations as a whole weren't at war, the two sides would still attack each other. It is rather bloody, with neither side gaining anything. Molly finishes her narrative and looks down at you. During the read she has moved you several times to keep reading, and at the moment you are on the lower right page:<br>\r\n\"How was that?\" she asks you. You smile back:<br>\r\n\"Fascinating. It's so cool to hear the history, you know?\" She nods back:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I like this homework. What did you think of the wars?\" She asks this casually, but she is watching you carefully. You answer honestly:<br>\r\n\"I think it's pointless. Why didn't the other Great Cat's or Bear's do anything? It was unnecessary bloodshed.\" She looked rather startled at that:<br>\r\n\"I never thought of it that way. Now that I think of it, they probably could have done something. I'll ask in class.\" You feel a warm glow. Molly is actually taking an opinion you offer with consideration and respect! You smile back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks you up for a moment so she can close the book. She already filled out the paper. You ask her what it was and she speaks while putting it away:<br>\r\n\"It was just a paper for drawing analysis on. I wrote what you said down, for class.\" She grins out you, than gets out the next book. You find out its chemistry and you groan. She looks down curiously:<br>\r\n\"I'm awful at chemistry\" you tell her. She looks surprised:<br>\r\n\"Really? I'm rather good at it.\" She takes out a worksheet and quickly does the assignment with you off the book. You try to follow the material once or twice, but it gives you a headache. You really are bad at chemistry, as your teacher has repeatedly lectured you about. She is good at it, but you can\u2019t decipher the symbols and give up. She finishes, than takes out her geometry with a frown. You perk up at this:<br>\r\n\"I'm better at geometry.\" You inform her. She stops frowning, but still looks rather depressed:<br>\r\n\"Really? Maybe you can help.\" She doesn't sound very confident and you pick up on this:<br>\r\n\"I will, watch and learn!\" You boast boisterously, than go over to the book. You heave yourself onto the page, than set about helping her. Molly gets less dejected with each word, and you quickly help her finish her homework. You request an overhead view several times, which she happily complies with. At the end of it, you're both feeling pleased and Molly immensely grateful:<br>\r\n\"Thanks Keane, I couldn't have done it without you.\" She finishes putting her books away and shoves it aside. She picks you up and stands up. She looks down at you with a playful look in her eye:<br>\r\n\"I think you need a reward so...</span></div></div>",

Then, suddenly, she looks a bit guilty \"I mean, only if you want to. Do you?\" You nod your head up and down as fast as you can. Molly giggles \"Okay, let's go.\" She walks over to the bed and strips you quickly, except for your collar. You stand completely unembarrassed on her paw, you're used to it. She stares down, far down, at you for a moment, appraising your looks. She sets you down on her bed, than grasps her shirt. She slowly works it off, teasing you. You wait impatiently, almost salivating with anticipation. Finally, it's off. Her breasts are as nice as ever, two hills expanding off her massive torso. She drops the shirt casually and lies down on the bed, knocking you over. You stand up. You are next to her stomach. You look farther up along her body, where she is smiling down at you \"Come on, get up there!\" You need no further encouragement. You climb up her fur to her stomach and start walking. You head to her left breast, a silvery hill rising into a pink top. You have a massive hard-on by now, and you scramble up the hill to her nipple. It is already hardening and you throw yourself onto it with wild abandon. You wiggle, suck, rub and do everything else possible to harden it. It does, slowly hardening until it becomes a fist in your gut. Molly can't restrain herself any longer, she is moaning heavily and she picks you up and starts rubbing you all over her nipples, giving you intense pleasure as she rubs your throbbing dick on her right nipple. Eventually, you explode all over her nipple, covering at least the head with your cum, and collapse, utterly exhausted from the experience. Molly looks tired to, you wonder how much pleasure your tiny body could have given her immense one. You lay gasping in between her breasts for a while, as Molly does the same on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Molly recovers first:<br>\r\n\"Keane...\" she says softly, not wanting to startle you. In the dreamy state of the afterglow, you look up at her, giving the unique view of her immense head looking down at you upside down:<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" you reply<br>\r\n\"Was that as good for you as it was for me?\" she asks you, panting a little from the experience. You pretend to consider her question for a while, than smile. You turn over so you're lying on your stomach and respond:<br>\r\n\"Yes, that was great! You were unbelievable!\" She grins:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the white spot on my breast tells me that. However, I do think I need to clean it off. Any ideas?\" She giggles a little, telling you that she already has one in mind. You shake your head and she giggles even louder \"didn't think so, but I have a prefect idea.\" She reaches with her paw and pushes her breast up and leans her head down. Her tongue darts forward to lick all the cum off her nipple. She chops her lips for a moment and looks down at you, mock serious:<br>\r\n\"I do believe that's the best cum I have ever tasted.\" With that, she starts laughing and you join in. It doesn\u2019t last very long, both of you being tired, but it expresses both of your feelings. You both lie there for a few moments, than she starts petting you and you relax some more. She picks you up gently and brings you to her snout, where she nuzzles you and you nuzzle her back. This goes on for quite some time, and when she stops you are both fully recovered. She groans and sits up on the bed, putting you on the nightstand next to your discarded clothes. You scramble into them as she puts her shirt back on. She looks over at you:<br>\r\n\"I think we should unpack all those clothes.\" She tells you. You nod:<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Molly, under the bed is a container with drawers. Why don't we put my clothes in there?\" She considers it and shrugs:<br>\r\n\"Okay Keane, whatever you want.\" She gets down on her knees and reaches under her bed. She sits back down on the bed clutching a black, metal container with, as you said, drawers. She puts it down next to you. It towers over you, about twice your height. You can only reasonably reach the first four drawers of ten, and the fourth is at your neck. Molly giggles and you turn around with your hands on your hips:<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" you demand, even though you know perfectly well what is so funny.<br>\r\n\"You compared to that container.\" She informs you honestly. You roll your eyes at her, but she just grins and fetches the bag. She dumps it all out, making a fair-sized pile of clothes. You immediately start sorting through the pile. Molly, as you suspected, didn't get any of the shoes you put out. You and Molly quickly arrange your clothes to your satisfaction and close the drawers. This is a bit difficult, the drawers are very heavy and it takes some strain to open them. Molly muffles a giggle at this and you glare at her. She just stares back innocently. Once you\u2019re done she picks you up so...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Molly picks you up, closing her claws under you, flipping her hand and opening them, leaving you on her pad. She heads down to the T.V room. Once you're there, you realize how different it is. The T.V is flat-screened and wall mounted. There are a few chairs at one end of the room, but there are various cushions taking up the main floor space. The floor is carpeted, thin and bristly. You've come to notice most carpets here are like that, to keep from catching on wolves' claws. Molly heads to one of the cushions and sits down. She leans back on it, giving her a reclined lying position. She is fairly far away from the screen, but it is still very, very big. There is not very much space on the wall that is not covered by it. You are stunned speechless, jaw dropping, by the sight of it. You look over at Molly. She reaching with her other paw and has grabbed the remote. Turning to you, she notices your expression and grins:<br>\r\n\"Big, isn't it?\" she asks you with an amused chuckle. You dumbly nod your head. She continues:<br>\r\n\"We got that from an uncle, who informed us that we wouldn\u2019t get any more gifts for the next ten years. I don't come in here often; usually Billy has control of it. He is a hopeless addict. He's not here now, though, so I thought we could watch something.\" She looks at you expectantly. After a moment, you manage to stammer out:<br>\r\n\"S-sure Molly, whatever you want.\" She grins at you:<br>\r\n\"That's what I was thinking.\" She reaches with her paw and turns on the T.V. For a couple of milliseconds, you admire the perfect reception, picture and texture of whatever it is she's watching. Than the sound hits you. It feels like a physical blow, banging you on the head. Your brain starts feeling like it will split open, you think your eardrums must have ruptured. You cover your ears, to little effect. You realize vaguely that you are on your knees from the sound. You also realize that you are screaming, but can't hear your own voice. Looking up[ painfully, you see that Molly is totally enraptured by whatever's on. You start screaming her name, but she doesn't hear you. She is flicking channels, but it doesn't make a difference to you. You want it OFF. Finally, you start punching her, out of sheer frustration; you don't think it will have an effect. It does. You punch her couple of times, then your first sinks into her [ad in a certain spot and Molly howls with pain. She drops the remote and clutches her suddenly limp hand, whimpering slightly. This, of course, was not good for you. You drop through the air, the noise pounding in your head, until you hit the carpet. There you lie, dazed and almost unconscious from the noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like an eternity, the T.V turns off and the noise ceases. The world looks a bit fuzzy, and you have a tremendous headache. Before you can gather your wits, something, Molly obviously, grabs you and roughly jerks you into the air, which almost renders you unconscious again. You are brought before Molly's snarling face, clutched none-to-gently in her claws. She looks furious:<br>\r\n\"Why'd you do that, Huh? Why? That really hurt, I oughta...\" She is shaking you furiously like a rag doll in her claws, which is causing you indescribable pain. You get really angry as you start to recover:<br>\r\n\"That really hurt, did it? Good!\" You interrupt her furiously. Molly stares at you in shock as you continue ranting \"That dammed T.V hurt me much worse. If you hadn't been so stupefied by that thing it wouldn\u2019t have happened! That hurt me MUCH more than it hurt you. You \u2018oughta\u2019? I 'oughta' you!\" You finish ranting to be confronted by Molly's snarl, which intimidates you even when you\u2019re furious. She opens her mouth, stops, then looks at you in pure disgust. She lowers her claws and drops you roughly to the ground, though not far enough to actually hurt you. She rises to her feet without a word and stomps over to the other side of the room, where she sits down and cradles her hand. You try to think through the pounding headache. You are still mad at her, so you sit down and turn your back on her, arms crossed sullenly. You both sit there in silence for a long, tension filled 10 minutes until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to make the first move. As your head gradually clears, you actually start to think about what happened. She hurt you with the T.V by accident, you hurt her with your fists on purpose. She has been nice to you, until now, and you don't want to make her feel bad. Your anger, however, wars with your feelings for Molly. She had dropped you, picked you up, hurt you even more. Would a nice person do that? Your feelings are troubled for a while, but come back with the fact that you had hurt her first. After 10 long, uncomfortable minutes filled with anger and self-recriminations, you believe it's your job to apologize. As your anger dies down, it is also replaced by cold logic. You should never have 100 foot tall carnivores angry with you, no matter how nice. You get up stiffly, still smarting and turn around. Molly is flexing her right paw, studiously avoiding looking at you. As you walk over, you feel her eyes on you, but refrain from looking up. It takes you a few minutes to get to her and you finally look up again. You are confronted with a view of her very tall legs, which reach the knee before going out of sight. You stand between them and try to work up some courage. It takes a moment, but finally you are able to call:<br>\r\n\"Molly?\" You call very softly, but she was listening for you. She quickly leans over in her chair, looking straight down at you. You are looking straight up; her head is positioned right over your body. You can't read her expression; you just hope she's become a little more forgiving. Right, you better get this over with:<br>\r\n\"Molly, I'm really sorry that I hurt you. It was just that the sound was hurting so much, and you couldn\u2019t hear me. I know, I probably should have found another way but i just couldn\u2019t think. I...\" You trail off, finished with your awkward and highly embarrassing speech. She blinks at you, and you just stand there, awaiting a reply. Finally, she manages to get something out:<br>\r\n\"Keane, I'm sorry I overreacted. I should have known that much sound would have hurt your ears. I just wish you hadn't punched me!\" A little of her old anger creeps into her voice, causing you to flinch. She immediately looks mortified when she sees you cower:<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I did it again. I should control my temper.\" She sounds just as embarrassed as you, and she trails off as well. You both wait, tension thick between you as you struggle to understand and accept. You can't meet each other's eyes. Then Molly manages to work through her embarrassment. She puts her paw down beside you. You note it is not the one you hurt. You hesitate for a moment, than climb on, grateful for the release. She quickly straightens out and lifts you up to her face:<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted, Keane.\" She tells you, her voice thick with emotion.<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted, Molly.\" Your voice is just as thick. She gives you a small, tentative smile and you giver her one back. Than she looks at you strangely:<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I pet you?\" She asks. You realize the question is an important one. You only have to consider it for an instant before giving your answer:<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" She looks a bit happier and reaches in with a claw. You lie down on your stomach, hoping she will massage your back. She complies, using the back of her claw to stroke up and down your back. You sigh softly and she keeps doing it. It feels REALLY good after that fall you took. She seems happy of your acceptance. She gently lowers her paw until they\u2019re resting in her lap. She continues to pet you for quite a while and you continue to relax. Eventually her petting tapers off and she just cuddles you. It isn't so bad, actually. Eventually, though, she lifts you back to her face, gently:<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if we watch T.V? I'll turn it way down.\" she assures you hastily. You look up at her and nod peacefully. She'll at least be more aware of you, this time. She cradles you gently to her chest, which you enjoy immensely and stands up. She walks over to the nearest cushion, which is farthest from the T.V, and sits back down. She has a sudden idea and lifts you past her shoulder. She sets you down so you are reclining against the cushion as well, back on the cushion and legs on her shoulder. You put your hands behind your head, she notices the movement and copies you. This forms a hollow for you, between her neck, shoulder and arm. She turns on the T.V and you tense up for a moment. She immediately turns down the volume and the noise reaches you like a slightly muted conversation that is conducted by giants. You relax and mindlessly watch as Molly settles on an afternoon show, some strange thing or another that involves a lot of talking and inexplicable cultural references. It occurs to you, suddenly, what an odd picture this would make if anybody came in right now. The gentle sounds of conversation envelop you and you nod off blissfully. You wake up....</span></div></div>",

Molly's legs surround you, she must be cradling you in her lap. Looking up, you see Molly is leaning over you, a smile on her face:<br>\r\n\"You were sleeping so peacefully. It was a shame to wake you up, but it is time for dinner.\" She sounds faintly regretful. You are still in the T.V room; she probably just sat up and picked you up to. You lounge back in her paw, which is being held in the other, and smile back up at her. You enjoy the moment, but it immediately passes when Billy sticks his head in the room:<br>\r\n\"Mom says you've got to come to the table now.\" He sounds smug; he gets to order his sister around in a secondhand way. Molly loses the smile quickly and shoots Billy a glare:<br>\r\n\"Yes I know you brat. I'm coming.\" Billy grins nastily at her and leaves. Molly glances down at you and you have no trouble guessing what she's thinking:<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine, he can't do anything right there.\" You wish you felt as certain as you sounded. Billy is just to full of spite for comfort. Molly nods grimly, than stands up. You stand up as well, grabbing one of her claws. It's blunt, except at the end where you don't try to touch it. Molly walks into the dining room and takes her seat. There are two courses again, much to your relief. Molly sets her paw down on the plate and you jump off. Dinner proceeds as it had the night before. You are very careful not to get anywhere near Molly, she seemed to transform with the meat at hand. She did remember to give you some, though. You munch on it, staring fixedly at te tablecloth and trying to ignore the sounds of the wolves eating. You are covered in grease again by the time their done. This time they all finish at once and Molly's mom clears the table. Billy leaves as soon as he can, leaving the other three at the table. The father looks at you carefully, and then looks up at Molly:<br>\r\n\"I see that you're getting settled, that\u2019s good. Anyway, school's tomorrow so you have to go to bed.\" He was sounding very odd, because you can't tell whether he is referring to Molly or to you both. Her mom speaks up:<br>\r\n\"Yes dear, time for bed. Be sure to wash your pet and keep it collared!\" You wince at the emphasis in her voice, on both \"pet\" and \"it\". You shiver, grateful you chose to come to Molly instead of her mom. You don't like her attitude either. Molly glowers at her, but doesn't say anything. She just nods at her and looks at her father:<br>\r\n\"Goodnight dad.\" She doesn't even look at her mom. She picks you up and swiftly departs the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she gets to her bedroom, she immediately locks the door and heads into the bathroom. After she turns on the light she starts filling the sink and meets your eye for the first time:<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry about her, she is one of the people who think of humans as an 'it'\" you can hear the anger in her voice \"unfortunately, most people see it that way. Try to ignore it.\" You nod up at her:<br>\r\n\"You're dad seems nicer, though.\" Molly nods considering:<br>\r\n\"He isn't quite as firm believer as me, but yeah, you're right. He hates family conflict, however, so we can't think of him as support. Well, anyway, ready for your bath?\" It isn't really a question; the tub is full and all. Molly reaches over and picks you up, than uses her other hand to remove your collar, untying the knot in the back with her claw. The fur falls away, still cordlike, to her pad. She puts it on the counter. You stare at it in distaste. Molly's mom had made it brutally obvious what it was, a sign of ownership. Still, it could be worse. You could belong to her. Or Billy, you think with a shiver. Molly is silent for a moment, than shakes it off. She reaches for you hesitantly, looking at you with an obvious question in her eyes. You sweep your hands in an after-you gesture and she happily removes your clothes, tossing them in the basket. She quickly sets about washing the grease from your body, with the same blissful massage as before. Once she's done, she drains the tub and lets you lie on the towel. She changes into her oversized t-shirt and panties outfit she uses for sleeping. You can barely keep your eyes open, filled with food and blissful from the wash. You hardly stir as she carries you over to the bed. She sets you on the pillow, than reaches over to your drawers. She puts the collar on the seventh shelf, which is high above your head. You wonder why, than you realize it is to keep you from getting at it. When she's done, you glare at her from the pillow. She notices, and shrugs in a what-can-you-do fashion. She smiles timidly and strokes your naked body gently. You let her, but you feel the resentment fade into a secure place, ready to come forth at any moment. Probably not at Molly, though. She's too nice for that. She turns off the lights, curls up under the blankets and falls asleep with you under her chin, paw resting over you. You fall asleep as well.</span></div></div>",

Your bed isn't nearly this soft and you usually don't sleep nude. Your eyes snap open and lock on the giant paw shaking you. You feel a scream coming, than you shake out of your grogginess and remember everything. You sit up wearily and look for Molly. She has already sat up and is leaning over to shake you. She looks a bit concerned:<br>\r\n\"Forgot again, huh?\" You nod at her:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess it will take me a bit of time to get used to this.\" She looks sympathetic:<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you will. At least you remembered before you fell down the pillow again.\" She gives you a wan smile. You recall the incident from the day before and venture a smile of your own. She seems satisfied, so you stand up. You wobble a little in the soft footing, but manage to stay on your feet. Molly yawns and stretches, which is a bit disconcerting to your still-befuddled mind. Than she puts out a paw for you. You scramble on and she lifts you to her face:<br>\r\n\"We gotta get moving if we want any breakfast.\" You wave and she sets you on the nightstand \"Get some clothes on; I'm going to take a shower.\" She walks over to the big dresser and takes out some clothes, than heads into the bathroom. You look at her, shrug and head over to your dresser. You open the drawers and study the clothes available. You hesitate for a moment, not knowing the fads or the temperature. Finally, you choose some undies, a pair of loose pants like jeans and a grayish shirt. You scramble into them, then remember the collar. You look up at the seventh drawer. It's high above your head and closed. You know Molly put it in there to keep you from tampering with it. You consider opening the drawers like steps to get at the collar, than start imagining ripping it to shreds or throwing it out or burning it. You stop and chuckle to yourself. She knows me more than I thought, you think.  You know that it's all that will protect you out with all those wolves, but it is humiliating. Especially after the things her mom said earlier. Just than, the bathroom door opens and Molly steps out. She's wearing a blue shirt and some jeans. The shirt is not all that revealing, but not that unflattering either. You wait for her to come over. She does, springy in step, very much the morning wolf. She grins down at you when as se stands there:<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" Her tone is bright, she really has boundless energy. At least, to your point of view. You wave up at her and smile, suppressing feelings of anxiety. You\u2019re a morning person yourself, at least after you've actually woken up. You\u2019re glad of that, because she gets up REALLY early, judging by the sky outside.<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" you call back up at her, trying to put some energy in it yourself. She reaches to pick you up than stops. She narrows her eyes at you:<br>\r\n\"You forgot about the collar, so you\u2019re not ready.\" She looks faintly amused as you squirm under her gaze, embarrassed. You had hoped you might get away with it, actually. You grin up at her sheepishly. She rolls her eyes and chuckles, than reaches for the drawer. Drat, you think.  She gets the collar and puts it around your neck. The fur is soft and comfortable and you don't try to resist. How could you stop her? She picks you up:<br>\r\n\"NOW your ready.\" she half smiles at your expression and pets you gently with a claw on her paw. She gets on her knees and reaches under the bed. She pulls out her backpack and puts it on, awkwardly because she's holding you with one hand. She slings it over one shoulder and heads downstairs, with you in her palm, sitting because of her antics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets into the kitchen and sits down at the table. Her mother is bustling around in the kitchen, you see to your dismay. Her mother brings over a plate of eggs and bacon with milk. She glances down at you, collared and sitting and nods approvingly at her daughter. Molly rolls her eyes at her mom's back and sets you on her plate. She pushes over some food for you. You both start munching on it with gusto, but Molly doesn't show that food-craze that seems to come over all wolves confronted with meat. That's definitely fine by you; you really don't want to have to deal with it more than once a day. After she finishes her food, and scoops up the remains of your meal, she gulps down some milk, and offers the rest to you. You drink some of the refreshing drink; it's really cold, but very good after the meal. Molly gulps the rest and sets the glass back down on the table. She clears her plate and cup, leaving you on the table. You wander over to the salt and pepper shakers, which are taller than the ones at home. They tower over you. You stop examining them when you hear footsteps. You look over and see to your complete terror that it is not Molly, but her mom. Molly is washing the dishes and doesn't notice her mom. Her mom comes up to the table and looks down at you. She yawns slowly, giving you a full display of her teeth. You cower against the shakers, pinned by her gaze. Her paw comes up to the table, reaching towards you. You look at it in horrified fascination, trembling with fear. It reaches you, than goes over you and picks up a set of keys a few feet from you. She grins evilly when she sees you drop to the table, weak kneed. She keeps it on as she walks out the room. Molly rushes over as soon as she's out of sight and picks you up, cradling you against her breasts, reassuring you:<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, Keane.\" She pushes her paws out, so she can see you. You just sit there, gasping. Sorry is not really an adequate cover for her. You nearly pissed you pants! You look up at her:<br>\r\n\"Is your mom,\" you manage to gasp, \"always such a sadistic bitch?\" you demand. She looks down at you oddly:<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever 'bitch' means, which I'm sure isn't complimentary,\" you feel horrified, your glad Molly doesn't know what it means, it would have offended her terribly. \"I'm sure I'll find out eventually.\" she adds with a sly grin when she sees your expression. \"Anyway, to answer your question, no, not really, just to humans.\" That isn't really comforting, since you're the only human within grasping distance. \"Anyway, we have to go. I can't wait to introduce you to some of my friends!\" she adds. She puts her backpack on fully and heads for the door. You are worried, however. How are you getting there?</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, one of them starts and pulls away, an impressive sight in and of itself because of its (relative) size. You can see her mom in the car and breathe a sigh of relief. You won't be riding with her, at least. Molly watches her go, and then you hear a car honk, an enormous foghorn that makes you jump. Molly does jump a little, which results in you ending up on your back on her palm. You hear her father call:<br>\r\n\"Molly, come on!\" He must have come out while you were being confronted on the table by her mom, you would have heard him otherwise. Molly quickly gets into the car beside her dad. She slams the door shut loudly, very loudly to you. You don't cover your ears, though, you seem to be getting used to the effect of such loud sounds. You sit up in her pad, trying to stand through the ride would be impossible. He starts the car and pulls out. He turns down the street and starts driving. You watch him drive. It is slightly mind-boggling. You couldn\u2019t have possibly moved that wheel with your whole body, and he is doing it with ease with one or two hands. After a while, you reach a stoplight. He turns in his seat and looks at you, than at Molly:<br>\r\n\"So, you're ready for school today?\" Again with the plural you, he is much more acknowledging of your existence and intelligence then his wife. Molly answers:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think we're ready.\"  You nod. He fixes his gaze on you:<br>\r\n\"So, Keane, we haven't been properly introduced. I'm Mark Wolfesbourg.\" You feel a little awkward about carrying on a conversation with this enormous, fairly forbidding figure. He is gigantic, and you\u2019re not all that familiar with him. However, it is only polite that you reply:<br>\r\n\"Hello Mr. Wolfesbourg, I'm Keane Molly's new... um...\" You trail off helplessly, not wanting to say the word. He looks down in amusement as he starts to drive at the green light:<br>\r\n\"Pet?\" he offers. You nod your head with some trepidation. How was he going to act? He chuckles softly: \"Don't worry; I know it's hard to hear. Still, it could be worse. You could be 'Molly's lunch'!\" He laughs heartily at this while you look up at him in confusion. This is definitely not what you expected. He goes on: \"You're probably right to hate the word. I would in your position. However, there's nothing that can be done. 'Pet' is the most,... kind word that we use to describe humans. Don't be offended to much if I refer to you that way, I mean it kindly, not contemptuously like SOME people.\" You consider this argument. You know that his wife is certainly contemptuous and cruel, and he and Molly are nice and respecting even as they acknowledge your 'lower' status. You decide to speak:<br>\r\n\"Mr. Wolfesbourg...\" he interrupts you:<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Mark. Whoever chose the family name must have been nuts, it's such a clich\u00e9. Would you like to be called \"Humanesbourg?\" You shake your head:<br>\r\n\"No Mark, I see your point. Anyway, as I was saying, I kind of get your point. It is still humiliating, though, no matter what you say.\" He acknowledges this with a nod:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. You'll just have to learn how to bear it, there are hoards of fanatical morons who would start calling for beheadings if we started to refer to you as 'person' or anything else that could infer 'equality' between humans and wolves.\" His tone is contemptuous and sarcastic. This is a new side of him, he wasn't nearly so forceful in the house. Molly finally breaks in:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I really hate people like that!\" Her tone is angry, which Mark recognizes immediately:<br>\r\n\"Molly, calm down. We can't solve anything by picking fights with them.\" She looks sourly at him and nods reluctantly. He returns his gaze to you:<br>\r\n\"Keane, it's nice to make your acquaintance. Maybe we can talk some more after school.\" He sounds regretful that you can't talk more now. He parks the car and holds ouy a claw. Molly reaches over with you. You grasp the claw carefully and he shakes your hand, and you, up and down. You are faintly dizzy when he stops. Molly kisses him and gets out of the car. As the door closes, you hear \"Have fun today, you two. Stay out of trouble.\" Molly rolls her eyes at the last and the car pulls away. She looks down at you:<br>\r\n\"So, Keane, what'd you think?\" You smile up at her:<br>\r\n\"He is nice, much nicer than your mom.\" She nods at this and heads towards the school, petting you with one claw as she goes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Molly walks into school. Around her are other wolves, all wearing backpacks and all more or less her age. You glance around nervously. The school seems like any other, lockers on the wall, wooden doorways with windows and white tile. It's not really tile, however, it is something else, slightly squishy and smooth. it must be there to keep from hurting the wolves' feet. The noise is incredible, many people talking all at once. You don't have to cover your ears, but you find it hard to distinguish what is being said. As Molly walks, you attract some attention. Discreet nudges and stares in your direction make you feel nervous. It is not enough to disrupt normal high school life; quite a few of them just look at you and go back to their conversations. A few are curious, but most are not familiar to Molly. She is followed by the inevitable \"a human!\", and \"where did you get him/it\". Molly just keeps walking, occasionally answering a few of them, people she knows. She makes a point to say \"him\" as she tells people she found you in \"the wild\". You wait nervously as she talks, traffic forcing her, and you, very close to the person she's addressing, whose mammoth torso always towers over you. Thankfully, none of them want to talk to you or, even worse, hold you. Probably they have the privacy rule ingrained into them, even if they are wiling to bend it in talking with Molly. Finally, she reaches her locker, which is a floor-to-ceiling affair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She opens it and carefully sets you on a shelf before unloading her books into it. She looks at you, eye level to her because of your placement:<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" She asks. You nod:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine. It is a bit noisy for my tastes, though.\" Just then, you spot a couple of wolves peering at you and whispering. You point at them: \"I think the gossip mill is running already.\" Molly nods:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, nothing stays private around here for long. You're a novelty around here, the last human who came to school with her master left a few years ago.\" You feel a little jolt:<br>\r\n\"Her?\" you ask. Molly looks grim:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she was caught by a real jerk. He treated her awfully, and a rumor went around that she died a little while after her master graduated.\" She looks angry \"I saw the way he treated her, it was disgusting, slave like! I heard that her master was taken to the principals office a few time, though\" she adds even angrier \"not for her treatment, but because it was distracting.\" She is getting really enraged. You don't want a scene, so you wave franticly at Molly:<br>\r\n\"Molly, I know it's bad but please, they're gone now and we can't do anything about it! Please, calm down.\" Even as you're saying this, you can't help but wonder what exactly she means by \"horrible treatment\" and \"slave\". After all, isn't she YOUR master?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She lets out a breath, slowly and seems a bit calmer. You are grasped by stupidity for a moment and ask the question you just thought. She draws back for a moment, looking hurt. She pushes her face into her locker, forcing you to back up into the wall. She speaks:<br>\r\n\"Keane, I'm nothing like that Jerk! Believe me; I treat you much better than him. He made her strip naked and chained as he went, until the principle insisted on some covering. Torture was used and constant humiliation in class! I don't do any of that, do I?\" She looks sad and sounds desperate. You walk forward hesitantly and pat her on the muzzle, feeling released from that momentary stupidity. You speak reassuringly:<br>\r\n\"Of course not Molly, I'm sorry for saying that.\" You hug her nose, but flinch when you feel how cold she is. She giggles at that. <br>\r\n\"Thanks for understanding Keane. Apology accepted.\" With that, she gets playful. She moves her snout into you, than moves left. You are caught unaware and you fall down. She puts her jaw on top of you and rubs, applying pressure on your body. It is tight, but fun. You struggle to push her off with your arms, to no affect. You push her as hard as you can, managing to inch her jaw up before your arms give out. You make a demand:<br>\r\n\"Molly, get off me!\" you say, laughing and trying to breathe at the same time. She laughs to, than squashes you back down for a moment before drawing back so that you can stand up. She smiles at you, than grabs her books for the next class, at which point...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, Molly's head jerks up and a look of consternation spreads over her face. You can barely hear a soft, high pitched bell ringing, though you imagine that the wolves with their sensitive ears can hear it fine. Molly quickly stuffs all the stuff into her backpack, which she slings over one shoulder haphazardly. She swipes you up and slams her locker with a resounding SLAM. As she moves quickly to her class, you can hear resounding SLAMS echoing throughout the school as other wolves quickly go to class. You are a bit uncomfortable, Molly is holding you in a fist and you are a bit dazed from the abrupt departure from land (shelf, really). You tap her pad, careful not to punch her hard, you don't want a repeat incident. Molly ignores you, so you decide to just bear it. You curl up in a ball and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly opens her paw and you sit up on her pad. You are entering a classroom. You can see lots of desks, and a blackboard in the front. There is a teacher\u2019s desk off to the side. There are beakers, burners and chemicals on every desk and you can see, twisting around, numbers and Wolfish characters on the board. You guess you're in chemistry. Molly heads to the back, followed by the eyes of her curious classmates. Molly takes a seat next to a girl. You see that she's wearing a blue blouse and miniskirt and some thin glasses. She is gray, far less silvery than Molly. She does not have a very attractive figure, but she has beautiful brown eyes and a ready smile for Molly, who sets you down before sitting. She peers down at you, an expression of curiosity and faint wonder in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans closer to get a better look and you back up involuntarily. She doesn't look very threatening, but all wolves are dangerous to you. She speaks up:<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I won't hurt you.\"  She keeps back some, but still examines you intensely. Molly\u2019s paw comes up behind you and she scoots you a bit closer to the girl. Her friend speaks up:<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Amanda and your a human, Molly's new pet, right?\" She speaks very quickly, in a higher pitch than Molly does. You nod, unable to figure out why she needs to ask. You also speak up:<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Keane!\" You can't really think of anything else to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiles at you before looking at Molly. She starts a barrage of questions and comments:<br>\r\n\"He's cool, where\u2019d you get him? Are you keeping him? Why didn't you call me?\" She looks like she wants to say more, but a voice interrupts:<br>\r\n\"Settle down class.\" You look up and see a youngish wolf, probably in his twenties, addressing the class. Molly and Amanda quiet down with the rest. The teacher, Mr. Sima as it turns out, commences the lesson. You find it hard to follow; your view is blocked by the lab equipment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly and Amanda have gotten out notes and are scratching furiously. You carefully avoid their papers and walk in front of the equipment. You see the people in front of you, who are also taking notes. Mr. Sima is writing on the board and talking to the class at the same time. You listen without comprehending the writing. You get a vague picture of the lesson, which is on thermo chemistry. You grasp some of it and resolve to ask Molly about the rest, it is actually fascinating. He is a good teacher. Eventually, he finishes the lesson and has the students to do the experiment. You walk back to Molly, who is putting away her stuff and putting on safety goggles, designed for a wolf. They both complete the first steps while you stay out of the way and very far away from the burner. Finally, they let the concoction sit and heat for a while and return their attention to you.  Molly patiently answers all of Amanda's questions. Suddenly, A shadow falls over the two girls. You all look up and see Mr. Sima who is looking at you with curiosity. You look back blandly, feeling emboldened by Amanda. He looks at Molly:<br>\r\n\"See me after class, please.\" He keeps going after checking their experiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looks after him for a moment before bursting out into giggles. You and Molly look at her and she replies;<br>\r\n\"He's HOT!\" she whispers very softly. Molly rolls her eyes and starts to pet you. Amanda follows the movement:<br>\r\n\"Can I...well...pet him?\" You look up at her. She looks faintly wondrous. Molly looks at her for a moment, than down at you. She speaks:<br>\r\n\"Keane, do you mind?\" You consider the question. Molly doesn't seem hostile or condescending, and she is a friend of Molly's. You shake your head. Amanda sees this and reaches over eagerly. You look at her dubiously, but don't back away. She starts to stroke you, a bit rougher than Molly does, but not uncomfortable. She looks happy after a moment and pulls away. She looks faintly embarrassed:<br>\r\n\"Thanks Keane, I just couldn\u2019t resist.\" She grins at you and you wave back. You can tell she would like to ask more, but has to go back to the experiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch them finish, a red frothy liquid resulting. Amanda seems to grasp the material a bit quicker than Molly, but both are confident in their answers. They finish up, hand in their papers and look at the clock. The lesson must be about to end, because Amanda says:<br>\r\n\"Sit with you at lunch?\" Molly agrees:<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Amanda gets up when the bell rings and bounces up after giving you a pat and a smile. You smile; her good humor is a bit infectious. Molly gets her stuff and heads over to Mr. Sima's desk. He is...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Molly walks over to Mr. Sima, who is grading papers. He looks up and sees you, riding in her paw. He clears his throat disapprovingly:<br>\r\n\"Miss Wolfesbourg,\" he begins, ignoring Molly who rolls her eyes, \"as you probably know, the school's policy towards humans is rather open. However,\" he continues, looking menacingly at you, \"I expect you to keep it under control. I also except you to meet the, ahem, behavioral guidelines on yourself as an owner. Am I perfectly clear?\" He looks strict and disapproving. You think the expression will get stuck on his face. You take his insults in stride; he doesn't seem hostile or even very interested in you as a thing, just as a source of disruption. Molly, on the other hand, looks angry. She looks at him in disgust and forces out:<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think I do.\" She turns her back on him and walks out of the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the hallway, which is fairly empty, she looks just about ready to explode. Her eyes seem to be focused on something not really there, her teeth are bared and she is breathing heavily. You call up to her:<br>\r\n\"Molly!\" She looks down, startled. She still looks very angry:<br>\r\n\"Keane, that jerk...\" She looks like she wants to hit something, which is not a good sign for someone, mainly you, in her paw. You try to reconcile her:<br>\r\n\"Molly, let's just get out of here.\" she casts a last glance back into the classroom and walks down the hall, still angry. You urge her into a small side corridor and have her sit down. She cradles you in her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb up her arm to her shoulder and head over to her head. She looks at you during all this with curiosity. You know that she needs a hug, so you walk over to her neck and give her one. She stiffens for a moment, than brings up a paw and hugs you back. She accomplishes this by pressing you still further into her silvery fur, into her neck. She does this for a minute or so, than draws you in front of her face so she can see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\" she asks, puzzled.<br>\r\n\"I thought you could use a hug, so you would think happy thoughts instead of angry ones.\" She looks at you strangely:<br>\r\n\"Weren't you angry to?\" she questions, disbelief showing all over her face.<br>\r\n\"Of course I was, but I really can't afford to get angry with someone that large. Besides, so many wolves seem to share that view. I can't get angry at all of it, and neither should you. You've got to ignore it.\" You urge her. She seems to accept what you're saying, dubiously.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right. Still, when people who are supposed to be smart and understanding say things like that...\" she starts to get angry all over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interrupt:<br>\r\n\"Molly, really, don't think about it. It is insulting an humiliating, but it's a fact of my life here. You should get used to it to. As long as YOU and other people close to you like Amanda and Mark are nice to me, I can take it. You should be able to as well. After all, they're insulting me, and you're not a tiny, insignificant thing to them.\" You finish you're speech, surprised about the honesty of what you're saying. You hadn\u2019t thought about it that way before, but you see that it's true. Molly listens to you with wide eyes and when you finish she hugs you again, smashing you into her fur, though it's on her chest:<br>\r\n\"I'll always be nice to you Keane. You\u2019re not insignificant to me. You're right, you're the one being insulted by this and you manage to stay calmer than I do. I should learn to control my temper.\" She holds you back out again and gives you a wan smile, which you return. She gets up and holds you carefully as she heads for her next destination. You call up to her:<br>\r\n\"Molly...</span></div></div>",

Molly darts a glance at you as she turns into another hallway.<br>\r\n\"I do to, come on.\" You don't really have much of a choice in the matter, riding on her palm, but you nod. She heads for a door and reaches for a handle. You see the picture of a girl wolf on the door.<br>\r\n\"Molly,\" you say, pointing. She glances down:<br>\r\n\"What... oh.\" she thinks for a moment and considers you. You wait nervously, this will probably get embarrassing. \"Well, you obviously can't go by yourself over there,' she says, nodding at the other door, with a boy wolf on it, \"so you'll just have to come with me in here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to object, but she covers you with her other paw and carries you in. It is rather closed in, and you are thankful you aren't claustrophobic. You hear female voices echoing, distorted and muffled by her paws. She opens her paw a few seconds later. You're in a stall, with green walls and a toilet. The toilet is very large to you, a long drop into a small pond. Molly brins her paws very close to her face, nearly squashing her black nose into you:<br>\r\n\"Keane,\" she whispers VERY softly, \"you will have to, um, go first.\" She looks really embaressed. She kneels in front of the toilet and puts you on the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you can see the 20 foot drop into the pond-like toilet. You feel very, VERY nervous. You really have to go, but you involuntarily start thinking of exuses no to. Molly looks slightly sick:<br>\r\n\"Go on, I won't look.\" she sits down and turns, studiosly loking at the door. You quickly decide to get it over with. You pull down your pants and sit down with your butt sticking ouy. You go quickly, stomach heaving as you hear the faint splashes far below you. You start to stand up, than remember toilet paper. You look at Molly, who hasn't moved an inch this whole time, though she did wince at the splashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly...\" she starts to look at you, but you cut her off, \"no no, I need some toilet paper.\" you say hastily. She nods and reaches over to the dispensor and rips of a piece, which she thrusts blindly at you. You take it and note it's toughness. It's really heavy and dense, hard to tear. You quickly wipe, trying not to think about the difference. You pull up your pants and call out to Molly:<br>\r\n\"I'm done.\" you inform her. She reaches a paw behind her and picks you up. She stands up and brins you in front of her face:<br>\r\n\"Keane, I'm going to have to trust you now. No peaking!\" she says sternly. She puts you on the toilet tank and you turn around obediently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have very little difficulty resisting the urge to peek. All you have to do is imagine being on the toilet seat while she sits down, crushing you. The loud waterfall and splashing sides help you greatly in this endevour. You gag when she reaches for the TP, her butt must've left the seat and released that awful smell. It is intense and foul. You hold your nose as you hear her stand up and pull up her pants. She swipes you hastily off the tank before she flushes. Thankfully, she uses her left hand, which doesn't stink. She leaves the stall and goes to a sinnk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hastily washes her hands, and you do the same, with her help. Thankful that that emberassing ordeal is over, you watch as she exits the bathroom. She heads through the crowded halls, still drawing curios stares. She ignores the people who hail her and procceeds directly to her locker. She puts you on a shelf without meeting your eye as she switches books. She looks at you and opens her mouith, than closes it abruptly. She loks flustered, so you break in:<br>\r\n\"Why don't we just not talk about it?\" you suggest. She nods, relieved. She shoulders he books again and heads for her next class.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Molly walks for a little while, with you in her paw as usual. You watch the crowd go by, some looking at you, some not. It is very crowded, and Molly has to weave her way through the crowds. You consider riding on her shoulder, but a sudden stop knocks you off your feet. She didn't bring a safety line; you'd get knocked off within moments. Molly enters a packed side corridor, shoulder to shoulder traffic. The crowd seems determined to try to go two ways in this narrow (to them) corridor, so Molly enters the line. She gets jostled immediately, sending her stumbling. You nearly fall of her paw, but manage to grab a claw. Molly rights herself and sees you dangling, so she curls in that claw and you get back on her pad. She starts to get pressed by the crowd and she has less space for her paw. She doesn't even look at you, by an instinct born of crowds she smushes you into her stomach.  It's hard to breathe, and your face is pressed into her shirt. You elbow her in the pad, hard. She immediately lets up on the pressure, but your still pressed into her stomach. At least you can breathe. She gets out of the crowd and enters a door, letting you back out as she goes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a normal classroom, with desks and all the rest. It's rather small though, only about ten desks. She goes to one close to the blackboard and sets you down, then gets out her stuff. She notices your mussed-up look:<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" You wave her off, you know it was necessary:<br>\r\n\"It's fine. Anyway, what class is this?\" she smiles:<br>\r\n\"It's one of my favorites, Three Races.\" She notices your curious look, \"It's a class about lifestyles, food, diplomacy and pretty much everything else about the three races. It's not history; we study current events and other things about the Great Cats and Bears, then compare them to our own. It's an optional course, but I had to take something and this sounded interesting.\" You agree:<br>\r\n\"It really does, I can't wait to see what it's like!\" she smiles at you. Just then, several students enter the class and notice you sitting on Molly's desk. They crowd around her desk, and you look nervously at their enormous torsos clustered around the suddenly small desk. All of them start talking at once, asking questions and offering opinions. Molly holds up a palm and they die down:<br>\r\n\"This is Keane, and yes, the rumors are true. The ones that say I won't eat him.\" A few of them chuckle at this. They all stare at you, fascinated. You look up nervously at their far-away faces, all bright with curiosity:<br>\r\n\"Uh Hello!\" you call up.  You watch them blink in surprise, exchanging glances. Suddenly, a boy drops down to his knees, bringing you to just below eye level. You back up a step nervously. He reaches a paw, than extends a claw:<br>\r\n\"Hi little guy, I'm Jon. You shake the proffered claw carefully. He smiles and stands back up. All of the others start clambering and Molly lets them shake your hand to. They all seem to be nice. The bell rings after the last of them finishes, and they all hurry to take their seats, though they do cast several glances over their shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large wolf walks in, a male somewhere in his early thirties. He spots you and comes over. He looks down at you and smiles. He turns to Molly:<br>\r\n\"Well Molly, this is an unexpected turn of events. I hadn't thought a human would show up here for a while.\" He turns to you:<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Mr. Kan. He extends a claw and you take it:<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Keane.\" He nods at you, still smiling:<br>\r\n\"This should be interesting. I just thought of a whole new project for the class.\" He announces the last to the whole class. Most of them groan and he laughs, \"It's not like that, don't worry. You need to find out about humans among the Three and be ready to discuss it. You would do well to start your research with Keane here.\" He turns and goes to his desk, where he sits down and starts grading papers. You hear several people stand up and start dragging their desks over, quickly followed by the rest. Molly takes out a sheet of paper and a claw pen. She is obviously going to take notes. The class forms a circle and you stare out at the class, who are all looking at you expectantly. Jon winks at you, than starts speaking:<br>\r\n\"So, how'd you two meet?\" he asks without preamble. You glance up at Molly, who is smiling and waves a paw at you. You clear your throat nervously and start talking. You tell them, haltingly, how you met molly, but you omit earth. They gasp appreciatively when you describe nearly being eaten. You decide not to mention Molly's breasts and various levels of nakedness as you describe what it was like, with some help from Molly. They are all fascinated. When you describe various incidents with condescending wolves, most of them shake their heads angrily. You finish up and look around nervously, wondering how your speech would be received. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all look at you for a moment, and finally Jon breaks the silence:<br>\r\n\"Well, that's certainly a view I haven't heard before. I must say, it\u2019s an interesting perspective.\" All of the others break in with agreement, and a general conversation commences. Apparently, the students all have different things to contribute. Jon seems to know a lot about human treatment in Wolf society, beyond general knowledge. You learn there's actually a law called \"Indecent Human Exposure\" which basically controls human torture and nakedness, in public at least. You also learn about humans in Bear and Great Cat continents. There are different codes for the different areas. The Pumas and Grizzlies have evolved a tradition of eating humans, while the more reserved Browns and Leopards seem to have rules similar to Wolf society, with a lot in between. You get quite a few looks of sympathy as the class dissembles over different areas. Wolf society seems to be as kind as it gets, quite a few places have human eating as a delicacy, or human hunting as a sport. You unconsciously cower a bit closer to Molly as time goes on, and she strokes you gently. Thankfully, none of the class seems inclined towards condensation and you actually get a lot of sympathy. Finally, the bell rings and the class gets up to leave and Molly packs up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they're all gone, you feel Molly's gaze on you. You look up at her and she looks entirely sympathetic. You shakily try to make light of it:<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a good thing I landed with you, don't you think?\" Molly isn't fooled:<br>\r\n\"Oh Keane...\" She gently picks you up and cuddles you into her chest and you start to cry. You're stunned by the magnitude of it all, the amount of human lives lost to these giant carnivores. You are comforted by Molly and she makes sympathetic noises at you. You bury yourself in her shirt. Finally, you're spent and she pulls you away. She looks down at you:<br>\r\n\"I thought you could use a hug.\" You smile wanly at her. and she returns it. She gently brushes a tear from your face with a claw. She balances it on her claw, which she raises to her face. She tastes it with her tongue:<br>\r\n\"Salty.\" she notes. You don't say anything. She looks at her shirt, where an impressive spot of wetness is blotted.<br>\r\n\"It really is awful. It's one of the reasons I get angry at wolves who say things like \"it\" to you. That sort of thinking led to current treatment of humans.\" She stays silent for a moment and you look at each other. She brightens a little:<br>\r\n\"I think you need some comfort food!\" she tells you.</span></div></div>",

The hallways are noisy, as always, and she heads into even bigger crowds as she goes into the cafeteria. Like any cafeteria on earth, there are tables and noisy students with lunches on trays. Molly goes into one of the lunch lines, making her way slowly up to the food. She draws curious stares from the other students, but they are all focused on the food. Molly herself is looking hungrily in the direction of some meaty smells. You decide to try and break off the cycle this time. Your really not in the mood to see Molly attack her food. You wave at her. She doesn't notice, which is a bad sign. You go over to one of her claws and push on it. That gets her attention. She looks at you with food-crazed eyes, which abruptly clear up. She looks at you questioningly, and you pre-empt her:<br>\r\n\"Molly, I was losing you there.\" She looks startled and uncomprehending. She turns her gaze back towards the food, but she doesn't seem likely to go food crazy, at least. She picks up a tray and dumps you on it. She pushes her tray down the line, picking up some chicken and bread. It looks weak and unsatisfying compared to Mall food, but she doesn't complain. She also gets a thing of ice-cream. She pays for it, than heads out of the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes outside and sits under a tree in front of the school, with you and the tray in her lap. She looks at you questioningly:<br>\r\n\"\"Losing me?\" she asks you. You nod with a little apprehension:<br>\r\n\"Well, um... you kind of, well, go nuts with your food. All wolves seem to.\" you assure her hastily as she looks at you weirdly, \"It's just that it's kind of, scary. You look so different. I hoped you wouldn't this time, that's all.\" You explain all this in a rush, not sure how she'll react. She looks odd for a moment, than bursts out laughing. It's really loud, and the tray shakes, knocking you over. She stops:<br>\r\n\"Sorry Keane. It's just so funny; I've never actually heard anyone tell me that's weird. Everyone else does it, even the other Races.\" You're not exactly sure what's funny about that, but you nod:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I just feel like a piece of meat when you're like that, that's all.\" She snorts:<br>\r\n\"Keane, I would never eat you, not even like that. But if it scares you, than I'm glad you brought me back to reality.\" You nod relieve. She sets into the sandwich, though with less gusto then usual. She offers you a piece, and you sit there, munching contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish up and stand up, wiping away the crumbs. Molly has already finished and is looking at you expectantly, with a mischievous grin on her face. You get suspicious:<br>\r\n\"What?\" you demand. She grins even wider:<br>\r\n\"I just thought you might like some dessert, that's all.\" You nod carefully, knowing full well she's concocted some sort of scheme. She smiles and takes off the lid of the ice cream. She looks around, mock confused:<br>\r\n\"Dear me, I seem to have forgotten my spoon.\" You smile, realizing what she wants. You push up your sleeves:<br>\r\n\"Well dear lady, a man like myself never lets a lady like yourself get into such a situation. May I\" you ask her with a bow and a flourish, mock gallant. Molly giggles:<br>\r\n\"Why noble sir, how kind of you to offer. Thank you, I accept.\" She whisks you into the air and drops you on her ice cream. You stumble slightly, your feet immersed. Thankfully, it\u2019s not too cold. It is chocolate, dark brown and extending to the sides of the bowl. You feel the bowl lift and see Molly peering at you. You grin and wave at her. She grins back, and then she shakes the bowl a little. You stumble to your knees, immediately covering your legs in the brown substance. You mock-glare up at her and she giggles again, before managing:<br>\r\n\"Why noble sir, It is impolite to keep a lady waiting.\" She reminds you. You roll your eyes at her, than set at the ice cream. You dig a trench in a half circle with your arms, which are immediately covered in ice cream up to the elbows. When you're done, You reach under and struggle to lift it. you manage to flip the ice cream over, a fairly large piece. A blur of red flashes at it and Molly's tongue recedes back into its mouth, taking the delicious morsel with it. Molly makes smacking sounds:<br>\r\n\"Ummm, sweet and delicious. You really must try some.\u201d You wave at her, than scoop up a mouthful for yourself. It really does taste good, and you set about making more \"spoonfuls\" for Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After quite a few more, at which point the ice cream is starting to melt, Molly starts lapping around you with her tongue. You contentedly watch her demolish what took you quite some time to work at. At last, you're resting on the bowl, surrounded by chocolate. Your feeling bloated, having consumed quite a lot (to you) of the stuff. You feel contented as you stare up at Molly, who is looking down at you. Suddenly, the playful grin returns:<br>\r\n\"There is still so much left. You are quite filthy noble sir; please allow me to clean you off. Your mind has slowed down and you nod contentedly, not actually thinking about it, just about her deep, blue eyes... You're shaken out of you're reverie as her tongue darts at you. You flinch involuntarily, but she still manages to lick you're whole body from head to toe. You come up sputtering and watch her tongue recede into her mouth. She tastes it for a moment, than grins at you:<br>\r\n\"That was a very delicious morsel. I think I will have another. Turn over please.\" You do so, and feel her rough tongue slowly make its way up you're legs, avoiding you're shirt and continuing to your arms and neck. You get thoroughly wet, however. You stand up, dripping saliva. You glance up at her smiling face:<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure this is much of an improvement.\" you inform her. She giggles:<br>\r\n\"Well, that's your opinion. But you're right; we need to dry you off.\" She gently lifts you and carefully, but firmly, rubs you down. You feel rather sore, but bear it. When you're done, you are completely dry. You're actually rather clean, but your collar seems to have gotten soaked. You point this out to Molly, who chuckles:<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is not just a ploy to get me to take it off?\" She asks you perceptively. You are feeling too good to argue, and strangely silly:<br>\r\n\"Alas, you have caught onto my ploy. It is really uncomfortable right now, though.\" She nods knowingly:<br>\r\n\"I know, fur can retain water for so long! Here, I\u2019ll dry it off.\" She carefully undoes the fur and takes it off. You're glad to be rid of it, at least for a moment. You rub you're neck. It is not really a problem, as long as it's not wet. Molly proceeds to shake, beat and dry it out. Suddenly, a shadow falls over you two. It's...</span></div></div>",

Whatever shall we do, the world\u2019s coming to an end!\u201d You hear the giggles behind the high-pitched voice and you know it\u2019s Amanda. She sits down beside Molly and looks at you, eyes bright with interest. Molly greets her:<br>\r\n\u201dHey Amanda.\u201d She continues to dry out your collar.<br>\r\n\u201cHi Molly, Hi Keane. You should be careful though; any number of people might start screaming if they saw you without a collar.\u201d You and Molly roll your eyes at her. Molly finishes and extends the dry collar. You let her put it on. Amanda may be silly sometimes, but she is right. Molly lifts you off the tray to chest level. Both girls look at you, and you return their gaze. Molly breaks the silence:<br>\r\n\u201dKeane, I\u2019ve got to throw this away. Do you mind staying with Amanda?\u201d You consider it, than agree:<br>\r\n\u201dSure Molly, if\u2026\u201d you leave \u201cif you trust her\u201d hanging. Molly nods and gently hands you to Amanda, who looks delighted:<br>\r\n\u201dThanks Molly, I mean thanks Keane. I\u2019ll take good care of him, I mean you\u201d she assures both you and Molly, stammering. Molly grins at her:<br>\r\n\u201dAmanda, it\u2019s just for a moment.\u201d Amanda looks slightly disappointed, but nods. Molly gets up and walks off towards the school. You stare at Amanda for a moment, who is watching your every move. You feel self-conscious, this is the first time you\u2019ve been alone with another wolf. Amanda looks just as self-conscious as you do. You decide to break the silence:<br>\r\n\u201dSo, Amanda, Molly must really trust you.\u201d You offer. She smiles:<br>\r\n\u201dYeah, she knows I\u2019ve always been fascinated with humans. So, where\u2019d you come from?\u201d You decide to trust her, and tell her about earth, and about finding the crystal. She listens avidly as you give her a short version of your tale, again omitting the intimate parts. She tells you about being friends with Molly from kindergarten, and she assures you she\u2019s not like those \u201carrogant jerks\u201d that you\u2019ve already met. You relax, she may not be Molly but she is her friend and you feel safe with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Molly comes back, she finds you in conversation about the school. The three of you talk about what it's like for each of you. The girls are especially interested in your perspective on it. You chat there for a while, not actually discussing anything of importance, but reveling in talking as equals with these two giant girls. You enjoy talking about school wide gossip; it's a lot like your school on Earth. You get handed back and forth several times, and stroked absently by both girls. Finally the bell rings, and Amanda, who has you, reluctantly gives you back to Molly, giving you one last pat. Amanda looks at you both:<br>\r\n\"This was fun; I'll have to come over some time, to see what you're like at home.\" She adds with a grin. You and Molly glance at each other and Amanda giggles:<br>\r\n\"Bye!\" she stands up and walks off with you and molly looking after her. Molly speaks:<br>\r\n\"Exactly what did you tell her while I was gone?\" she asks you slowly. You just shake your head and watch Amanda head into school, nearly skipping with excitement:<br>\r\n\"Nothing like that.\" You tell her honestly. She looks at you skeptically, but you keep going: \"Cross my heart.\" you tell her. She ponders for a moment:<br>\r\n\"Maybe she meant something else. Than again, she has always been perceptive. Maybe we gave ourselves away.\" You shrug, and so does she. She stands up and heads into school.</span></div></div>",

Molly takes you to Wolfish, which is very boring for you because you cannot read Wolfish, so you sit there and idly watch Molly write an essay on something. You remind yourself again to ask Molly to teach you. The teacher, Mrs. Krine, is indifferent to you, not rally interested and neither condescending or nice. After that Molly, carrying you goes to Computers. This is interesting, but again hard for you to decipher. The keyboard has indentations on each key, to catch Molly's claws when she types. You don't even understand the assignment, so you just watch her type. Her claws blur over the keys while you watch, producing enormous characters on the screen. After a watching for a while, you come to believe that she's programming script for something. When the teacher looks at it, however, she just shakes her head and moves on. Molly casts a rueful glance in your direction, which you return:<br>\r\n\"Not so good?\" Molly just rolls her eyes and keeps typing. Apparently she really stinks, because she gets a really bad grade (you think). After that, she heads home. She goes to her locker, packs up her things and carries you to the bus. She gets on and heads for a seat in the back. Sitting down, she puts you on her backpack, which puts you at a good talking level. She turns to you:<br>\r\n\"So, how was your fist day of school?\" she asks you. You consider it, and then respond:<br>\r\n\"Interesting, to say the least. It's not that different from my school on earth. Though,\" you add when she gives you a look, \"mine DEFINETLY isn't so big.\" She smiles at that. Just then, the bus lurches forward and you stumble. You get to the edge of the backpack and start to fall... only to be caught by Molly. You stand up, the wind knocked out of you. She gently puts you back on the backpack. You look up at her:<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Nice Reflexes\" You tell her sincerely. She grins:<br>\r\n\"Now Keane, don't you know you're supposed to sit down on the bus?\" you share a laugh with that one, although you do sit down. She thinks of something and loses the smile:<br>\r\n\"It must've been awful, hearing about the treatment of humans.\" She offers. You nod:<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I really got lucky, when I came to you. It could've been bad if i'd landed in Puma territory.\" you tell her with a shudder. She gives you a look:<br>\r\n\"You're right Keane. I know it sounds cruel, but try not to think about it. You're with me, so don't 'what if' yourself. Doing that will just make you a nervous wreck I\u2019ll keep those idiots away from you!\" she tells you solemnly. You smile at her:<br>\r\n\"Thanks Molly.\" You decide to change the subject:<br>\r\n\"Uh, molly?\" you offer hesitantly.<br>\r\n\"Yes Keane?\" she asks you. <br>\r\n\"Could you, uh, teach me to read? Well, teach me to read Wolfish, I already can read and it's just that I want to be able to read Wolfish.\" you say this in a rush, feeling kind of embarrassed that you have to ask for something kindergarteners learn. She considers this:<br>\r\n\"Well Keane, I don't know. It's could be so difficult. I mean, it's kind of a time-consuming chore and I have things to do...\" your heart plummets, why is she acting like this? She looks at you for a moment, than bursts out laughing. You look at her, perplexed. She manages to get a breath:<br>\r\n\"You should've seen the look on your face! Priceless!\" she chuckles some more. You start to get mad. This is so humiliating! Molly sees this and sobers up: \"Honestly Keane, I was just teasing you. Of course I will! You don't even have to ask!\" She strokes you gently, and you yield to her claw. It just feels so good! You let her massage you. She does this for quite some time before she lets up. She smiles at you:<br>\r\n\"This won't be so difficult, you're intelligent. I'm sure you'll learn in no time at all.\" she assures you. Just then, the bus stops. Molly looks out the window. She picks you up gently, but quickly, and slides her backpack on. She exits the bus, although she does draw a few curious stares. She starts to walk down the sidewalk. You look around. You're not sure, but you think you're still quite a ways from her house. You ask her and she nods:<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this is why we took dads car in the morning. We've got quite a walk, we're on the other side of town.\" You nod and she keeps walking. You share an amiable silence until you get to her house, about a half-hour later. She goes in, slams the door and yells:<br>\r\n\"I'm HOME!\" she bellows. You cover your ears and wait for your ears to stop ringing. You look reproachfully at her:<br>\r\n\"Was that really necessary?\" you demand. She grins a toothy grin:<br>\r\n\"No, but it WAS fun!\" she tells you. Who answers her loud call?</span></div></div>",

She rushes over to him and slams into him, hugging him and plopping a kiss on his cheek. Unfortunately for you, she forgot that you are in her paw. You end up thoroughly squashed against Mark. All you can see is his read and yellow shirt. You find it hard to breathe, and your body is under immense pressure from Molly's hug. You elbow her paw. She doesn't notice, but Mark seems to notice the movement:<br>\r\n\"Uh, Molly? Where's Keane?\" Molly looks at her paw, which is squashed against her dad's back. She immediately jerks her paw away and steps back, looking at you. You are in a spread eagle position on her pad, looking thoroughly squashed. You gaze up at her. She looks guilty and slightly worried. She nudges you with a claw:<br>\r\n\"Keane?\" she asks. You groan and make your stiff muscles work, sitting up. You glance up at Molly, who looks visibly relieved:<br>\r\n\"Could we not do that again?\" you suggest mildly.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Keane, won't happen again.\" she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, Mark chuckles. Molly looks at him:<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" she demands.<br>\r\n\"I've got a human shaped imprint in my shirt.\" he informs her. She shakes her head:<br>\r\n\"Dad, you\u2019ve got the strangest sense of humor.\" she informs him. You pipe up:<br>\r\n\"I think it must be genetic.\" you tell them. She swivels her head to you:<br>\r\n\"What's that mean?\" she demands fiercely. You tell her:<br>\r\n\"Wasn't it just recently that you forgot the spoon to your ice cream?\" you ask her innocently, \"and I do seem to recall several incidents with your tongue in strange places.\" you say suggestively. She immediately shrieks:<br>\r\n\"Keane!\" Mark pipes up:<br>\r\n\"Didn't somebody dress up as a fairy and run screaming through a zoo one time?\" he asked mildly. She turned towards him:<br>\r\n\"Dad!\" she shrieked again, her face fur standing out in a wolfish blush. You turn towards mark, pretending to be fascinated:<br>\r\n\"Really? Do go on!\" you urge him. Molly by this time is almost reduced to tears in embarrassment, looking angry, embarrassed and humiliated all at once. You and Mark look at each other, than burst out laughing. Molly looks like she's about to spit fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour laughter dies down, and you look up at her accusing face:<br>\r\n\"Sorry Molly, but I owed you that one.\" you inform her. She shifts her glare to Mark:<br>\r\n\"And what's your excuse?\" she asks him, eyes glittering. He looks back innocently:<br>\r\n\"There was this incident at the mall involving some undies, a forged signature and a very obnoxious daughter laughing behind me the whole way.\" With that, he starts laughing again, and you join in. She growls and punches him, and she looks at you with a dangerous light in her eyes. You stop laughing and start to get worried. She grins evilly and abruptly tilts her paw, sending you plummeting into space. You fall for a few moments before you hit her other paw, which was positioned below you. You recover from the abrupt terror and the impact and glare up at her:<br>\r\n\"Bully!\" you mock shout up at her, waving one fist, \"using unfair advantages to silence the voice of ridicule!\" She just grins at you, no longer looking mischievous. Smiling and laughing with good humor, the three of you make your way into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Molly and Mark sit down and put their feet up on the living room table. You recline on Molly's thigh and look up at the two. Molly turns to Mark:<br>\r\n\"So dad, why'd you get home so early?\" she asks him. He looks at her:<br>\r\n\"I got done at the office early.\" he informs her. He looks at you:<br>\r\n\"So Keane, how was school with Molly? I hope this maniac didn't get you into to much trouble.\" he adds with a sly grin. Molly squawks indignantly, and you chuckle. You consider your answer, than look at Mark:<br>\r\n\"Seriously though, Molly wasn't that bad. A little playful maybe, but certainly not crazy. A lot of the others though, weren't as considerate.\" He nods grimly, and Molly's face darkens. Molly bursts out:<br>\r\n\"I didn't know so many of the people there, especially the teachers, were such jerks!\" Mark looks at his daughter blandly, and you know that there's a lecture coming:<br>\r\n\"It's hard to call these people jerks, Molly.\" he has his best \"wise father\" look on. \"Quite a few of the greatest philosophers, artists, wolfists, charity workers and philanthropists have been bigoted against humans. This is not to say,\" he says, glancing at you, \"that such prejudice is condonable, or that the resulting actions have ever been less than horrifying. It is just that most wolves, and the other races two, can't seem to handle thinking about creatures so small as intellectual equals or even as sentient beings. It just seems to make them madder when confronted by it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finishes his lecture and looks at both of you steadily. You nod reluctantly, what he's saying makes sense. Molly also seems to accept it, but she doesn't look very happy about it. He suddenly looks less serious:<br>\r\n\"And that's my word of wisdom for today, folks.\" You and Molly just stare at him. He sighs: \"Okay, that wasn't a very good joke. Still, there are a lot of people like this, so you have to be careful. Just keep your head down in normal society, and you can talk freely with understanding people, like me.\"<br>\r\n\"Or Amanda.\" you offer. He looks surprised:<br>\r\n\"Amanda? Oh, you must've met her at school. Now that I think about it though, you're right. She never did strike me as the type to disregard human intelligence. She's just too smart.\" Molly glares at him, and he hastily adds, \"and nice also.\" Molly sighs, but you know you've gotten through to her. Mark looks at the clock: \"Cathleen and Billy will be home soon, so please avoid more family conflict.\" He looks at you and you shudder, remembering their attitudes towards you. Molly gets up and heads towards the stairs with you.</span></div></div>",

She flings her backpack onto her bed, where it bounces up and down accompanied by metallic BOING's. She goes over and sits down herself. She puts you down on the bed and you watch as she fluffs up her pillows. You feel the rush of air as she swings her legs up, leaving her sitting on the bed with her back on the headboard. You walk over to her. She is rummaging through her backpack, and draws out a book. You stop below her. She looks at you and smiles:<br>\r\n\"Come on up!\" she invites you. She reclines a little. You look with some trepidation at the difficult climb ahead, than get to work. You climb up her leg, using her jeans for handholds. She watches you, smiling. You wait for a moment, catching your breath, than look up at her:<br>\r\n\"Any chance of getting some help?\" you ask, already knowing the answer. She just shakes her head slowly, looking thoroughly entertained. You reach her shirt and she leans back a little more. You start to ascend her torso. You struggle your way past her navel, than her stomach. You get to just below her chest and look up. Her breasts are looming in front of you, miniature hills with a valley between them. You see her grinning face through that valley. She looks slightly sympathetic as you wait there to catch your breath:<br>\r\n\"You know, you could wait there if you like.\" she offers. You grimly shake your head. You've come this far, you'll go all the way. You continue you're climb, gradually coming between her breasts. Suddenly, the hills loom closer and you get enveloped in her shirt and squeezed between her breasts. You squirm for a moment before sitting still. You can't get out of this without some help. You're warm prison suddenly draws back and you remain between her breasts with her looking down at you, grinning even wider. You wave good-naturedly at her; it was certainly more pleasant than some of her tricks. You keep moving until you reach her shoulder, where you stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straightens out to an almost-sitting position. She draws her knees up and puts her book on the resulting incline. You look down as she opens it and immediately recognize her geometry book. You look at her:<br>\r\n\"I thought we finished geometry.\" you tell her. She turns towards you, looking annoyed:<br>\r\n\"We only got through some of it, okay? So you'll have to help me with this as well, so I will teach you to read. Got it?\" she snaps, looking angry. You contain your feelings and look at her steadily. She looks startled, obviously excepting a bigger reaction. She sighs:<br>\r\n\"It just makes me so angry, I'm not very good at this stuff and she assigns SO much homework. So you help me and that just makes it worse because...\" She stops suddenly, looking mortified. You struggle to control your emotions, with limited success:<br>\r\n\"Because I'm so small or because I'm human? is that what you meant to say?\" You let a ;pt of anger into your voice, you sound level and very cold, for maximum effect. She visibly flinches and looks very, very guilty:<br>\r\n\"Keane, that's not what I meant, I...\" you interrupt her:<br>\r\n\"You what Molly? You meant to say something else? Like what? No, I don't think so. I think this is an accurate picture of how you really feel.\" Your words hit her like blows; she almost shrinks as you accuse her. You stop shouting, panting from you're volume and the anger in your system. She starts to sob, and she covers her eyes with her paws. You look at her in disgust:<br>\r\n\"And now you're crying to.\" You shake your head. Within the confines of your brain, two reasonable voices, one stating that you shouldn\u2019t hurt her like this, another saying that when she recovers you're going to get eaten, try to get your attention, but you ignore them. You slide down her arm onto the bed, than walk away from her. So mad now that you're seeing red, you manage to jump to the nightstand. You rip off your collar and drop it to the ground, stamping on it. Molly sobs even louder. You stamp off away from her, still blinded by fury. You manage to cross her desk and are confronted by a bookshelf. You climb a conveniently placed cord to the top. You stamp across this to, fury ebbing but still present. You're confronted by a wall. Suddenly, you hear a great gale and are hit on the side with the force of a hammer. You stumble towards the edge. Looking back, panicked, you see an enormous vent, which is pumping out warm air furiously, pushing you towards the edge of the shelves. Your arms windmill as you reach the edge, you\u2019re confronted by an 11 story drop, which is sure to kill you. You panic and try to get back inwards, but the vent pushes relentlessly. With one last, despairing squawk, you begin to fall...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You fall through the air. Dreamy lassitude has come over you, and time seems to slow down. You review your life, carefully inspecting it. You see childhood memories, school pranks and everything else as you're life \"flashes before your eyes\". You remember molly, kind to you in a world that doesn't tolerate that. You remember her angry, both at and for you. Above all you remember her playfulness, which doesn't seem that bad now that you reflect. You wince as you remember all the times you hurt her, regretting them all, especially this last one. You wish you could apologize. A logical and pessimistic part of your brain says that you could've survived if you had, but it goes deeper. You've only known her for two days, but you've already formed a deep bond with her. You think of her more dearly than any \"girlfriend\" on earth. You dimly hear the voice shouting at you again, but you tell it to shut up. You like this state, no anger, just peace. The world starts to go faster, and you think you hear a despairing voice shriek:<br>\r\n\"Keane!\" you dismiss it, you just hop molly won't feel two guilty. As you close your eyes and wait for the end, not liking the view of watching the bookshelf raced, you are suddenly buffeted by a sudden just. You hear a gigantic THUD, and sluggishly wonder what's going on. Then, you hit a surface and expect death...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut death doesn't come. You bounce several times than come to a rest on Molly's pad. You look to the side and see molly's face, wet with tears yet somehow radiant with relief. She's breathing heavily, breaths coming in high pitched, hysterical laughter. You lay motionless for a while, than look at the bed. It looks like a tornado hit it, with sheets strewn everywhere and the geometry book lying open on the floor. You try to picture what happened. Molly must've seen you fall and launched herself off the bed under you, hitting the wall with her back, all so she could catch and save you. Looking again at the wall, and the slight imprint in it, you mentally wince. That must\u2019ve HURT! You are drained of anger, having had a near-death experience. You struggle to sit up and call:<br>\r\n\"Molly.\" weakly. Just then, the pain hits you. You feel as if every piece of you're body is on fire, all you're bones broken. You emit a pained groan, because you can't get a scream out.. Molly sits up slowly, her gaze immediately going to you:<br>\r\n\"Keane!\" she says urgently. She sits up quickly and cradles you in her lap. This movement sends whole waves of agony through your system and this time you do manage to get out a scream. You see star and know nothing but pain for an eternity. You nearly black out several times and you completely forget everything but the pain. After an eternity of pain, you notice a persistent nagging, but comforting, sound. You draw your conciosness back up from the debths of pain. After more pain you manage to open your eyes. You see Molly's worried face hovering above you. You groan and try to sit up. The plain flairs for a moment, than starts to ebb. You manage to get into a sitting position, craning you're neck to keep you're eyes on her. She looks vastly relieved:<br>\r\n\"Keane, you're alive\" she says softly, as she cradles you. You nod to her:<br>\r\n\"I hurt to much to be dead.\" you inform her. She looks worried:<br>\r\n\"Is anything broken?\" she asks. You experimentally shift all you're muscles. They all hurt like hell, but all seem to work. You shake your head and she looks enormously relieved. You wait in apprehension of the confrontation sure to come. You can see the soaked fur around her eyes, she doesn't seem to cry well. Her eyes are puffy and you can remember the vast hurt you inflicted on her. Already your pains are down to a body wide dull ache and you try to struggle to your feet. She immediately closes her claws, forming a cage above you too low to let you stand. She scolds you:<br>\r\n\"You shouldn\u2019t move\" You wave her off and stand. She reluctantly opens her paw and you make it to your feet. You look up at her:<br>\r\n\"You saved my life.\" You say simply. She lets out a breath and nods. She can't argue with that. You go on:<br>\r\n\"I really shouldn\u2019t have said those things. I was deliberately hurtful to you, and you didn't deserve it.\" you don't ask her to forgive you. She just stares at you for a while. You look around, noticing for the first time that she moved to her bed while you were out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your gaze rests on your discarded collar. You know what to do.<br>\r\n\"Molly.\" you call, and point to the nightstand. She looks at you, startled and uncomprehending. She moves you closer and tenderly puts you on the shelf. You slowly and painfully move yourself to the collar, feeling Molly's eyes on you. You carefully reach down and pick up the collar. You hear Molly's breath catch, but do not turn. You carefully smooth out the silvery fur and gently reach up. You tie it around your own neck and turn around. Molly is looking at you in wonderment, tears standing out in her eyes. She reaches for you, carefully untying your knot and retying the collar more snugly in her wolves' knot. She moves her paws away, but you grab one claw and hold it tight. You hug her paw and she gently hugs you back. She picks you up again and brings you to her face, where you stare at each other awkwardly. Finally, molly sighs and starts petting you:<br>\r\n\"I guess I've got some prejudice left. I really shouldn\u2019t, I'm really, really sorry Keane.\" You respond:<br>\r\n\"I'm the one who should be sorry Molly. I hurt you so bad, on purpose. I deserve all the pain I got.\" As you say this, a fierce glint shows in her eye. She brings you closer, speaking firmly:<br>\r\n\"Keane, don't ever say that. It's ridiculous!\" You nod in trepidation as she seems to get angry. She smiles softly. She continues to pet you, than goes on:<br>\r\n\"Never did I expect such intelligence from you, you're just so cute!\" she seems mesmerized, but then draws a breath quickly. She looks at you, guilty and awaiting your reaction. You look up at her:<br>\r\n\"You, you think I'm cute?\" you ask her. The veil between you rips away as she smiles, a cheerful, bright smile that fills you up to bursting. She nods:<br>\r\n\"UMMM HMMM!\" she tells you. You both smile at each other for a while, until she reaches for her book:<br>\r\n\"Shall we go back to what we were doing?\" she asks you. You nod and she draws back up into that position, and you help her complete her geometry, all the while staying close to her neck as she pets you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Molly finishes the problem with relief. She looks at you. You had helped her with this last one, and you nods when you see the answer. She beams with triumph and gratitude and closes the book with an enormous SNAP. The air rushes upwards, a pleasant breeze in the still air. Molly sets it aside and looks at you sideways:<br>\r\n\"Up for a language lesson?\" she asks you.  You nod carefully; the pain has subsided to a dull ache. She looks suspicious, but lets it pass. She reaches into her backpack and takes out a notebook. She opens to a blank page, refills her claw pen and begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of your first lesson, you've decided that this wasn't such a good idea. Molly begins by drawing the wolfish alphabet. That's where the trouble starts. It has 43 characters, and has four cases, not all of which are applied to every letter. Furthermore, it is not phonetic. The wolves speak your language, but they don't use your alphabet. The different characters combine to form the sounds used by the 26 letter alphabet. M, for instance, when spelled phonetically, is a combination of 4 characters in 3 of the cases. All of the letters are like that when wolves write. And, to make matters worse, when put in an alphabet the letters have individual names, none of which have anything to do with how their pronounced. At one point, while you are standing on the notebook looking up at Molly, you burst out:<br>\r\n\"Who invented this screwed up system of writing?\" you demand in frustration. Molly stares at you and chuckles, amused. You redden, \"sorry,\" you mutter, looking away. She laughs and pets you for a moment. She smiles:<br>\r\n\"As to your question, I don't know. I'll look it up on the net.\" She returns to the writing lesson. You find that she is a very strict teacher. At one point you beg her to stop:<br>\r\n\"Molly, enough! My brain feels like it's going to explode!\" Your head does hurt. Molly pauses for a moment, glances at you, than keeps writing and narrating to you. You throw up your hands in disgust and turn around. You start walking away, but Molly's other paw suddenly blocks your path. You try to walk around it, but she moves with you. It moves towards you and pushes you back. She is very gentle, but infinitely stronger than you are. You are forced back around and scooted, still gently, back towards the writing. You glare up at her. You catch a glimpse of mirth on her face, but it is quickly wiped away into a stern expression:<br>\r\n\"Keane, if you want to learn how to write wolfish, you're going to have to work with me.  We need to cover this. Now, as I was saying...\" she continues, though you catch a glint in her eye, showing amusement. You reluctantly return to the lesson. Molly's paw stays with you for a while, then relaxes and pulls back. Finally, after a period way too long for you, Molly stops. She looks at you:<br>\r\n\"Think you've got it?\" you would have to be crazy to say no:<br>\r\n\"Barely.\" She grins:<br>\r\n\"Good, because there's going to be a quiz next time\" she says in a mocl-stern voice. You prepare to vent your outrage at her, but she grins wider:<br>\r\n\"Just kidding!\" she laughs and you laugh to, relieved. You stop when your body starts to hurt again. She looks sympathetic:<br>\r\n\"Does it hurt?\" she asks. You nod. She frowns:<br>\r\n\"That\u2019s it mister, no more work for you. Light activity and bed rest only. Owner's orders.\" she adds when you look like you might object. You swallow your words. She does have a point, you do hurt, but she has to say it like that? She notices the look:<br>\r\n\"Hey, you put the collar on. That means you have to listen to Me.\" she points out. You nod, conceding the point. You put it on, to show you trust her. You have to trust her now to. You decide to change the subject:<br>\r\n\"Uh, Molly?\" she looks down at you:<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" she asks curiously. You point towards the bathroom. She nods: \"Okay.\" she gets up and heads into the bathroom. She sets you in the sink and passes you some tissue. She then stares down at you. You glare up at her:<br>\r\n\"Do you mind?\" you ask sarcastically. She turns around. You go quickly, and then get Molly's attention. She picks you up carefully and runs water. She then heads out into her room. She looks at you:<br>\r\n\"Wanna listen to some music?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" you reply, intrigued. She gets out a stereo. She opens a case, revealing a C.D. She puts this in and music immediately blares out. You cover your ears and she turns it down. She tells you about the band, and album, and you spend the next hour or so critiquing her collection, which runs from ordinary to truly bizarre music.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You listen as the end lyrics of a slow, eerie song that is filled with howls comes to an end. You look up at Molly, who was listening raptly. She looks down at you and grins:<br>\r\n\"Interesting, don't you think?\" she asks<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure. Whatever.\" you mutter to yourself. Of course, she heard you and pretends to be hurt:<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with it?\" she asks you.\" You consider your answer carefully:<br>\r\n\"Uh, it was just, uh, weird.\"\" you fumble through awkwardly. She snorts:<br>\r\n\"Weird, huh? Well, you're right. They are weird. But GOOD weird, no what I mean?\" You nod your head, totally clueless. She rolls her eyes heavenwards and mutters something that distinctly sounds like \"boys!\" You chuckle. She rolls her eyes again and picks you up. She swings her legs off the bed and stands up. She looks down at you:<br>\r\n\"We're going out.\" She reaches over to the nightstand and opens the eighth drawer of your dresser. She removes some rope, which you recognize as your harness. Strange that you didn\u2019t notice her putting it in. She puts you down on the nightstand so she can tie it around her neck. She then moves for you. You are about to lift your arms when you have a dark thought:<br>\r\n\"Molly, is this a leash?\" you ask her, watching her face. Her expression is all the confirmation you need, though she quickly stammers out a negative:<br>\r\n\"N-no Keane, It's just a harness.\" You just look at her, arms crossed over your chest, waiting for her to cave. She doesn't go easily: \"Keane, can you just put it on.\" You don't budge. She starts to shift from one paw to the other. You meet her eyes and enter a staring contest, part of you thinking that this might not be a good idea, she usually wins. This time however, after a period of tense silence, she looks away:<br>\r\n\"Alright Keane, pretty much everyone sees it that way. Now will you just let me put it on?\" she sounds exasperated. You smile and uncross your arms, lifting them so she can tie. She brings her head close to keep the line slack. You look at her seriously:<br>\r\n\"Molly, I don't object that much to having this thing on. It's doesn't even compare to the collar. But please, be honest. You think of it that way too.\" She flinches, which sends you stumbling. You right yourself and wait for an answer. It comes swiftly:<br>\r\n\"Fine Keane, I think of it as a leash. You think of it as a leash. Everyone thinks of it as a leash. Can we go now?\" She sounds even more frustrated. You nod:<br>\r\n\"Okay, I just needed to know.\" She looks a bit happier, and sets you on her shoulder. She makes her way downstairs and walks out the door, with you standing on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes her way down the street, heading into the center of town. You take in the enormous sights and absently run your hand through the soft fur around her neck. Other people are walking around or working in their yards. They call out hellos and wave to another, and chat in quite a few places. Several of them call out to Molly. She waves back, but doesn\u2019t stop. It could be any other town setting, had it not been that it was filled with gigantic wolves. As she gets farther away from her house, she gets fewer greetings. Eventually she makes her way into the shopping areas. Stores line the sidewalk, portraying wares in their windows. You look in as Molly walks. There are a lot of meat shops, and other Wolvish things. A school supplies store shows the Wolvish pen on a sign, and everywhere there is Wolvish on the signs. You glance at these as Molly keeps walking. You can make out individual letters and there case, but can\u2019t tell the words. You sigh. Molly glances at you questioningly. You explain:<br>\r\n\u201dI still can\u2019t read the signs.\u201d You explain. She laughs:<br>\r\n\u201dI wouldn\u2019t think so, you\u2019re not really all that literate yet.\u201d She says this kindly, but it still stings a little. You nod, but it shows on your face. She adds hastily: \u201cNo offense.\u201d You relax a little. She seems preoccupied, her face concentrated. You venture:<br>\r\n\u201dSomething on your mind?\u201d She looks at you quickly:<br>\r\n\u201dNot really, well, I guess so.\u201d You prompt her:<br>\r\n\u201dAnd?\u201d She grimaces:<br>\r\n\u201dI was just thinking that it was odd, the way you reacted to the leash. I mean, I didn\u2019t even make it out of my fur, which I could\u2019ve you know.\u201d She waits expectantly. You consider the question, and answer:<br>\r\n\u201dIt\u2019s still humiliating Molly. It always will be. However, it wouldn\u2019t be so bad if you were honest about it.\u201d She flinches at that:<br>\r\n\u201dWhat do you mean?\u201d she asks, sounding dejected. You answer:<br>\r\n\u201dIt would be better if you told me the truth. It\u2019s already humiliating enough, without you trying to keep it hidden.\u201d She looks even more guilty:<br>\r\n\u201dSorry Keane, I\u2019ll try to be honest next time.. I just feel bad, telling you stuff like that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNext time?\u201d you ask, puzzled. She looks at you sadly:<br>\r\n\u201dWe\u2019ll deal with that when we come to it.\u201d She informs you. This entire conversation seems to have made her miserable, and you feel a little guilty. You hug her nexk one armed, speaking almost directly into her ear:<br>\r\n\u201dCheer up; it\u2019s not so bad, now that you\u2019ve told me.\u201d She perks up and presses her cheek into you for a moment as she walks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach your destination, a pharmacy by the pill sign. Molly walks in. You find yourself in a well lit, wide space. The counter is right in front of the door, but you see rows of shelves behind it.  A soft bell rings and a wolf comes to the counter. His eyes take in Molly, and then he spots you. His lips curl back slightly from his teeth in an expression of distaste and your heart sinks. This will not be pleasant for you. Molly doesn\u2019t seem to notice and walks over. She addresses the wolf:<br>\r\n\u201dSir, do you have anything that can relieve pain and promote muscle and bone repair?\u201d she asks him. You realize that this is for you and make a note to thank molly. A painkiller sounds excellent. The shopkeeper looks at her in disgust:<br>\r\n\u201dIs it for that?\u201d he asks her, pointing an accusatory claw at you. You hear Molly\u2019s breath catch and can practically feel her getting angry. Her voice remains calm though:<br>\r\n\u201dYes, it\u2019s for him.\u201d She stresses the last word. You notice the man looking at you like you\u2019d look at a dirty rat. It makes you angry, although you have an easier time keeping calm. He looks at Molly:<br>\r\n\u201dWe don\u2019t carry things for humans.\u201d He spits the last word out, \u201cI advise you to go see a vet.\u201d Molly clenches her fists, boiling mad. She looks him straight in the eye:<br>\r\n\u201dMaybe I will, jerk off. He probably would be more competent than you.\u201d She spins around abruptly; almost making you fall off, and walks out of the store. On the sidewalk, she walks out of sight before stopping and breathing heavily. Her pupils are dilated again, and you think she\u2019s going to explode. You grab a strand of fur and pull hard. Her paw comes up reflexively and almost hits you, but you throw yourself to her shoulder. You look at her neck and see that she hit her neck, she almost swatted you! She starts breathing normally and looks at you:<br>\r\n\u201dYou okay?\u201d she asks, removing her paw. You nod and stand up, aching from her hard shoulder. She isn\u2019t in a blind rage, but she\u2019s still mad. She stomps down the street until she comes to another shop, which she enters, nearly slamming the door. She walks up to an elderly wolf woman, who seems to be reading. She looks up at molly:<br>\r\n\u201dCan I help you?\u201d she asks calmly. Molly nods and reaches up quickly. She snatches you off her shoulder and holds you out, leash extending to her neck:<br>\r\n\u201dHe needs some pain relief and muscle repair stuff. Do you have any?\u201d She is acting very aggressive. The lady peers down at you, than nods. She goes over to a shelf and picks out a bottle. She hands it to Molly:<br>\r\n\u201dIt\u2019s a lotion, to be rubbed into dry skin. I\u2019ll ring you up.\u201d She goes over to the counter, where she pounds a few keys and a piece of paper comes out. She puts this down for molly to sign, which she does. As she is about to leave, the lady adds:<br>\r\n\u201dI see by your expression you ran into that old fart, Sturve. Ignore him, he\u2019s an idiot.\u201d Molly looks a bit calmer and nods gratefully. The lady smiles, than goes back into the store. Molly puts you back on her shoulder and heads out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you sideways:<br>\r\n\u201dSorry about the rough treatment, I was just angry.\u201d You wave her off:<br>\r\n\u201dits okay.\u201d She nods and heads over to a fast food joint. She buys some cheeseburgers and sets to devouring them while she\u2019s walking home. You watch her eat for a little while, than tap her. She glances at you, than tries to speak. It comes out a mumble and she sprays you with hamburger bits. You grimace and wipe these off. She swallows, an extended lump on her neck, than tries again:<br>\r\n\u201dSorry. Want some?\u201d You nod gratefully. She reaches up and offers you the one she\u2019s eating. It\u2019s got teeth marks on it, and it\u2019s dripping wit saliva. It looks thoroughly unappetizing, but you accept it, using your hands to tear off a chunk as big as your torso, with Molly\u2019s help. You sit down on her swaying shoulder and eat it, trying not to notice the teeth marks and saliva. It\u2019s actually pretty good, better than fast-food on earth. When she\u2019s done she looks hungrily at you\u2019re chunk. You\u2019re done, so you offer it to her. She grabs it and chucks it into her mouth. She jogs home with you on her shoulder.</span></div></div>",

You watch as she opens the door and heads insider. She looks around:<br>\r\n\"Mom, dad?\" She calls as she walks through the downstairs rooms. In the kitchen she finds Billy, eating some raw meat. His snout is covered in blood and he has that crazed look. Molly walks over to him and you enjoy being able to look down at him. He comes out of it when he sees Molly:<br>\r\n\"Mom and dad went out.\" He says his mouth full. Some chewed up meat sprays out at Molly, who grimaces and wipes them off her shirt, leaving red stains. She glares at Billy:<br>\r\n\"Watch the merchandise, squirt.\" He just sniggers. He sees you and his eyes gleam hungrily. He stares at you and you take a step back, nervous. He gets a malicious expression:<br>\r\n\"You leashed it! Good, now it knows its place! An even better one would be here.\" He says, pointing at his blood-smeared plate. He stares at you hungrily and malevolently, wanting to see your reaction. You quickly move closer to Molly and see her get angry. She growls and looks down at Billy, who looks apprehensive. Her paw snaps out and she hooks her claws into his shirt. With a grunt of effort she lifts him bodily to his feet, nearly off the ground. He looks scared now, and you enjoy it. Not being an idiot, you keep it off your face. Molly starts shaking him. She starts speaking:<br>\r\n\"Listen to me you brat,\" she says her voice slow and furious. You quail at it, and so does Billy, \"Keane is not an 'it'. He does not have a 'place'. You got that? Now, you will never bother me, or him, again. And, most especially, you won't even HINT about eating him. Is that clear?\" Billy nods furiously. Molly lets go and he falls to the ground with a thump. He falls on his butt, sending a small shockwave up to you through Molly's body. You look down at him. He is staring sullenly up at Molly. Molly turns around. Looking back, you see her lash her tail against Billy's plate, which sends it tumbling onto Billy's head. He gets covered in blood, and Molly flicks her tail across his blood-smeared snout, which leaves a streak of red on her tail. She walks slowly towards the stairs, head high, not looking back. You do look back. You se Billy get up and brush himself off. He glares at Molly and fixes you with a glare of pure hatred. Then Molly goes up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in her room, Molly starts to giggle. She tries to stifle it, but it becomes full blown laughter. You look up in shock as she raises her head, laughing at the ceiling. You really can't see what's so funny. She doubles over suddenly, howling with laughter. Unfortunately for you, this launches you off her shoulder, outward and downwards. You come to a rest near her paws. The snap of the leash causes you to cry out in pain, it amplifies your other injuries. Molly stops laughing and stands straight. She picks you off her chest and holds you on her pad. She looks down in concern:<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" she asks you. You nod:<br>\r\n\"What was so funny?\" you ask her, perplexed. She wipes away a tear and replies:<br>\r\n\"I've wanted to do that all day.\" She informs you, grinning widely. She starts jumping up and down in exuberance. You feel the stress on your body, you feel like you pulled a few G\u2019s. You smile as she bounces around, knowing how she feels. Someone who was nasty to humans got what was coming to him! You share the moment with her, until the bouncing starts to get painful. You wince, and Molly notices. She bounces, lightly over to the bed and flings herself down. She grins down at you for a moment, but then she emits a small shriek and twists around. You see that her bloodstained tail has left a smear on the blanket. She curses loudly:<br>\r\n\u201dShit! Now I have to wash that!\u201d She springs up immediately, looking alarmed. This is painful for you, but you bear it. She looks back at the blankets and looks annoyed. She groans and reaches down with her other paw. She picks up the blankets and walks towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She enters the bathroom and stuffs them down the chute. She looks down the chute for a moment, giving you a good view of her snout. Then she looks down at you and you look into her liquid blue eyes. She smiles:<br>\r\n\u201dI have to wash my tail, want to help?\u201d She is looking mischievous, so you look suspiciously up at her:<br>\r\n\u201dWhat are you up to?\u201d you ask her. Her eyes widen, and she pretends to look hurt:<br>\r\n\u201dMe? What ever do you mean? What makes you think I\u2019m up to something?\u201d You groan and shake your head. She just grins and moves for the sink. She puts you down, and then moves back a little. Unfortunately for you, the leash goes taught and you are dragged into the empty air (again).  You bounce up against her breast before you come to a rest, twisting in the air. You twist your torso around and glare up at her:<br>\r\n\u201dDid you do that on purpose?\u201d you demand. She shakes her head:<br>\r\n\u201dNo, I\u2019m sorry. It was forgetful of me. Here.\u201d She reaches down and plucks you out of the air. She gets on her knees and puts you on the sink at eye level. You stare at her head, which is resting on the counter. She reaches up and unties you, then unties herself. She props her chin up on her paws and stares at you. You wait for her to speak, and she does:<br>\r\n\u201dKeane, you sure you want to do this?\u201d She sounds concerned. You grin and puff out your chest:<br>\r\n\u201dOf course, I can take anything you give.\u201d You boast. She grins even more mischievously:<br>\r\n\u201dWe\u2019ll see.\u201d She promises. She stands up again and you look up at her towering form. Then she turns around, and you\u2019re looking directly at her butt, with her tail right above. She grabs the counter with her paws and lifts herself onto the counter. You quickly try to scramble out of the way, but it\u2019s too late. Her tail swishes in for you and hits your chest. It sweeps you along, curling to get to her front. You grab hold of the gray fur and unsuccessfully try to scramble up. She ends her swish to her right, lifted in the air above the white counter. She grins down at you and your efforts to keep holding on. You start to tip downwards, about to fall, but she flicks her tail and you tumble onto her tail. You find yourself on top, and you hug the tail for all your worth. She giggles:<br>\r\n\u201dCan you still take it?\u201d She asks. You want to give up, but won\u2019t allow it. You look up, not loosening your grip:<br>\r\n\u201dOf course.{\u201c You gasp out, holding on for dear life. She extends you out over the sink and the bloody fur, which is closer to the tip, is directly under the faucet. She reaches over you, her arm casting a shadow on you, and turns on the faucet. Water gushes out and you get sprayed. Her tail dips from the wait, but she keeps it aloft. She turns off the water and looks down at you:<br>\r\n\u201dWell, get to work.\u201d She orders imperiously. She points towards the wet part. You grimly start to slink your way towards it. You are surrounded by her fur, which is fluffy and often obscures your view with a silvery field. Finally you reach the blood. You look down in apprehension at the red, wet stuff. You swallow nervously and twist your head. Molly looks at you, than sees your apprehension. She looks understanding and starts to reach for you. You shake your head swiftly and get started. You wring out all the fur with blood in it, twisting them in your grasp as the red stuff oozes down into the sink. You get covered in blood, but move on grimly. You start to get tired, and eventually Molly stops you:<br>\r\n\u201dThat\u2019s great Keane, I can do the rest.\u201d She reaches over and carefully picks you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sets you in her lap and quickly does the rest herself. You watch her, and then notice the blood getting into her jeans. You slide off quickly, leaving a red smear. She looks down in concern:<br>\r\n\u201dWhat is it.\u201d You point towards her jeans. She shakes her head:<br>\r\n\u201dIts okay, there going to be washed anyways. You, on the other hand, need a bath. You stink of pig!\u201d You grimace. Molly prepares a bat and strips you. You could\u2019ve done it yourself, but she likes it. She also washes your collar. You let her massage the soap into you, relaxed and content. Finally she lifts you out of the bubbles and peers down in concern at your naked body:<br>\r\n\u201dStill hurt?\u201d She asks. You nod wearily, too tired to think. She pulls out the tube of lotion and takes off the cap. She dries you off thoroughly, and then applies it to every inch of your body. You relax, letting the cool substance take the pain away. It does, to remarkable effect. She rubs it firmly into your skin. You nearly doze off right there, but she hops off the counter and looks down, her head cocked and her eyes puzzled:<br>\r\n\u201dYou ready for bed?\u201d She asks. You nod dreamily. She grabs the leash and collar and heads into her room. She gently lays you on the pillow and you relax into the soft surface. She smiles:<br>\r\n\u201dGood night Keane.\u201d She presses her cheek into you for a moment, nuzzling you. You relax into the warm pressure. She withdraws and you intend to say goodnight to, and wait for her to come to bed. You do neither, because you nod off immediately.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're in Molly's pad, looking up at Molly. You take in her billboard sized face; liquid blue eyes and long snout. She is grinning and laughing, and so are you, everything\u2019s all right. Suddenly, you take note of your surroundings. You\u2019re in her enormous kitchen, space surrounding you. Molly's laughter suddenly turns cruel, and her grin mischievous and malicious. You back away in fear, but you get to the edge. You step into space, but desperately grab onto one of her claws, which is suddenly sharp. You cry out in pain from the cuts in your hand. You look pleadingly up at Molly, but she just smirks maliciously and tips her paw. You scramble to hold on, but she flicks her claw. You fall for an eternity, looking at Molly, who recedes into a titaness, towering into the sky. With a THUD you hit. You feel instant pain and nearly black out. You remain conscious and look around. You're on a black landscape, with long holes in the ground everywhere. You realize with a shock that you're on a grill. You look up franticly and see Molly with her palm on the dial. With another malicious smile she twists the knob. You scream as flames leap up around you, burning you, searing you. It is more painful than anything you could've imagined. You are screaming, and you can see you're body browning before your very eyes. You lie on your back, the metal burning into you. All you can see is flame. You hear you sizzle in your own grease. Suddenly, a metal object is put under you and you're lifted up. You continue to scream from pain, even as you see Molly lick her chops. She flips the spatula and you fall back into that hell. Your front burns now, but for some reason you can see. You feel her press the spatula into you, forcing you into the metal. After an eternity of pain and burning, she lifts you up. She dumps you on her plate, where you lie, grease pooling outwards. You smell smoke from your own skin. Then Molly carries you to a table and sits down. She looks down at you hungrily. Except it isn't Molly, It's Billy and he's staring at you fixedly. His snout is covered in blood and his eyes have a crazed and extremely cruel look. You also see Cathleen, and looking onwards you see a long table, surrounded by Wolves, Bears and Great Cats. You hazily see some other plates with humans on them, being feasted on by the guests. You feel Billy spear you with one claw, driving into your stomach. You scream mentally in pain as he lifts you in front of his face. He smiles maliciously:<br>\r\n\"Should've kept to your place.\" he tells you. He opens his mouth, revealing bloodstained, very sharp teeth. He opens wide and you see his esophagus, a black hole. You manage one little squeak he lowers you to his mouth. He sets your head between two of his teeth and bights a little on your neck. He lifts his teeth. Then he bites your head off....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up, panting furiously, your naked body covered in sweat. There's a weight covering most of your body like a blanket. You hear Molly's regular breathing and relax a little. Your eyes adjust to the darkness and you see you\u2019re under Molly\u2019s chin, her paw covering you. She's curled up on her side again. You lay still for a moment, calming down. You immediately reject going back to sleep, so you decide to get up. You try to crawl out from under her paw, but it\u2019s too tight. You put your palms on her pad and heave from the shoulders. It\u2019s REALLY heavy, and you grunt with effort. You manage to get it up about six inches, enough for you to get out between her thumb and index claws. You let go with a sigh of relief. The paw settles back into its depression in the pillow. You stand up, shaky on the soft and yielding pillow. You gaze falls on Molly\u2019s head. You\u2019re just barely tall enough to see over her chin. She looks very peaceful in sleep, smiling a little. You go over and touch her chin for a moment. Then you remember the dream, and her malicious smile. You shudder and pull away. You look down along her body. It\u2019s bathed in moonlight, revealing that she has scrunched the blankets up, curling them around her. It\u2019s very untidy, and you can see her silvery fur and loose shirt in some places. You see her tail swish in sleep before lying still. You wait for a moment, than turn. You walk over towards the nightstand, trying to rid yourself of the dream, and failing. You get to the edge of the bed and look over at the nightstand. There\u2019s a small crack between the furniture, barley more than a long step for you. You crouch some, ready to jump. Suddenly, you\u2019re view is blocked by a large, dark object. Molly angle\u2019s her paw and plucks you off the bed, leaving you reclining face down in her paw. Turning around, you see Molly\u2019s eyes are open and looking at you:<br>\r\n\u201dWhere are you off to?\u201d She asks you. She doesn\u2019t wait for an answer, she uses her other paw to reach over to the lamp and click it on. You are shielded from the light, and you see her blink from it.  She puts her elbow on the bed and rests the side of her head on her paw, looking at you. She waits expectantly. You swallow and speak:<br>\r\n\u201dI couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d You tell her. She smiles:<br>\r\n\u201dThat\u2019s a little obvious, Keane. Why, did you have a bad dream?\u201d  She looks a little sleepy, her voice is muffled. You don\u2019t want to talk about it, so you just nod and say:<br>\r\n\u201dYeah.\u201d You decide to add a little, \u201cIt was hot, to. You\u2019re paw was giving off heat.\u201d Her eyes open a little more, and you see the pupils scanning your body:<br>\r\n\u201dI can see that.\u201d She tells you appreciatively. You chuckle. She looks curious, so you explain:<br>\r\n\u201dEven this late you can still find time to make jokes.\u201d You tell her. She grins:<br>\r\n\u201dAny time, any place.\u201d She informs you. Just then, you remember the dream. Her eyes had done the same thing while she was cooking you. You shudder. She looks concerned:<br>\r\n\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d You lie. She gives you a reproving stare:<br>\r\n\u201dDon\u2019t \u2018nothing\u2019 me, Keane. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d She demands insistently, staring at you in concern. You look away, avoiding that coaxing look:<br>\r\n\u201dReally, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d She sighs, looking disappointed:<br>\r\n\u201dOkay Keane, I guess you don\u2019t want to talk about it. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.\u201d She gives you one last, long look, which you don\u2019t meet. She sighs, and then turns off the light with a click. She puts her head back down on the pillow and tilts you back onto the bed. You stumble for a moment, than look up. She\u2019s closed her eyes and is breathing steadily, her paw back on the pillow. You remain standing for a moment, your thoughts troubled. Should you have told her? You want to be honest with her, but this would just hurt her feelings. You tell yourself that you made the right choice, but it weighs heavily on your mind and a seed of doubt remains. You thrust the issue from your mind and go back to the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump over to the nightstand, landing heavily and nearly falling over. You straighten up and look around. You look at the dresser and the lamp, both towering over you. Having nothing better to do, you decide to look for her alarm clock. You walk in between the dresser and the lamp, trying not to think. You don\u2019t find it, and you search harder. You don\u2019t find anything that resembles an alarm clock, and you begin to get frustrated, Just as you\u2019re about to give up, your feet slip on a smooth surface. You go down and your butt hits the smooth wood. You feel a little pain, which passes. You get up, rubbing the sore appendage. Looking at the offending area, you see a smooth, glass surface with dim numbers on it set into the nightstand. Obviously you\u2019ve found the elusive alarm clock. You take a brief interest in the various buttons, all of which are twice as big as you\u2019re hand. You can\u2019t read any of the labels, being illiterate and in the dark, so the fascination fades and you sit down, you\u2019re hands around your knees, staring out at her vast room. In the moonlight you note her distant dresser to your left well as the bathroom and main doors. You also see a clutter of junk and several posters to the left of the door. You gaze silently at the enormous items, gigantic even in the distance, across the sea of her silvery pink carpet. Really puts things in perspective. This view gets depressing fast, and your uncovered skin gets Goosebumps from the cold. You shiver, get up and decide to go back to bed. You jump back onto the bed. You walk back up onto the pillow and feel the cold. You consider trying to get back under her paw, but you feel a flash of dread, remembered dreams. You settle for the area in front of her nose, looking towards the night stand. You lie down and curl into a ball, letting her warm breath wash over you. You are still very cold, and you shiver and hug yourself more tightly. You drift off to sleep again, thankfully with no dreams. You wake up for a split second and think you feel a warm weight settling on you, but you fall asleep before you can confirm it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You feel something gently shaking you. Your about to speak when you remember Molly, and everything else. It didn't take very long this time, you think. You open your eyes and are confronted by a view of Molly's large, black nose. She blows out, sending a breeze ruffling across your body. You stand up a little shakily and look around. Molly's paw had withdrawn by the time you opened your eyes. She uses it to pull the expanse of green that is her blanket off, exposing her oversized tee-shirt on her curled up body. She yawns loudly, and by reflex you look. You get a direct view of her gullet. You step back involuntarily, remembering the dream, and trip. You fall over and find yourself staring upwards at her distant ceiling. You get up again and look at Molly. She has closed her mouth and is staring at you sadly. Before you can say anything she sits up. You her stretch, then glance down at you. She still looks at you sadly, and you know why. You look away and you hear her sigh. She picks you up gently and deposits you on her nightstand. You wobble shakily, and then look at her. She gets up, towering over you, and walks over to her dresser. She grabs some clothes quickly, and then walks into the bathroom. You watch the door slam behind her, then turn towards your dresser. You open the drawers with some grunts, there a bit heavy, and grab some clothes, not really caring what you wear. The whole time your thoughts are troubled. She is obviously upset that you didn't tell her about your nightmare. She probably thinks I don't trust her, you realize. But will telling her make things better? You would only upset her more if you told her that SHE cooked you in your dream. While you\u2019re mulling this over, you dress distractedly. It isn't until you realize that you're trying to pull underwear over your head that you shake yourself out of your reverie. You take all the clothes off and try again. Your successful this time, and find yourself dressed in a light blue shirt and some green pants. The sound of water shuts off and Molly soon walks out, dressed in a red tee shirt and some black pants. Both items are baggy and don't complement her figure at all. You feel a little guilty; it's a symptom of her sadness. She gets to you and looks down at you. She just stares and you feel a little uncomfortable. She shakes her head and reaches down. She plucks you off the nightstand and holds you loosely at pants level. She turns and starts walking off. You think something\u2019s wrong, and after a moment you figure out what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly!\" You call. She swiftly brings you to her face and asks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Keane?\" She sounds eager and there's hope in her eyes. You look away and tell her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot the collar.\" You explain. If you hadn't been so dull and depressed, you might've been amazed that she'd forgotten this. Out of the corner of your eye you see the fire die in her eyes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" she says. She walks back to the stand. She puts you down and pulls the drawer out. She grabs your collar and ties it around your neck sloppily. It's loose and uncomfortable, but you don't complain. As an afterthought she grabs the leash from a drawer and picks you up again, pocketing the leash. She goes over to her bed and drops to her knees. She reaches under her bed and pulls out her backpack. You tumble around her loosely clenched paw during this. She straightens and then walks, dragging her paws, out of the room. She walks downstairs, holding you at pants level and seemingly content to let you bounce around in her paw. You get disjointed images of her house as she walks. She reaches the kitchen and sets you down on the table. She walks over to her dad, who's making breakfast. He kisses her cheek:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning sunshine.\" He says. He doesn't seem to notice her depression. He hands her a plate of bacon and eggs and she walks back over to you. She sits down and starts eating. You shift from foot to foot and she notices you. She looks down at her plate, and then grabs a piece of bacon. She tears off the end with tooth marks on it and hands it to you. It's still wet with saliva, but you hardly notice. You eat mechanically, like she does. When you\u2019re done she carries the plate to the sink. Mark looks at her: \"Sorry honey, but you have to take the bus today; I've got to go to work early.\" He gets a grunt from Molly in response. He kisses her again, and then walks out of the kitchen, saying in passing to you: \"Bye Keane.\" and patting you with a claw. You just watch him go. Molly comes back and picks you up again, loosely. She shoulders her backpack and walks out the door. You bounce around her paw as she walks across town to her bus sop. You're miserable the whole time. Besides being truly uncomfortable the whole time, you can't bare this silence. Molly's usually bright, playful personality is subdued and she walks slowly. The day is gray to, clouds covering the distant sky, reflecting the mood. You wrestle with yourself as she walks, hating the silence but not wanting to hurt Molly either. The deciding moment comes when she reaches the bus stop. She sits down on the curb, knees very high because of the low surface. Your grateful for the reprieve, but not for very long. She glances at you, depressed. You can't meet her eyes. She relaxes her arm, letting it fall to the curb. She releases you and you fall to the curb. You hit the pavement and feel sore for a moment, than stand up. You look at Molly. She has her elbows resting on her knees, and has her chin resting on her pads. She's staring outward, eyes distant and depressed. You can't take this any longer, you can't figure out which you hate worse, her depression or her indifference to you. You work up your courage for a few minutes and call:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly.\" She doesn't stir for a moment, then turns her head and looks at you depressed. You gulp, her eyes are really lackluster, the blue color almost gray. You tell her: \"We need to talk.\" She looks at you uncomprehendingly for a moment, then her eyes light up a little. She reaches for you eagerly. You shudder as her paw approaches, and she notices. She grabs you anyways, gently. She sets you on one knee; you wobble precariously on the high surface, than sit down. You take a deep breath and look at her. She\u2019s gazing down at you expectantly, a hopeful light in her eye. You start talking: \"Last night I had a nightmare, and it involved you.\" You see her open her mouth, horrified. She shuts it and looks at you with a determined eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened in your nightmare?\" She asks you. You answer, telling her everything, not leaving out a single detail. You see her eyes widen in horror, and tears form as you continue your tale. When you finish, telling her of Billy biting your head off, you sit there and wait. Her face goes through a multitude of details before setting on one. Anger. Who's she mad at?</span></div></div>",

You know whats coming and prepare for the worst, you take a few back from her offear of what might happen. As time passes on she says nothing to she just stare into the big gray clouded sky with those tear stained eyes of hers. You feel guilty for making her mad at you. You just watch her in silence trying to figure out away to make her feel better without making her more mad at you. A short time passes before you figure out your plan of action, but you feel a little scared of what her reaction might be, you finally build up enough courage to confront her. You walk towards her and stop a few step away from her, you take a deep breath while you are doing this you see her ears flick in your direction, but she doesn't move her head towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say softly \"Molly?\" she is still ignores you, you still continue any ways \"I don't blame you for getting mad at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves her gaze down to you and says \" Do really mean that Keane or are you just saying that to make me feel better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I really mean that Molly.\" you  answer.

You just smile up at her and she smile back at you. She starts to stand up and brushes herself off and picks you up and brings you at eye level, you see the light return to her liquid blue eyes. she burys you into her soft fur as she hugs you,you yell up to her \" Molly! I can breathe!\" she pulls away and lets you breathe. \"Sorry Keane, I wasn\"t thinking clearly again.\" you wave her off as you catch your breath. You hear loud sound coming towards Molly and you, you figure it is the bus. You turn around to see it stop right in front of you and Molly, she bends down and picks her backpack and start walk on the bus, you notice not alot wolfs are on today, Molly heads to the back of the bus,she sits down and set you on her lap, you think to yourself how forgiving Molly is and how kind she really towards you, you think to yourseif that you forgot where you where and when the bus stops you fall off Molly lap on to the seat with a THUD. Molly who was looking out the window turns too you with concern look in her eyes and says \"Are you okay Keane?\" you answer back \"Yeah just lost where I was for a second.\" Molly picks you up and bring you to eye level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe ask \" How did you do that now?\"  in a curious voice and she look a little confused. You tell her what happen and starts to giggle at some points of the story, at the end of tale she has tears of laughter in her and you don' t see whats so funny a bout it at all, but you let it slide. She trys not burst out laughing she settles down and wipes the tears from her eyes and looks down at you with a grin and you grin back at her. The bus once stops suddenly and you lose your balance again but Molly puts a paw behind you preventing you from fall to the floor. \"Thanks Molly.\" you say \" Any time Keane.\" she answers back, \"Time to go Keane.\" she picks you up and puts you in her paw and grabs her backpack with her other hand and gets off the bus. She heads to the school, the hallways are packed as every Molly weives are way threw the crowd you are shakened up from the rough ride in her paw, she finally gets to her locker she opens it and puts you on the top shelf while she gather her stuff she. You where  you try and stand u, but are dizzy and fall down on your butt. Once the world stop spinning around you get and see Molly giggling at you, you just roll your eyes to the heavens Molly says \"Sorry for the rough ride.\"you wave her off and answer \"Its fine Molly you need to apolgize to me.\" she smile and says \"Thanks from understanding Keane.\" you just smile back. The bell rings she quickly grabs her stuff and picks you up gently and slam her locker shut and heads to first class.</span></div></div>",

I mean, we've had our arguments but you know I care about you alot right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod to her without hesitation knowing you need to assure her. The friendship you two had certianly has had it's bumps, and you never once pictured you end up like this, but in reality you've really grown to care about her and you knew Molly would never hurt you like you dreamed she would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Molly smiled lightly. She lifted you up to her face and nuzzled you just a short moment, despite the snickers it got her from others on the bus. \"And next time just tell me what you dreamed you dummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Molly.\" You smile, glad she had taken it so well.

Molly gives mock-surprise \" what? after all we've been through you think that I, of all people, have an idea about whats going to happen?\"  You shift legs and stare into those deep blue eyes.  \" well.... todays P.E!\"  her sudden change to excitment catches you off guard and you fall flat on your ass.  \" whats so special about P.E?\"  Molly takes this time to walk over and show her medals,  the same ones you spotted during the weekend.  \"i'm one of the best runners at our school.\"  You think over how the day might go then you shrug.  \" well how about we get ready befor we talk about this more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly picks you up and sets you down by your dresser then goes to hers and pulls out some clothes and enters her bathroom.  You choose a white shirt and sliver-grey pants which also match your collar.  You pull some of the drawrs out and climb up to where the collar is kept.  Pulling it out you wait for Molly to come out.  When she does she is wearing a fitness t-shirt and shorts.  She looks at you holding the collar with curiosity and you hold it up, smilling as you do this.  She walks over takes the collar from you and ties it snuggly around her neck.  She then takes out the leash and attaches one end around her neck and the other around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPracticly jogging down stairs and into the kitchen, you wonder why she hasn't taken her back pack.  her father is in the kitchen preparing breakfast and looks up at the two of you as you entire.  \"Well it seems your up and ready.\"  Molly nods her head and Mark looks to you.  \"Keane becareful today, P.E. is.... diferent here then you'e used to.\"  \"Thanks for the tip Marl, but im not sure what could go wrong.\"  Mark chuckles and serves breakfast, Ham eggs and toast.  Molly takes a piece of ham and toast and gives it to you to eat as she begins to eat her meal.  Once your falryly stuffed and Molly has finished breakfast she clears the table and jogs to the door.  \"Ok. I'm going now.\"  \"See you sweety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo tyour surprise, Molly jogs to school.  That explains why it seemed darker then usual when you woke up but you couldn't place a finger on what was up.  \" hey molly\"  \"yes Keane?\" she responds without turning her head or breaking pace.  \"you forgot your backpack.\"  \"Oh, well... you see i dont need it today because of P.E.\"  Sitting there in on her shoulder rapped in her fur you think to yourself.  \" ok i give up whats so special about P.E.\"  Molly glances at you from the corner of her eye and speaks up, \"  P.E. goes for the whole day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently you sit there letting what she just said register.  One full day of PE!  This was definetly different then his school.  \"Keane you're preatty quiet.  Whats on your mind?\"  You explain to her how you have PE but its only for a period and doesnt take up a full day like hers.  Molly turns her head to look at you and gives a curious eye.  \" really?  we have Wednesday and Friday where all we do is PE.  On wednesday we do running, sprints, track and all that.  But on Friday....\"  she trails off and looks ahead.  \"On, friday what?\"  \" on Friday we do wrestling and thats the whole grade thats involved.  We wrestle till we are the champ then the victor has to maintain status as the Alpha of the group.\"  You shake the surprise off your face and register what she goes through every day for school.  \"Molly?\"  \"yes keane?\"  \"out of sheer curiosity how many weeks left till summer?\"  She registers this change of topic and figures out you're not that into Physical Education.  \" oh about 4 more weeks.\"  Four weeks seemed like a ong time and you contemplate how your going to sirvive this.  \"keane, dont wory,\" Molly says this as though reading your silence, \" i wont let anything happen to you.  In fact thats why im bringing the leash so you dont happen to fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up ahead and the school comes into view you also note that the sun is almost up and you can hear ahigh pitched noise from up ahead.   \"shit! im not being late again.  Hold on.\"  At this Molly picks up speed faster then she's ever gone befor.  You cling to her fur with your might and thank god for the leash and pray nothing causes you to lose your grip.  Molly dashes to the front door sprints down the almost vacant halls and screathes into what looks like a gigantic gym.  A teacher looks up and stare at her with dark green eyes.  \"Oh good Molly you made it on time for once.\" her deep accent with her voice makesit sound like a rumbling noise to your ears.  The her gaze shifts....</span></div></div>",

Registering what's going on, she quickly smacks the teacher's hand away, growling ferociously \"HE is my friend!\" You quickly try to calm her down; knowing it could get bad if you don't. \"Molly?\" \"And I don't appreciate the look that one of my 'favorite teachers' is giving him!\" Showing a look of utter shock of being growled at by her prized student, Mrs. Bee slowly recedes. \"Very well...\" Her gaze softens just a bit on you. \"I'm sorry I tried to grab it fro-\" \"Keane\" Molly forcefully interrupts. \"And you owe 'him' the apology.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf is silent for a moment. \"...\" Molly is shaking so much that you're hugging as tight as you can just to keep your footing.

A few moments later she lets out a large sigh, and nuzzles her cheek into you. \"I'm sorry about that Keane. Of all the people I know, I never would have thought...\" she drifts off. \"It's okay, don't apologize\" You say, giving her a smile. She smiles back, but you can tell it's fake. You want to help her, but you know it must have been a hard blow; taking it from her favorite teacher like that. \"Well,\" you pipe up \"come on Molly! Let's get running; I wanna feel the wind through my hair!\" Surprised by your words, Molly nods and flashes a real smile. \"Thank you, Keane.\" You already know you're going to regret this later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Molly is now sprinting along a giant (to both you and her) track.

She seems to be too focused to notice you. You think to yourself that you might as well tough it out so long as she's happy. Molly glances back for a moment and smiles slyly. She knows you're only doing this for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Molly!!! Keane!!!\" a voice calls from behind somewhere. You try to turn your head to see who it is, but can't. \"Mooooolllllyyyy!\" She looks back and is greeted by a panting Amanda who is trying her best to catch up. \"HI AMANDA!\" you manage to yell and wonder if she can even hear from this distance. \"H-Hi Keane!\" she breathlessly replies. Amanda tries to yell \"S-huff-slow down M-Molly!\" Molly just looks back, playfully sticks out her tongue at Amanda, and somehow finds the energy to run faster. Still screaming your head off, you wonder how anyone could possibly run so fast. Especially without panting or breaking a sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A bell rings in the distance hours later, and the running is over.

Amanda finally reaches the two of you. She pants and breathes heavily, trying (and failing) to get words out. \"I-Idunnohow-huff-youcandothatMolly\" she splutters. Molly replies \"Just a natural talent I guess\" with a grin. \"Molly?\" you ask. \"Hmm?

Did it fall off at all?\" her mother said with a toothy grin that made you shudder. Molly simply walks to the sink to get some water, giving her the cold shoulder. Mrs. Wolfesbourg's smile fades. \"I'm talking to you Molly.\" she says in a stern voice. Molly continues to ignore her while she drinks. You're also very thirsty, and hesitate to ask in front of her mother \"Um, Molly? Could I have a drink too please?\" \"Of course~\" she beams. She puts you on the pad of her paw and slowly tilts the glass for you. Her mother, now extremely irked that Molly had acknowledged you and not her, walks up to the two of you. She calmly yet angrily says \"Molly; you'll answer me when I'm talking to you...!\" Molly turns around and walks away. \"MOLLY!\" You try to get her to answer. \"Molly, please\" you whisper \"you don't have to-\" Her mother cuts in with a low growl \"I don't need any help, human.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Molly turns to her; you can tell she's very nervous about what she's going to do. \"I-I refuse to answer you until you do three things: <br>\r\nNumber 1. Call Keane by his name<br>\r\nNumber 2. Speak to him nicely<br>\r\nN-Number 3. Acknowledge him as a person; because he's not an object\"<br>\r\nYou can feel the sweat on her paw as she says this. Her mother stares into her eyes, and the tension builds up in the room. Mark walks in the door and greets everyone. \"I'm home! Got off early and... oh...\" You look over to him; the other two don't seem to notice he'd come in. After minutes of awkward silence and intense staring, Mrs. W. speaks up. \"Well Molly, I can see that you intend to hold me to that... I will call Keane by it's name, and if I speak to it I will be courteous\" she pauses for a moment \"I will not, however, accept it as a person.\" Mark gives Molly and you a 'that's the best you're gonna get' look and you nod; then look to Molly. \"Alright, mother... thank you.\" The tension lifts as she takes you up to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that...\" you grin. She replies in a bit of a shaky voice \"Ah don't worry about it; she was getting on my nerves again.\" You climb up to her maw, slipping once or twice, while she gives you a curious look. \"What are you...?\" You just smile again; giving her a big kiss on the nose that causes her to blush this time. She giggles and licks you off her face. \"Hahaha! You're pretty cute when you blush, Molly\" you say mockingly, even though you really mean it. \"Oh shut up\" she replies. Molly playfully tosses you around her mouth and gets you all wet once again. As she does this, you try to think of a way to poke fun without hurting her feelings. \"You know, your mouth makes a great bath.\" you say in a mock-serious tone. She giggles \"Oh really? Maybe I shouldn't bother giving you one tonight then.\" \"Touch'e\" you laugh \"Could I come out now?\" She opens her mouth and slides you onto her paw. You hop over to her shoulder and nuzzle her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, she exclaims \"Oh! I almost forgot!\" startling you. \"What, what?\" \"Your gift\" she remarks. You give her a puzzled expression. \"Gift? What for?\" \"Earlier today, when you said you wanted to run and got me all psyched up.\" You still don't get it, and reply dumbly with \"Yeah...?\" She rolls her eyes at you and says \"Don't you think I realized last time that you didn't like running, or that I couldn't hear you screaming your lungs out today? I know you only did that to cheer me up... it was sweet of you...\" At this, you give a sheepish laugh. \"Heheh... so you <i>were</i> paying attention to me today...\" \"Anyway, I thought it was such a nice gesture-\" [I'd hope so,] you think. [I was shaking like a leaf when it was over.] You almost shudder. \"-that I thought I'd give you a gift\" she says, beaming. You really have no idea what to say. This was certainly unexpected. \"Well... thank you, Molly! What is it?\" She attempts to hide a mischievous grin. \"...Molly?  Are you planning something again?\" \"Weeell\" she replies \"not exactly.\" You remain silent, looking at her. \"I couldn't get you anything without you knowing, so your gift is: I will do absolutely anything you want for the rest of the night. Anything, just name it.\" \"You- you're serious?\" you ask in disbelief. \"Yep! So what'cha want?\" she winks. You are temporarily dumbstruck at the idea of her letting you do this. She waves a paw in front of you \"um, Keane?\" \"Huh, what?\" \"Did you decide yet?\" You think about it for a bit, and eventually say \"Bring me up to your ear, Molly\" She does so. You are embarrassed to say it out loud so you whisper something in her ear. \"Haha; alright naughty boy, if that's what you want\" she teases. She takes off your clothes and licks you just for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly sets you down on the bed, stands up, and walks to where you can see her whole body. \"Ready Keane?\" You nod without hesitation. \"Okay~\" She lifts up her shirt slowly to tease you. As she does you can better see the soft curves of her body, even with the fur. Once her top is off, she slides off her pants, then her panties; which she throws at you, knocking you over. \"Hey\" you laugh \"what was that for?\" She gives you a silly look \"Well I wanna have some fun too\" she says. You look at her then, completely undressed standing in front of you. You think she's beautiful, not caring if she's human, wolf, or anything else. She walks over to you and turns to lay down, the base of her tail just brushing you as she does. \"Watch out~!\" she exclaims as she lays down. \"Will do\" You move to the side, and are now standing at her hips. You decide not to bother to ask for help and clumsily climb up; she occasionally giggles while watching you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach the top and hesitantly go between her legs. It's very moist, and has an odd smell that you seem to enjoy. \"Hope your ready, Molly~\" you say. You begin to stroke your hand gently against her clitterous, making her shudder a bit. She moans softly as you stroke more.\"Liking this?\" you ask. Her reply is hard to understand, but you could swear you heard her purr somewhere in there. You decide to walk to her chest. As soon as you get to her belly, you trip on her fur-covered navel; getting a mouthful of fur. It tastes like mango shampoo you think. You then begin to wonder if she would have the same reaction to a tummy rub as dogs back home, so you test the theory. Molly starts to ask \"What are you doi-\" But finishes with a deep murr as her belly arches up. \"Heheh; guess my hunch was right!\" You continue to rub yourself (as you have tiny hands) against her belly until it growls. The feeling of her fur, and now the vibrating of her stomach against your shaft makes it hard to keep it in, but you don't want to be selfish so you resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later she lifts you up and drops you onto her left breast, were you land with a bounce. \"That tummy rub reeeeaaaally felt good, Keane...\" she said with a content smile. \"Glad you enjoyed it!\" you smile back. She strokes you as you begin to rub against her nipple. \"Mmmnnn Keane?\" \"Yeah?\" Would you mind going back down there?\" You just grin and reply \"Not at all.\" Molly licks you gratefully and sets you back between her legs, where you decide to go in. It is soft and warn to your touch, and very slick. You gladly start to undulate your hips after getting about a half inch in over your head. Molly's moaning becomes more audible, and you feel her heating up around you. Not soon after, you both cum in unison, although her's shoots you back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter many licks, hugs, and nuzzles, you both get cleaned up and get back into bed. You look at her and say \"I really loved my gift Molly; Thanks!\" \"My pleasure, Keane; but we still got a few hours of night left if you want to do something else\" she replies, giggling. You decide to...     </span></div></div>",

You open your eyes still heavy from sleep; to see the gleaming face of your owner, Molly, who is trying to wake you up. \"Keane wake up Keane....\" she calls softly, \"I'm up!, I'm up!\" you replay still in your dazed state. \"We over slept, so hurry up and get dressed, I'm going to go take a quick shower.\" and with that she carries you over to her nightstand and sets you down, which is a bit disorienting for you in your current state. She quickly walks over to her dresser and picks out her clothes for the day, you figure you should probably do the same. You start to head towards your  \"dresser.\" You take a deep breath the heave the heavy drawer open, \"Gotta remind to ask Molly for some more of that rub.\" you say to yourself as you rub your sore shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick out a red shirt and a pair of cargo pants. You quickly dress and wait for Molly to come out of the shower,which isn't long, you notice she is wearing a white shirt with blue jeans; her fur is still wet,\"We must really be running late.\" You think to yourself as she walks over to you. You can't help notice her ample breast dangle in front of you as she opens the top drawer of you metal dresser which, she promptly pulls out your collar and ties it around your neck.  She then extends her hand out to you and to carefully climb up. Then she quickly turns back to her bed bends down and picks up her backpack, the resulting motion causes you to land on your ass. \"Sorry Keane but we really need to get going.\" and with that we walks out the door and stumbles down the steps. \"Mom! i'm gonna need a ride to school.\" Molly bellows. \"Molly\" her mother says staring sternly at her \" Why did you miss your bus?\" \"Sorry mom I over slept.\" she says with her ears flat on her head. After a few more moments of over mom staring at her, she finally says \" hurry up and get something to eat we're leaving in ten.\" and with that she walks out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabs a bit of left over meat that they her family had for dinner last nice a reheats it in the microwave then, pulls out a glass and fills it with some OJ she got from the fridge. By that time her food was done cooking and she takes it out and cuts off a portion for you and sets it aside. You start to chow down on your breakfast but something seems a bit off, it feels like you are being watched by someone. You turn your head around to see Billy leaning on the door way between the kitchen and the dinning room, you see him eyeing you with pure hatred, you lock gazes then he turns around and walks in the kitchen. you don't have long to think about before Molly interrupts \"Are you going to finish that?\" \"huh? oh no you can have it.\" having lost your appetite. She then eats whats left of your meal washes it down with her remaining drink; Then, with you in hand...er paw, picks up her dirty dishes in the sink and heads out the door, grabbing her backpack along the way, to her awaiting kin in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride is uneventful for the most part you finally reach Molly's school, Thank God for that you could feel Billy's eye on the back of your neck the whole ride which, is really unsettling. \"Bye mom she says,\" as Molly exits the car \"Goodbye dear and a good day at school, stay out of trouble!\" Purposely ignoring you, and she drives off, Billy in tow. sensing your distress she asks, \" is something bothering you?\" \"It just they way they treat me.\" you respond. she brings you up to face level and says \"I know Keane but who cares what they think.\" and with that she starts to nuzzle you with her muzzle. All too soon it ends \"Thanks Molly I need that.\" I thought you did, now lets hurry and get to class before we're late! at that you nod and she turns and starts to walk to her locker. The halls aren't as crowded as they were before due to the time you think. The two of you reach her locker and the end of the hall which, she quickly opens. Keane I'm going to need both hands here could you step on the self, with out a word you step on the the cold metal self as you watch her scramble to get her books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a faint sound of a bell accompanied by the \"oh shit!\" of Molly and you are quickly scoped up and whisked away to her first class, all of which is very unpleasing for you. she comes to and halt and you hear her teachers voice saying \"ah so nice of you nice to join use Miss Wolfesbourg please take your seat.\" Molly, with you in hand walks to her seat next to Amanda ( who is looking as happy as ever to see you two.) Molly sits down and opens are hand to find a not so happy you. \"I'm sorry Keane, I didn't hurt you did I?\" \"No I'm fine,\" you wave her off \"A little warring would be better next time.\" \"A little late today are we?\" Amanda interjects. Molly just shrugs and gives a smile, with that Amanda then asks \"So how was your guys morning?\" Before either on of you could respond \"Girls!\" Mr. Sima says \"pay attention!\" and they that the girls stop talking. feeling that he has got the attention of all his students Mr. Sima goes back to writing on the black board, the girls pull out their notebooks and start to take notes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chemistry goes on just like at Monday, but now it is different subject. You think that it's about some acids. Next are computers. You note to yourself that you need to learn wolfish, because you see that Molly just, well... sucks at it. You were rather good at it back on earth, so you think you might be able to help her. After all, you are her pet, and as you remember, pets were always helping their masters in some way. So you think that helping Molly in her lessons is your way to help her. And you noticed one thing today, since you were now inspecting the keyboard more precisely. You saw, that the numbers and symbols, like &lt; &gt; # ~, were just the same as on earth. It will make helping Molly a lot easier, because you won't need to learn alternative names of symbols and numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lesson ends and you go to the canteen. But then Molly notices that you look thoughtful and walks into empty corridor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, did something happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just now realized where you are, since you were thinking about your place in this world and didn't put attention to your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing Molly, just thinking\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I saw that. But I want to know WHAT were you thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...\" You consider your answer, but then decide to be honest. You don't want another \"gray day\" with Molly. \" It's just that I'm of no use for you. When i was back on earth, every pet helped It's master in some way. And I can't help you very much. I don't know wolfish so I can't help you with computers, even helping you in geometry is hard when I can't read. It's a little depressing too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, don't call yourself \"It\" and don't bother yourself with such things. It would be OK even you weren't helping me in geometry. You are the best and the most funny pet i could ever have. This is really enough. You can learn wolfish only if you want, you don't need to do it for me. You...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interrupt here, because you are quite hungry. \"OK Molly, thanks for saying that, but can we go to eat something? I'm getting hungry and Amanda is probably waiting for us, especially for me\" You both start to laugh at this, while Molly goes to the canteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i WILL talk with you about something when we get home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what is that she prepared for you. But then you cut it off, because the only wait to know this is to wait. And yet there is another idea in your mind, since you know that that the numbers in this world are the same as in yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Molly, just one small thing. Do you have any calendar? I would like to know what day it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, i don't think that i have one, but i will buy it for you. And don't say no\" She adds when she sees that you are starting to objecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide not to start an argument with her, but note to yourself to really learn wolfish to \"repay\" her somehow. After a short while you get to the long-awaited canteen and get some food. You see that she haven't got any ice cream or other \"special food\", so she won't play with you, probably because Amanda is already waiting. You are partially happy because of that, since you aren't in a mood for such games. When Molly finished getting her food, She walked away from canteen and headed to the same tree that you were at first day in school. Amanda was already waiting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Amanda\" You both say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Molly, Hi Keane. What took you so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing important, just a little talk.\" Molly says \"You really can't wait to see Keane, can't you?\" She adds with a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, you know me\" You all start to laugh and sit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Molly starts to eat while Amanda waits for you to end, then you start talking, mostly about what happened between Molly and her Mother. But then Amanda looks like she just remembered something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Molly, what are you going to do tomorrow? You know that we have wrestling on Fridays\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh*t, i completely forgotten. Do you have any ideas? If not, I'll probably need to retire from it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou burst out \"Molly, you don't need to do something like this for me. I'm sure that we can do something without you retiring from lesson\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually\" Amanda says. \"I might have some idea. Molly, you know that i always lose fast. Maybe I'll go first, and then i can take care of Keane, without you retiring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure of it. What do you think, Keane? It's mostly your decision\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see any better ideas, and we can trust Amanda. But this isn't MY choice. It's OUR choice Molly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are cute Keane\" She says while she pets you \"So it's settled Amanda. I hope that You'll give him back\" With that you all start laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Molly. After all, he is yours pet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou end your conversation and get back to school.  You arrives just in time to take books, when the bell is ringing.</span></div></div>",

Finally something you understand. Molly sits with you next to Amanda, like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Settle down class. Get your books and open them at page 231.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that this won't be an easy lesson. But you examine it carefully and see, that luckily you know everything from today's lesson. Back on earth you were always a little ahead of the class and now It's paying off. You see Molly doing exercises, but like always, you see it isn't an easy task for her. You consider helping her for a while, but then you look on teacher. Maybe she doesn't looks at you, but you decide not to risk. You remember, that a lot of wolves consider humans as \"It\". Because of that, Molly could have problems if they find out you are so good at geometry. Luckily, Amanda was there and she helped Molly, so you didn't need to bother yourself very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class ended, so you go to the next lesson. But Molly stops in empty corridor, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened Keane? I saw that something was happening with you during geometry.\" She asks you. You are little surprised by that question, but you know why she asks this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't what you think Molly. I was just thinking about helping you, but i was a little afraid of the teacher and what would happen if she find out that I'm helping you. At least Amanda was there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, i see your point. Anyway, lets go to our next lesson\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next class was wolfish. You tried to listen to it and learn something, but it was quite hard. At least you finally learned a wolfish letters, so Molly won't need to repeat the first lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was biology, but nothing interesting happened.

You see some wolf, looking around 30 years old for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Molly, what do you need?\" You see that this wolf know Molly very good, since he used \"Hi\" to greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a calendar\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chose which one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\" She takes the one with numbers on it. Molly's aware that you still can't read wolfish. But you hope that this will soon change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll ring you up. By the way, why you don't introduce me to your pet?\" You were a little afraid that he will say this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Keane this is Michael, Michael this is Keane\" At least it was quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Keane. I suppose this calendar is for you.\" Michael speaks directly to you. He must be one of these acknowledging that humans are something more than \"It\". You decide to trust him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Michael. And yes It's for me. How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly wasn't buying any calendar before. You were most possible reason of this. Have you tried saying no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't gave me chance to refuse\" After that Michael starts laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like Molly. Here you are, your calendar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Michael.\" But Molly have some mysterious grin on her face. \"But next time, do not ignore me, OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Molly. Bye\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Michael\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you get to home without any incidents. You notice that the house is very quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, are we alone now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Billy is still in school and my parents are still in work.\" She starts grinning. \"And that's good, because i need to talk with you a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a little afraid of that. You don't know what is she planning to do. You hope you didn't do anything wrong. Molly gets to her room and puts backpack on the bed. Then she puts you on bed too, but she crouches at the side of the bed, so you are on her eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, don't worry, It's nothing THAT serious.\" She starts laughing a little. You are relieved of that too, but not in a mood to laugh with her. \"I just wanted to know something about you past live, about earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are really startled by that question. You don't understand why she want to know this.It will be of no use for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can i know why Molly? Because i don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just... I'm just curious. You know a lot about me and wolves. So i want to know something about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think that is fair. After all, you know something about wolves, how they live, what they do in free time (maybe you just know what Molly does, but she is a wolf and she is MOLLY, your master). So you just start telling her about earth, about animals there, your world, countries. She gets very curious when you mention national languages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Can you repeat that?\" She sounds like she can't believe in what she heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We humans are scattered all across the earth and we are divided into countries. Each country have it's own language, but every country uses an international language, English. We speak by it now. And there are more than 200 national language. Some are similar, but still different\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are all humans, but use so many different languages?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's weird. One of  languages are easier, other harder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is your national language?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you want to know this, but if you insist. It's Polish. Many think it is the one of the hardest languages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou talk more about your family, school and friends. Remembering this all made you sad. They are all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Keane.\" Molly notices your change. She takes you in her paw and cradles you in her lap. You don't cry, but you are close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay Molly.\" You say after a while. \"Put me down, please.\" She does as you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we won't talk about this more. Telling about this all makes you sad. Let's just go eat something.\" She takes you after that, and you both go to eat the dinner.</span></div></div>",

You find i easy to learn, if you really want this and concentrate on learning. You noticed, that these 23 bonus letters in wolfish are just sounds, that are in English too, but aren't written. With that, It isn't very hard to learn wolfish. Wolfs don't have any big or small letters. All are the same. At the end of lesson, Molly gave you her clan pen (which was quite heavy for you, but managed to hold it), and ordered you to write your name in wolfish. The only problem in writing was that this claw pencil wasn't very comfortable for you to write with. But you managed to do it. Molly looked on your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, It's written good. You have learned this very fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this isn't very hard if you concentrate and really want to learn it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so we will just make a small revision tomorrow and it shouldn't be a problem for you to read wolfish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are relieved for that. Finally you will be able to help Molly in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we should go sleep. Tomorrow's going to a hard day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you start undressing, Molly changes into her sleeping clothes, and you go sleep.</span></div></div>",

You have dreamed of being back home with your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, wake up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just 5 more minutes, mother\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you hear laughing. For a while you think why your mother is laughing so loud, but then you remember where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard that Molly?\" You open your eyes, to see Molly's face above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, son?\" With that she starts laughing again and lies on her back, since she can't stand still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, a little angry on her, but it passes quickly when you observe her. Finally, she stops laughing. Molly stands up, looks at you and is about to say something, when you interrupt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't say anything. Let's just get dressed.\" She is still smiling, but let it go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly puts you next to your dresser, then goes to her dresser, picks some clothes and goes to take a shower. You look around drawer while thinking what to wear. You choose some light gray t-shirt and pants. Molly walks out from the bathroom dressed in her sport t-shirt and shorts. Today is Friday, wrestling. You have forgotten about it for a while. She gets the collar, ties it around your neck and you go down to get a breakfast. It's bacon and eggs, like always. Cold milk after the meal was very refreshing. You just wonders about one thing. Where is Molly's mother? Though you are startled, you are happy about this. You honestly don't like her very much. Molly takes you and start walking toward the doors. But she didn't tied you to your leash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, aren't you going to tie me to leash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't need to today. We are going to school by car, with my dad.\" So you walk out of the home, get in the car and goes to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you get in front of school pitch. Molly gets out the car with you in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Molly. Just be careful all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will dad. Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Molly, Bye Keane\" With that he drives away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now we will see if our plan works out\" Molly says, but you are not sure if she says that just to herself, or to you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You've went on the pitch. You were one of the first student to arrive, since you took car. You spotted Amanda, so you came to her to chat a little. There was still some time left to start of wrestling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Amanda\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Molly, Hi Keane.\" You go and sit down under the nearest tree. Molly sets you on her knee and pets you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm nervous. What if something happens? And there will be nothing of our plan?\" Amanda looks really worried as she says this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. We must believe it will work out.\" You say to them, but you are a little nervous too. You didn't ask why you couldn't be with Molly, because you perfectly knew why. It was too dangerous to be so close to other wolves, especially when they can be \"hostile\" to humans. Even if you had your leash, they could easily cut it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lesson starts soon, we'd better start preparing for it\" Molly says. \"The only thing we can do, is to wait and see what happens. We can't \"what if\" all the time. We must believe that the luck is with us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle a little at this. You have watched the \"Star Wars\", and this reminded you of something from the film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Did I say something funny?\" Molly must have heard your chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not directly. I just watched a film, and there was something similar to what you said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you will tell me later more about that film. Now we need to go.\" You can see her point. There is already a lot of students on the pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you go and take your place in a row. You see that there is a new teacher, not Mrs. Bee from running. He isn't very old, something between 30-40 years. But you can see that he is very strong. He is wrestling trainer, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, i see you are ready.\" He looks at the class. For a moment you feel his eyes on yourself, but do not look back at him. \"So, who want to go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw something that troubled you: There were a lot of wolves who wanted to go first. And you wondered, why do not everyone fights at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here.\" Said the trainer, luckily pointing to Amanda. \"I'll show you all what we are doing today.\" He used Amanda to show some moves. \"Now, find someone to pair up and take your place in chosen circle. Loser walks away and find someone other to fight with. Winner just wait for another participant. You can go rest after at least 10 fights, and only for 5 minutes.\" This isn't what you wanted to hear. You and Molly look at each other. But just then the trainer calls: \"Molly, Amanda, come to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what is it. You just hope that Molly and Amanda won't fight each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Molly, you are planning to leave your pet with Amanda, don't you?\" How did he knew that, you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Yes, bu...\" Molly is really startled, she has some trouble in saying this all. The teacher interrupts her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda never before wanted to go first, and this is first time I see you with this human.\" You notice that he doesn't say \"it\" on you. Maybe he don't speak to you directly or use your name, but it is still better treatment then Billy's or Molly's mother. \"You probably thought that today's lesson will look a bit different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Timon. We thought that the loser won't fight anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And I see how you treat this... what's his name?\" You don't think you are able to talk to him, so you just kick Molly very lightly. Luckily, she felt that and knew what you meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is Keane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mr. Timon looked at you and spoken to you directly. \"I hoped you will tell me this. Maybe i scared you a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are really startled about this and don't know what to say. \"Sorry, Mr. Timon, but it's hard NOT to be scared. You are all so big to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your point. Anyway, as i was saying, i see how you treat Keane Molly. I can tell that this is very unusual. So i decided to not break your plan very much and I'll let Amanda have a free day. You Molly are too valuable to have a day free, since we have only 1 day of wrestling. I just hope that you will be better prepared on our next lesson.\" He starts to going away to look after other students, when he adds one last thing. \"You know, you can always come and talk with me about this. We could arrange something.\" After that, he goes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is one of the most kind teachers to me\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was the last of who i thought will be kind to humans.\" With that, you all laugh a little. \"Sorry, i must go. I see someone waiting for me. Have fun Keane, Amanda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Molly handed you over to Amanda and went to a waiting wolf. You and Amanda went under the tree to sit down. You were talking mostly about school. She got very interested when she heard you are good at computers and geometry. Molly was visiting you very often, she came after every 10th battle. Time went very quick on talking, so the lesson ended very fast for you. Teacher whistled and dismissed the class. After a short while Molly came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK? Hope Amanda didn't do anything stupid.\" Molly asked you with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly!?\" Amanda pretended to be hurt. With that you all burst out laughing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You saw what the wolves were doing. The moves showed by trainer required speed and strength. And she was training very long. You two say bye to Amanda and go to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something happened dad? You don't usually come for me.\" Molly asks her dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had finished work earlier and i thought you could use some ride today.\" Mark ends that with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'm really tired.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get in the car, but notice something strange. Mark have some bags in the back. It wouldn't be something interesting, if not one thing that drew your attention. Some idea is forming in your mind, but need more information to be sure. After a while, you are already at home. Molly takes you to her room. You saw that the calendar is on the drawer. You haven't seen it in the morning. It showed 14, and after a while, you read that 14th of July. Luckily the months names weren't different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When have you put that calendar? I didn't see it in the morning.\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? It's here for the whole day already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't noticed it.\" But something more draws your attention: Molly has circled the next day, 15th. You think that you know whats going on, but still need to confirm it. You don't want to ask Molly about it, you think asking Mark would be better, however you want to wait until Molly will go sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what month is this? It's...\" Molly says to you, but you interrupt her, you know what she is saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes i know, It's July, though i had some trouble reading it.\" You are honest with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So are you ready for your final wolfish lesson? You shouldn't have some big problems in reading after today. And in writing too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready. Though i think my biggest problem in writing will be to have something to write. Your claw pen isn't very comfortable for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but we don't have anything better. Anyway, let's go with the lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday's lesson was mostly a revision, there weren't many new things. Just some irregular verbs and other similar things. Though the lesson lasted pretty long, and at the end of it was already time for dinner. But you are happy. Just a little bit practice and you won't have any problem with reading wolfish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was it Keane?\" Molly asks you, she want to know how you feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't very bed. I think that I just need a little bit practice and there won't be any problem in reading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that. Come on, let's go eat something. I'm really tired. I think i will sleep like a rock today.\" She's grinning at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes you and go down to the dinner. You think, that you could use this fact that she will sleep so hard. You will really need that. As you go to the dinner, You are happy to see that there is cooked meat again. It's still not time to eat raw meat. Though you think, how long It will be like this. You shake it off and just think about now. The dinner is going almost normally, but there's something strange again. Billy is really avoiding looking at you. You don't think It's because of what Molly did to him. He was too angry back then. Someone other probably told him not to anger Molly. You are almost sure of your thought, and soon you will confirm it. The dinner is over, so Molly's mum takes the dishes, Mark takes his newspaper and Molly goes to her room. Billy ended faster, so he was already in room for some time. Molly says goodnight, locks the door and goes to bathroom to wash you up. You can see that she is really tired, she don't say the word while doing everything. After the bath she rubs the pain lotion into you. You are glad for that, because you still felt some pain. She washes her teeth, then go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Keane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Molly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for a while, until you are sure that Molly felt asleep. It was quite warm night, so Molly didn't put her paw on you. It made things easier, because you don't want to wake her up. You go and jump to the nightstand and take some clothes. You don't want to talk with Mark naked. But now you see one thing that you forgot about: It's quite a fall from bed to the ground. You see that the blankets on the edge of the bed are the closest to the ground, so you jump back on the bed and go there. After climbing down the blankets there is still some fall, however not so big fall to hurt you. You just jump down, land lightly and go to the door. Molly locked them up, but there is enough space under them for you to get trough. Molly's room isn't very far from the stairs, so it don't take long to get to them. You thank god (if there is any in this world) that the stairs are carpeted, because so many hard falls would surely hurt. When you get to the bottom (which takes some time), you look around, and see Mark at the dinner table, looking in front of him. You somehow feel he is waiting for you. You come to him and call:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark?\" You see that he is look in your direction, though a little to high. \"I'm down here!\" He spotted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, here you are.\" He takes you up and puts on the table. \"I would ask what are you doing here, but it would be a stupid question, since i am waiting for you. I saw how you were looking in my car and during the dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I'm here to ask you something.\" You find it hard to talk, but manage somehow. \"Is it... tomorrow... Molly's birthday?\" You are feeling a little embarrassed asking about something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt you would give me a question like that, since you probably saw a cake in the bags and how Billy was behaving during dinner.\" You nod at that, not feeling in need to answer with something more. \"So, answering to your question... Yes, it's Molly's birthday tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo your thoughts were true. In the morning her mother probably just went looking for a present. That cake you saw in Mark's car was Molly's birthday cake and she has circled her birthday in calendar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Molly didn't tell me?\" You think that you know, but need to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She probably thought that you can't do anything for her. Or maybe you just didn't asked.\" You laugh at that. \"By the way Keane, You surely have birthday too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now when i think of it, it's just in a week, at next Saturday. Though i don't think that you could do anything for me, even if you tried, Molly's mother wouldn't be happy of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you are right. Anyway, i think you are going to do something, am i wrong?\" He asks you, knowing well that you are up to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm going to make a little surprise for her. I just need some things and a little of help.\" You say. \"I'll need some paper, colored or if you don't have it, some normal white paper and some colors. I could use some string, needle, tape, some pen and something heavier. Can you get that for me, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what i can do.\" You are glad to hear that, because you order quite many things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Mark came back with everything you ordered, even colored paper. So you have started your work. You have draw a few letters (ok, a lot of letters, enough for 3x \"Happy birthday Molly\" written in wolfish). Then asked Mark to cut them out. After that you took needle, string, and made 3 sets of subtitles They were quite long, for you at least. Then, with some help of Mark, you have hanged them around the dinner room You didn't want to Molly spot them instantly, so you made some \"simple\" mechanism. You've taped every subtitle to the ceiling, but first attached some string to the tape. The second end of that spring was attached to the heavy thing, located above some furniture, not very high, because it could damage the furniture when the weight would fall. You've made sure that the 3 strings won't hold up the weight, and added 4th string, but didn't attach it to any subtitle, just taped it to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark will you cut it off when Molly will be here? It should work.\" This is the last thing that is need to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Keane.\" He assures you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mark this is all. I'd like to stay here though, maybe I'll think off about some present for Molly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want Keane. I'll go sleep. It has been a long night.\" He puts you on a table and goes to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just lie down there and think about present. Making the surprise for Molly made you tired too, so you don't notice when you fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

And somewhere deep you knew, that your 15th birthday party was your last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KEANE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up fast, feeling like something very loud woke you up. You see that's still dark around, you're not sure how long you've slept. You're just angry at yourself that you didn't get any present for Molly, when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KEANE! WHERE ARE YOU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what woke you up. It was Molly. She must have discovered that you aren't in bed with her. You see some shape walking out one the rooms. The shape stretches, and then calls:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened Molly?\" It's Mark, much to your relieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear someone running down by stairs, Molly obviously. In the meantime Mark turns on the light, but stands close to the string. He remembers the plan. After a moment Molly stands next to her dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen...\" She stops when she sees you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was asking Mark, she looked very scared and worried. But now? You are not sure if she's more angry, scared, sad or anything else. You think that going here alone wasn't the best idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane!\" She talks while going in your direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think that she is more angry than anything else. You go back, just by habit, because you know that you have no chances in escaping someone who is like 100x bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that Mark cut off the string and one of your \"surprises\" landed on Molly's face. After that Mark disappeared in his room, probably to get a present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's thi...\" She stops, looking stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backed off a little and saw, what you prepared. Though you are not sure if she thinks that this is your work. But you notice that Mark is back with some kind of pack, obviously Molly's present. It isn't very big, probably some kind of CD or T-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy birthday Molly! This is for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and saw the rest of your surprise. She is standing with her back facing you, so you can't see her face. You just sit down, relieved, because you were really scared. You have at least a while of rest, before Molly will remember about you. You are looking down on your knees, thinking what she will do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane.\" That scared you, especially when you hear anger in her voice. You look up at her face, but from this point of view you can't see her expression. She puts her paw next to you. You don't want to make her more angry, but hesitate a little before getting on it. She lifts you up, though not so much, you still can't see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you done this?\" She asks you slowly. You really don't know what to answer her. You just nod your head slightly, and in a moment you find yourself cuddled in Molly's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Keane, these are my best birthday. But please, don't leave me like that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's hard to talk, but you manage to say something: \"Sorry Molly, won't happen again.\" You don't get answer, you're just still cuddled in her fur. But you are very relieved. Molly really scared you before, but you don't blame her. You understand why she was so worried. At least your plan worked out. Finally, after what seems like eternity, She gets you off her fur and holds on eye level. You see some tears in her eyes. She quickly clears them off and goes to her room. You can't see Mark, he probably just went back in room to get dressed. You can already see some sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I scared you, didn't I?\" She look guilty, you think you must cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that much Molly. I understand why you did that. I scared you first, and probably much more then you scared me.\" You are honest with her. You really don't like the view of sad Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Keane. And thanks for the surprise, but you really didn't...\" You know what she is going to say, so you interrupt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, stop it. I'm your pet, and I wouldn't do anything on your birthday? Really? No, don't say anything.\" You see she is opening her mouth to object. \"You need to bear it. No matter if you will or won't tell me, i will do things like that.\" Now you are really honest. You really want to repay her somehow for how much she cares about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sweet Keane. Now that i think of it, how did you knew about my birthday? My dad told you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, i just saw, that your family was behaving quite weird yesterday, that cake in Mark's car and you circled this day in your calendar.\" You hope that you won't need to say this 3rd time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I didn't notice anything. Maybe because I'm used to it. Anyway, i need to get dressed. I see that you are already ready.\" With that she smiles at you, and you smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly puts you and her present on the dresser, while she is getting her clothes. Then she goes to the bathroom to get shower. You are happy along with Molly. But after a while you remember that you don't have a present for her. That makes you sad. You hear the sound of opening door, but you are too late to hide your sadness.

Now let's go eat something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that there is already morning, you can see sun trough window.

Anyway, we need to help dad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We? I don't think I'll be able to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, you did this surprise for me, don't you? And now you say you can't help?\" Maybe you did, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practically I only planned it and wrote these inscription, but your father hanged them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we will find something you could help with.\" After that she walks into living room and see Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like your surprise, Molly? I hope you weren't too scared by Keane's disappearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and Yes.\" You're guilty that you scared her, and she sees that. \"But it's OK now, i understand why you did so.\" She warmly smiles to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Molly.\" That really helped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you hear a doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably your grandmother. Wait with Keane here, Molly.\" Then Mark goes to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must ask Molly: \"Is your grandmother... you know...\" You don't want to say it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, she will be gentle. I think.\" You hope she is right. But then you hear some voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that Cathleen finally agreed for some decorations.\" It probably was the voice of Molly's grandmother. And Cathleen must be Molly's mum name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she didn't know about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've made them alone?\" They walk in to living room, but they're talking so don't notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Keane did them. I just helped him.\" With that, he points in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandmother looks in pointed direction, but don't spot you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Molly, not Keane. But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Molly joins the conversation: \"This is Keane.\" She says while showing her paw with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human? And you don't treat him in usual way. I see that Mark taught you something.\" You're relieved now, she's gentle, not like Billy or a lot of wolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Keane.\" You decide to greet her, though you are a little scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I won't hurt you. I'm Kate.\" You can see that she must be Mark's mother. \"But we need to get to work. We will get everything ready for party. You can go get dressed or what else you need to do. Oh, I almost forgot.

But not very hard, just for her to felt. But unlucky for you, you've hit her weak spot (again). She immediately  released you. You were relieved for a while, but then you noticed that you weren't over a bed. As you fall, you hear some sound, but don't know what is it. Probably Molly. After a while of falling, you hit some surface and everything blacks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to wake up. Luckily, the fall didn't kill you, just rendered you unconscious. You feel that you're lying on bed. You just look at the ceiling, not knowing for how long you've been unconscious. After a while you decide to move, but then feel awful pain. You just hope you haven't broken anything. When you've rested a little, you decide to sit. You did it, and when you move your muscles, you don't fell like anything is broken, but they all really hurts. You just sit there and think of what you have done. Why did you started talking about this present again? And why you didn't just told her to let you go a little, instead of just hitting her. You think of it, when you hear sound of opening door. You look at the door, to see Molly's coming in. It's dark, probably party already ended. She turns on the light and see you sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, you're alive.\" She's really relieved. You're not sure if you would survive if you won't fall on carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't answer, just look at your knees, being to embarrassed to look at Molly's eyes. She comes to the bed and sits on it, though not very close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your paw all right?\" That's all you are able to tell. You really feel bad for hitting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, don't worry-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell me.\"You don't know if she is angry, startled or what. You don't want to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK. But what about you? I'm sorry for dropping you\" You build up courage to look at her, and see that she's guilty, just like you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, don't blame yourself for something i did. If i wouldn't hit you, that wouldn't happen.\" That's true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i should know i was holding you too hard. We all do bad things sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I've already done that at least three times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, you always blame yourself for everything. You're not the only one who do bad things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But I'm not worthy of being your pet, if i keep hurting you in physical and emotional way.\" You really feel like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That surprise you did showed me, that you're not my pet.\" Finally she understood that. You just hope you'll die fast. \"You're something more than just a pet. You're even more than a friend to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's something you weren't expecting. She thinks of you as a friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't let me end it before. I was trying to say, that you would be my best birthday present, but you're not just pet. Friends can't be presents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're starting to cry. She really thinks of you high, of something MORE than a friend, and you keep hurting her. She just takes you and hugs you. You don't complain. But it takes some time for you to cry out. Then she puts her paw on bed, so you can get off. But you stay on it. She's really happy of that, as she lifts you to her eye level and pets you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know what to say.\" You're still stunned by what Molly said. \"Thank you.\" She just kept petting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, don't think of yourself as a small, insignificant pet. You are something far more.\" You didn't answer, just let her pet you. \"We'll talk about this tomorrow. Now I need some sleep.\"</span></div></div>",

You just sit and think about what Molly said. You're more for her then a \"pet\". You could feel it before, but she needed to say this. But you just can't stop blaming yourself for lack of present. You decide not to tell her about your birthday, because she would surely do something for you. But Molly is waking up, so you can't let her see what's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, you're up already?\" No doubt she is surprised, it's first time when you are up before her. You just nod. \"Well, let's get ready. Today will be a good day.\" She have some mischievous smile, She have planned something. But you can only play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puts you next to your \"dresser\", and goes to hers, takes some clothes and goes to bathroom. You open a drawer and see, that on top there are your first clothes, in which you came to this world. It must be part of Molly's plan. You get dressed, and then comes Molly from the bathroom. She wears the pink t-shirt, exactly the same as at first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, what have you planned today?\" You have enough of that mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know?\" She sounds like it was obvious. \"We're going on the picnic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And? What so special about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to the same place as week ago.\" She said that with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, now it was something special. Maybe it wasn't very long time, but there many things happened in that week. You're feeling like you came to this world at least month ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go for breakfast.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puts her paw next to you. She is gentle, remembering what happened yesterday. You hope that today will be finally some normal day. You get on her paw, and you two go for breakfast. Today is sandwich, probably because Molly's mother was making them for picnic, and made some more for breakfast. You ate your sandwich, and then Molly started helping her mother.  You were just sitting at the table, because you couldn\u2019t help them. Probably even if you could, Molly\u2019s mother wouldn\u2019t like the idea of you helping them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparations took some time. They were packing a lot of sandwiches, drinks and some other food. You\u2019ll probably spend some time there. Finally, they\u2019re done. Molly takes you and goes outside the house, to the car. After Molly comes her mother, then Billy, and finally Mark. Everyone get\u2019s ready, and Mark drives away. You are sitting in Molly\u2019s paw.  You don\u2019t talk, because of Molly\u2019s mother.  After something like half an hour, You stop. Everyone starts preparing the picnic, but Molly takes you some place away from them. You really don't know why, but somewhere deeply feel, that this will be your worst day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last week we were here. You recognize this place?\" She asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was a little scared back then, so i haven't looked on my surroundings\"  You notice Molly looking a little sad.\"But maybe i will remember from where came, if you show me where were you sitting.\" You smiled to her, and she smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put you on the ground and sit close to you. \"I was sitting here that time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk in direction you hope is right. You can't see much more than grass. Finally, you get to the place you think is right. But then you see some flash in the near pile of grass.</span></div></div>",

You don't answer her, just keep going for that flash, when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe your own eyes. You need to pinch yourself to be sure it's not a dream. It was THAT crystal which teleported you here. You could probably get back to your family. But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane?\" She's worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's that crystal which moved me here.\" You hear her breath catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's great!\" She tried to sound happy, but you knew she was sad. But she cared for you so much, that she wanted not to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly.\" You say this while turning around to her. \"Thank you for everything. If not you, I don't think i would live up to this moment. Maybe we had our arguments, but you were always forgiving me. But...\" Molly already looks like she is about to start crying. \"I hate you for one thing. I just can't leave you.\" She's stunned. She had really dumb expression on her face. It was hard for you to not laugh during your speech, but now you couldn't stop yourself anymore. \"You should see the look on your face. Priceless.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just kept laughing, tears were coming out of your eyes. But then you heard a growl. You stopped laughing and looked up, to see REALLY angry Molly. She probably couldn't see the crystal, so she thought you were making some really bad jokes from her. You saw her getting ready to hit you, with exposed CLAWS. She attacked you, but you ducked down hoping she won't hit you. Unlucky, one of her claws hit you in back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAARGGHHH\" It really hurt. After a while, you weren't able to scream, and your vision started blurring. You have heard Mark calling: \"Molly, what happened?!\". Then you had one last fought before you blacked out: This was really your worst day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waked up, but didn't open your eyes. You were afraid where you could be. But when you tried to move, you felt pain from your back. So you weren't dead, that's good. You opened your eyes, and saw pink ceiling. You were in Molly's room, lying on her bed. It weren't night, because it was bright in her room, but you weren't sure if it is still Sunday, or already Monday. You decide to sit, which was pretty hard because of your wound and soft bed. But you do so, and when you look down, you see, that your chest and back are wrapped with bandages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That was really bad weekend. Maybe I shouldn't make jokes from such serious thing? I could tell her that normally.</i> You thought to yourself. But then you heard some voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all my fault.\" That is Molly's voice. Maybe she was behind door, but you could see her, guilty, mortified and sad. \"I should believe him about that crystal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That which i crushed?\" It was Mark. \"Why won't you tell me what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should give him to Amanda, she will be alive at least.\" Now you are angry, but you're not sure if more on yourself for making her feel like that, or on Molly for being like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, you-\" You decide that you need to interrupt them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly.\" You call, not very loud, you just couldn't. You were very tired. You have probably lost a lot of blood. But they must have heard you, because they stopped. The door opened and they walked in. Molly just stood next to door, but Mark kneeled next to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK?\" He asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly? It still hurts, but it could be worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even now you are making jokes.\" You both chuckled lightly. \"Can you tell me what happened? Molly ignores that question.\" So you just told him what happened, what have you found and about your \"big\" joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So you won't blame me for accidentally crushing it.\" It wasn't a question, so you didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you leave us alone?\" You wanted to talk with Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" He stood up and walked out of Molly's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were alone with Molly. You could feel the tension in this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, sit next to me.\" You feel bad for ordering her like that, but you think she wouldn't listen if you ask her to. Maybe she does what you said, but she do this like some robot, automatically, not like Molly, full of life, cheerful. She doesn't look at you. So you must do something with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, look at me.\" She have done that, and you saw tears in her eyes. Her fur around the eyes was wet, too. \"Molly, you really think i wouldn't come back if you would give me to Amanda?\" She just kept looking at you. That really made you angry. \"Molly, take a grip on yourself!!! You can't blame yourself all the time! And I'll tell you something: You're much more then a friend to me!!!\" You've shouted this all, which made you fell pain from your wound. Molly saw that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally you've said something. Don't you even think of giving me to Amanda.\" You smiled at this, and Molly smiled a little too. Finally it was the Molly you know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, I thought I know you, but you keep surprising me. You really chosen me instead of your old life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I told you, that you're more then a friend to me. I don't think of you as my owner. And if you want to know, that part with \"hate\" was just a joke.\" You both laughed at this, though you not for long, because of the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, you need to rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But promise me something: That you will be the old, good Molly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise Keane.\" She really looks better. \"But don't make jokes from such serious cases, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, Molly.\" You just keep smiling to each other. \"By the way, who bandaged me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, that was something you weren't expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum, you've scared me\" What happened when you were unconscious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dear, but i couldn't see any other way of getting into your talk.\" Then she looked at you. \"You're surprised, aren't you?\" You just nod too afraid and too surprised to talk. She was talking directly to YOU!. \"Molly told me everything, otherwise i wouldn't help you.\" You aren't surprised by that. \"I thought of humans as stupid things without heart. But you have showed me how wrong I was. You really like her, and try to do for her as much as you can. You're really unusual human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mrs...\" You notice that you don't know her name yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Cathleen. We haven't been introduced yet.\" She said that while looking at Molly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mrs Cathleen, and sorry, but you're sure I'm alive?\" You couldn't stop yourself. This is something really hard to believe in. But Molly and Cathleen just laughed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, It was hard for me too.\" Molly said that while smiling to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you alone. Come down when you will be ready.\" With that, Molly's mother left her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just looked dumbly at the place when Cathleen was standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this some joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. And you're not dreaming, you're not dead and any other things that will come to your mind\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're back, Molly.\" You're really happy that everything is returning to normal (normal in this world). OK, some things are even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly? Me too. Thanks for that Keane, I really needed that.\" You just keep smiling at each other. \"I bet you're hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, because you are hungry. You've only ate breakfast, and it was getting late. Molly lifted you up, very gently, and went down to the kitchen. You think, that it wasn't so bad day.</span></div></div>",

Is it that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better see for yourself.\" She lifts you up close to the mirror. You turn around and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no sign of wound.

That's...\" You can't find words for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird?\" Molly tries to help you, but that's not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird is me being so small.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, I told you not to make jokes for some time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be hard for me to live here if I would be a pessimist.

Normally I should have really bad looking scar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally you wouldn't be so small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who's now making jokes?\" She smiled in response, like many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you ask why...

Now that you think about this, your mother A.K.A. Molly, mentioned something about \"Big day\". She probably just meant taking of these bandages, so you move your attention to the clothes again. You only have white and gray clothes.  It's boring and... depressing a little to walk all times in similar clothes in such not very happy colors. But you finally decide to take some white underwear and white shirt with some comfortable gray pants. You only managed to put on underwear and pants before Molly finished and walked out from the bathroom. And she knew that something is going on, because always you were faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" You say while putting your shirt on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to be honest, but why you can't?\" Good point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you'll probably do what I say and it will cost you money.\" She already bought a lot for you, and you can't do much in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you said you're not pessimist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I haven't said in in direct way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please?\" She's asking you so nice that you can't resist anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll tucker me out with your <i>Pleases</i>\" She just smiled. She knew what works on you, beside her breasts. \"It's just the clothes. I'm still walking in same colors. It's... boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And depressing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's same as me. I don't like to walk in same clothes all time. I'm sorry I haven't noticed it before. I'll buy you something next time we'll be in the Rickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I was afraid of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, stop being a pessimist.\" She sees you're trying to say something. \"You are, and don't try to deny it.  Maybe not all time, but in moments like this you are. Money is less important then people. Cheer up, I'm sure It'll be a great day. I'll be back in a moment.\" With that she went downstairs, but left door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig day, great day. What's going on? And why did she left opened door? </span></div></div>",

But what she talking about? Why she could be angry? And where is she taking you? Well, you're sure that not far, because she stopped moving after very short time. You fell that the upper paw is moving away and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy birthday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately straighten up and look at your surroundings. You were in the dining room. Under the ceiling you see signs, practically the same as you did, but they called \"<i>Happy birthday Keane</i>\", instead of <i>Molly</i>. On the table you saw chocolate cake with two already light up candles in shape of 16. So that's why she left you alone for a while. You think that you should be angry at Molly, but... you're happy. Maybe if not that little talk before you would be angry. But you're so amazed, that you can't say a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I haven't scared you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, not that much.\" You don't ask how she know, it's not important because it wouldn't change anything. And you feel that you know the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry anyway, but I wasn't joking before. Why you haven't told me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firstly, I didn't want to bother you, and secondly, isn't it a little weird to ask or tell someone about this? And I think you talked with Mark so you already know why. And you're not angry.\" You smile to her because you know you're right. And she smiles back, which make you sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you know me already. And I think you should start living here as it would be your normal life.\" But she quickly changes her expression to guilty and adds: \"Sorry, I shouldn't say that, not today at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm aware of that. And I think that nothing will spoil this day. Knowing you, you have some more surprises for me then just this <i>rough</i> way of telling happy birthday. And no, you haven't hurt me or anything like it.\" You add seeing her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad of it. But why you had to just lie in bed for so long yesterday? I couldn't go prepare this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could keep doing that for longer if you want.\" You look at the cake. \"I think I'll need help in blowing off these candles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On three.\" She said while getting closer to cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was no three. You knew she's preparing something, but didn't think she'll do it before three. She blew really strong and caught you off-guard, so you fell of her paw and landed face first in your chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\" You say while cleaning your eyes from chocolate. But you can't finish even that, because Molly bites the piece of cake you're on. It was scary just for the beginning, but you knew Molly wouldn't eat you. She uses her tongue to clean you from the chocolate, and you've got idea how to revenge on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spits you out onto her paw. You just lie there, breathing heavily and trying to keep scared look on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, are you all right?\" She's really worried about you, just like you wanted. But you can't stop from laughing any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should see the look on your face.\" You say while bursting out with laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, quit it.\" She tilts her paw and you land in cake face first, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just now without eating.\" At least she listened to you and just licked you clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but you haven't even gave me a chance to try that cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We couldn't have any fun for some time, so I thought...\" She thinks you're angry at her, so you stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I understand you. I'm not angry. Just maybe not so much in such short period of time.\" She smiles warmly to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just eat this cake normally.\" You nod and she cuts off some pretty big piece of cake, and cuts some small piece for you out of that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much more surprises you've got for me?\" You ask when finished eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got only 2 prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can always think of something.\" Again with smile. \"But I won't show you last until evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about the second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you in a moment, I just need to take this cake to the fridge. You'll wait here.\" She takes the cake with her and comes back after 2 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, about your surprise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you won't eat me.\" You laugh a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that depends.\" You stop laughing. She wait few seconds for dramatic tension to build up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do whatever you want for the whole day.\" And here is your gift. And you know what \"<i>doing</i>\" she have in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got 3 ideas, but for now the 3rd one will remain secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, you're the master now.\" You got really serious after hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, don't use that word. It's humiliating you. I'm the only one who can be humiliated here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no one can be humiliated.

She starts to clean you up, and then starts to pet you. It feels really good. Then she says to you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the second surprise I told you about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its not really a surprise that I came up with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you with some excitement. She then lifts you up to her eye level and says that \"You'll find out at dinner.\" You look at her with confusion, but it is replaced with curiosity and excitement. After Molly puts her clothes back on and you do the same. You both go down stairs and see that Mark was sitting down at the dinner table. He looks like he is nervous. Which is odd. You never expected to see him nervous. Never in a million years. You then ask Mark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Mark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you with a glare that sames to throw you off. You couldn't tell if he was angry, sad, or troubled. He then starts to talk, but with a very shaky voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Keane... I have some news...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of news?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why do you look nervous?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you and says once again with a shaky voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its the NEWS!\" Molly says practically yelling. You flinch in fear due to Molly yelling. She notices this and says \"Oh sorry Keane I didn't mean to yell like that.\" You look at her and say \"Its ok.\" brushing that off. Then Mark looks at you and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some friends that are big league scientist. They have currently done some experiments and have fond a way to turn humans into Wolfe's!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Mark in amazement. He begins to tell you that they are looking for humans to turn into Wolfe's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Keane are you interested?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are completely shocked by this news. You look and say to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REALLY YOU CAN DO THAT?!\" sceaming at the top of your lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I just need to know if you want to and then you and Molly can come with me to their lab and they can do the procedure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Mark with joy in your eyes, but then look at Molly. She seems to have been saddened by the news. She starts to cry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly what's wrong? I thought you were in on this surprise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I never knew that this was the news that my dad had.\" She is crying a lot and you try to come her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly its OK, its not like I'm leaving or anything like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you and the sadness leaves her face and is replaced by a smile. You can tell you made her happy now. You look at Mark and sigh. Then ask. \"Is it ok if I think on it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looks at you and smiles. \"Of course, but I need to know by tomorrow ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Mark me and Molly just need to talk a little. I will let you know by tomorrow morning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" Mark looks at you with an understanding look, and then dinner is then served. Molly grabs some cooked ox and heads to her room with you on her shoulder. Her mom was about to say something but Mark stopped her. It looked like he told her what was going on, but you couldn't tell from your angle. Molly sits on her bed with you and is silent. Then you break that silents and ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think about that news your dad gave us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked unsure about what to say, but then her mom opens the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly Keane, Mark told me what's going on... I had no idea that he this planned.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her and she looks at you and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane if you do it then it will have a major affect on us all. You will be more then a pet to us, well mainly me. You'll be...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she says next touches your heart and fills you with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be apart of this family...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then leaves and your in shock same with Molly. You both just can't say anything. Until you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I think we need to talk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to do it don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why do you need to think about it if you already know your answer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I seen your face... It look like you didn't want me to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sorry Keane its just I thought of all the fun we had with you this size and I didn't know how to react.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its ok Molly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really want you to do it though! It will be awesome we will be able to do a lot more with each other!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and think about it. Molly see's this and smiles. You notice and look up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly I need to ask you something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Keane?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whenever I'm around you I feel a warm feeling and I just can't stop this feeling. I know what this means. Molly I love you... and I want to be... with you forever. Molly... I want to be you boyfriend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you with a large smile. She looks so happy to hear this. She then starts to cry tears of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you to Keane and I would love for you to be my boyfriend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both smile and just sit with each other on Molly's bed and snuggle with each other for the rest of the night. You think of your old life and your present life. You know that you will miss all of your family and friends from Earth, but you know that you will love you new life as a Wolf. You then slowly start to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anything special about them, or just an increase in hearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's a little bit different.\" Molly begins, \"Like your tail, your ears will act as an indicator of your feelings, but you can also use them to pinpoint certain sounds by doing this.\" She proceeds to swivel her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation continues like this all through your shared dinner. You bring yourself to try the deer and find that it actually is quite delicious. Diner ends a half hour later, and with nothing more to do, you two head upstairs to Molly's room where you continue to ask about the wolf body. As the conversation gets more personal, you ask about scents and how to identify them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Molly says... </span></div></div>",

Attempting to do as she had shown you, you wiggle your ears in an attempt to figure out what she's planning. All you hear is her shuffle around before falling still. \"Now,\" she says sounding much closer than before, \"take a nice deep breath.\" You inhale without thinking to much about it. Your nose is instantly assaulted by mango, peach, and what can only be described as Molly. You exhale, enjoying the lingering sent on your nose. \"Count to ten, then use my sent to find me.\" She places something over your head as she finishes saying this. You quickly find that it's more that just a hat, it's reduced your hearing substantially, preventing you from hearing where she went. With nothing else to do, you begin counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ready or not...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin sniffing immediately, finding the faintest lingering of her scent. Opening your eyes and removing the 'hat', you make your way to the door where her trail leads. Stepping out into the hallway, you take in another breath before following the trail to the bathroom. Slowly you open the door only to see the bare backside of Molly as she steps in the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning only her head, she smiles saying, \"That was faster than I expected.

As you do, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. You take a good look at your new body, from the tips of your ears down you your feet. Unlike the other wolves, your fur had a slight brown tinge that could easily be missed at first glance. Your tail was long and you stood tall, slightly taller than Mark. Your body is slender, almost flat from your chest to your stomach. The tips of your ears are fluffed, and your nose has a white spot on the tip of it. Your legs, one of which was still bandaged, were well toned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, I look better as a wolf...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving looked yourself over, you step into the shower. Molly has her back to you, having finished matting down her fur with water. She turns to you, pulling you under the water. You relax into the warm water, releasing tension you didn't realize you had. Becoming fully wet, you notice Molly handing you something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to her hand to see a bottle of lotion. \"Will you help me wash?\" She asked with an innocent smile. Your quick to get the bottle open and the lotion into your hands. As you prepare to wash her, you take a good look at Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly, in all her glory, stood before you. Her athletic nature kept her trim and toned, while her genetics had kept her curvy and full. As you stand a full head taller than her, you take in not just her form but her face. Her eyes gleamed a golden brown, her face look to be angelic, and her whole presence gave off a soft yet commanding aura giving the sense that she was kind but could put her foot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having only seen her from an ants point of view, it still startled you how the fuck you missed all this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished drinking in her beauty, you go to work starting at her collar bone and working down her arms. You're careful not to miss a spot before you descend down her front. As she leans into your hands, you can't help but linger on her breasts longer than necessary just to be sure they're nice and clean. Not that Molly seemed to mind, guiding your hands over herself. You begin to work further down, being less playful with the vag simply because you ARE trying to get her clean. Mostly. You turn her around, working your way back up her thighs to her tight rear end. You squeeze and push until you're sure it's clean, before finishing the rest of her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finish, Molly spins on you, a bottle of lotion in hand. \"My turn\" she states with a sly smirk. As she lathers her hands, she begins as you did at the collar bone working down the arms. She trails down your chest, slow and deliberate as she nears your crotch. As her hand reaches down, you come to realize you've been standing at attention as she strokes you. The lotion on her hand make it slimy and lubricated amplifying the feeling. However, she cuts this game short, continuing down you. Instead of spinning you around, she curls around you, cleaning you while rubbing against you. She finishes soon, sooner than you'd like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both rinse and step out of the shower to dry. After getting the water off, Molly turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know mom said not to... but do you want to have fun?\" That sly smile of her's is back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already know the answer, the question is how do you want to go about it?</span></div></div>",

That is until you wink at her with your own sly smile. \"Let's just get to bed, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly still looked confused, but nodded her head as she slipped into sweat pants and a baggy t-shirt, while you opted to just put on pants. You both make your way to Molly's room where, after entering, she closes the door and looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" She sounded slightly angry, but mostly upset. You stride over to her, locking the door as you gaze back. \"We don't know if Billy was listening or not, but it won't matter from in here.\" Your calm reply seems to settle her down a bit. Molly makes her way over to her bed with you in tow. \"Well,\" She starts, \"if you really mean that, then prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one fluid movement, you press your lips against hers. She has a look of shock on her face as she falls with you onto the sheets. Quickly recovering, she returns the kiss full force, not giving you the chance to break away even if you tried...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what you planned to have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, your once bandaged leg seemed to think this was the perfect moment to remind you that you had been bitten, causing you to take one step and collapse. Rather than gracefully finding Molly's lips, you end up head-butting her, causing both of you to recoil in pain. As you hit the floor, you hear Molly say something that sounded not to pleasant, but you missed whatever it was as you were to preoccupied with both your leg and head at the moment. You feel movement, followed by your head being lifted to reveal Molly cradling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if your leg was a problem.\" She was clearly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my defense, it hadn't been a bother early.\" What you say is true, you had been walking on it just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing more that a glance, you and Molly both decide to have a look at the problem. In one look, you notice that not only is the bandage all but gone, but your leg seems no worse for wear. Confused you try to stand, only to buckle as you put pressure on your leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Lay on the bed, I know what's wrong.\" Molly helps you up onto the sheets as she begins to explain. \"I got to caught up in your reward that I didn't take into account your injury. The pain your feeling is a combination of the water and soap that mixed into the wound.\" As Molly explains this, you grow confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the soap was mixing with the wound, why didn't it affect me earlier?\" It didn't make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly tells you, \"Even though it was running over your wound, it probably didn't soak in until just recently. You probably won't be walking for the rest of the night.\" Hearing this doesn't bother you to much, but it does put a damper on your plans. However it seems Molly is thinking the exact same thing. \"You know, it was YOUR reward for doing a good job, so maybe I can still give it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly steps until she is standing at the end of her bed with you glancing down your own midriff to see her. She reaches down, ever so slowly pulling her top off. Teasing you the whole way, she playfully smiles and laughs as you give her your complete and undivided attention. As she reaches her chest, she lifts her head straight up and throws the shirt off in one fluid motion. Following this, Molly slowly craws onto the bed, inching towards you with a predatory look in her eye. A slight fear builds up in you, quickly washed away as she reaches your face giving you a passionate kiss. Wanting to take back the moment you lost earlier, you are quick to return said kiss in full. While this was not the positioning you had planned for, you made do. Molly pushes her tongue into you, and you make way without a second thought. You battle for dominance in a war of spit, only to have it end as Molly breaks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready already?\" She asks. You know she's referring to your cock. It's rigged and grinding into her thigh. \"Let me take care of that.\" With a wink, Molly slides back down on you, peppering kisses along the way. It's all you can do to look on, completely in her power. Even if you tried to stop her, Molly had enough strength to keep you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you were stopping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly had now reached your waistband. With one final kiss on you navel, she pulled your pants out of the way and allowed your dick to spring forth in all its glory. You didn't have much of an angle, but from the gasp Molly gave you must not have been that bad in the size department. Or she had exaggerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching your gaze, Molly licked her lips as she began stroking your length as she had earlier. You couldn't suppress the groan as you tilt your head back from the feeling of her fingers overwhelming you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer giggle brought your eyes back to her. \"You think that's nice, then just wait. Tell me Keane...\"</span></div></div>",

The instant spike of fear you feel as you see her mouth near your dick vanishes as you feel warm bliss. Molly bobs her head, suckling and running her tongue across your length.

Molly, who is in her own little world, beings taking in more of you until eventually you both feel her hilt.

As the final shot leaves your body, you collapse from your tensed position. You were so lost in the moment, you hadn't realized that you were tensing up at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching your breath, you see Molly slowly rise off your limping cock and, despite being in a haze, see her swallow.

Morning came and the two teen wolves exited the room receiving pointed stares indicating that the other occupants of the house were aware that something had happened, though no one brought it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark did a quick check of Keane's leg and determined that his leg was not broken, and that he would be healed by the end of the week. While relieved that things were going well, Keane couldn't help but to ask about a clothing situation as the only thing he'd been wearing up till now was sweat pants and oversized t-shirts not fit for public. Mark had already prepared for that while Keane was unconscious, and simply handed him enough clothes to make him look presentable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the week, Keane's leg healed nicely. Shortly after Molly finished school and to celebrate, they were going to meet with Amanda the following day at the mall. That morning was Keane's hardest as Molly insisted that they run there AND back. By the end of that day he was exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark welcomed Keane every day with a warm smile and a friendly conversation. He also insisted to Keane that he didn't owe him anything, but Keane was determined to pay him back somehow. After looking around, he found a small mechanic shop looking to hire a Go-For employee that could fetch what the boss needed and learn while doing so. Simply walking in and inquiring about the job, Keane found himself something to fill his Monday's, Wednesday's, and Friday's afternoons and return the favor Mark had so generously given him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathleen, while not so open, was still kind and thoughtful of Keane. While she did expect him to find his own house within the year, she repeated over and over that Keane would always be able to call this house home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly did everything he could to avoid Keane. If he was forced to be near him, Billy would either glare daggers at him the whole time, or simply ignore Keane altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly, of course, was there through it all. After adjusting from having a miniature friend that she had to care for, to having a boyfriend that she could be more carefree with, she became much more open to his ideals and wants. Molly had supported Keane in getting a job to repay her father, even going so far as to help him look for one. She had been present when her mother told Keane about his welcome in their home, and had asked if she would be able to go with him. While Cathleen denied her daughter, she had agreed that once Molly had graduated <u>and</u> turned 18, she could leave with him. Molly also helped to keep Billy from being a bother, not that he ever tried to be. <br>\r\nKeane of course returned all this back to her in full. He agreed to go on runs with her, not just to build him up, but to keep Molly in top shape. Keane practiced his Wolfish, as well as many other skills so that he and Molly could interact fully. He did whatever he could to keep Molly smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on nights when they could, Molly and Keane ensured the other was more that satisfied with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day moved on, school started up for Molly again. Keane took this as an opportunity to receive a promotion at the shop.

These included sports, entertainment, media, fashion, and so on, but most importantly: Holidays. He first finds out by learning of, what he least expected, Halloween. Apparently, many old story's of living dead and ghoulish creatures do exist, only on an intensified scale. This brought Keane to ask about other possible holidays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was surprised that Cathleen, of all people, sat him down to discuss multiple days of celebration. Unfortunately, there was no substitute of Thanksgiving, but there was a Christmas type day. It was referred to as \"The Day of Galvinishy's Gift\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGalvinishy was a scientist from hundreds of years ago. It was a time when scientist and other people of knowledge and power thought of themselves as better than others, going so far as to be downright cruel. Galvinishy didn't think this way. He believed that in order for science to progress and knowledge to properly be shared, every creature of sentient being must be treated with kindness and understanding. To make his point, he did something his peers frowned upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, while walking to work, Galvinishy was passing a small family of three in the dead of winter. It was a mother and what looked to be her two children. Galvinishy took pity upon the family, asking them to accompany him to his lab. After getting them out of the cold, he went to a local deli and ordered food for them all. Galvinishy insisted the family eat until they were full and strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, a co-worker of Galvinishy came across the scene. In an uproar, he exclaimed, \"Who are these peasants? Why do you waist money and time on these worthless lot?!\" Galvinishy responded in kind, \"These are not peasants, they are our guests! This here is our sister, and these are her children. Should we not care for them to better ourselves?\" The wolf, shocked and outraged by Galvinishy's words, screamed, \"They do not belong among us! They must leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing this, Galvinishy stood up, took the woman's hand, and led her and the children out of the building. He left with them, disappearing for days. Eventually, another of his co-workers, named Almedary, came looking for him. She found Galvinishy at his home. Almedary also found that he had been harboring the family at his house. She asked him, \"Why do you keep this wolf and her pups? What can she offer you?\" Galvinishy responded, \"What they can offer me, I cannot say for sure. I believe that one day the children will grow to become smarter than me. I believe that, given the chance, they will contribute to the world more than I ever could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmedary told this to the other scientists. They were humiliated that Galvinishy would put faith before knowledge. That is, until the head scientist, Lamar, spoke out, \"We must consider his words. Galvinishy has always done everything in the name of furthering science. Is it not true?\" The words caused the others to fall silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGalvinishy not only convinced the scientists to consider other lives, his actions reached everyone. It was marked on the day he met the family, December 23, that everyone would retail the story with family, friends, and strangers as well as present them with gifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeane greatly enjoyed this story and prepared for...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning you wake up by some loud knocking. You realize that your bed is softer than it used to be and it is really warm. Suddenly the last two days and especially the last night comes back to your memory.<br>\r\nYou hear a female voice from the door:<br>\r\n\"Molly? You still in bed? Stand up, you will be late at school\"<br>\r\nYou think it's odd that Molly who usually waking up before you is still asleep. You turn around to her and recognize her heavy breath. the heat you feel seems to come from her body. She has to be ill.<br>\r\n\"Molly! Come on! It is really time to go!\"<br>\r\nWithout thinking you call:<br>\r\n\"Ms Wolfesbourg! Please come in Molly seems to feel bad!\"<br>\r\nThe door opens and Molly's mother enters. Without looking at you she turns to Molly. You can see real concern in her face as she feels Molly's head. Then she turns to the door and leaves in a rush not looking at you only one time.<br>\r\nYou turn back to Molly. She looks really weak and you can hardly imagine that this is the same powerful person wandering around with you the last days. You go closer and start stroking her face. She is still asleep and seems not to realize you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome moments later Molly's mother enters again followed by another male wolf carrying a suit case. A physician it seems.<br>\r\n\"Please Doctor Green\" Molly's mother begs \"what has Molly?\"<br>\r\n\"Patience please.\" Dr Green says with a rough, but gentle voice. \"You are her pet?\" he asks when he sees you. You nod still stroking her. \"Please step aside. I will take good care of her.\"<br>\r\nYou do as you are told and he starts his examination. Both you and Molly's mother watch him concerned when he finally stands up and starts to explain: \"It is is not serious.\" he starts and feel like a big weight being taken of your shoulders and Ms Wolfesbourg sighs relieved. \"It is some kind of flu going around this time. I will leave you some medicine. Keep her head cold and give her one pill in the morning and one in the evening. I would give her also one now but she is still asleep. That is not bad.\" He tells quickly as he sees Ms Wolfesbourg's concerned expression \"In fact she needs a lot of sleep to get rid of this disease. Here\" he hands Ms Wolfesbourg the bottle \"give her one when she wakes up.\" He takes his suit case \"I will look after her again tomorrow, She might even feel better then.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you Doctor. I will bring you to the door\" Molly's mother says then leaves the room and you are alone with Molly again.<br>\r\nYou climb back on her pillow and watch her moving around. She seems to has pain and the heat from her is hardly to take. But you don't want to leave her side now so you just sit there and wait for her mother to come back.<br>\r\nShe does after a short time bringing a dish of icewater and a small towel. She does the towel into the water and then on her forehead. She strokes Molly gently for a while then speaks to herself: \"I've got to call her school.\" With these words she leaves the room and shuts the door.<br>\r\nYou watch her going when you Molly moaning behind you. A wave of pain lets her grimace and you can see her deadly teeth. You cant but thinking of your dream again. You stumble away from her in fear. She moans again in pain and you stop. The minds rush through your head. It is Molly she is your friend. She is a wolf she will eat you whenever she is in the mood. she promised you she wouldn't and you owe her your life.<br>\r\n\"Keane!\" Your minds stop when you hear her calling your name. Is she awake? You look at her. No must be speaking while sleeping.<br>\r\n\"Keane!\" she calls again \"Why can't you trust me? I really want you to be my friend. Please!\"<br>\r\nYou see a tear falling down her eye. You know what she is talking about: Not talking to her about your dream really did hurt her. You didn't want to tell her in order to avoid hurting her and made things worse. A feeling of guilt comes over you. How could you be that silly? The last days you did hurt her emotional and physical. Every time you could talk to her, she accepted all your apologizes, protected you and made herself target of attacks of other people like her mother or the pharmacist yesterday and you are risking this relationship because of a dream.<br>\r\nWithout thinking anymore you go back to her head near her ear. \"I do trust you\" you whisper \"I'm sorry I didn't talk to you yesterday now concentrate on getting well again and after that I will tell you about my dream.\" She didn't wake up but her grimace fades and her breath gets lower.<br>\r\nYou reach for her head and recognize the towel on her forehead got warm.</span></div></div>",

Well she seemed to be really concerned of her daughter thinking what she can do you guess she had other kinds of stuff to worry about than water on the floor. You reach for the towel it is double your size and full of water. It is really hard for you to even get it of her head. You are making a notice in your head to train your strength in order to be of any use in this gigantic world. Almost out of air you are making it to the water and with a strong swing you throw the towel into the dish. You are taking a short break to get refreshed and start pulling the towel out of the water it got even heavier but force yourself to bring it to her head climbing over her forehead you manage to get the towel back on her.<br>\r\nGasping you are sitting down near her and start stroking her again. \"You better get well quickly.\" you order to her \"I don't know how many times I can do that again and besides I want to see your warm smile and hear your powerfull laughing again. You know it is just depressing me to see someone like you suffer.\"<br>\r\nYou something from the door. You are looking there and see Molly's mother looking at you. Something is odd in her face. She seems to look directly into your eyes what she never did before and also the expression is new. How long might she have been there you wonder. After minutes of staring she leaves the room again. Confused you are turning back  to Molly.<br>\r\n\"You are really sleeping like stone you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later the door opens again and...</span></div></div>",

You remember the glare he gave you yesterday and start to think of a way of getting away. Useless, you are trapped.<br>\r\nBilly smiles down to you evilly. \"Guess what: I just came home when my mother told me that my beloved sister is tied to bed sleeping and not awakenig too soon.\" He smild even wider. \"Then I thought to myself: she surely wants her brother to take care of her pet. I see you don't wear your collar. Well I think I told you yesterday where your place is, so where Molly can't stop me you will go right there. He reaches his paw for you when you hear a low deep growling. Billy stops looking for the source of the noise. You are searching to and find to your surprise Molly's mother standing in the door. She has a plate of food which she puts away and heads for Billy.<br>\r\n\"Out of here, now!\" she yells.<br>\r\nBilly, really scared, quickly leaves the room.<br>\r\nThen Ms Wolfesbourg looks at you again in this strange way she did before it looks like she really needs to force herself to the things she is about to do. I guess Molly wasn't able to give you breakfast today and it is always midday.\" She reaches for the plate and is puting it on the bed beneath Molly \"If you are hungry take it, if not leave it.\"<br>\r\nBefore you could manage the surprise of her having talken to you directly she turns around and heads for the door. After half the way she stops again. \"I know Molly did introduce you to us but I am afraid I forgot your name.\" she says not looking back at you.<br>\r\nYou know this is a friendlier way of saying that she didn't care \"It's Keane.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Keane I see I am Cathleen Wolfesbourg, Cathleen.\"<br>\r\nshe continues to the door after reaching it speaks again without looking at you. \"I will lock the door so Billy won't come in.\" and then after looking at Molly \"Take care of Molly or Billy will be your smallest problem.\" After that she closes the door and you hear her locking it.<br>\r\nStill a little confused you are looking at the plate. Seems to be the rest of breakfast today: some pieces of bacon an edge of a fried egg and some milk on a plate. You really are hungry so you are heading for the meal wich surely wouldn't be enough as an appetizer in normal size but it was enough for you to fill you up. After eating you decide to change Molly's water again. It again is a hard job but you want Molly to feel good. After you have finished you are really exhausted so you decide to take a nap.</span></div></div>",

Dr.Green said that she will be sick for about another week.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel very sad and you slowly sit down on a chair in front of them. Thoughts of her dying start to cross your mind. Then you lose all control of your emotions. You start to cry out of the thought of losing Molly. Mark the asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid of losing her. She is the person that I truly love... And the thought of losing her keeps crossing my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they hear this they all gather around you to comfort you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane don't worry everything will be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but the though just keeps coming up and I...I...I just can't picture my life without her. She saved my life and for that I can never repay her, and the though of losing her... It crushes my soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark then hugs you and you start to literally have a mental break down. You look at him and say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the first time in my life... I'm scared out of my mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hears this and then brings you up stairs to her room. He opens the door and you see Molly laying on her bed. She looks so peaceful. Then all of the thoughts of losing Molly vanish into thin air. Mark see's your ears perk up and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no doubt in my mind that she will get better. What about yours Keane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no doubt now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles and leaves you alone in her room. You stay in their almost the whole week. One day you were taking a nap. Molly still hadn't awoken yet. Then you hear a very loud scream. This woke you up immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KEANE! KEANE WHERE ARE YOU!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looks at you and starts to walk over to you with an angry look. The look is telling you that she doesn't know who you are so start talking. Your scared for your life at this point you start to try to talk but it all comes out as gibberish. Then Molly starts to ask you things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH KEANE!? WHERE IS HE!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly just relax ok its me Keane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mark and Cathleen walk in. You look at them and say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys a little help please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly that's Keane. When you were asleep I asked him if he wanted to become a wolf like us. I knew that he loved you so much so that's why I asked him. He said yes and I brought him to the science center and he was turned into a wolf. The wolf in front of you is Keane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly looked at you and started crying. Then she hugged you and stayed like that for a minute. She started to kiss you and say I love you and you did the same. Then she starts to look around your body, admiring it. Then she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know your pretty good looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh and then say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you for that compliment. Your pretty hot too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both just laugh and then snuggle for a while. Later Molly starts to feel the effects of not eating for a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'd think so if you were asleep for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you had my worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts to snuggle you more. Then you kiss her. Then you decide to tell Molly about your dream that you had before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly you remember when I had that bad dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you wouldn't tell me what it was about though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in the dream...\" You pause for a moment and start to get over run with emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its ok Keane you can tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then spit it all out every gruesome detail. All of the pain you felt during it and all of the fear you had of telling Molly about the dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Keane I would never of done that. Never in a million years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then start to cry. You and Molly get really emotional for the next few  minutes. Then you ask Molly what she wants to do. </span></div></div>",

He leans toward you, making you cringe, \"That's not true, and you know it.\" He then looks at Molly, \"It's not the flu, by the way.\" he says. You give him a confused look.

Now you were wondering what he would look like now he was a giant sized. You then studied the whole room. It was strange because you were never in a boy's room before. Sure your brother's room counts but not in a boy's room your age. This was so strange. No posters but she did see some.... papers. May have been some comic books like Billy had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear the water turn off and about five or so minutes later you saw Keane come out of the bathroom. He looked like a god. With his hair pulled back making it look neat and clean. His eyes had some dashing look to them. His smiled had just warmed, if not melted, your heart. His shirt was nicely tucked in. It was a dark blue with a collar on it. His pants were dark blue as well. He had his shoes on and they were nice. They were dress shoes. All together he was dashing looking while you looked like someone that went to a consert.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So this is the new pet I keep hearing about,\" says a most unpleasant voice from behind Molly. You turn on your perch, getting to your feet quickly and looking at the speaker. The voice, which sounded deep and menacing is accompanied by a form that matches. The wolf boy with pitch black fur looks much taller than Mark, Molly's dad, and bigger too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt actually takes your mind a moment to wrap around the fact that all that you are seeing is him, as he doesn't wear a shirt, leaving his bare fur against the air. For a moment you wonder about the fashion sense of the world you ind yourself on, but all thoughts are driven from your mind as that face leans closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you are very much reminded of the first moments you spent on this odd planet, in which Molly nearly ate you off a sandwich, and probably would not even have known it. This guy is even bigger, and you can see what look like bones jammed between his jagged teeth. Still, Molly meets his gaze with the fire you've come to expect of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Dork?\" she tells him, staring up at him. You realize that their heights are probably close to a foot from each other in their measurements, but to your diminutive gaze it looks like he stands miles above her, and you feel proud to call her your friend, though still more than a little weird about calling her your owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's DARK Wolfesbourg, and I wanted to see this new pet of your's everyone's talking about\" he tells her in an irate tone of voice. You realize in that moment that these two probably have some kind of history with each other, and that at this moment you have become a plaything in their struggle, because Dark seems very interested in you, leaning closer to Molly's shoulder to geta good look at you before she pushes him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you've seen him, no go away,\" she tells him, taking her books and spinning away from him, nearly tossing you off her shoulder in the motion. With a will you are able to grab her fur and stay put, but behind you Dark is growling and baring his teeth. Obviously Molly just insulted him by turning her back to him, and with a speed that is astonishing to you considering his size he runs in front of her and slams his fist into a locker, denting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Molly. Haven't you ever heard of sharing? I just want to play with your little snack before you gobble him up,\" he tells her, his fingers making a kind of crawling motion through the air towards you. Molly, the instant he touches her, responds in the way you expect, she smacks him in his snout with her paw, and pushes him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he gets on his haunches and growls deeply at her, and she responds likewise, you realize their about to go at it, one of the big clues being the gathering crowd which is growling likewise, almost in the same way people gather in a human school chanting, fight. It doesn't take a leap of genius to realize that them fighting while your on Molly's shoulder is a bad thing, but what can you do?</span></div></div>",

Still you have to help, if not for yourself then for Molly. She's been really nice to you, in her own way, and she listens...to...you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a stroke of inspiration you think of one thing that might help get you both out of this, but you have to get Molly to do something before you can do it, otherwise you're going to hurt her worse than you're going to hurt this jerk. For a moment you consider just going through with your idea, but then decide to at least try and warn her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cover your ears Molly!\" you shout at her, and you see her eyes, which had become little dots, grow a bit and focus on you, she leans her head a little closer and whispers at you so no one else can hear, not that any of the others are listening anyway, intent as they are on Molly and Dark who continue to circle each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda busy here Keane, can we talk about this later?\" she asks sarcastically, snapping at Dark and nearly tossing you off her shoulder. When things settle again, and you get back up to you perch on her shoulder you decide to try and tell her one final time before you use your idea and see if you're as smart as you think you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it can't, cover your ears, NOW!!!\" you shout at her, and watch as her ears, which are bigger than you, flatten against the sides of her head and then she puts her hands on them. With a quick in take of breath you prepare, and for a single instant everything is quiet, as the crowd and Dark try to figure out what you an Molly are doing. Then, raising your fingers to your mouth you whistle as high loud as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second you think you might be wrong, as nothing seems to happen, but then you watch as the other wolves in the hall grip their ears, falling over as the high pitched squeal of your whistle does to them what it does to dogs at home, causes the bones in their ears to vibrate so fast it causes extreme pain. Dark, being the closest is howling with fury, but he is on the floor like the others, gripping his ears down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes you stop, and you look at Molly. She seems to be okay for the most part, but as she uncovers her ears she winces in pain. Even with her hands blocking most of the sound, there was still some leakage, and your little whistle was right next to her ears. She staggers a bit, but she smiles at Dark on the floor, and then walks up and kicks him while he's down before walking off, leaving him and a crowd of wolves to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do Keane?\" she asks, a little louder than she's ever said anything to you before. You realize that her ears must be ringing, and that it proves you were correct. The giant wolves, and probably the other two dominant races of this world as well, are based off small prey predators, and their ears are ultrasensitive to high pitched noises. Obviously your diminutive size raised your whistle by an octave or two as well, and looking back at the pile of fur, you feel proud of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you guys would have heard of whistling. It's something humans of my world do to control animals. I didn't think it would work so well though,\" you tell her, wondering why it did work so well. You know high pitched noises cause certain animals pain, and whistling can either drive away, or attract certain predators, but those wolves seemed to have been in a lot of pain from you little blow. And if it was that painful why didn't the humans of this world use it against them? Molly eyes you for a moment and continues on her way. After a moment...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately at that instant a very big wolf staggers out of what you can only guess to be an office. Obviously a big wig at the school you realize that you probably just knocked out half the student body, and your just a pet. Something like this would get you put down on Earth, and here it probably gets you put down someone's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Wolfesbourg, what is the meaning of this?!\" he demands, waving his hand at the pile of students, some of whom are finally struggling to their feet and walking off. Their staggering gait tells you that their ears are still ringing, and you turn to face the teacher, who's odd green suit and red fur clash awfully in your opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it, not her,\" you shout at him before she can say anything, and the large wolf eyes you suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this? How, you're a human, an appetizer. So how is it injured over a dozen of this schools student body?\" he asks, accentuating his speech on the word appetizer, and baring his teeth at you. You are getting so tired of being reminded that on this world your considered a food stuff, and you prepare to whistle right in his face when you look to see a pleading expression in Molly's eyes. You realize she's probably in a lot of trouble for this already, and attacking a teacher will only make it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it because Earth has learned some tricks since your furry butt was there,\" you tell him, sitting down on Molly's shoulder, eyeing the old wolf defiantly. Molly, bravely mimics your look and stares the teacher in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dark was threatening me, and Keane tried to protect me, he was just a little overzealous,\" she tells him, and the teacher looks over her shoulder to see the black wolf boy still laying down in the center of the crowd, which is now reduced to five members as the rest slink off towards their classrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dark?! You mean a human took out our star player? How are we going to live this down, Molly? Tell me how?!\" he demands of her, looking at her and then at you, before going back to staring at Dark. Obviously you just took out what amounted to the schools quarterback, and that is probably gonna cost you, cause this seems to be a school that values its sports stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Romelles, Dark was threatening Keane, and then me and Dark were about to fight, and probably end up killing him, so he protected himself,\" she explained, but you notice, and she does to a second later, that Mr. Romelles isn't paying attention. Obviously something big just happened, and you two decide its best to leave before he figures out what to do with you. If he wants to punish you he can find you later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning from the teacher Molly, with you perched on her shoulder, soon enters her class room. At the front of the class a female wolf is writing on the chalkboard. All eyes turn towards you and Molly, and you hear a nervous laugh from somewhere as most of the eyes turn towards you. For a moment you can't place it, and then you realize with a start that its you whose laughing, and Molly turns towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, is something wrong?\" she asks in a whisper, and you shake your head, gaining control of yourself and your composer. None of the students in the class are from the hall, luckily, and that makes you feel a little better. You realize that at least half of them are gonna want to kill you now, a lowly pet who knocked them down with a simple whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Wolfesbourg, may I ask why you are late for class, and what that awful racket in the halls was a moment ago?\" says the teacher. You realize that if you were her size, she might have been hot, but being small changes things a bit, and those teeth flashing in the light from the windows are seriously turning you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing Mrs. Orland, just a bit of roughhousing before class with Dork,\" she tells her, and the teacher smiles. For a moment that face makes you more nervous than the serious expression she had on a moment ago, but some of the class is laughing now, and so is she and Molly, so you decide it might be best if you laugh with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, I'll ignore your tardiness if you'll kindly take your seat.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The lesson that follows is difficult to understand, but after a moment you realize that some of the terms are similar to science fiction. Obviously these people have made a few of the theories on the workings of the universe reality, yet you see nothing involving atomic energy, and when Molly accidentally flips to the periodic table of elements you realize that they only have 92 compared to the 100+ you remember from your science class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously something weird is going on. Then again you're a tiny, mouse sized human in a school of giant anthromorphic wolves on a planet where your considered either a pet or snack food. A lot of this is weird, but their science, while containing dozen of bits of information you don't understand, is obviously not that much farther ahead of Earth's. So how did they build those boxes, like the one you found in your closet? Or did they build them at all? Obviously you are lacking a bit of information, something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane can you please move?\" says Molly quietly, pushing at you with her paw gently. Well gently to her anyway, to you it feels like being hit by a car, but its over quickly and you find yourself at the edge of a piece of paper. She then proceeds to open a black bottle and dip the tip of her right claw in it. You notice the texture of the liquid and are surprised to see that it is ink. With a delicate hand she begins writing stuff down from the board on the sheet. Surprisingly, though the language is still not something you can understand, the numbers are the arabic numerals you remember from home. That is odd too. Why is it you speak their language, yet they write differently? And why do they use the same numbers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the page as she's writing you begin to see what you think are errors in her math. Looking up on the board you realize they have switched to doing formulas on their own, and the teacher is sitting in her chair watching. Obviously either they are either using a completely different math from what you remember, or Molly stinks at it. Either way you begin to do some of the formulas in your head, and finding that you can causes you to start. You were never what one would call an A student, but you weren't that bad either. Still most of this stuff didn't make sense to you before, but now it does. You can feel your brain working out the problems, almost like you had a second mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, you forgot to take the square root of the coefficient,\" you whisper to her, pointing at the place where her originally balanced formula begins to get off. For a moment she stares at you, and then moves her paw over it mumbling the numbers under her breath as she moves her claw over the point you specified. You feel slightly embarrassed when she turns back to you with a wondering gaze in her eye, and then proceeds to correct the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Thanks,\" she whispers back to you, and then moves on in her work. For a time the two of you work together, focusing on getting her assignment right, and you can ignore the fact of where you are, or with who. All that matters are the numbers, which are flowing through your head. The two of you continue to whisper to each other, which, though the students can't hear the teacher can. She was interested in you since the moment you walked in, more because she'd never had a pet in her class before and wondered how it might effect things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't done much to a large degree, but now that she hears you correct Molly's math she begins to get interested. None of the races allow lowly humans to learn math, reading, or writing, because it might give them ideas. At first she was going to warn Molly and let it go at that, but then she realized you were smarter than Molly. Obviously something was going on with you, and she was going to find out what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last you and Molly finish the work, well over three minutes before any of the others and you sit back, feeling good about yourself, and slightly disturbed as well. You had never been this good at math science or anything like that before. You hadn't been bad, but then again you watched Star Trek with your parents sometimes, and that show, while very scifi, still contained some real science in it. What's more some of the stuff in the physics book looked like something off Star Trek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that instant the bell rings, and for the first time you listen to it. Oddly enough you can compare it to the one in your school back home, but higher in pitch, lower in tempo, and with a bass beat added in. The bell is still basically three electronic pings, just like at home, but the odd nature of the sounds make it harder for you to hear them. Obviously the wolves have no problem though, and most shoot out of their seats running for the door. Molly shoves her books, papers, and the ink bottle back into her pack and puts you on her shoulder, then makes a beeline for the door herself but a voice makes her stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Wolfesbourg, may I see you for a moment?\" asks the teacher, her tone making it obvious that it is not a request. One of the other wolf girls looks over at Molly, and you realize they must be friends. The look in her eyes asks if Molly wants her to stay, but Molly shakes her head, nearly knocking you off in the motion. After a moment the class room clears out and you and Molly are alone with the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it you want to talk about Mrs. Orland?\" she asks the teacher, and you realize she's nervous. Considering the way she stood up to Dark out in the hall, and even her mother and brother, you are surprised to see her like this. You didn't think Molly got nervous. Still you are drawn to the teacher's face as she's not looking at Molly at all, instead her eyes are focused on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Wolfesbourg...</span></div></div>",

Keane says he's from Earth originally,\" she says to the teacher, some of her nervousness fading. You find your's is only increasing though as Mrs. Orland eyes you critically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth? Really? How did he get here from there?\" she asks Molly, and you find that your hurt. Obviously this woman doesn't consider you much more than an animal, and so asks your owner questions about your past rather than you yourself. Feeling that anger in you, you decide to speak up for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got here because I found a box with a glowing crystal in it in my closet. A flash of light and then I was in the grass near a picnicking family of giant wolf people. I went up to Molly and after almost getting eaten as part of her lunch I got her to notice me, and then I found out that I was on another planet, with no way back,\" you tell her forcefully. You don't know why you did it, but it made you feel better to do it, but you wish you hadn't a moment later when Mrs. Orland leans closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. so you found a crystal box? Well at least that means no one will have to be punished,\" she comments to herself, leaning back. For a moment you are surprised by this comment, why would anyone have to punished, and what for, but a second later Mrs. Orland explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Molly, you know its illegal to teach humans math or science. After all if we taught them such things they might begin to feel that they are worth something,\" she says in an offhand kind of way. You feel insulted, but this time you keep your tongue. This woman's prejudices are firmly in place, and you doubt you're going to break them today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, but I didn't teach Keane anything. He already knew this stuff on his own,\" she explains. Obviously she had been aware of this little law too, but hadn't bothered to mention it to you, probably to spare your feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be that as it may, I suggest that you make your human keep his mathematics to himself. If he doesn't and the wrong people overhear then you're going to be in a lot of trouble,\" she tells Molly, and you realize that if it gets Molly in trouble, then it might get you dead, and that's not something you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Mrs. Orland, and don't worry. Keane can behave himself when we're in the wrong company,\" she says, and you hear anger in her voice. Obviously she's as upset by Mrs. Orand's attitude towards you as you are, for a moment you are afraid she might try and fight her, but you quickly see that it won't come to that. Mrs. Orland is nodding her head towards the two of you, and absently waves you out of her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside you can feel ad hear Molly growling, and you can also feel that if you don't do something sh might very well go back into the class and make trouble. Looking around you see other wolves staring at both you and her, whispering things. Obviously high school here is no different then on Earth, and you're fairly confident that by the end of the hour no one will be unaware that Molly had to stay after class, or that it had something to do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly?\" you ask nervously as she opens her locker. She doesn't answer you for a moment, shoving some books from her pack into the metal box with enough force to dent it, and then puts you back on the shelf over her books much more roughly than she did before. For a moment you are afraid she might try and take her anger out on you, but she takes a moment to draw in a deep breath, bang a nearby locker with her fist, and then exhale before looking at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Keane?\" she asks, her voice still full of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, and you shouldn't be either. You heard the way she treated you, like you weren't even there. People like her just make me so angry. I mean they think their so much better than humans just because their bigger, well I can tell you...\" what follows that statement your not sure as it mostly comes out as an angry, frustrated growl. She takes a moment to compose herself again and then reaches into her locker again to place her on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, I'm sorry. I'm not angry at you, its just I don't like people like her. In a lot of ways they're worse than the ones like Dark. At least dad and I get it. That just because you aren't as big as us, doesn't mean you're not sentient,\" she tells you softly, placing you on her shoulder again. You realize in that moment how lucky you were to have appeared near a someone like her in this world, where such thinking is a rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you begin to consider the odds of that. Heck the odds of everything that happened to you since you got to this planet. Again you have the nagging suspicion that somewhere, someone is laughing at this entire thing, like some cheap dime store novel. Obviously though you can't do anything about your current standing for the moment and so you just sigh as Molly walks through the next door that's marked with a picture of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well food might have been a little bit of a stretch, but considering what the school is you assume the picture of a deer is reference to eating for giant wolves. Unfortunately you are right, and the instant Molly steps through those double doors you can't help but wish you were wrong. For a moment you wonder if Molly had been dragging you along this whole way, always intending on downing you as a snack, but considering everything she'd done so far you doubt it. After all she and her dad both treated you like you mattered, like you were sentient, and besides, sights like this probably didn't bother them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u2018inside' of the cafeteria at the wolf school was actually outside, though in most other respects it resembled a high school cafeteria. There were metal stands on wheels in front of which the young wolves lined up to get food dumped onto their plates, though for you the food looks highly unappetizing. Its not that its human, after all if it were human you would have just started screaming and probably not stopped. The food is just not what you're used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne line, the one Molly first gets into, serves mice, live mice. You watch as one of the wolves sets his serving on the ground after getting out of the line and then starts chasing after it. The sight of him catching the thing and ripping into it is a little to graphic for you, and luckily Molly notices your discomfort, and so gets out of that line into one that serves food more to your pallette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you have to wonder why a world of giant carnivores, at least as far as you know, developed hamburgers, but when you at last get to a table you find your hunger overriding your questions as she sets you down on her tray. For a moment Molly's eyes glaze over like the other wolves do when their eating, or fighting, and you are afraid that she might just eat you too. Her head lowers towards the burger and you can feel her hot breath roll over you, and you find yourself staring into the back of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly!\" you shout at her, and then she starts. For a second or two she looks around and stares at the people around her, almost all of whom are to engrossed in their own food to notice her. After a moment she leans down towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Keane?\" she whispers at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, what was that? You just sort of went nuts and I was afraid you were going to eat me,\" you tell her, and then her head backs up. You can see her looking around, and start. For probably the first time  she is gazing at the eating habits of her people from an outsiders perspective, and from the expression on her face it doesn't thrill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Keane, its just, we're carnivores. Meat sort of sets off old instincts, and we go a little out of control. I never thought about how it would look to someone like you. I'll try and control it. For you,\" she says, and then picks up the burger. After taking a huge bite out of it, one bigger than three of you, she holds it down to you so you can rip off a few crumbs. Still a little wary you take the offered sustenance and then retreat back. Molly's face takes on a hurt expression, but she resumes her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a time everything is silent between the two of you as you eat and watch her. You're beginning to see the differences in this world as compared to Earth, and you realize that some of hem have to do with tech. The school, and her house for instance. They have lighting, but its all bulb, not fluorescent rods like home. And the cars don't sputter like internal combustion cars do, instead they hum like the new electric ones back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other places too. The fridge back at Molly's house is walk in, but as far as you have been able to tell there is no air conditioning anywhere. The school, her house, and even the mall you were at yesterday were all the same temperature as the outside world. How is it that they have refrigerators, but not air conditioners? And why do they have bulb lights, which need replacing very often and are expensive to make, yet they also have electric cars, something that requires the same chemicals as those long lasting bulbs that your high school uses?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about this planet is off. The tech of the wolves is inconsistent. They seem to have taken big leaps forward in some areas, but never applied that knowledge to other areas. And then there's the boxes. Everyone seems to know about them, so why is Earth free? After all if these people wanted to, you have no doubt they could take over your home in a second. So why don't they? And what about the stuff in your own head. You speak their language, but don't read their writing, and they seem to be hurt by high pitched noise if its not accompanied by a bass counter point like the school bell. With that in mind shouldn't the humans have been able to fight these guys just by whistling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another thing, were are the other humans. You keep hearing from Molly and everyone else that humans are pets, or food, yet you haven't seen another one since you got here. The way Molly talks they're supposed to be common, yet as far as you can tell the wolves far exceed them in population size. The math doesn't make sense, nothing adds up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish your last few crumbs on that happy thought, intending to ask Molly about the other humans when the scene goes dark. For a moment you are afraid for yourself, but looking around you realize your just in someone's shadow, turning away from Molly, who is looking at whoever is casting the shadow you stare into the face of...</span></div></div>",

Still you try and smile back at her as she sits down across from Molly. The wolf girl either didn't notice you or is trying to ignore you as she sits down and continues to stare at Molly with an odd look in her eye. Still smiling she turn from Molly to stare at you and you find yourself wishing you could get smaller just to get out of her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's the human I keep hearing about?\" she asks, Molly nodding in a way that tells you the two are friends, close ones at that. Still you would seriously feel better if she would stop smiling and staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, word around school is this little guy punched Dark's lights out with his mighty fists of fury. Seeing him I have serious doubts about that, no offense\" she said, looking down at you. Obviously this newcomer fit into the same category as Molly and Mark, they all saw humans as more than objects, but probably still less than people, after all you were little more than a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is he the one you wanted me to...?\" she leaves the rest of the question unasked, and looking into her face you wonder what it is that fills in that blank. Obviously it wasn't something they were supposed to be talking about as both she and Molly glanced around nervously. Nodding again was Molly's only response, and then with a small gesture she pointed to a stand of trees near the edge of the school grounds. Looking back the other wolf girl studied the stand for a moment before nodding her ascent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word to you Molly picked you up off her tray, deposited it in a trash can, and then walked towards the trees with you on her shoulder. By this point you've already figured out that Molly, at some point, found time to make contact with this other wolf girl. Why was still an unknown, but you trusted Molly, well as much as a bite-sized human could trust a colossal wolf. Molly didn't mean to hurt you, and seemed to have your best interests at heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards the clearing you wanted to scream at her to stop slinking. She was dragging her feet, looking around nervously like she was some kind of spy. While you knew little about this world, or the wolves in particular, you were still of the opinion that she would have been less obvious if she had just walked normally. It was people who snuck around who drew attention, not those who looked like they belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two of you were safely among the trees, and the sounds of the school were so faded you couldn't hear anything clearly anymore. Still you weren't sure about what was about to happen. Molly was still in \u2018spy' mode so you doubted that she would spill the beans for the moment, but that left your mind to wander. Just as you were almost sure that both you and she were in some kind of trap the other wolf girl walked into the trees, and Molly breathed a heavy sigh of relief, nearly knocking you from her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aura, I'm so glad I got in touch with you last night,\" she tells the other wolf girl, finally along you to put a name to the face. Looking up and down the other wolf girl you realize that this was probably not her first time doing something like this. Her mannerisms and stride were to calm and confident. Whatever was about to happen, she'd done it before, and often, Molly obviously hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad too. I was surprised to hear from our mall contact that another human had been found, but even more so that he was with you. You guys don't exactly live in an area that would be rife with humans,\" she tells Molly, both of them ignoring you. For a moment you consider speaking up and asking what is going on, but you dismiss that idea. You trust Molly, and you kind of liked that old guy at the mall the other day when he was making your clothes. You had no doubt that he was the contact she had just mentioned. For a moment the trees were dead still, and then both wolf girls turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is it true you knocked out Dark with some kind of weapon?\" asks Aura. You are stunned silent for a moment by the fact that she asked you directly, not Molly. Obviously you would have to revise your opinion of Aura. She didn't think of you as a pet, she really did see you as a person. Well that or she wanted to hear it straight from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Him, and a couple of others. I guessed that your physiology was close to dogs from Earth, and that your ears work along the same lines. With my smaller stature I believe my voice raised an octave or two, too you anyway, and that means a whistle is probably even higher in pitch, and high pitched sounds hurt dogs. Your kind seem to be even worse about it though,\" you tell her, replaying the incident in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Cathy will want to hear about that. You better tell her it when you see her,\" she comments to you, and this time you can't help it, you leap to your feet, as well as you can, and point a finger at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First you better tell me what the hell is going on here,\" you say, not loudly of course for fear of being overheard, but firmly enough to cause both to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I didn't tell you anything about this did I. You were so keen on going home that I took you to the mall the other day to get in touch with a group that could send you to a free human settlement. It may not be home, but without a crystal box it's the best I can do,\" Molly tells you, and you begin to feel tears in your eyes. You realize now, for the first time, that Molly really is your friend, of course now the question remains, where is this free human colony, and why is it free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScenario 1: The colony is in the mountains, in a cavern to small for the carnivores to enter, and thanks to the efforts of people like Aura and Molly it has remained hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScenario 2: The colony is on an island to the south of the mainland, a place the carnivores don't go because they don't like the water. Some can swim well enough, but the deep water of the ocean just sets off their primal fears.</span></div></div>",

I never told you, but...I love you...\" Molly say's, right before she closes her eyes, swallowing him whole. You scream the whole way down until ice cream gets in your mouth. You slide down fast, plopping in her belly. She moans from you moving in her belly. A few moments later your melted into nothing, and Molly lies down in her bed. After thinking about what she's just done, tears begin to flow down her face. She starts to sob. \"What've i done...I'm so sorry Keane...\" Molly say's, as she just cries...</span></div></div>",

He's dressed in jeans and a windbreaker and walks over to hug Molly tightly.  Your footing is put off balance for a moment at the sudden and tight embrace, making you look down Molly's back, her tail wagging furiously.  The two wolves move to kiss each other readily, you watch as Molly's cheeks distend from the male's tongue licking into her mouth as you get the impression that the two are close, very, very close.  After a few awkward moments you cough to remind them of your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Patrick, this is Keane, he's kinda, well, I guess technically my pet.\" Molly said, finally said, nuzzling the male.  \"Keane, this is Patrick, my packmate.  We've been going out for six months.\" she said, blushing softly as Patrick licked her cheek opposite of you with his long, sloppy tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six months today, actually, happy anniversary.\" The young male said, giving Molly a small box.  Inside of it was a necklace, a gold fitting around a pearl easily the size of your head and torso.  You've quickly come to the conclusion that packmate would be roughly translated into boyfriend and girlfriend.  \"Mmmm, and you know what the tradition is for the six month... don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly blushed, stroking Patrick's face, \"Oh, I'd love to, but, well, it's 'that time of year,' you know?\"  You weren't sure what time of year she meant, maybe her period or something.  Though, the question didn't seem to bother Patrick as his fuzzy hands moved all over Molly's breasts, squeezing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, well, I'll be good, though.  Want to give you pleasure.\" He whispered, kissing along Molly's collarbone, making the bitch moan in pleasure, she didn't seem to be fighting Patrick's carnal advances.  You couldn't help but blush, sure, you were a bit annoyed that they were forgetting you're watching them, but, were you making out with your girlfriend, you'd probably be just as oblivious.  Patrick's hands clutched over Molly's shoulders, bringing her closer to his face as he buried his muzzle into her bosom, making Molly groan in bliss.  His claws raked into the shirt she was wearing, and you could hear your \"lifeline\" tearing a little bit, but he pulls away to lift Molly's shirt up over her breasts.  The line halfway ripped, but still attached, you aren't sure how much weight it'd hold anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore clothing rustling was heard below and you see Patrick's jeans down around his ankles, his boxers pushed down as well as a rather huge, even compared to his giant size, furry sheath was hanging, a tapered red tip peeking out of the flesh.  Molly gasped in surprise, but reached down to feel over her boyfriend's length, \"W-we really shouldn't...\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay, my love, it'll be okay.\" he whispered, pulling Molly to him suddenly to kiss her again.  This causes you to tumble forward as well, down past Molly's breasts.  All that's holding you from meeting the ground so far below was a ripped cord around you.</span></div></div>",

As you plummet, the two teenagers move closer together and, you aren't sure what happened, things went dark fast.  The whole world was dark, wet and hot as you caught your breath, there was stirring and movement all around you, and as you looked up, you saw Molly's panties, both teens having disrobed a little more, and you realize you fell right into Patrick's sheath.  More of Patrick's penis slid out of the hot pouch of flesh into the open air while the teens kissed and fondled one another.  A hairy finger moved Molly's panties to one side, and you see her folds, swollen and dripping, nestled in her pubic fur.  She whined some more, \"P-Patrick, I'm in heat.\" she muttered, but wasn't pushing him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'okay, baby, I'll pull out.\" He muttered, every teen's promise.  Molly seemed content with the words as she got down on her hands and knees on the soft earthen floor.  Seems the teens do things traditional.  The swelling red shaft below you slides more into the open air before sinking into Molly's willing cave.  You're frozen in fear, getting out of one wet, hot cave and pushed into the other one.  A barrier prevents Pat's shaft from pushing any further as Molly turns back to her packmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, my love.  Make this bitch a dame.\" she whispered before Patrick firmly shoved his shaft inside.  The hymen tore around the shaft, as you're covered in her cherry blood and Molly's juices.  Both wolves growl in their lusts as the heavy lovemaking begins.  You're tossed forward along the shaft with the motions, feeling Molly's vaginal muscles pulling you in towards her body, though with enough effort, you can position yourself where you won't be crushed.  It's hard to breath, watching Patrick mate with Molly, the humid air filling up your lungs as his preseed spits out into her channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the base, you see Patrick's cock swelling up, and barely make out Molly's voice from outside of her, \"D-don't tie me, Pat... ooooh.\" she muttered.  Patrick doesn't say anything, pushing and pulling faster, the knot swelling up even more, popping and slurping in and out of Molly's sex.  By the looks of things, it doesn't seem like the teen male will heed Molly's plea, though, maybe if you try something, you might prevent Molly from having puppies of her own.  You grunt and make your way towards that knot, pounding your fits and beating against it, weakened by the exhaustion from being in this mating, but, you're going to try your best to get Pat to pull out.</span></div></div>",

Her channel rumbling around you, and had you known any better, you'd feel like you were in an earthquake.  You feel Patrick's shaft throbbing hard beneath you, making you tumble forward, hitting wetly on the soaking ground in between Patrick's tip and Molly's cervix.  \"F-fuck... y-you said you'd pull out!\" You hear Molly tell her boyfriend, though by the sound of her voice, she didn't seem too terribly upset with Patrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, h-haven't, ooooh, cum yet, Molly.  J-just keep still and I might... go down before I go off.\" he muttered.  By the looks of the massive length, he was about a hair's tickle from flooding the bitch, and you know that he won't pull out before flooding his lover.  His huge tip was winking at you, drooling more and more preseed, getting thicker and whiter with his semen, most of which he was holding back, but, you knew that it wasn't going to be long before he starts to gush his seed into this small area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly's inner walls ripple around you and that shaft in an aftershock of her orgasm.  You hear Patrick howl outside, his shaft throbbing a few more times before it gushes against you.  Huge, strong volleys of his semen presses you against Molly's cervix as both wolves outside howl in their bliss.  The slimy fluid seems to keep coming, and Molly's adding to the juices in here.  The humidity is getting worse, and the fluid-level rises up more and more.  You aren't sure how much longer you can stay inside of Molly's tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look behind you, seeing Molly's cervix dilate just a little, taking in some of the semen into her womb.  You see a possible way out, though, getting back out of Molly might be a bit tricky.  Patrick continues to leak his semen into his girlfriend's body, and you have little time to make a decision.  It's now or never.</span></div></div>",

Though logic was trying to tell you that you might not make it out again, you had faith in her noticing you were gone. By then, perhaps she could help you get out of that prison before you died in there from dehydration. Right now, however, you couldn't see yourself surviving in this part of her and you had no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped battling the current, which quickly took you to Molly's cervix, which had opened up a bit more as the flooding continued. Your head was being sucked down under the semen as your legs went through her cervix, though you were blocked by your waist. It seemed she was slightly smaller than you were around, and you were now at risk of drowning since you couldn't get your head back above the surface. Putting your arms against the floor below you, you pushed, and that, combined with the pressure, pushed you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear Molly suddenly become startled just as you pushed through, and she seemed to have noticed you though she was in too much pleasure to do anything right now. The flow finally slowed down, and then stopped as you saw more semen coming in through her cervix. With the amount he had came, she was sure to be pregnant now, there was no doubt about that in your mind. She just laid there as she panted, hot from her recent foray with her boyfriend and waiting for him to be able to pull out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and started brushing some of his cum off, and you could feel her organs throbbing as blood flowed through them. Suddenly, you felt a jerk as you heard rumbling coming from high above you, and then the sounds of yelling outside of her. She was mad, and rightfully so given he had seduced her, and you personally hoped that she would teach him a lesson. Given the current state of things, he didn't have much of a choice but to listen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you'd pull out!\" She said, fury pouring out of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry, babe.\" He said rather coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no you're not! And now I'm going to be pregna--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was cut short as she felt something, or rather you, wandering about inside of her, trying to keep your balance as they fought. She finally remembered you and looked over at your string, seeing it dangling from her cut off part way down. Immediately, she was thrown into a panic, as she called out, \"Keane! KEANE!\" You called back but she couldn't hear you, so you finally had to resort to pounding on her womb's walls, which she actually felt. Realizing what had happened, she launched at him again, saying, \"You clumsy omega! YOUR CARELESSNESS LANDED KEANE INSIDE OF ME! I swear, after we're untied, we're through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, the long and the sort of teenage love, you thought as you sat there inside her womb, trying to wait for him to pull out. It was a full half hour before he could, and you could hear a snarl as she chased him off, sending you bouncing around inside her. As he ran off you could hear her crying, she didn't want to be a mother, before she turned her attention back to you.</span></div></div>",

The cervix had closed up after Molly's ex-boyfriend pulled out, so escape was impossible. You except your fate and fall asleep, but little did you know that her womb was trying to save you. As you slept, an umbilical chord attached itself to you and her womb filled up with a fluid that you were able to breath. Molly feels your heart come into sync with her own and says, \"Oh my goodness, I'm pregnant with Keane.\" You are oblivious to her saying this since the umbilical chord had caused you to fall into a deep sleep that would last until you were reborn. Molly cries, but not because she doesn't want to be a mother, because she realized that having life growing inside her was one of the most wonder feelings in the world. Now she knew how her mother felt when she and her brother were inside her. She was happy and prepared to become a mother, and best of all her human friend would become her son. There was one thing she would never do, if you didn't remember your past life, she would never tell you who your father was. \"Don't worry Keane I'll take good care of you,\" She says, and goes to tell her parents the news (technically they were your grandparents now), of course she left out a few details, and they were happy to hear that she is with child. They were also mad though, not at her, but at her ex, for one, she had told him to pull out, and for another, he didn't fight back to say he would be part of their grandchild's life. Your grandfather then said that he hopes to never see him again. As the months pass your memories have completely faded and you had developed baby wolf features and were no longer human, and you had made your mother's (Molly) belly big and round. It was two days before your due date, and you unconsciously start kicking your mother. She feels your movement and says, \"Mom, the pup's moving again.\" Your grandma comes over and feels your movement. \"It will be here any day now honey, I think it's best we take you to the hospital,\" your grandma says to your mom. They were soon off to the hospital and arrive there fifteen minutes later. Your Mom checks into a private room and puts on a hospital gown, where she waits for you to want to come out. The day had finally come for your birth and your mom goes into labor. She says between her screams as her water broke, \"Mom, the pup, it's coming.\" Your grandmother soon brings in the doctors and nurses and take your mother to the delivery room, she was now fully dilated. Once they get there, your mom starts to push you out, which takes half an hour. After your completely out, your mother is relieved to have the pain gone. The doctors finish cleaning you and place you in your mother's welcoming arms. She looks at you with loving motherly eyes as you look at her and she says, \"So your the one that's been kicking me. My little Keane.\" \"Keane? That's a wonderful name for him honey. He is so adorable, I'm proud of you dear.\" Reality had changed for everyone except your mother who remembered everything. She was happy to have you as her son and guides you to her right breast where you suckle off her nipple and feel warm nourishing milk flow into your mouth and down to your stomach. As you enjoy your meal, your mother says, \"I'm so glad I got pregnant at the end of senior year. My he's going to be a handful when he is older.\" Your mom and grandma smile as you continue to nurse and then fall asleep in your mother's arms.</span></div></div>",

Your theory fades as she wraps her fingers around your world, her finger tips gentle brushing against you making you going go fully erect.

Molly moans, \u201c Mmm strawberry.\u201d And she looks down at her boyfriend\u2019s awaiting member and smiles. You fill a gust of her sweet sexy breath and scream  as she laps at his base all the way up barely touching you. She then giggles and her maw opens to you. You scream but Molly can\u2019t her you over her moans of bliss. Her maw descends on his member causing both of them to moan. Her tongue begins to lap circles around his head lathering you in her saliva. You are tossed around her mouth for minutes. Finally Kane can\u2019t hold on for much longer as his member is throbbing for release. Molly allows just that and you are sent flying in a whirl of cum as she licks his member clean. She then plays with the cum for a minute. She then opens her maw to reveal big kiss. You scream as their tongues collide cum and saliva stirred around each of their tongues. You are pinned by Kane\u2019s tongue on the roof of Molly\u2019s maw. As he withdraws his tongue who\u2019s are you on?</span></div></div>",

You study the boy wolf from where you are. He looks to be about 8 years old in human years, with fluffy gray fur all over his body. He's wearing a green button shirt and blue jeans. He puts something in his mouth and laughs at something his mother says. Almost there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the little boy wolf stands up. He stands on his back legs like a human would. He says something to his father, then starts running in your direction! His feet shake the earth around you. You watch helplessly as his right foot comes down on you. Suddenly you regain control and you dive out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's too late. You feel the giant wolf's foot push you to the ground, and pain shoots through your body. You think it's the end, but suddenly you rise into the air. You're stuck to the boy wolf's foot! Your clothes are stuck to some mud on the bottom of his foot, and your leg is caught between his toes. You squirm as much as you can but you remain stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground starts rising up again. You brace for the impact. You twist your body to avoid being squished, but it still hurts. You rise into the air again. And down again. Up. Down. This continues for what seems like forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you feel like you can't take any more, the little boy wolf slows down. He raises his foot into the air and peels you off it. You lay in his paw as he raises you to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What are you?...\" the giant wolf asks, peering at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a human!\" you shout at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy wolf blinks, then his eyes widen. A huge toothy grin comes across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! A live human! Really? This is awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like his choice of words. \"'Live' human?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! All the humans I've seen were either dead or cooked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. These wolves eat humans! You feel the wolf's breath wash over you, and it smells horrible. Like rotting meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... not going to eat me, are you?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! I like humans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief. \"Thank God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the only one in my family who likes humans. If my mom and dad found you, you'd be eaten before you know it! And my sister hates humans! Hmmm... I better not show you to my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You have to help me kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I could bring you back to where you came from. Where did you come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came from my world.

Don't worry, you'll be safe with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a splash of water on your head. You look up and see that the sky has turned gray. Large, fat raindrops were starting to fall. Billy looked up too, and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's raining...\" he said sadly. \"That means we'll have to leave. I better stay dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly set you on the ground and walked away from you, the ground shaking with his every step. You turn and see a very large plastic bag a few feet from you. Billy starts rummaging through the bag and pulls out a yellow slicker and yellow rubber boots. He pulls on the boots over his feet and puts on the raincoat. He buttons up the slicker then reaches for you. He raises you to his smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to stay in my pocket until we get home, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. Billy opens the pocket in his raincoat and drops you in. You lay down and hold on as Billy bends to pick up the bag, then begins walking back to his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull yourself to the opening of the pocket and look out. You can see Billy's family getting ready to leave. They pack up their food and other things and stuff them in the bag, then begin walking away. As you watch, the park suddenly opens up onto a road. Large houses line the road, and there are sidewalks, just like a human road. You lay down again and wait out the trip. Occasionally Billy slipped his paw into the pocket and petted you a bit. You patted his paw to let him know you're alright. For a giant wolf, Billy was a good kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Billy's paw emerges in the pocket and takes you out. You look around and are amazed to see your surroundings. It looks like a child's room, complete with toys, bed, drawers, closet and everything else. Billy places you on his bed and hangs up his raincoat. He lays on the bed in back of you, causing you to fall over. Billy giggles and puts you on your feet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry? I brought some food.\" Billy takes out a small plastic container full of food from the picnic. He takes some out and places it before you. You look at it with disgust. Large pieces of meat burnt at the edges, red and dripping with grease. You can see some blood as well. It looks a lot like a human arm, and it smells horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I'll pass on that stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I brought more.\" Billy takes some more food from the container. Mac and cheese! Your favorite. You pick up a noodle and chomp off a piece, enjoying the savory taste of cheddar cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it!\" Billy says, smiling. You nod and smile at him. Billy pets you a bit and rests his head on the bed, watching you eat. You feel his breath on your back (thankfully it doesn't smell anymore) and you feel comfortable. You sit and eat your mac and cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Billy! Time for bed!\" Billy's mother shouts from downstairs. To you her voice is like a lion's roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom!\" Billy shouts back. \"I'll be back in a minute, Keane!\" Billy hops off the bed, causing you to lose your balance again, and runs out of the room. You keep on eating your mac and cheese, feeling a bit safer in this giant world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the door to the bedroom opens. It's...</span></div></div>",

It would be cruel not to feed you.\" Billy picks you up and lays on the bed, then places you on his chest. He giggles as he watches you rise and fall with his breathing. He takes you in his paw again and places you on his pillow, next to his head. He turns his head to face you, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Keane, it's hard to believe you're here!\" Billy says quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" you reply, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Billy's mother can be heard outside the room. Billy quickly stuffs you inside his pyjamas through the opening at his throat and slides under his blanket. His fur is surprisingly fluffy. You flatten out the fur so you can  breathe under the pyjamas and lay on your back. Everything suddenly goes dark as Billy's mother tucks him in. You hear her say goodnight, then hear her footsteps fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly moves the blankets off his chest and unbuttons the button where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close,\" Billy says. \"Hmmm... I don't have any place to put you. Do you want to stay where you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, it's comfortable here,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Keane...

I mean, it is awkward being your pet, but I'll manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be my pet! Just friends. Want to be my friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Billy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Billy smiles at you, and you can tell he's really happy. He strokes you softly with his paw, and you pat his paw lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Keane,\" Billy says contently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Billy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly buttons his pyjama top again and pulls the blanket over himself. You pull his soft, fluffy fur over you to get comfortable. The warmth and the movement of Billy's chest makes you very sleepy, and for the first time today you feel completely safe.

You feel a momentary spike of panic as Billy\u2019s claws come toward you; you know he won\u2019t hurt you, but his claws are enormous! Billy gently wraps his paw around your chest, and lifts you to his face. He\u2019s holding a toothbrush in his other paw, but the toothbrush is larger even for his size than a human\u2019s would be... after all, wolves do have larger and sharper teeth than humans, and it wouldn\u2019t do for the toothbrush to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly\u2019s mouth is covered in pink froth. \u201cI\u2019ll just set you down on the sink. Don\u2019t fall in, ok?\u201d As you nod, you are enveloped by an oddly scented breeze. It isn\u2019t minty, as most toothpastes are, but it is oddly refreshing. Considering the nature of its makers, you decide not to ask what the scent is exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly sets you down on the back of the sink, behind and to the side of the faucet. Billy goes back to brushing his teeth, giving you quite a view of them. You devoutly hope never to experience the power of teeth like those firsthand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly reached down and turns on the faucet. Hundreds of gallons of water churn out of the pipe, and into a sizeable hole on the bottom of the sink. You realize that Billy wasn\u2019t joking about not falling in; even if you land unhurt, you may well fit through that drain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly stoops down to the height of the faucet. You notice that he has to lean quite far; the sink is set a lot lower than a human sink would be. Billy stops his head in front of the stream, and laps water into his mouth. He swishes it around, and spits out enough froth to fill a small pool on Earth. Billy grabs a large soap on the other side of the faucet from you, and washes his hands, paying particular attention to his claws. Then he does something unexpected; he leans on the mirror above you for support, and raises a foot into the sink! That\u2019s why the sink was set so low; since these wolves didn\u2019t wear shoes, they would have to wash their feet at least as often as their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly isn\u2019t as tall as an adult, so he still struggles to balance himself in the sink that is set slightly too heigh for him. You hope he doesn\u2019t fall on you, but he seems to have practice with this sort of thing. Billy lowers the foot he had been working on, and raises the other into the sink. You feel somewhat intimidated by this whole display; even though Billy is acting entirely innocently, he seems to be displaying every possible thing that you fear you might get killed with soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly puts his other foot down, and looks at you. \u201cWell, Keane...\u201d</span></div></div>",

I guess we just have to skip to the washing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider protesting, but you decide that even if you win, Billy would probably just complain about you smelling bad. You hope he doesn\u2019t mean washing your entire body; you can\u2019t very well get clean with your clothes on, and you don\u2019t want the young wolf to see you naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly cuts off a small (for him) sliver of soap with a claw. \u201cOk, Keane, hold out your hands.\u201d Billy holds you in front of the stream of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your hands out into the water. The pressure of the water pulls your arms back down, but Billy only wanted your hands to get wet anyway. He takes the soap between his thumb and forefinger, and starts to rub your hands. Billy is certainly going out of the way to be gentle, and it actually feels pretty good. Your eyes close halfway as Billy massages your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly stops, and looks carefully at you. He remembers the trouble you had keeping your arms raised under the faucet, so he grabs your forearms and holds them in place. The rushing water rinses off the soap, and also feels fairly good. You start to think that maybe this whole situation isn\u2019t quite as bad as you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly takes your hands out of the water, and holds them to his face. Satisfied with the results, Billy turns you sideways, and briefly holds your feet under the water before cutting off another slice of soap and raising it toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou protest, startled, \u201cHey! ...what are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got to wash your feet too. Do you want your feet to get all dirty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh softly to yourself. That\u2019s right, these wolves don\u2019t seem to wear anything on their feet if it isn\u2019t absolutely necessary; he probably hasn\u2019t seen normal shoes before! \u201cThose aren\u2019t my feet, Billy. I\u2019m wearing shoes. Like those boots you wore in the mud? Humans wear shoes a lot more than you guys seem to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, ok. Sorry... mind if I take them off then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and Billy gently pulls your soggy shoes off with slight popping sounds. \u201cYeah, I was wondering why you didn\u2019t have any toes. I was pretty sure humans had them... ummm... Keane?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re socks Billy. They come off too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly awkwardly tries to fit his claw between your skin and socks. \u201cLike this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm...\u201d You consider what course of action gives you the least chance of getting hurt. \u201cTry just pulling them off. Gently...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly carefully grasps your feet between two fingers, and pulls. Your sock slides partway off, but since it\u2019s wet, slippes out of Billy\u2019s fingers. Billy\u2019s tongue pokes out of the side of his mouth slightly as he concentrates. He grabs the limp end of your sock, and pulls it off with a smile. You chuckle slightly at the absurdity of the situation, of all the things to give him trouble...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly pulls your other sock off, and looks at the new objects in his hand. He sniffs at them, and noses the four items around for a bit, before slipping them into his pocket. \u201cWhy do humans like to wear those things, Keane?\u201d Billy asks as he raises you up to his face, still held horizontally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, humans don\u2019t have pads like wolves do. We can hurt our feet much easier. And besides... um...\u201d You start to giggle as Billy sniffs your feet. \u201cH-hey, stop th... that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly seems very interested in your feet right now. \u201cI haven\u2019t really looked a human\u2019s feet before. Why is your heel all short like that? Do you walk on it? What about those darker parts, aren\u2019t they pads?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to control your laughter. \u201cWell, yes pretty much. Humans walk on their heels, like raccoons, and... um... well... that\u2019s pretty much all I can think of right now. The darker parts are callouses, they work sorta like pads, but sharp stuff can still poke the lighter parts, and it really hurts. That\u2019s why humans wear shoes.\u201d You valiantly marshall your thoughts against what looks to be quite an onslaught of questions.</span></div></div>",

Billy holds your feet under the faucet, quickly rubs soap on them, and rinses them off. \u201cWell, Keane, I don\u2019t want anyone else to see you, so I guess you\u2019ll just have to go back into my shirt until I have another place to put you or we\u2019re alone.\u201d Billy rubs your head with his finger, and slips you gently into his shirt again. \u201cNow, be quiet until I think it\u2019s safe to take you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly buttons his shirt back up, and you are again covered by darkness. You feel a large object gently press you against Billy\u2019s chest, then you hear the sounds of doors opening and footsteps. Suddenly, you can see again, and Billy pulls you from his shirt. Billy looks at you from arm\u2019s length, and then gently sets you down on his bed. \u201cOk Keane, I\u2019ve got to get ready for school now. No peaking!\u201d Billy pulls the covers over you with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear many different noises for a while, and finally, Billy pulls the covers off you. Billy is wearing his day clothes, a red shirt and jeans. Billy wags his tail and pets you. \u201cI\u2019m so happy I found you, Keane,\u201d Billy says with a big smile. Billy picks you up, and hugs you. You lay there, flattened vertically against Billy\u2019s chest, and think about what would likely have happened if any other wolf found you. \u201cI\u2019m happy you found me too, Billy,\u201d you say, and push against Billy\u2019s chest, the closest you can come to hugging him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly whines involuntarily, and squeezes you harder against his chest. You can hear Billy\u2019s tail swishing audibly behind him. After a while, Billy holds you in front of his face. He watches you, and you feel warm air blow gently over you. Billy nuzzles your head, then opens his hand, and rubs the side of his muzzle against you. You pat Billy\u2019s muzzle, just below his eye, and then hug it, finally finding a part of him that you can wrap your arms at least partly around other than his fingers. Billy closes his eyes, and you can feel him relax under you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Billy\u2019s eyes snap open with a start. \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m late!\u201d Billy rubs his muzzle against you quickly once more, and then slips you into his shirt. \u201cSorry Keane, but I\u2019ve got to hurry, I don\u2019t want to be late to school.\u201d You hear Billy pick up something heavy, and swing it around onto his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly runs down the stairs, and swings around in another direction. You are thankful for being in such a secure place; as it is, you still feel pulled around with ever motion Billy takes. You hear Billy shout, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late!\u201d You hear loud sounds of hurried and quite probably messy eating: crunches, slurps, even the occasional growl from one of the wolves there. Billy\u2019s mother admonishes him to \u201cStop wasting so much food!\u201d, and Billy\u2019s father asks him if he needs a ride to school.</span></div></div>",

His eyes grew hollow and glazed over and you began to cry.<br>\r\nThe creature's gold eyes met yours and you felt excitement bristle through you.

Wolf slobber!\u201d you cried and wiped off the wolf's drool. Suddenly, you held your wrist out to his mouth. The wolf looked at you before taking it into his mouth and applying only a small amount of pressure.<br>\r\nThere was no blood, nor extreme agony. Only a small burning pain that vanished as soon as the creature removed his mouth. <b>I have marked you, no other wolf may harm you, you are mine and mine only, understand, Keane? </b> You absently nodded as the great timer wolf turned and trotted into the fog. The man's body was no only a simple dot, no blood or sour stench.</i><br>\r\nYour stomach churned as you rolled up your sleeve, softly gasping when you saw teeth marks. Billy yawned and turned over. <br>\r\nYou immediately got over your crush. He was too young and innocent to have a girlfriend like you. \u201cI'm\u2026 marked,\u201d you whispered, your voice filled with awe and wonder. You strained hard to remember the wolf's voice but, it wouldn't come. <br>\r\n<i>I am always watching, in my human-like wolf form, so needn't worry, Keane, I will find you\u2026</i> An alluring voice whispered as you curled up and tried to sleep.<br>\r\nAt around three AM you fell asleep, dreaming of that wolf.<br>\r\n <i>You leaned against a tree, his head rested on your lap as you stroked his flank, rising and falling while he caught his breath.<br>\r\nGold eyes closed as he seemed to sigh and shift to get comfortable against your thighs. You were wearing a black corest and old fashioned white dress with lace around the hem, much like little riding hood\u2014without the hood. Your dark tresses were curled softly and your brown eyes were closed as you hummed a gentle tune.<br>\r\nThe wolf sighed with content and drifted off to sleep.\u201c You're are beautiful when you sleep,\u201d you told him and closed your eyes as well. The sun kept both of you warm and the shade of the great big tree kept you from getting over heated.<br>\r\nA breeze ruffled the meadow's flowered and stalks and sent a leaf on the wolf's snout. He sneezed twice and you mumbled, \u201cBless you,\u201d twice.<br>\r\nThe wolf rumbled something that sounded suspiciously like laughter and you fell asleep again.

Billy still wore his flannel pajamas and you wore dressed in the clothes on your back. <br>\r\nMallory shouted something again and swung like a batter. You dove for cover under Billy's pile of pillows and hit it with a muffled bounce. Mallory growled at Billy and lunged, using her fist instead of her pillow. You gulped silently and flattened yourself against the pillow's lumpy surface.<br>\r\nThere was silence for about ten seconds before you heard Billy snap, \u201cWhat'd I do that <i>so</i> evil?\u201d Mallory seemed to waver and you peeked your head out. Mallory stood there, tears brimmed in her eyes, mouth agape, hair looking as though it were chopped with kitchen sheers. Billy looked smug, arms crossed over his chest, eyebrow raised, smirk on his muzzle. <br>\r\nFor a minute, you saw Jeremy, you're ex-best friend, who you later found out was dating your sister. \u201cMy HAIR!\u201d Mallory snarled, teeth bared in a threatening grin. Billy pretended to look innocent. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d he asked with a pouty look on his furry features. <br>\r\nTears rolled down Mallory's cheeks as she grabbed her pillow, hit Billy in the side with it and stormed out. Billy shook his head and smiled cruelly. \u201cMan, she'll never guess it was me,\u201d he said aloud, as though he'd forgotten you were there. \u201cHey! Billy, remember me?\u201d you asked, waving your arms wildly, scrambling up the mountain that was the pillow. Once atop the pillow, you began to jump, waving your arms like a moron, shouting billy's name over and over again. <br>\r\nHe finally noticed you after what seemed to be twenty minutes. By then, he was wearing a black shirt, black jeans, his hair in his eyes, a black parka and two belt chains on either hip. \u201cOh, Keane, there you are!\u201d He flashed you a  phony smile and put you in his paw. You got the chills. You rubbed your fishnet clad arms and scowled. \u201cI'm cold,\u201d you announce more crudely than you intended. Billy gave you something.

You could tell by the horny look in his eyes it probably wouldn't end well for poor Billy. Nervously, Billy walked up to his dad without a word, afraid of being punished for keeping you a secret from them. \"Think you can help your old man out?\" His dad asked, pointing his other hand at his slowly growing hard-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Billy and his dad, Mark, were bisexual, so this wasn't the first time they did this. Billy nodded eagerly, his tail wagging eagerly as his own cock already started getting hard. Without the need of getting on the ground as Billy was about stomach height to his dad, Billy rubbed a hand against Mark's sheath and quickly his member came out further. Mark moaned in ecstasy, and right away pre dribbled out of his length. Billy lapped the pre up and slowly licked the cock as soon it reached its full length. You're assumption was correct, as it really was about 3 times Billy's own cock size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you thought that they had forgotten you were there, but as if they read your mind you were pulled closer to Mark's cock. \"Impressive, ain't it?\" Mark chuckled down to you. You could only nod, looking the cock up and down. Mark snickered a bit and moaned as Billy's licks became more frequent. Mark buried you into the saliva soaked dick and you were stuck to it face first. You could feel Billy's tongue lap over you and the cock you were stuck to shivered as the dad closed in on his climax. Mark panted as he neared his climax, and he grabbed his son, going to jam his rod and climax into him. And you were still stuck to the cock.</span></div></div>",

Get on your hands and knees and point your tail hole towards the sky!\" Mark tells Billy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pop sound, you and Mark's whale sized dick (at your height, it might as well be) are out of Billy's maw. You then look at Billy, having turned around and kneeled down and places his hands on the floor in front of him. The wolf boy then does a half pushup, his tail hole exposed to the world and Mark's dick (and YOU).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father then brushes the boy's ass cheeks, even slapping them with his cock. He then aims his wolf prick at his son's puckering anus, you see it and smell the wolf boy's scented tail hole. You recieved mixed thoughts, the smell wasn't bad but wasn't great either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a good look at my son's asshole, human,\" Mark tells you, \"as you'll be staying in there for quite a while!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further words, Mark shoves his dick (and you) deep into Billy's butt. A loud moan escaped the boy's lips, having not been fucked in the ass for a long time. Mark grunts as he continues to drive his cock deeper into his son's anus, feeling your squirming. He wasn't sure if you were struggling to get out or wiggling in pleasure, but he didn't care. So he then grabs Billy's ass cheeks and started fucking, shoving his cock in and out of his son's ass with ferocity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you were free of Mark's dick. All that movement caused you to break free, leaving you to the sight of the father wolf's cock head going back and forth in the wolf boy's butt. You were getting horny from this! Without warning, you run straight at the cock and jump into the piss slit, sending yourself halfway into Mark's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father wolf feels your body decend deeper into his balls, his knot now the size of his son's hands. The squirming bulge in his cock, the moans of his son, the clenching anus on his dick; it became too much. With a great thrust, he sends his hyper knotted prick deep inside Billy's tail hole and throws his head back as he howls his orgasm. Billy couldn't take anymore and started to yip like crazy as he cums, his anal walls clenching his daddy's manhood real hard as if it was trying to drink his father's cock dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you were propelled back into the wolf boy's tail hole along with a tsunami of Mark's cum. The entire anus filled with the father's spunk and you were floating in the stuff. You felt like you was in paradise and decided to drink some of the cum. Salty, just like you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Mark leans his face towards Billy's and gives the young pup a deep kiss, their tongues dancing in their mouths. After a minute of this, the father then breaks the kiss and looks at the swell in Billy's gut. Mark's knot was big, but the cum he shot out inside his son was huge. He then grabs one of his son's ass cheeks and squeezes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your stay, little human,\" he said. \"Because once you're out of my boy's ass, you and I are gonna have a talk...and end it with you in my balls. After that, I'll have my son suck me off and you'll be gulped down his throat along with my cum and you'll struggle in his belly as it digests you alive!\" With that said, he resumes to make out with his son/lover, grabbing his son/lover's swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you was too horny to care what was just said. You heard it all and you was scared at the last bits, but you find it very erotic for some reason. You couldn't wait! Could it be the cum you drank made you feel this way? Whatever it was, you continued to pleasure yourself and started making out with the anal walls around you as you hump them in lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

A cleared plate in front of him, smears of syrup and butter marking it. It was far from his loudest, but this one taste a little different. Better, though he couldn't put his finger on it. \"Billy!

Heh, like you have anywhere to go.\" He says innocently as starts folding.  Letting out a smaller, much quieter burp, causing him to lick his lips lightly, savoring the taste of his delicious pancake breakfast. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nIf he only knew, your journey had just begun! Throughout the day your body is churned about, broken down and digested, your bones being the only part of you left to tell apart from the soupy mixture now snaking its way though the young wolfs bowels. Your friends intestines suck out any nutrients your small body has to offer along the trip. By the time you come to a stop its almost dark out, and Billy is just finishing up with his chores. Letting out a slight bit of gas as he bends down to pick up the last of clothing littering the floor of his bedroom. Feeling a growing pressure in his rear. Pausing for a moment as he remembers his human friend who he left trapped in his rump hours earlier.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Keane, I almost forgot you were in there! I'm all done with my chores so I can let you out now. I really gotta poop anyway.\" He says, giving an immature chuckle at the last part as he heads out of his bedroom and into the nearby bathroom.  Still ignorant of your fate, Billy continues to speak to you, while he unbuttons his pants. \"Sorry I had to leave you in there all day, but I had to get those chores done or mom woulda been really mad!\" He drops his pants to his ankles before kicking them off to the side. Repeating the process with his underwear, exposing his slightly rounded, furred rump in the process. \"Thanks for staying still for me. heh\" He adds as he sits down on the toilet, shifting slightly to get comfortable. He lets out another fart as he start to pee into the water below him, his anus puckering as it gets ready to send you back out into the world.  The wolf looks down to his member just as his stream of urine comes to a stop. Clenching a bit as an idea starts to form in his mind. Taking his penis into his hand he says...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm all done with my chores so I can let you out now. I really gotta poop anyway.\" He says, giving an immature chuckle at the last part as he heads out of his bedroom and into the nearby bathroom.

The wolf looks down to his member just as his stream of urine comes to a stop. Clenching a bit as an idea starts to form in his mind. Taking his penis into his hand he says...<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can still have some fun after all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured he had been waiting all day to finish playing with you, and you had been in there so long already, what more could a few more minutes do? Deciding to hold his turd, and you (still not know they are one and the same at this point) in while he plays with himself. Billy quickly starts to massage his member into an erect state. Leaning back as he strokes. Trying his best to keep clenched as to not let anything slip out.  After a few moments the young wolf is stroking his cock rapidly, the memory of you rubbing against him in his underwear helping to fuel his approaching orgasm. With the mounting pressure knocking his back door, it doesn't long before the canines panting breaths become shorter and more rapid. He lets out a whimpered moan. He can't hold it anymore. Just as his cock begins to shoot its first spurt of cum Billy unclenches. Sending the first of several logs of wolf crap containing your remains into the bowl with a splash, coiling slightly, before breaking off. As the young wolf above, sits catching his breath, his slowly softening cock still clenched in his spunk covered hand as he basks in the afterglow of the best orgasm he'd ever experienced, still quite new to masturbation at his age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he'd caught his breath, he casually reached over to the toilet paper and whipped his hand off before dropping it into the bowl and standing up to give the toilet an inspection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane? Are you in there?\" He asked curiously, not seeing anything but a coiled log of brown wolf shit and some toilet paper in the bowl. \"Maybe his still  in my butt...\" he added as he sat back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes on the toilet Billy gives his rear a good wiping and gives the toilet another look, only finding a few more, smaller turds in addition to the first. He continues to peer into the bowl hopefully for a few seconds before noticing a tiny bone embedded in the side of one of the small logs, and another, and...is that a skull? \"But...but I didn't have any humans at the picnic\" He thinks to himself, confused at what he was seeing. Come to think of it, he hadn't had any humans in a few days. \"But how could there be...Keane?!\"   He yelped in surprise as it dawned on him. Those turds were his friend! Well, what was left of him. He didn't exactly know how, but he had digested his little human friend. \"Keane, I'm so sorry! I just wanted to play, I didn't know this would happen! I didn't mean to hurt you, but you said you wanted to help\" Billy stayed knelt in front of the toilet for a few seconds thinking about everything that had happen. \"If it makes you feel any better, you felt really really good...\" he adds, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Billy? Who are you talking to?\"  Billy's father asked through the door, causing his son to jump slightly in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh, no one Dad! Just talking to myself!\" Replied as he started to put his pants and underwear back on hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well hurry up in there, other people have to go to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem Dad\" Billy finished buttoning his pants and leaned over the toilet, looking over Keane one last look before flushing. Giving his crap a hesitant wave as he watched them swirl around the bowl before disappearing from sight. \"Uh...bye Keane\" he adds as the now empty toilet starts to refill with water. The canine gives his hands a quick wash, feeling kind of odd for waving goodbye to his shit before he exits the bathroom, his father entering it almost as quickly as he left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pew, Billy! I'd know THAT smell anywhere, hitting the humans again, eh kiddo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly couldn't help but chuckle at his fathers comment. Sharing his immature sense of humor \"Yeah, kinda...\" He replied, his father giving him a similar smirk to when Billy had belched at the table earlier before closing the bathroom door. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young wolf felt kind of guilty about what had happened to Keane, but he did say he wanted to help, and he did...sort off. Besides, humans were a dime a dozen. He really did want a pet one though...Billy sat on his bed, his arms folded. \"I wonder if... <b>Momm</b>!\" he called out, jumping from his bed and rushing down stares to his homes living room, where is mother was reading. \"Mom, mom mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* What is it Billy?\" she asks, slightly annoyed as she closes her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, can I get a pet human?\" he asks, giving his best puppy dog eyes \"Pleaseeee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you finish your chores?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, everything's done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know its a big responsibility to have a pet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know mom, I can handle I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll consider it. How about this, we'll see when your report card comes in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, thank you!\" Billy shouts excitedly, running back up to his room to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few months later, Billy's report card comes in and his mother takes him to the pet store to find a new human pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look back at Billy\u2019s large, furry face, so innocent in his dreams; at least as innocent as a giant wolf can look. You decide that you have no way of knowing how long Billy will sleep, so do decide to find something to do to pass the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully walk to the edge of the bed. It\u2019s a long drop; too far for you to jump. Fortunately, part of one of Billy\u2019s sheets is hanging to the ground, and you carefully climb down. Once on the floor, you notice that the carpet is quite springy, and fun to stand on. You gently bounce from foot to foot a few times, and look around. The door is closed; so you will have to explore this room. Most of Billy\u2019s toys are picked up, and the floor is relatively clean. You look behind you, and notice that there are some things to explore under Billy\u2019s bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back there, and examine what you find. It looks much the same as a normal pile of toys, except of course for the size. As you wonder around, you hear a loud squeak right above you. You hear a loud yawn, and the sound of someone getting up. You run toward the outside room, and see two large feet slam into the ground in front of you. You run toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Billy, I\u2019m down here!\u201d you shout. Billy starts to walk away, and as you reach the end of the bed, you see Billy, groggy from waking up, absent- mindedly rub his chest as though he was trying to remember something. Billy opens the door and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is great...\u201d you mutter to yourself. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just wait here for him...\u201d Suddenly, you hear someone approaching.</span></div></div>",

You make your descent down the wet oozing tube and the esophagus rubs you in such a way that you would find this arousing (albeit terrifying). Outside, Billy is enjoying this immensely, as you make a visible bulge gliding down his gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovered in spit you see the sphincter open and close in front of you, gushing out stale stomach air as it does. It opens, and you squeeze through without much difficulty. With a sick *squelch*, you *plop*SPLOOSH* into the stomach acids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying there, your life flashes before your eyes as the stomach gurgle around you, and you realize that there are certainly worse ways of dying, but you'd rather not die at all. The acid begins to have an effect on your skin, as you slowly burn away into the acid, still wriggling a bit. Looking around you, you see skeletons and lumps of all varieties, most of them were alive bfore this point, all with different stories to tell... if they weren't  getting their mouths and neck burned from the inside out. The veins and other organs are actually quite visible from your POV, and they pump and puss as they go about their jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, yes, struggle all you want, all your doing is making this better for me!\"Billy says quietly to himself, or at least quietly to him, but to you it's a thundering boom vibrating the churning stomach walls. The acid doesn't hurt anymore, likely because of your nerves having been rendered numb seconds ago,and all fades to black slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, that was wonderful! You were quite delicious Keane, thank you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly lies back on the the grass, releasing a pent up *UUUUURRRRRRAOOORRP* and the remaining air is blown out of Billy. He pats his stomach as it digests its workload, turning its contents into a disgusting bubbling goo, to have the nutrients sucked out of later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paste (and you) travel down the stomach exit, and down the tube, which leads down to the small intestine, and the small intestine sucks and absorbs your nutrients, th deeper you go, the browner, and more solid you get. That's right, your going down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Billy feels far less full, and with small effort, lets slip a tiny *poot*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pew, guess your ready to come out, huh Keane?\" he says, grabbing his nose. He gets up and trods over to the bathroom and pulls down his pajama bottoms, and sits down on the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUUURGH,un, I guess I should get more fiber in my diet, UUURGH. *PPPFFRRT**SPloosh*\" Whew!I guess I was right when I said you stink! Uh-oh...*gurglerumble* *PLLLOOOOIIRRTTTTT* *Splash*PLooMPH*\"Urg, man you sure went in easy, but MAN did you come out hard!\" He reaches for the toilet paper and wipes his bottom, and gets up. Peering into the bowl, he sees his immense turds, and spots your tiny skeleton in one of them. \"I guess this is goodbye Keane.\" With that he flushes, and washes his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all yours, sis.\" he proudly states, exiting the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Billy, it's about ti- WHOAH,geez!\" Sh walks in and is immediately greeted with the horrible stench. She sprays the bathroom with air freshener. \"Billy, what did you have for the picnic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles, \"Sorry sis, must've been the potato salad.\"</span></div></div>",

You hide your knife, knowing that you couldn't do anything to these wolves, since you've dropped your explosives (Anyway, how could Keane get explosives to school? Please, read the story more carefully before adding new chapters. Thanks - Author of this chapter) when Molly grabbed you.

And he seems to know wolfish, though he said something about egnilsh or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird. We'll see his memories quickly.\" Memories? How is that possible? \"Put him here.\" She points out to a space close to some kind of door. \"You want to wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think we'll wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit there please.\" Then the \"secretary\" (you are not sure who is she) presses some button and calls. \"We've got some unknown.\" It's all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors in front opens and you see a doctor, accompanied by two soldier-like men. You know why. The doctor comes to you and speak in a similar dialect that Molly tried at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, don't understand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two soldiers starts aiming at you, so you impulsively lift your hands up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You talk wolfish? It's forbidden for most humans.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not from here. See my memories and you'll know.\" You think that asking soldiers for putting their weapons down will be too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist. Follow me.\" He turns around and walk back trough the door, you after him, and the soldiers after you. You see some futuristic-looking chair. It's probably that memories-reader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit here.\" You do as he says. He ties you to the chair and puts something on your head. You can't see anything, and after a while you fall asleep. Then you start a journey trough your memories, seeing the same things as doctor. It ends on your memory of getting here. You're back into consciousness, and feel doctor untying you, then he takes that \"helmet\" out of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, we're done here. You can go back to waiting room.\" You wonder why they don't say now who you are. \"You're really a special case. We didn't think that there are some other humans out there, but now you came. Though i don't know any way of sending you back.\" He ends that with a warm smile. You try to smile too, but you can't get off a feeling, that you will be soon dead in \"some\" wolf, and you think that even know which one. You go through the door, to see Molly's family talking with secretary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... done anything before. But this... incident with your neck?

You drop to your knees, because you can't believe in what you just heard. She actually really saved your life. And now when you think you could kill someone that nice, you are starting to feel really bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you leave us alone, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Please, come here with me, we'll do some formalities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait until Molly's family and secretary go to another room. You just listen, because you can't find strength to lift your head up. When you are sure you're alone expect Molly, you call:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Why?\" It's all you manage to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you are a bad person. Officer told me you haven't done anything serious before, this was your first time. And i feel like it was mostly our, especially mine fault.\" You hear that she is close to you, but... She thinks that it was their fault? You manage to look at her, just to see her... worried? That is really confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your fault?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't believe me, do you? You came from some other world, it was the first time you saw someone like us. No doubt you were scared. We could be more gentle to you. You were just defending yourself. Will you forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it goes again. Will she never stop confusing you? Why she wants YOU to forgive HER?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.... But... Err...\" You almost can't talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something happened?\" She looks really worried as she leans closer to you. She probably didn't understand you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no.\" You reassure her hastily. \"It's just... I don't know why you want me to forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, you're probably still a little scared of me.\" That's true. \"I don't doubt that, It's not your world. I'm sorry for nearly eating you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to relax a little. She won't do anything serious to you, at least if you won't offend her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm worthy of something like this.\" You bow your head down again. \"I've tried to kill you first, It was just your way of defending yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but you've stopped yourself alone. If not my mother, i would eat you. Please, forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to be sorry for that. You've done a lot for me by considering me as a person. That saved my life.\" You see her expression, you think you need to say something. \"If you really want to know, i forgave you, when you accepted my apologies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat really made her happy. You find yourself being \"hugged\" right under her breasts, which is embarrassing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, umm...\" She pulled you away from her breasts, which you were somehow pleasant of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's Keane. Could you put me down, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I forgot myself. Here you are.\" She puts you gently on where you were standing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for everything.\" You just stare at each other, when you turn around and start going to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where do you think you're going, Keane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err... To see the doctor? So I will wait here for, I don't know, until someone pick me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you will come with us.\" She looks really sad, but you think this is too much of kindness you are worthy of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but i think you are too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.\" She interrupted you. She sounds very pleading. You struggle under her look, but decide to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, if you really want that.\" After that you find yourself being cuddled again into her t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, forgot myself again. Anyway, i haven't introduced myself. Molly Sixclaw. Call me Molly.\" She is really happy that you agreed to stay with her. You remember how her mother told something about no \"person\" living with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Molly. After all you've saved my life. I just fell bad for trying to kill someone so nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. You haven't killed me, so let's just forget about it, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are happy of that. \"All right. Thanks for everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Keane. By the way.\" She silences her voice. But why? \"I see you like them.\" She have some weird grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" You've got no clue what she is talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My breasts, you silly.\" Now you get really embarrassed and \"red\". She just laughs at that, making you even more embarrassed. \"Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\" You fell a little angry at her, but it passes quickly. She is too nice (and big) to be angry at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just winks at you. You feel like you will have some occasions to play with her (or maybe her play with you?). \"Anyway, we need to go finish some last formalities, then we will go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and Molly takes you to the rest of her family.</span></div></div>",

You could see that the sun is already hiding behind the horizon. That test must have took longer than you thought. It takes 15 minutes to get to Molly's house. When you walk out of car, still in Molly's paw but now in her right, you look at her house. For you it's enormous, like some skyscraper. For her it's normal sized house. You walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll show you the house later, I bet you're hungry. It was 6 hours after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"6 hours?! That's longer that I thought. So I was there for at least 4 hours? Don't tell me you were waiting for me for so long.\" You could feel the effects of going for so long without food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, others couldn't wait.

Molly left you (still stunned( on counter next to the fridge and opened it to look inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like cheese?\" She looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah\" It's all you can say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes out cheese and some bread. She makes sandwich for her and cuts some piece of cheese for you. You get to eat it without hesitation, you're really hungry. You finish before Molly and wait for her to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for waiting for me. I know you didn't need to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. But I think I'll show you home tomorrow, it's too late today. Where do you want to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there?\" You point to some cupboard close to the window. It looked like Molly wanted to object for a moment, but stopped herself. She moved you there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here, I'll prepare something.\" She goes somewhere, but is back in few minutes with something like match box filled with cotton. She put it next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight. Sleep well.\" And she leaves with a smile. You go and lay in your bed.</span></div></div>",

You can't stay here, you must get back to your world. you wait for half hour, just to be sure that everyone are asleep. Then you go out of your bed and use the curtain to get to the ground. Then you go to the front door, but when you are moving from kitchen to corridor... you see Molly. And she notices you. She comes to you and crouches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" You just look at side. You can't find courage to tell her truth. You stay like this for a minute, until Molly makes her move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I understand.\" And much to your surprise, she stands up and opens front door slightly, so you could just slip by. Then she walks past you to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn an impulse, you go to the door, but something stops you just before walking trough it. You still want to go, but one thing troubles you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was really crying. It wasn't joke or something like this. Even now, if you concentrated, you could hear her cries. But what's surprising in it? She tried... no, she was good for you. She trusted you, gave you home. And what you do in return? You are trying to escape. Only thing that Molly did wrong was her attempt to eat you... but now when you think of it, she probably just wanted to scare you. Maybe it was just coincidence, but she didn't eat any of those cooked humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou even didn't give her any real chance. But she already showed you that she cares for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed there, couldn't decide what to do. But finally you managed to make decision you were later proud of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and walked into the kitchen. Light was on and you could easily see Molly. Maybe you couldn't see her face, because it was hidden under her paws, but it still wasn't pleasant view. You stopped next to the chair Molly was sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should close the door\" Maybe that wasn't your best idea. You scared her and she jumped, shaking the ground. She probably didn't fell it, but you weren't ready for it and you fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly crouched, still stunned. She wanted to grab you, but stopped herself few times, not knowing what to do. You think you must help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for?\" And you immediately find yourself being cuddled in her cheek fur. You spend half minute in this position, until Molly finally takes you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Her face isn't the sight you are pleasant to see. Her fur around eyes is wet, with some part under eyes. At least now she's smiling so it's not so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I calmed down and realized, that It's better to be your pet then die out there. And at least I need to give you chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? It was all just because you're thinking you are pet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you're wrong. You're not pet, you're a family member. Especially now, when you decided to trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all you trusted me first... but aren't your methods of getting to know humans a little weird if you want them to be family members instead of pets?\" She giggled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too long story for now.  Now it's really late and we should go sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one last question.\" She looked at you, waiting. \"You never wanted to eat me, am I right?\" Her smile was enough for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, but I'm sorry. Maybe I scared you too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. It's past already, and at least now I know you're not some <b>blood-thirsty</b> wolf.\" You both laughed at this.

You relax and thrust your trust knife back into its scabbard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" you say to yourself, wiping the sweat from your brow, \"too bad I'm too small for anyone to have seen that.\" You watch the wolves packing up for a few moments, glad that the man-eating behemoths are leaving. \"Then again, maybe it's a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not until the father is staring the car up in the distance, the mother is rolling up the picnic cloth, the daughter is holding the basket, and the son is holding a few containers reluctantly that you realize something. Maybe you didn't want to think about it, but once the wolves turn their backs to you and head to their car the problem hits you like a sledge to the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! Wait!\" you scream in futility, \"Where the hell am I?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step and reach out in their direction when you catch yourself, realizing that it's a futile endeavor. Moments later, the sound of doors slamming shut reached your ears and the car rumbled away in the distance, hidden behind the forest of grass<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap. Well, this sucks,\" you tell yourself. It had just sunk in that you were in the middle of a grassy\u2014scratch that\u2014you are in a HUGE grassy field, the equivalent of the middle of nowhere at your size, without direction and probably a slim chance of survival, given the creatures lurking in the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting serious,\" you say to yourself, concerned. \"I'm gonna be screwed if I don't do something...or find something. ...find...someone.\" Your head instinctively swivels as if trying to discern one direction as better from the others. It was all just a wall of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should follow that road,\" you offered to yourself. There was the sound of a car, you figured that there would be a road of some kind. Going in the direction of the giant wolves you had just hoped to avoid seemed a little silly, but then again, there were the small...ugh, fried humans in the bowl, which lead you to believe that human civilization must have existed somewhere in this world. With any luck, you could run into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you push your way through denser sections of grass that lie ahead of you in the direction that the wolves left, impeding your progress. An hour passed and you feel as if you had barely taken a bite out of the distance; the flattened grass that had been under the picnic really slowed you down. You guess that you may have slogged through about a mile, which would be, what, to those wolves five feet? Ah, you didn't stop to ask them their height to make an accurate estimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now caught in some real thick sh--stuff. Tall stalks growing high overhead as the thinner blades create a dense carpet, or rather ticket. You try with some difficulty to stay above the growth by stepping on the blades as they bent, but they had too much tensility and at one point your foot fell through and you came crashing down, swearing out loud, and forcefully pushed your way through in your anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a small parting in the sea of green, you sat down, momentarily winded by the difficulty in progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man,\" your hand traced the handle of your knife, \"I wish you were a machete. Or a bottle of water.\" You added the last part after a thought, when you realized you were thirsty. You hoped that a river would lie in your path before you died of dehydration. \"...but then I have to watch out for monster-fish,\" you added vocally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cracked your knuckles and prepared to sludge through some more grass, when you heard a rustling in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh,\" you breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't tell if it was moving in your direction and it didn't sound too loud, but the again, you couldn't hear a bug moving through the grass when you were big; might as well assume! You drew your knife and held it at ready in the direction of the rustling. Minutes passed and the sound did not cease. It had move slightly to your left and a little louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nit started to make you nervous, especially when it stopped. Just stopped. Thirty seconds passed and all was still. You couldn't take it. It was making you paranoid and muttering under your breath wasn't helping. You had to scream:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out, Bugsy! I'll cut off all six of your legs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came--</span></div></div>",

In your concentration on the thing that was lying in wait somewhere in the foliage, you did not notice it until the noise was unmistakable. It was approaching very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it burst overhead, a blast of noise. A black shape roared overhead, sparing you no moment, but it was unmistakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found your agility and flew through the foliage ducking and weaving round the grass blades. The rotorcraft was banking right into your path and you found out why. You soon had clear sight of a dirt patch ahead of you and hovering above, stirring up dust, was a black helicopter. It slowly descended until it's skis gently touched down onto the soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could have jumped for joy, but then, right before you could celebrate your rescue, a shape burst out from the foliage and was making it's way to the chopper. It was a human! Suddenly the thought of one of those \"first come, first served\" routines popped into your head and you burst out into a run, not exactly on a trajectory to tackle the man dressed in brown, but the idea was what had you going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just then, the side door to the chopper slid open, and a man in armor was revealed and the first thing he did was raise <i>a rifle</i> and pointed it <i>right in your direction.</i> This was easy to tell since you weren't even close to getting between the man and the rifle's bullet path. Just before you could stop and raise your hands in fear, a muzzleflash from the rifle had you diving sideways just as hissing bullets passed overhead and ripped into the green behind you. A few of them a few feet shy of your body into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyes had closed in fear. The soldier had only let off a burst, but you were left shaken and it took a few moments to roll onto your stomach and look up to see that the man in a uniform had already climbed in through the wide open side door. Once he was in the chopper began to ascend. The man turned around and shocked you when he looked right at you, smiled, and gave a salute. The door slid shut and soon after. You picked yourself up and watched the chopper accelerate and disappear into the horizon of green grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach twisted into a knot. In a strange world of great proportions, chances of survival nigh-impossible, and the first human encounter you have they shoot at you then leave...<i>deliberately?!</i> You stood up, unable to speak for a while and just stared into space when the chopper was. This development hit you as hard as one of those bullets would have and was left bouncing around the inside of your skull, scrambling your brain. You did what was to be expected:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stupid little bitches!\" You whined, balling your fists as if ready to strike an imaginary person. \"What the\u2014? W-what the hell?! What about <i>me?!</i>\" It took a great deal of effort not to collapse onto you knees and scream 'no' at the top of your lungs. But eventually, after taking slow, deep breaths and counting backwards from ten\u2014about nine times\u2014you calmed down enough to stop raging and forget about the helicopter, it was no help anymore. It just left you outlook a little more bleak; the wolves were dangerous, and now, what should have been your salvation, was also danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, back to the road,\" you told yourself. You hung your head and heaved a sigh. You saw all the dirt your shirt and jacket had caught in your fall in the dirt. Finding your frustration again, you began to vigorously pat the dust out of your clothes. Just thinking about what happened was getting you steamed up all over again. Hell, you could <i>hear</i> the sound of that chopper leaving in your head. Yeah, and it was loud; you hoped that this wouldn't drive you crazy. The thought was just deafening and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...\" you mumbled to yourself, \"that's not a chopper.\" It really wasn't. This noise was not in your head, and it was not a helicopter. But it sure was loud, emanating a low rumbling noise. Your head swiveled all over the open sky, but there was not a thing to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly a shadow was cast across the ground. Looking up you realized that the source of the noise had sneaked up behind you over the grass canopy and was blocking out the sky. The ground began to quake and you could not keep you balance. You fell on your back just as you were forced to clamp your hands over your ears once the rumbling had reached unbearable levels. Now looking up, you could see that you were directly over an enormous engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise the car was making kept you stunned, but mercy had it that the engine was killed soon after the vehicle had stopped. A clicking of a door opening  sounded and you looked over to the what should have been the driver's side, and sure enough, two furry paws touched down on the ground. You followed them as move to the from of what was the car, with you yourself running up to see this stranger. It was a wolf alright, it would figure due to the size of the car. But, not only that, this wolf was dressed in black and blue; a uniform. It was a police officer. And he seemed to be concentrating on something... There was a voice so faint, coming from up above, that it was hard to hear unless you strained your ears. You could just barely make it out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...had 'em on here just a minute ago. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf made a movement and then said, \"WAHOOM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gesundheit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf sniffed, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just made out the little human, also dressed in a police uniform, standing on the wolf's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you make of this? All readings are now showing negative.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can smell exhaust fumes, other than those from our cruiser.\" The wolf replied to the human. \"They\u2019re faint, probably a kerosene fuel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre they flying jetcraft out here?\u201d The other laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but whatever they used there\u2019s no one here anymore,\" the wolf shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other laughed, \"Alright. Well, let's make a thorough sweep before we call it. Get the ground floor and use that nose of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it like white on rice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh-oh.

He then more or less shoved you towards an empty compartment, and lifted the lid, like that of a coffin. He the walked behind you, and took the cuffs off. \"Get in, and lay down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously gulp as you got in, and he closed the lid.

The sounds came across as just a muffled noise, but from what the human officer described, it should have sounded like several supersonic explosions, on the outside that is. Hard to believe since you could see the wolf's mouth moving and all, though the thick layer of plastic should have been an indication of the protection your body had from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs surprising as it seemed before, to see those in the containers falling asleep, you couldn't help but get tired from the muffled screams of the other detainees and the bumping of the car ride. The two officers must have had some rounds to fulfill after you were picked up because it took a while and you ended up\u2014well, maybe you were right, you couldn't get to sleep, but you did manage to space for a while. After all, your container's placement on the dash did allow a wonderful view of the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had finally arrived at the police station, the sky had become dark. A sudden jolt in movement had you sitting bolt upright, banging your forehead rather hard on the thick plastic as a result and eliciting an expletive from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise and shine,\" came a voice through the slots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! I'm up, I'm up!\" you groaned, rubbing your head. Looking out through the clear plastic, you could see that the wolf officer was carrying the plastic containment apparatus through a set of doors, no doubt the doors to the police station as the other side had many more wolves bustling about wooden desks and even more miniature humans scrambling about the desktops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Station,\" announced the human officer just outside your capsule. \"Unfortunately, we don't have time for the grand tour; maybe once <i>some</i> of you have been cleared. For now,\" he gestured downwards towards a system of steel compartments set on a table, \"you will be detained until you either become Registered or designated as a Snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened up your capsule. \"Come on, you first,\" the officer said kindly enough. Soon, he was helping you down through one of the doors built into each of the compartments on the apparatus. Dropping inside, the door closed slowly behind you, giving you the sight of the wolf and his human partner moving on to place the rest of the humans that they had gathered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around your cell, it was large enough to house one person with a cot set to the side to provide some comfort in those seeking rest. A set of iron bars was built into one of the four walls, though another steel barrier isolated you from the rest of the world. Four lights shining from all four top corners of the cell provided light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is it,\" you muttered to yourself, \"reduced to a holding pen in the station.\" You put your hands onto the bars of the cell, feeling very much like a felon accused of a crime he did not commit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to pass by very slowly after that. Perhaps the officers were concerning themselves with the more conspicuous individuals of the group that had been brought in. You, meanwhile, had been lying on the cot, trying to find a way to kill time. The human officer, whose name you did not know, strangely enough, had taken away your knife, so you couldn't play pinfinger or slit your wrists. If it was anything that was killing you, it was the anxiety. Out of the wilderness and into jail, now waiting for a background check, however the hell they would accomplish that. And under what kind of criteria? Would they interrogate you? Would they read you your rights at all? Did your Miranda rights even <i>exist</i> in this weird place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is\u2014\"</span></div></div>",

Of course, even the poorest of wolves owned a thousand humans who'd been designated as Snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pets? Snacks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that if you had a talent for making art, and I mean making something that took time and energy, like a painting, even a crude one, you'd likely end up as a Pet. If your only talent was causing trouble, you'd end up as a Snack, with no purpose other than to be eaten, especially during lean harvest times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, how were those classified as Pets treated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, better than pet mice I suppose, given the best of food that a family had, clothing on par to their Masters, and items to help them explore their creative thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rights of most humans are the same as the wolves; vote in government, right to run for office, right to an education, right to a good paying job, and so forth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the Miranda rights exist here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what those are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens if one gets arrested for a crime around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one's allowed the right of counsel, recommended to keep their mouth shut, as what they say could be used against them, unless counsel is around, and to be informed of what crime they allegedly did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's about the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, there's your memories; those can be used as evidence, both against you, and for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Memories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of the Registration, and Cloning, process; humans are injected with microscopic machines, and I mean microscopic on our level. These machines copy our memories, and store them in a file that's designated for that particular individual. Should you have an Unnatural Death, your clone will get all those memories, along with the ones you's made since, to about five seconds before your death, more or less depending on the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by 'five seconds before your death'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to remember getting your neck snapped when you're being prepared as part of a meal, or getting torn to pieces by a pack of hungry squirrels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. And know this, <i>when</i> you get cloned, not <i>if</i>, you're still going to be you, but your body will be a clean canvas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that any scars you've got will be gone, along with other such things. More importantly, you'll revert to your most physically fit age, between twenty and thirty years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it can be rough at times; watching members of your Host family grow old, and die, while you stay the same. Most tend to sign a DNC form after a century or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DNC?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do Not Clone. If they die afterwards, that's that. Buried in a matchbox in the garden with a daffodil bulb next to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why a daffodil bulb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flower grows every year, in remembrance of those buried there, even if the owner of the house fifty years down the line doesn't remember you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what about Snacks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mainly the worst of the Worst end up with that designation; murderers, rapists, homicidal and genocidal maniacs, and so forth. Of course, there are those who get designated as a Temporary Snack, but they'll get the full rights after serving their term, though it can take a while, and you have to behave during your term of being eaten over and over again, which can last up to a hundred years. But Eternal Snacks, like Adolph Hitler, Osama bin Laden, Ted Bundy, Timothy McVeigh, Pol Pot, and others like them, there's no chance of them getting their freedom, legally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I was shot at by some people that the cop said were Snacks. How'd they get free?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember how your mother always told you to eat what's on your plate, and to not play with your food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even more so with wolf kids and Snacks; more often than not, a Snack will escape because a kid forgot to eat them, and dropped them on the ground while picnicking. Normally their freedom doesn't last long; cops catch them, or they meet up with a hungry squirrel, and they get sent back to the Station, and end up with Additional Time on their sentence, unless they waited at the site, and didn't resist apprehension when a patrol came by. Then there are those who are clever; ambush human cops and park rangers, kill them, take their weapons, organize gangs, make vehicles, and generally terrorize human picnickers, and possibly worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A group tried to invade my home once; they wanted to kidnap the women and children to increase their numbers. Slight problem; there's nothing more dangerous than a man protecting his home, even more so when he has a lot of neighbors, some of which are armed with laser rifles instead of just M16 knockoffs. Of course, twenty intruders against a thousand men and women who know every square inch of the Human Quarters within a Home tend to be at a severe disadvantage. The Host Family really enjoyed breakfast that morning; we served them up rotisserie-styled. The police were just as happy to have them back in custody when their clones showed up at the station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's with the wolves eating humans, and the cloning thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that humans were easy for wolves to catch in the Old Days; still are actually. As for the Cloning, that's been around for ten thousand years, though the device to save memory came along about three thousand years ago, especially after humans who created art began to show up. As for whole process, they'd take a drop of the human's blood, or another form of DNA, and make a series of Blanks, whom they'd eat; even then they valued humans, especially good tasting ones, and wouldn't just eat them. As for the humans, they lived together, within the Masters' home, in what was essentially a pen. Now, they were taken care of; food and water, and social company, as well as a choice of mates, but it wasn't like they were free, even those who were Pets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how'd that all change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that there was a really bad drought about a thousand years ago, and food for wolves was coming hard to find. Don't ask me why, but some of these Pets asked their owner if they could be the Meal, and not just the Side, like they normally were. Turns out that Owner was related to the then-Leader of the time, and they suggested that to him. I'm not going to bore you with the rest of the details, but basically, those who willingly offered themselves up as food were granted the same rights as the wolves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still, wouldn't the cloning process take up a lot of electricity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The amount of energy it takes to clone a human, or a similar sized animal, is the same as if you'd turn a light on at your home, and I mean one on a human scale. Cloning a wolf sized animal though, that's a great deal more energy, enough to power a city block for a week, and I mean one for wolves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make sense,\" you said. \"Shouldn't it be like turning on their own lightbulbs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something about the fur; disrupts the system, or something,\" said Richard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, back to the memories thing; how do the police use them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like watching a movie; they'll use a special screen to watch the Key Moments of you life, though they will look for criminal activity. Your safest bet is to be honest, let them know if you remember something or not, or what you do remember of it. Of course, I doubt you'd be in too much trouble, doubt you've done much more than just steal candy or pull on some girl's hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you began to hear heavy footsteps coming in your direction. You look and see that it was...</span></div></div>",

She got out a clipboard, and walked up to you. \"Detainee 236805, please state your name for the Record.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you talking to me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you. \"My partner and I have been assigned to be your counsel, so yes, I am talking to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keane, Keane ________.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then asked you how you spelled your name, and you told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she said. \"You'll address me as Mrs. Torrance, and my partner as Mr. Halftail.\" She then turned to the cell officer. \"Open his door, and bring him a headset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute, you were on Mr. Halftail's palm, and Mrs. Torrance was by your side, asking you questions, and writing the the answers down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the best of your knowledge, have you been convicted of a crime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I've been in School Detention before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled. \"Who hasn't? When you were apprehended, was anything taken from you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wallet and pocketknife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Describe them please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wallet was brown, had my school ID, and a $10 bill, a $5 bill, and five $1 bills. The knife's handle was red, and had a white cross on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swiss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then asked you some more information, a little bit about your family, how you were in school, and other such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, did officer William ask you anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you talking about the guy who arrested me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically, they didn't arrest you, more like detained you. Your freedom might have been taken away, but you weren't charged with a crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Well, he did ask me if I'd met up with anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people the officer said were Snacks; they shot at me when I tried to go for their helicopter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avoid them like you'd avoid a spot that had a bad tooth; they'd rob and murder you, if not worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda got the message from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to know.\" She looked over the information. \"Well, from what I can tell, you'll be allowed to leave within a day or so, with a Host Family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you sighed. \"By the way, the guy who was next to me said that people were allowed to have firearms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Torrance chuckled. \"Can't kill mice with a knife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mice, rats, squirrels; you don't want a colony of rodents nearby, especially if you plan on having children; the DNA of an unborn baby isn't exactly on file you know. Also, you <i>don't</i> want to get eaten by them; sooner get impaled on a child's tooth than get torn to pieces, at least your death would be quicker from the tooth going through an artery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, have you been eaten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Torrance smiled. \"Of course; being a Willing Meal is how I paid for collage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how does that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on what you're to be part of, and the preparation; if the method of cooking isn't going to kill you, the assistants give you an injection, one that keeps you from feeling pain, as well as from moving your limbs- the client is expected to use chopsticks, or the tips of their claws, you pick you up, place you in their mouth, and swallow- death tends to come from drowning in the stomach acids. If the method of cooking, or preparation, is going to kill you anyways, the assistants twist your head, fracturing the vertebrae, making the death quick and painless. In either case, you're given a very good massage before they inject you, or twist your neck. Snacks don't get either of those though; they feel every bit of pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From being dropped into boiling water, to being dissolved in stomach acid; they also remember their deaths, up to the last moment. Tends to break them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised that a lawyer would condone such practices. I mean, they are human beings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked away. \"Some don't deserve to be called human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalftail placed a finger next to her face, and she grabbed a hold. \"Focus on the here and now, Kate. You need to be strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Patrick. It's just, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think that you can keep it together for our client's sake, or do you want me to speak on his behalf myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Torrance said....</span></div></div>",

Of course, I got a snack here to satisfy any immediate hunger pains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as he stuck his free hand into a pocket, and pull out one of those pill container things, only this one didn't have a mattress in each section. Each of the individuals were shouting things out, vulgar things, and all of them were naked. Then, he opened the lid on one of the compartments, and the man inside tried to get out, but Halftail would carefully tip the container one way, and the other, keeping the man in it, as he raised the container to his mouth. With a quick flick, he caused the man to tumble into his mouth. He then tilted his mouth from side to side a few times. Then-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, after you realized that he wasn't just going to swallow the man, you decided that it was best to look forward, and not watch blood drip down your lawyer's lips.

They don't like it when someone hurts a friend of theirs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got that impression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, you were in a room, and set on a table. There was one of those restraining-type chairs, as well as a doctor-like person, and a couple of officers. You look at Mrs. Torrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in the chair,\" she said. \"The doctor's just going to take your blood, and inject the nanobots into your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that this will be safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Now, get into the chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go and sit in the chair. The officers fasten the restraints, and the doctor puts a couple of needles into you.

She had dark fur and bright yellow eyes looking through a pair of glasses onto a clipboard held in her hands. She looked up and asked, \"Is number 236805 present?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here,\" you replied, waving your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, \"Your presence is requested in the testing labs.\" She turned to Mr. Halftail and Mrs. Torrence, \"I'm afraid he will not be leaving today, counsel, if his stay has already been arranged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, actually, we were just getting to that.\" Mrs. Torrence then looked at you with a puzzled expression. \"What is this additional testing for? If I may ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Head of the Cloning Department has discovered an unusual mutation in the subject and wishes to further examine them.\" The wolf turned the clipboard around and tilted it so that Mrs. Torrance could see. \"As you can see, he was <i>very</i> specific.\" The gesture must have been intended to discourage her from attempting to extricate you from any unnecessary  procedure. In fact, you admired how she was trying to make things easy for a newcomer like you to reenter a new society, even when she breathed a sigh of defeat as she read over what was written on that paper. You couldn't read the strange text, but Mrs. Torrance looked at you again, this time with an expression you could not place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had you scratching your head nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled, \"Oh, I'm sure it's nothing. After all, the scientists are trying to make all sorts of advances in cloning technology and every bit of information on human genetics helps.\" She smiled reassuringly, \"I'm sure they'll be done with you within a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Halftail stood up and looked down at you and said, \"I'm sure we will meet again, tomorrow, when it's time to select your host family.\" And with that, your counsel said their goodbyes and left through the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf with the glasses lowered her paw down to the table and smiled at you. \"Well, hop on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you replied and stepped onto the giant digits and made you way for the big palm pad. Once there, the wolf lifted you gently up into the air and curled her clawed fingers up, forming a protective barrier should you have fallen, once she started moving. Passing through the halls, you got to see some of the police station. This was the first time you had been further than the lobby of one, but the spartan interior and dull colors would seem like the standard design. Occasionally, an officer wolf would pass by carrying one or more humans in their paws, all of them well-behaved unlike newcomers or snacks. Things were getting quiet; you figured it must have been close to midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you passed through a set of double doors. Inside was a small room with a large, sturdy table upon which was an assortment of human sized medical equipment, mostly gurneys with some sort of machine next to them and a few pieces of radiology equipment. Among them was a human male who looked to be in his late thirties, waiting patiently for your arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf lowered her paw to the table and you stepped off, but spared a moment to glance back at her. Oddly enough, she was looking back and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for escorting Number 236805 here, Ms. Shirana,\" the man spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf momentarily regarded the man with a look of disdain, but it was fleeting and she nodded respectfully before taking here leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name is Dr. Lazarski.\" The man proffered his hand, which you shook. He didn't even ask for your name as his eyes went to a clipboard he was holding. You told him your name, but he didn't even look up, and just hummed a confirmation. There wasn't even any preamble with him as he got right to the testing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will have you lay down on that right there.\" He pointed to a sort of gurney constructed out of a frame with fabric stretched across it with a hole cut out for a persons head and many restraining straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said approaching the strange contraption. You could tell that you were supposed to lay face down in it even before Lazarski told you to do so, after you were told to remove your shirt. Once you were on it, the doctor began to pull straps across your back and securing them tightly. After a few moments of adjustments he asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you comfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprisingly--yes,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you move at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a few experimental tugs here and there. \"Not an inch,\" you confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say doc, what is this thing for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just to restrain restrain patients while we extract some tissue samples for study.\" You were kind of worried when you felt a pinch at your spine. \"Right now, we are doing bone marrow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Bone ma--AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more tests, you and Dr. Lazarski were heading back to your cell. The things he put you through left your body feeling exploited. Most of them were just scans and such, but you did not let go of that first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say that session went quite well, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a nasty, dirty trick!\" you complained indignantly. \"A sneaky, sneaky trick, and I hate you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful to see your energy return so quickly. Here we are,\" he said once you reached your cell. The doctor ushered you inside and the bars slid closed once more. Without a word, the doctor left. You certainly did not like the guy, but you realized just how fatigued you were as the sight of the cot in your cell became surprisingly welcoming. Falling face down into the mattress, you groaned loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be sometime before you finally managed to sleep, but the rest was wholesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil... </span></div></div>",

They were unnoticeable most of the time, but it was a different story when you wound up on your side during the night, they ended up pressing uncomfortably into the side of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that time you could not fall asleep again. However the spartan accommodations of the cell did not exactly accommodate early risers, such as yourself. You resolved to rest a bit on your cot, slipping into a pocket of your imagination to pass the time. In fact, this secluded cell that they put you in nearly had you forgetting that you were in a world that was several times your size, and you left your to mind wander in a state of half-dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you layed back, hands behind your head with your eyes closed, you thought of inconsequential things like music in cinematic sequences of your imagination, and eventually listening to the soothing sound of an ocean lapping against a sandy shore. It was so subtle that it took you a while to notice that the sounds were played through your headphones. It must have been something to put newcomers at ease, and honestly, it worked as you found yourself enjoying the nostalgia of. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome kind of \"Klip-klapping\" sound invading the privacy of your--'what the hell?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyelids fluttered open for just a moment to see the figures of half a dozen men in uniforms of black and grey standing around your cot. No doubt these guys had marched in while your earphones only picked up ocean noises, in fact they were barely audible. Someone must have tampered with your 'phones. Your expression must have been one of incomprehension, but no one cared to elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them looked at you and then made a gesture of his fist hitting the palm of his other hand. Your mind was a few milliseconds too slow to register the fist of the other soldier that wound up to strike at your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>POW!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel weightless for a moment, but then your body begins to pick up speed, your stomach lurching at the acceleration, and through the haze you the the ground fast approaching. You don't shield yourself and just let your body slam into the ground and you find it somewhat comfortable. It was solid at first, but the dirt started to suck you in, squeezing just right around your body and feeling cool against your skin. It felt nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese things don't last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started as a buzzing in your ears. It grew louder and louder until it caused pain. You tried to move, but your body just wouldn't respond like you wanted it to, so you just sucked in a breath between your teeth in pain. What you got wasn't air. A foul liquid sprayed into your lungs and made you hack and choke. You struggled to get up, but found your body in pain and unwilling. Your eardrums were on fire and your head hurt like hell, and the ground held you under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt something grab the scruff of your shirt, hauling you to your knees. You spat out the mud that had gotten in your mouth and breathed in air, but it was still all over your face and when you tried to open your eyes it dribbled, painfully, into them. Whoever had pulled you up now roughly wiped a hand against your face, getting some of the mud off, though irritating your eyes. They burned, but you blinked, which hurt, but the tears washed away the filth and a blurry image of a man yelling at you registered in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat buzzing noise. You could see his mouth move, but it was hard to hear. You must have been deaf. The sound that came through was loud and urgent, though that could have been discerned from his frantic expression. You weren't feeling too good right now; to hell with what he wants. Your head was throbbing. You ran your hand across your skull, but something seemed to be missing. You pulled your hand away and the part that passed over your ear had a little red on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what it was you were missing your helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had to be somewhere. You turned around, and there it was, lying a few feet away in the mud. Unable to manage getting up yet, you crawled over to it, ignoring the pain in your back. Once it was within reach, you reached out for it, but your hand looked different this time. It looked stronger, more mature, and it wore a green sleeve. But this was your helmet, you were sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to place it on your head head, but lost balance and fell back down. You lifted your chin to keep your head above the muck, and with your headache clearing you got a good look at what was happening. You were surrounded by jungle, the dense foliage that surrounded you from all sides was cleared only by the expanse of dark mud. But the mud was also stained by something darker. A few feet from where you laid was a mass of red, twitching and leaking blood into the water that crept slowly outwards. A crater was directly beside what used to be that body, and just a bit more behind that was half of one, legs practically gone, stomach shredded open and intestines spilled into the muck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hands of the other man, a soldier, hauled you back up, this time to your feet. His mouth was right next to your right ear as you could barely make out:<br>\r\n\"You've got shrapnel in your back, but we've gotta get moving!\" He shoved something into you hands. He faced you, the man dressed in green, it was hard to hear again, but his lips said \"We'll come back for them...need to find the team...\" something like that. He was running now, waving his arm at you to follow him. You looked down and see that he had given you your rifle back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright then, no time to argue. You could hear the distant chatter of gunfire now. It was getting more distant...and more...your vision became unfocused. You were dazed and confused from the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind finally snapped back to reality and the images became fuzzy like a dream. You felt a hard surface below you and realized that you must've been dreaming, though your head did feel like a jackhammer had done a number on it and your nose felt a little numb too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. What a horrible nightmare...\", you groaned. You started to stretch your limbs when you realized something:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute... Oh God!...\"</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s how you knew that this was not your cell anymore, as if your throbbing headache and the numb feeling in your face was not indicative enough. You remembered something about getting punched in the face, but that was as far as your memories would assist you, growing murky between the events of some kind of armored guard in your view and your current position on the cold ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lying on your back with your arms drawn tightly behind you. Moving any of your limbs gave you the indication that several straps restrained your arms and legs as they pressed harder into your skin. They were uncomfortable in that position and felt numb and asleep, but you couldn\u2019t pull them out from under your back and neither could you pull your legs apart and only caused the individual strips of binding to press uncomfortably into your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to distinguish anything from the dark\u2014a wall, a desk, the corner of the room, anything which could help orient yourself. But minutes passed and your eyes could not adjust to the dark, there just wasn\u2019t any light. Wriggling around frantically, you tried to find a weakness in you bindings, but they held fast and all you managed was rolling onto your stomach. In doing so, your nose bumped into the ground, something which was surprisingly painful. Pain exploded in your face and elicited a whimper followed by some loud profanity. Your nose was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo soon did a light illuminate the room, for your eyes complained immensely at the photon intrusion, squinting before the bright rectangle that illuminated the room from one of the walls. It was a door. The silhouettes of people mercifully dampened the effects of the light, but it was not within their interests to make you comfortable. Two people moved in, and though your position on the floor and the look on your face must have been one of the most pathetic imaginable, they roughly hauled you to your feet and held you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Wassit!\" you complained, unable to speak clearly due to clogged nasal passages. You looked from one guard to the other, noting the grey armor and the masked faces and the creepy polarized eye lenses. One of them raised a handgun to your cheek, effectively shutting you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit him down,\u201d commanded a voice, a low and distorted one, though you thought it had a feminine quality to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came from within the room via speakers, as it came from all around in a hollow, distorted tone. You were in no position to argue as the two men who had you by the arms forcefully pushed you into a chair you had not seen in the dark. Once you were seated, the door closed and it was dark again, but only for a moment, for shortly after another light, thin and rectangular, outlined a reflective surface. It was like a mirror, but you realized that it must\u2019ve been one-way glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNumber 236805,\u201d the voice stated, \u201cFor any further designation of yourself, your are to be referred to and refer to yourself as Number one-sixty-two from now on, is that understood, subject 162?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than argue with the disembodied voice, or fear of bringing about the wrath of the two guards beside you, you lowered your head in defeat and answered, \u201cYeth...Ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d the voice said; at least your assumption was right. \u201cWhy do you think you are here, Number one-sixty-two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just entered this strange new world with the sheer amount of change throwing your brain for loops so sharp that the Blue Angels couldn't handle them, yet this question really blindsided you. Why did you think you were here in the current company? How were you supposed to know?  Before you answered, you took a second to hock out a big, fat, dark-red blood clot, making it easier to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I think I\u2019m here? I think I\u2019m here because I\u2019m a human the size of a freaking mouse on a planet with giant wolves!\u201d Just answering that question made you feel stupid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, that is incorrect,\u201d the voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are here because we believe that your genetic structure is anomalous,\u201d the electronic voice said. \u201cNormally, we wouldn\u2019t collect you until evidence of your anomalous existence was incontrovertible, however, with you it is a little different.\u201d After a pause, the voice continued, \u201cYour anonymity to our detection systems and body composition tests seems to be part of your anomalous nature.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the hell are you talking about?\u201d This voice was making you feel like you did something wrong, but you knew you were the victim here. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d the voice interrupted, \u201clet me assure you that it is within your best interests to come forward with any knowledge you may have about your abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen\u008d\u2014!\u201d you nearly jumped up, but backpedaled when the cool steel of a muzzle pressed into your back threateningly. \u201cUh, you\u2019ve got to have the wrong guy!\u201d you said shakily. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about any abilities!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, the time for you to confess any knowledge of your existence will come later; Mr. Lazarski requested that we restrict any investigations into your\u2014\u201d You were sure the right side of your face twitched at the mention of that name.

The guards hauled you back to your feet, and still holding your arms they untied your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Site 17,\" were the voice's parting words as the guards then led you out the door. You moved into a dimly lit hall with concrete walls and metal floors. You moved a bit drunkenly with your dizzy head and recently bound legs, but your guards were there to keep you balanced, though you did not want to look back, sure that their weapons were still at the ready. They led you briskly. . .</span></div></div>",

The sight of her dark maw was enough to make you scream your lungs out as she dropped you onto her tongue. You tried to move, and attempt to escape as her jaws closed, but were unable to do so.

Let's just say that, after I was rescued, I had to leave my bedroom door open partway, with a nightlight on, and I was twelve at the time, a little old for such things, but that's how badly affected I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's why your screams were of a higher pitch than those of most I eat,\" said Molly. \"However, I can promise you that I'll help you through it, both with getting used to being eaten, and with the fear of dark confined spaces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly nodded. \"I give you my word, even if I have to do all of the work myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked towards the one wolf. \"What's he doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Officer Samual,\" Molly said. \"He and his human partner, William, are conducting the investigation, trying to find Hitler, and sort out the punishment we'll have to take for letting him go free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's the punishment?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Billy owes you roughly a hundred times your weight in gold each month you live with us,\" Molly said. \"We're also responsible for helping to pay for any medical bills, cloning bills, education, and so on. It's next to nothing for us, but you'll be set for quite a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" you said.</span></div></div>",

It was a ham and cheese sandwich- it seems that your one earlier observation was correct, there were indeed animals on your scale, and these animals were also cloneable. There was also animals on the Wolves' scale, but these, and the Wolves themselves were not cloneable- from what Molly had told you, the energy required to clone you had been the same for her to turn on a light, barely noticeable, but to clone something that was the size of a wolf required a whole lot more, easily the same amount that a whole block used in a week, if not more. Essentially, the meat that the wolves ate came from human-scaled animals, including humans themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were done eating, Molly placed something that looked like a human-sized matchbox next to you. \"When you're done, you might want to get inside,\" she said. \"This way you'll be more comfortable than you would if we used a Snack Container to take you home.\" She then opened it and you took a look. It was basically what it looked like- only it was padded on the interior, without any matches, or a striking surface. It also had a clean smell, a little <i>too</i> clean. It seemed more like a coffin than a way to transport people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you normally use to transport humans?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly gave a nervous smile. \"Not normally,\" she said. \"Normally you'd be transported in a special carrying case, but we didn't think that we'd encounter a new human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you normally use these for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To bury your kind in, should you have an Unnatural Death,\" she said. \"Your bodies produce good nutrients for the plants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that this will be safe?\" you ask. \"You know that I'm afraid of dark and confined spaces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep it open part way,\" Molly said with a more natural smile. \"That way you can see what's around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, you were in the matchbox. Strangely enough, it was comfortable, more comfortable than your previous transportation container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do we have to Foster him ourselves?\" Billy asked. \"I'm not in the mood for buying him clothes and food all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be what you'd deserve,\" said Mr. Sixclaw. \"Just be glad he ought to be satisfied with room and board, in addition to a hundred times his weight in gold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, all from my allowance,\" Billy muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Billy, we've told you time and time again that you're supposed to eat Snacks, not play with them,\" said Mrs. Sixclaw-Whitetail. \"This time you'll have to face the piper, and pay for your actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly looked at you and growled. \"Perhaps I ought to eat him without knocking out his pain receptors, and tear him to pieces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder the Tenants prefer to live near my room instead of yours,\" Molly muttered. \"You'll never get the house if you only see them as Food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he always like this?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't all little brothers that way?\" Molly asked with a smile. \"He's just upset at being caught, and the fact that he'll have to take a flea bath tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flea bath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom had us take a check-up while we were waiting on you,\" Molly said with a grin. \"The one doctor found fleas on him, but none on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle at the thought. If these wolves were anything like your dogs, they might enjoy taking a bath, but add in the scent of that flea killing soap/shampoo, and they'd clear on out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that you've got Tenants,\" you said. \"Do you have others like me living with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we do,\" Molly said. \"Hard not to have any. They check on things, and help to keep small issues, like mold and leaks, from becoming bigger, and more expensive to fix. One of the couples we have should be able to care for you, at least for the next couple of years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how many do you have?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not many,\" Molly said. \"Just a few.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"We have four thousand, two hundred humans of Rent-Paying age,\" Molly said with a smile. \"Of course, we've got around ten thousand who live with us, most of which are under the age of eighteen, and therefor, don't have to pay Rent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just what is Rent?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five times their weight in gold per week, or be part of at least one meal each week,\" said Molly. \"You'd be surprised as to how many do both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, your kind needs us, and we need them,\" Molly said. \"Many wild animals see you as an easy meal, especially the park's squirrels. That Hitler clone has probably met up with some. Without our cloning devices, your kind wouldn't last long, even as a species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why does your kind need us?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In short, you're easy to clone compared to a creature near our size,\" Molly said. \"Your kind has been coming to our world for many millennium. Sometimes you saw us as Gods, sometimes as Demons, and more often than not, you were nothing more than a bite to eat for poorer wolves, or a pet to the wealthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, your kind would just eat us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like catch and breed you for food,\" Molly said. \"We thought nothing of it, you were extremely primitive then, nothing like art, or clothing to talk of, let alone anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been coming that long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but then several thousand years ago, we noticed a change in the new ones that came here,\" Molly said. \"They could create art, primitive, but it was art. Instead of just seeing you as food, the 'gifted' ones were bred as pets. Of course, we were way ahead of your kind on a technological level, in that we were using electricity to light our homes while you still lived in caves. Along the way, Cloning, and Flash Cloning were developed, but they didn't do much, other than the cloning of better tasting humans meant that one didn't have to rely on genetics too much any more, one one could clone the same human over and over. Still, we watched your kind develop. Eventually, some very gifted ones came here, ones that could write. Things began to change after that, slowly of course, but they happened, especially once we found a way to 'save' your memories, and transfer them to new bodies. That's sort of how you're alive, fresh new body, but with a lifetime of memories. Of course, talking to your kind was no good- trouble hearing on both ends. However, some did sign language, and we began to use that to communicate, in addition to writing. It wasn't until we began using sound transfer devices that someone stumbled on a way in which we could talk to each other effectively, and mic-and-ear sets developed as a result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you see us now?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We see the ones that behave themselves as People,\" Molly said with a smile. \"Those that don't, are Snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout thirty minutes later, the family arrived at the home. It was way bigger than any mall you'd been in, or had memories of at any rate. It's size made you look at Molly, and try to calculate her height. She had to be around three hundred feet tall, if not more. The house had to be a thousand feet tall at any rate. Small wonder her kind had thought of humans as food for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer family opened the door, and she walked in, with you still in your matchbox container. She then set you on a table, and let you out. She pointed towards something, a bunch of shelves, where you saw a whole crowd of people. \"Meet our newest Tenant, guys,\" she said.  The people waved at you, many with a smile on their faces, especially the females near your age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can get to know him later,\" said Mrs. Sixclaw. \"Who wants to pay Rent by being part of tonight's supper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hundred step forward, and begin to take their clothes off, along with the headsets, while Mrs. Sixclaw went to the cupboard. One of the things you saw her set on the counter made you shudder; it was a meat grinder.</span></div></div>",

At least, that's the way it is with Willing Meals, or some such thing. Snacks though, we don't bother killing them, or giving them painkillers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They still get cloned, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Molly said. \"In fact, they'll all be finished being cloned by the time supper is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you have to go to the hospital to pick them up?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"Most every home that has Tenants has their own Cloning Chamber,\" she said. \"Get you registered as residing here, and this will be your Default Cloning Location, or DCL. Of course, once you are registered for school, or a job, you'll be cloned at those places during school/work hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's good to hear,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only annoyance is that you might want a change of clothes,\" she said. \"Depending on the circumstances of your death. By the way, would you like to read something until they call us down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, inserted a few claws into a long crack on the desk, and lifted up a whole case of books, one that was six feet tall, and over a hundred feet long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lot of books,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over two thousand titles, not including translations in German, Russian, French, Spanish, and Wolven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wolven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its what we normally speak when humans aren't around,\" Molly said. \"It's a little difficult to put the various subtleties into human words, as there's the tone of our voice, and even the scent that we give off. It's like a bunch of growls, howls, yips, yaps, wolfs, and barks to you; even if you knew what each sound meant, you wouldn't get the whole message, unless you could read the scents we gave off, along with the meaning of the tone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, why write it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly chuckled. \"The written version was easier to translate than the spoken one for your kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, why did you speak English back in the car when I first woke up?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are of obvious European blood, and your ID thing was in English, so we spoke it, hoping that you'd be familiar enough with it to understand us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the Clerk at the Hospital?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the Primary Language there,\" said Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how many languages do you know?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can speak and write three others fluently, in addition to Wolven and English,\" she said. \"But I can understand another sixteen, both the written, and the spoken versions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you get the time to learn more than two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly chuckled. \"One listens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that you read my ID,\" you said. \"Do you have the rest of my stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly got out another matchbox, and carefully set it on the table. She opened it up. \"Would have buried you with them if you hadn't made it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"I still didn't make it. I mean, this body's nothing more than a copy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a finger under your chin. \"It still has your heart and soul,\" she said. \"Those in and of themselves are more important than your memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know this?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed at a landscape drawing of the house, one that seemed to be from a human's point of view, looking up at the eves. \"Let's just say that your Earth, is not the only Earth out there,\" she said. \"And let's also say that the Hitler who killed you, is not the only Adolf Hitler who resides here on this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Hitler who made that drawing never got involved in politics, or into the whole anti-Jew thing,\" Molly said. \"Wouldn't be too surprised if he takes it on himself to Foster you, and take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he do that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He feels bad for what his other counterparts did- imagine being an artist one moment, and finding out that one who shared your identity had murdered a million people the next. He even contemplated signing a Do Not Clone form and just taking his life. Grandpa talked him out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, how do you know about the soul being the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We made Blanks of them both, clones without memory, and woke them up in the same room, with nothing but a set of painting materials.

Those on your scale though were relatively unaffected, as even back in Antiquity, one of the important jobs was making sure that crops and animals your size were taken care of. Back then, your people were nothing more than snacks and pets, but while we did have the cloning technology, we tended to only eat those who caused trouble, on a regular bases anyways. Normally you were only eaten as a side dish, or a quick snack. Now, the daughter of the then Ruler had a good number of Pets, both Scapens and Gonans, and she knew how bad the drought was, and it had gotten to the point that even the wealthy were having trouble buying food. It's said that her Pets had written the suggestion that she could eat them, and many had volunteered to be her meals. Now, the memory technology had been invented, so it wasn't like they'd be reduced to Blanks, meaning that they'd come back intact, both body, mind, and soul. She he told her father, and he talked to the others on Counsel. This was soon passed, with a very significant alteration; the pets, and snacks who volunteered to be regular meals would be granted the same rights as Wolvens- including a say in government, along with other things. We were quite desperate then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised that humans didn't turn down the offer, and just let your kind starve to death,\" you said. \"Or your kind just resorting to just scooping us up and eating us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even then there were certain rules that kept us from just eating you, especially since you could create artwork, and improved upon it,\" Molly said. \"I mean, even five thousand years ago, you had people making statues out of stone, depicting people from their home world, carving engravings on large flat surfaces, and then some. As for just letting us wolves starve, when a mouse can see you as a meal, just how long do you think your species would last without protection from larger predators?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can see how that would be an effective argument for giving humans the right to vote,\" you said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly smiled. \"They had plenty to gain from it. Now, the system's not perfect; there's still those who see humans as nothing more than snacks or food, or even toys, but thankfully, they comprise a fairly small number.

The cushion was very comfortable, and you fell asleep almost immediately.</span></div></div>",

You rub your neck as you remember the feeling. You then looked in a mirror that was in the room, and noticed something; some old pox scars were gone. You looked at other places that scars had been; they were all gone. Your body was literally a clean one, free of the various flaws it had accumulated over your life; your previous life that is.

You and Lilly got into a box that reminded you of those movies of military transport aircraft, with the seats along the sides. There were others around your age, roughly a hundred of them; many of them looked at you, before they started chatting among themselves. It was about the usual things; what bands were in, which movies were good, and which ones sucked, as well as the counterarguments. Some of the musicians sounded familiar, like various raps stars, rock bands, metal ones, and a few country singers, as well various actors, like Dwayne Johnson, Sean Connery, Jackie Chan, Jet Le, and some more that sounded familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they talked about those you didn't know about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Schwisks are way better than the Horrwens,\" said one young man. \"Their clawings are much more in tune than the scratchings of those wannabe-Horrwens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call that garbage music!\" the person next to him practically screamed. \"The stuff that those Schwisks write are only good for flushing down the toilet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Croons are way better than either of them,\" said another. \"Their howls just make you want to cry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that's how terrible they are,\" said the first person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They put <i>me</i> to sleep by knocking me out with their awful singing,\" the second person said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled and looked at you. \"I'll be surprised when those three agree on anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never heard of whom they're talking about,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilly smiled. \"Wolves like music to, though their music is very different from humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" you said. You then look out a window, and notice that Molly was walking, but you didn't notice any movement; no swaying, or vibrations, or anything. \"How's this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some sort of gravity stabilizer thing,\" Lilly said. \"Not my area of expertise though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then notice Molly heading into what looked to be a restaurant, if the giant plate and silverware signs were an indicator. She then said some growls and yeps as she handed a few cases to someone behind a counter. You hear someone respond in a slightly deeper tone. You notice Molly smile, and give out a few more yeps. You then see a paw wave her off, and hear a slight growl. Molly chuckled, yepped back, and began walking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was dropping off those who work there,\" Lilly said. \"She and every other wolf has to take their tenants to their places of work; Molly's school is along this way, so those are the ones she takes to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thirty minutes, Molly entered a school building, and placed your case, and others, on one of the various shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we get out here?\" you ask as the rest got out of their seats and picked up their bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not us,\" Lilly said. \"You need to be Registered, tested for Comprehension, and also, you're Molly's Adam, meaning that you kind of need to be with her, especially for Biology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that biology won't be too difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"We won't have to do a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting registered for School, you found out that...</span></div></div>",

Since he is your Adam, you can explain it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mrs. Blackfur,\" said Molly. \"The first step to dissecting, or cooking, a human is to place them on your palm, so that they are on their chest. You then gently rub their back; this will reduce their tension. Next, you flip them onto their back, and rub their genitals; once they have masturbated, they will be relaxed enough that one can place their fingers on the sides of the human's head. After that, twist the head past the ninety degree point, as this will fracture the neck vertebra, along with the spinal cord. This will cause the human to lose consciousness, and death will be instant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" said Mrs. Blackfur with a smile. \"Now, on for the lesson.\" She then picked up a \"scalpel\" and, from what you could see, made a rectangle around Mr. Simmins' genitals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly looked down, and made a rectangle around yours. You felt a strange sensation, as if the area was being numbed, but you could still feel everything. Then, Molly used the \"blunt\" end of her \"scalpel\", and began to rub your still erect penis. You looked down your body, but while you didn't see anything, you could feel <i>something</i> touch you there. Whatever it was, it felt <i>really</i> good. Finally, you'd ejaculated, and you collapsed onto the cot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" you asked as you tried to speak clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An electrical current,\" Lilly said. \"It will simulate the cuts she makes. Just remember to shout out if you feel a sharp pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means she made a wrong cut,\" she said. \"You don't want her to continue along the wrong path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if we continue with the lesson?\" Molly said in a whisper. \"I don't want to get a low grade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you said.

Thankfully though, the Final Bell eventually rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you were in the Transportation container, and again you heard the conversations, including the arguing of which Wolven band was better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where were they at?\" you asked, as you turned to Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were at their classes, just like we were,\" Lilly said. \"Of course, since us humans outnumber the wolves by about two thousand to one, if not more, its often easier to sort us out by what family we live with. In fact, the Wolven's Family name is often added at the end of most, especially those who can't recall the family ancestor they were descended of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like what happened with the African slaves in the United States.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I've heard. In any case, they took their classes, just like we did,\" Lilly said. \"For the most part, they had different, or human, teachers.or took the class at a later time. Of course, if they have the same class as us, they watch through a monitor, along with other families' humans, and they in turn are watched through a monitor. In fact, some of these others take the same Biology class we do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me they didn't watch our dissection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"No, they saw Mr. Simmins and Mrs. Summers being dissected. Mrs. Blackfur was the only one to see our dissections, besides ourselves and Molly, and that was to make sure that she was following directions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's good,\" you sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you'd best remember what Molly did to me, and what she did,\" Lilly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you'll have to dissect me in a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. \"I don't think I could handle cutting into you, and getting your blood on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"I'll be drained of blood before you cut into my body.\" She then grinned. \"Of course, you could dissect your own body, if that would make things easier on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you done that before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, even I have to know the female body, and be used to such things, as both me and Molly wish to be doctors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's a very respectable, and well paying, job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that would be expensive to pay for,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"It might be difficult for Molly, but for me, it will be fairly easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because on the Taste Scale, I rank a 8.5 out of ten, and the higher your rank, the more you're worth when you're served as part of a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, you're going to be a Meal, to people whom you don't even know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's how many humans pay for collage,\" Lilly said. \"As it is, I wouldn't be surprised if you got yourself a 9.0 rank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw what Earth you came from, and I know its Reputation; it's a good one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle nervously at this. \"It's not the sort I'd like to have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled as she shook her head. \"You'll get used to how things work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Molly had it home, and let you, and the others out. As the rest when into the human-sized mouse holes, Lilly took you over to Molly, who then took the two of you to her room. Next thing you knew, you were busy with homework, thankfully Molly and Lilly were able to help you out with certain terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of hours of working on it, it was time for supper.

Until then, stay by me, or someone that Molly trusts.\" Then she did something you never expected; she pulled you into a corner, and kissed you, right on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this a little sudden?\" you ask. \"We've barely known each other for a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly grinned. \"Little sudden would have been me kissing you the first moment I met you. Of course, I'm no fool; I'll wait until we're older before having sex with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sex with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't need to have a wolf's nose to know that you found me attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit to that, but still, shouldn't we start out as friends first, before going onto the next step?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"I've got no problems with taking it slow, boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle nervously at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked. \"You are a boy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are my friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly kissed you again. \"Then that makes you a boyfriend, not a <i>boyfriend</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you just see me as a friend who happens to be a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"For now, but like I said, I wouldn't mind having your children; I have plans for making my family the main ingredient in a high class restaurant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't that take a while?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hundred years, if not longer,\" said Lilly. \"Of course, if I select my potential mates accordingly, along with those of my children, and theirs, I should have well over a hundred blood relations by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize that you'd be at least a hundred by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"Yes, but I'd look twenty, or thirty at the most. About the only annoyance would be that I couldn't be eaten while I was pregnant, but I could get eaten afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're serious about your plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly smiled. \"Of course; being a doctor would be good for a career, but I need something for my daily bread until then.\" She then started walking down the passages again. \"Coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well,\" you said, following her. \"So, just how long can a human live, with all of the cloning and whatnot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two, three, four, five thousand years, it's anyone's guess,\" Lilly said. \"I mean, there are those who aren't eaten, and die about fifty or so years later, when their body was seventy or so years old, but that person could be over two hundred years old. It happens often enough, the whole cycle of cloning to a youthful age, while your Wolven friends grow older, and die, can affect you enough to sign a DNC form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DNC?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do Not Clone; the next time you die, it would be for keeps, instead of getting a new body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's understandable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for how long a human can be cloned, well, there are those from the Really Old Days, back when Memory Cloning came around, roughly three thousand years ago. Then there's the DNA on file from those before then, at least ten thousand years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your DNA stays in the system, even if you've signed a DNC,\" Lilly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do they do with it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make Blanks with it, see how compatible it is with existing stock, and try to set up potential Mates for you. Also, they'll see about creating your children, and <i>improve</i> your bloodlines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What where those last two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"Let's just say that if you've yet to have a child by your thirtieth birthday, the System will look for a possible mate that is of a similar age, take your DNA, as well as theirs, and essentially, create the best offspring possible. Next thing you know, you get a message that says 'Congratulations' along with the basic information about the child, who the other is, and if you wish to pick up the child or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the improvement part?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Similar process, though it's a little wider in range, in that it doesn't concentrate on a single wolfen home; but rather the whole world, and try to arrange possible future mates for your family members- Already got a possible match with this human in Zumania. Nice guy from his letters, but I'll try someone closer than the other side of the planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone like me, I take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"Wouldn't you prefer someone you knew as a first love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. \"I guess I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, if you don't pick me, there's plenty others, for both of us.\" She then stopped before a slightly familiar door. \"I promise you, my parents will learn to accept you, it just might take my father a while longer than my mother, at least she didn't lose family to Americans during the War, unlike father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope it's easier than last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly smiled, and opened the door.</span></div></div>",

Her father though, just glared at you. He then stuck his chopsticks in his rice bowl, having them stand straight up, as he picked up a spoon and began having some soup. Something about the gesture made you nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chichi wa, sore wa hij\u014d ni shitsureida,\" said Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kare ga dono y\u014dna chii hashi wa massugu ine shudan de shitte irudarou y\u014d ni,\" her father muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sore wa, kare ga, sore ga by\u014dki no ishi o imi suru koto ni kidzuite inai wakede wa arimasen,\" Lilly said. \"Osoraku watashi wa, anata wa kare ga shinu shitai koto o kare ni tsutaerubekideshou ka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Q\u012bn'\u00e0i de, t\u0101 zh\u01d0sh\u00ec y\u012bg\u00e8 ni\u00e1nq\u012bng r\u00e9n,\" said Lilly's mother. \"T\u0101 sh\u00e8nzh\u00ec m\u00e9iy\u01d2u ch\u016bsh\u0113ng sh\u00ed f\u0101sh\u0113ng de zh\u00e0nzh\u0113ng.\" She then looked at you. \"You'll have to forgive him.\" Her accent was somewhat thick. \"Sometimes wounds don't heal, especially ones of the heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard about what happened,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watashi wa tsuma to musuko o ushinatta,\" Lilly's father muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mori, it's been over sixty years; you need to learn to let your anger go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tao, one just can't set aside that type of anger,\" Mori muttered.

You could clearly see Molly's fur, as it moved with the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned yourself on your chest, and began swimming towards the parts of Molly that her above the water, namely her breasts. A you grabbed her fur, you quickly climbed up and sat next to Lilly, who was also wearing a similar device. She gave you a quick kiss on the cheek. \"Not a bad impression of a mermaid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at this; a three-legged cat could have swam better. You then looked, and noticed that Molly was looking at you, with a wide grin. You felt a rumble under you; she was laughing at your predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled, and practically jumped off of Molly's breast into the water, which was a comfortable temperature, not too warm, but not too cold. The way she swam reminded you of some Olympic swimmers you'd seen on T.V. She swam up next to the breast again, and Molly picked both her, and you, up and set you on the edge, in a depression that was the size of a family hot tub. Molly placed what had to be a handful of water to her in it, so that you and Lilly could finish bathing. Molly then grabbed a bottle, and squirted some of it into her bath water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zenum Lomi,\" Lilly said. \"Or Flea Soap as one would say in English.

Molly was by a series of devices, along with the rest of the Sixclaws, operating them. Even Billy was working on them. Every time a light flashed, they'd press a button, and someone would appear in something that reminded you of a pneumatic tube. They'd then set the person on the shelf, and that person would get a weapon. After about twenty minutes, the lights slowed and eventually, stopped flashing. The family had a look of relief as they sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Molly. \"Everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome minutes later, you watched as Lilly and others came out with...</span></div></div>",

The others picked up their own mice and ate them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Mr. Sixclaw said as he licked his lips clean of the mouse blood. \"Let's get the rest of them ready for later meals.\" He picked some up, and took them to the kitchen, while some of the Tenets began to carry the mice that way along the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do get the bodies of those who were killed fighting them,\" said Mrs. Sixclaw to some of the other nearby Tenets. \"We'll consider the week's rent for them, or their families, paid.\" The Tenets went back inside the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Molly and her family were eating the bodies of the Tenets who'd been killed, by just picking them up and swallowing them, almost like sushi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were on a shelf, with Lilly next to you, watching, along with what had to be everyone else in the house. \"What's the point of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's to show respect to those who fell in battle,\" she said. \"Aside from the claws, as well as the inside of the mouth, no damage is to be done to the bodies, well, they aren't to be cooked or jabbed with a fork at any rate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you saw something that shocked you; Lilly was in Molly's claws. You looked at the Lilly who was next to you, She looked at you. \"You don't want to know what one did to my backside; all that I'll say is that it was bad enough to be glad my mother snapped my neck.\" You looked back just in time to see Lilly's old body plop on Molly's tongue, before being promptly swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to believe what I just saw,\" you said. \"You right here, and right there, at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"Get used to it; tomorrow you'll be dissecting my body, with me next to you. Then, you'll be dissecting your own body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, speaking of school, aren't we going to be late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The school will understand; Home Defense comes first. If an invasion were to occur at the school, it would be up to the teachers and staff to take care of the fighting, along with older students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I never have to do that,\" you said. \"I mean, I can use a gun, but, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"You can stay in the home then; but know this, a Snack tries to come in, don't hesitate to kill them. Unlike a bunch of mice looking for food and shelter, Snacks can set fire to the place, and potentially kill the Host Family as a result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankfully, wolves have good noses.\" She gave you a kiss, much to the displeasure of her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, you were at the school.

Eventually, you're right by her foot, within centimeters of being squashed. Pass that class, you've got to deal with two feet by you, and then two wolves, then four, and so on. Also, they get faster, and faster still, until soon enough you've got to dance just to stand up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it beats being chased though, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"Me and Molly both love Cat-and-Mouse; been a while since anyone's caught me, and Molly has a lot of captures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Hide-and-Seek; humans have to run and hide while wolves try to catch them,\" said Lilly. \"It's based off of the old tradition when wolves would claim humans by being the one to capture them. In a sense, part of that tradition is still practiced; the unwritten law is that the first wolf to catch sight of you, and hold onto you, is the one who gets you, or their family at any rate. Of course, you could move in with another family, should you feel unsafe around the one you're currently with. Then again, if you got a job, and it isn't within the family's normal route, it's recommended that you be with another family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the wolves are our main mode of transportation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"Of course, unless you fancy getting your neck snapped every morning to show up at your destination.\" She then gave you a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you stop doing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly giggled, and walked behind you, draping her arm over your shoulders. \"I need you to relax around me,\" she said. \"I need you calm for when I snap your neck in class tomorrow. You'll have to do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp at this; you didn't know how you'd manage that part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll practice tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you were at ballet, and you found out...</span></div></div>",

That's the way it is at home to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they do this on a regular basis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the humans don't complain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They might be nervous the first time they are to be eaten, or killed, or kill someone who is to be eaten, but they get used to it,\" Lilly said. \"Might take you a while, but you'll get over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you plan to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"You'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Snacks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You learn to ignore them, for the most part; save whatever sympathy you have for the ones they killed.\"</span></div></div>",

She put her hands on her hips and chuckled at you, as you tried to cover up your manhood. \"It's not like I haven't seen it before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a thud, as Molly placed an elbow on the desk, flashing you a grin. \"He's got a nice one you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly walked up to you, and moved your hands away. \"Let's get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two of you were sitting on the desk, her back to your chest, and she had your one arm in a manner that would help support her, as she had the hand of your other arm by her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just rub, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're alright with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like a pervert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to hold your hand, and do it for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no.\" You began to rub her, slowly at first, then faster, and faster.

The light in your room was on, and red in color, and that sound penetrated your entire body with a feeling that something was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed to the door of your room, opening it to see Mori loading up a carbine, naked but for the belt that held the scabbard of what looked to be a katana. Likewise, Tao was also loading up a carbine, and naked but for the belt meant for a Chinese dao-type scabbard. The two of them looked at you, and looked at Lilly, who was in the process of mounting a bayonet onto a M16.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rir\u012b wa, koko ni taizai,\" Mori said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shikashi, watashi wa, tatakau koto ga dekiru,\" Lilly said. \"Anata wa, watashi ga suru koto ga dekimasu shitte iru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W\u01d2men zh\u012bd\u00e0o n\u01d0 k\u011by\u01d0 d\u01ce,\" Tao said. \"D\u00e0nsh\u00ec, w\u01d2men b\u00f9n\u00e9ng l\u00edk\u0101i t\u0101 d\u00faz\u00ec z\u00e0i zh\u00e8l\u01d0.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked at you, then at her parents. \"H\u01ceo ba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two adults nodded, and opened the door to the hallway, where you saw plenty of armed men and women running towards one direction.

Sometimes you were able to keep your balance, other times when a rather heavy note was followed by another one, you lost your balance and fell to the ground. You could always get up quick and hoped that the teacher wouldn't notice your failings as she seemed to bee enraptured by the dextrous fingers of Beethoven flying across that piano of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once class was over, you realized how wrong you were.

The movement of wolves' feet is much more erratic when it comes to real life.\" She sighed, obviously she was trying to help you, but you must have been one of the least practiced pupils she had had in a long while. But in all fairness, you had not been here a full  day, yet. \"Is there something something that we can do,\" Mrs. Crinktail continued, \"to make you more comfortable in ballet?\" She must have noticed just how uncomfortable this class had made you, if the smile on her face as the moment was any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't give your answer much thought as you just replied in what was on your mind at the time. that classical music was just not your style and the solo piano just made things all the more frustrating.

At your height, your could not read them all, but you could tell that it was an impressive library of sound. Her clawed fingers rapped against the plastic cases and settled against a certain one when she turned back to your. \"Ballet is much more versatile than you might think.

In time, the bulb would grow into a lovely flower, growing well due to the nutrients that the matchbox, and your body, had provided, and it would return at the start of every Spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Hitler, he found out the hard way that, in addition to nuts, squirrels like to have meat with their meals.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You're Keane, an average 16 year old with an average life. You're doing well in school and sports and are really enjoying being alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, while rooting through your closet, you stumble upon a strange, golden box with many inscriptions on it. You've never seen this box before. Curious, you open the box and find inside it a shimmering green crystal. It's a beautiful crystal. Rays of light shine in all directions as you look over your discovery. Suddenly, the crystal flares, and everything goes white. You cover your eyes from the blinding light, and you start to feel disorientated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open your eyes, you find yourself in a sea of green. You look around yourself and realize that this sea is actually grass. You've shrunk! You look down the sea of grass and see something amazing: a family of giant wolves is having a picnic just 6 feet from you! You head towards the giant furs, unsure of what else to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill the wolves be nice to you, or will you become a tasty snack? Or will you become their slave? Who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo size changing. Try not to kill Keane, but if you have to, make it interesting :) </td>",
