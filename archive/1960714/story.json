Are you alright?\" says a familiar voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

I think\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Why wouldn't you know me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around to see that you're in bed again but in a different building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" you ask \"And who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in your room, at the guild hall... You really don't remember... Do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looks worried by you not knowing who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me; Maya\" she says \"Brody carried you in after you collapsed outside.

She wore some sort of robe and has black hair and purple eyes.... Wait. Purple eyes!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like he's awakened\" She says, although, she said it pretty quietly.

I was going to school, and had gotten off of the bus... And then that guy Lanc-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. A bus?\" asked Maya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A form of transportation, much like a wagon but doesn't require horses. (*Name*) has spoken of these before, when I would ask about where he came from.\" says Victoria<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have?\" You ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria reaches for a book from some sort of satchel, as well as what looks to be some vials with different colored liquids inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a spell that could recover some of his memories, but I'm not sure how well it will work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spell? like magic?

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You find yourself in a brand new world, Known as Aureus, but how and why? <br>\r\nYou end up joining into Pantheon, a questing guild, in order to survive this foreign place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese are the rules for the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;The main character is known as (*Your Name*), yes, you! However, this story is designed to have a male lead, but if you are not male or if you simply don't want to use your name, just imagine another character to take his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;The main character must be involved with the Pantheon guild somehow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;Avoid killing any of the main characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;No adding any non-original characters. I don't want to see Naruto or Sailor Moon in this story. Ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;This is a romance story as well as adventure, it is not an erotica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;Try to make chapters at least a couple of paragraphs long and keep it interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;I'm not asking for perfect grammar (I have some issues sometimes) but try to keep it as neat as you can. And if it becomes a chore to try and understand what you have added, it will more than likely be edited or deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;Keep the story going!!! no adding chapters that will end the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;Plenty of creatures exist in Aureus that don't in the real-world, such as orcs, trolls, vampires, Giant bugs and pretty much anything you can think up as long as it fits!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright that's enough rules. Onto the characters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;<b>Maya</b>. she was the first person that you met in Aureus. She is a Cat-Saith, a race of humanoids that look mostly human but have feline features, such as a tail and ears as well as slit eyes, claws and fangs. Maya has short orange fur and short hair on her head and yellow eyes. She prefers to use martial arts while fighting and uses her claws while doing so to increase fighting capabilities. She stands at only 5'6\" (which is actually within normal range for a Cat-Saith), is 19 years old and likes to wear cloths that aren't too restricting (She finds them really uncomfortable), usually a sleeveless vest and shorts. She became a member of Pantheon at the same time you did and you have always watched eachother's backs, even if you don't always agree on everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;<b>Victoria Unaatis</b>. Victoria is a human mage, she prefers protective and healing magic and has been a member of Pantheon for about 6 months. She is kinda shy and prefers to keep to herself but has helped you in the past with some quests when a healer was needed. She is 22 years old and stands at about 5'10\". She usually wears her study robes but will wear an enchanted robe while questing for greater protection. She has straight Black hair that hangs at mid-shoulder, as well as light purple eyes, which is a trait of her family. She prefers reading her grimoires and practicing her magic over most activities but is more than willing to help others when she is needed. She also finds the story that you came from another world very interesting and will sometimes ask questions about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;<b>Lin'ora</b>. She is an Elf Huntress, she prefers the bow as her main weapon but always keeps her dagger ready.<br>\r\nShe wears leather leggings and a leather vest as well as a long sleeved silk shirt. She has long blonde hair, green eyes, and long pointed ears (Tolkien Ears, not WoW style). She stands at 5'11\" tall, No-one really knows how old she is (Elves can live to be about 4000 years old) but she looks like she is in her mid-20s, and usually only takes quests involving either monsters that need killing, or ones that involve treasure. She has been a member of Pantheon for just over a year now and has a reputation in the guild for her beauty and skills with a bow, but she doesn't really care for the recognition.<br>\r\nShe has been on probably 3-4 quests with you and you have befriended her in the process, however, she still has a difficult time believing that you came from a different world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;<b>Brody</b>. Brody has been a member of the Pantheon guild for over 15 years now and seldom goes on quests anymore,but he is more than happy to train the other guild members. Brody stands at a massive 6'7\" tall and has unkempt black hair and a beard, he is 37 years old and carries a greatsword on his back. Oh, and by the way, he's a werewolf. When transformed, Brody stands at about 7'5\" tall and grows black fur all over his body as well as a tail, claws, fangs and the head of a wolf. He can transform any time he wishes but prefers to do so only when necessary, such as losing his sword or becoming greatly injured.<br>\r\n(Courtesy of Isyther)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;<b>Dark</b>. No-one knows what her real name is, for all they know it actually could be Dark. <br>\r\nDark is a vampire, a really powerful one too, but she believes that her vampirism is a curse and she herself hates vampires.<br>\r\nNormally she cannot walk in sunlight, but she can drink a special tea brewed specifically for her from a friend in the guild.<br>\r\nWith it, she can walk in sunlight safely and become immune to weapons and items made from silver, but it will also suppress her abilities and render her as if she were human. She cannot be harmed by items such as crosses, running water or garlic (however, she doesn't personally like the taste). Dark stands at 5'11\" tall, looks like she is in her mid 20s and has short black hair and red eyes. Dark normally quests alone, and uses her twin longswords with her inhuman speed and strength. No-one really knows when she arrived at Pantheon, but some say she has been there for over 500 years. She also has a tendency to be uncaring for other people and is a borderline sadist, which makes you wonder why she isn't a member of Harbinger.<br>\r\n(Also courtesy of Isyther)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;<b>Silus</b>. This young warrior is a former member of Harbinger, now recently turned to Pantheon.<br>\r\nSilus has blue eyes, short brown hair and stands at 6'1\". He carries his Mace and shield on his back whenever he goes questing and doesn't feel comfortable outside of the cities without them. He doesn't wear much in terms of armor, just an old Breastplate and helmet that he got from his father when he was 15 years old, he is now 19 and takes care of his twin sister Serena. You don't know him too well personally, but he seems to worry about others often.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nall of these characters are part of the Pantheon Guild and now so are you!<br>\r\nThe guild is a way for members to find jobs that people need done that vary from the mundane to the extremely deadly.<br>\r\nthere are probably 80 or so members currently enlisted to Pantheon many of which have made decent names for themselves through questing. There are however other guilds, some of which will take the same job as another guild and they would fight it out to see who gets the reward and sometimes they will take quests contradicting to yours (Such as, they would steal a diamond for someone, while your job is to guard it). The guild that has caused the most problems for Pantheon would be the Harbinger Guild. Most of the quests that Harbinger would take are mercenary jobs or assassination targets, Pantheon doesn't allow for assassination quests but will sometimes allow for mercenary quests, depending on the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is my first Interactive Story, reviews and suggestions would be helpful and very much appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;UPDATE: the beginning of the story has been redone, to allow for the companionship of different characters rather than having to travel with Maya automatically (Nov/15th/2013)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;UPDATE: The official currency in this world is known as Gen (Sounds more like genn than Jenn). Gen is practically the standard gold coin of other worlds but only half is gold, while the othe half of the metal is copper or brass mixed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave Fun!</td>",
