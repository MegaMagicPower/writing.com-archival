Your arms, shoulders, legs, ribs, chest, head; they all hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you remember is getting the last book you needed to complete your Redwall set. After that, bright lights, and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel something; water coming into your nose. You open your eyes and find yourself surrounded. You look up, and see light. You begin to move your arms and legs, trying to get to the surface. Along the way, you see others, but you can't make them out. Finally, you make it to the surface, and gasp for air. Then, something grabs your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Brother, we just found another one,\" a voice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we throw him back?\" another voice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we can not just throw back anyone who has managed to survive the river,\" says a third voice. \"After all, it is our duty to help the sick and injured, as well as the newly revived. Be they woodlander or otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to your sides, however, your vision is blurry. All that you can make out about your saviors are that they are tall and wearing brownish fur coats, which do not make sense. You then look towards the direction of the third voice, and see someone wearing some green clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you two otters hurry up and get that person here,\" the green one says. \"I think they suffered a concussion before they came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it looks like they swallowed a good deal of water too,\" said the owner of the first voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also begin to hear other voices, some saying thanks, others telling someone to get their hands off them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you manage to get to land, where the green one began to wrap some cloth around your eyes, and you try to fight off the two holding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy young one,\" says yet another voice. \"If you try to use your eyes too soon, there could be some damage that could be permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of this voice causes you to relax, and stop struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" the voice says. \"Let's get these revivers back to the Abbey. Dannflor and his crew are going to trade places with us. As for you who have just revived, I'm sure you know the drill, rest, eat up, and go to the places you feel comfortable, and that goes for those of you who aren't honest woodlanders as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wonder about the one we've got Martin,\" says the person who blindfolded you. \"I've seen most whom have lived, but I've never seen anyone like this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter Brother Rafael?\" asks Martin. \"They still need food and rest, no matter whom they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, you were in a place that, from the sounds of the echos, was made of stone or brick. Then there were the smells of food cooking, which made your mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you Warriors are always bringing in revivers just as I'm about to get food ready,\" says another voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you too, Friar Hugo,\" Martin says. \"Be sure to bring some soup up to the Dormitories and the Infirmary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's going to the Infirmary and why?\" asks a voice that seems to have some authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's this one right here Abbot,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I see,\" says the Abbot. \"I've never seen this one before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part of the reason I'm taking them to the Infirmary,\" Martin says. \"They also seem to be suffering from a concussion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, carry on with what you were doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, you found yourself in a very comfy bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this feels good,\" you say quietly. \"Of course, it would be better if I could see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear a giggle. \"I might be able to help you with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel someone removing the cloth. A few layers of cloth later, you find yourself looking at the figure of a young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to remove the last piece off by yourself?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind doing that,\" you say as you remove the last layer. However, the sight causes your eyes to bulge out. The young woman is a mouse with the hairstyle of a young woman. \"Um, where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you're are Redwall,\" the mouse says. \"And you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm (Fill in name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you then,\" the mouse says. \"I'm Sister Buttercup. Would you like to look in a mirror?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gets out a small mirror and you take a good look at yourself. You are......</span></div></div>",

Despite a weird feeling accompanied by nausea and aches pulsing through your skull, there is nothing that needs plastic surgery. You glide a hand across your jawline, going up the cheek and running your fingers through your hairline. Your hand then drops down to feel your chest and ribs and despite the pain from before, there is no damage that can seen. Everything is in place. In fact, you're so glad that there is not a scratch on you that you just have to compliment yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good,\" you smile to your reflection before handing the mirror back to the mouse. \"I was expecting my face to be hamburger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Buttercup tilts her head quizzically, but smiles warmly as she takes the mirror and replaces it on the bedside table. \"You must have suffered quite a shock to your head. Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think so. Just feeling a little fuzzy and light up here,\" you tell her, putting your palms to your temples in emphasis, \"like I've just lost my mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little mouse girl giggles when you squawk mirthfully. \"It can sometimes happen that the injuries causing death will carry over to to a revival's new life. That is why you may be weak or in any pain after your revived,\" she explains to you with a concerned smile, adding, \"--and why you may be dazed. I would venture to assume that you received quite a blow to the head?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, yeah. Something like that. . .\" you kind of drift off for a moment when she mentions something about death and revival, but seem to recall something involving a heavy impact. But death? You feel too. . .alive to be dead, everything seems to vivid to be death, or at least compared to your nebulous ideas of death, so you ask, \" 'Causing death'? 'New life'? Are you saying I'm dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did die, yes, but have been revived in the nearby river. You are quite obviously a Dead Fan; surely this isn't the first time you have been revived, unless you. . .\" the little mouse suddenly halts her explanation and places a paw over her maw, expression growing apologetic. \"Unless you just died. Oh, I apologize, (your name here), I didn't mean to be insensitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need, little Sister,\" you assure the little mouse, \"I figure I'm gonna be out of the loop for a while. In fact, now that I think about it, I'm surprised you're not overreacting to the difference in, uhm,\" you search for the words as your arms motion to you, Sister Buttercup and back, \"species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPut at ease by your chummy disposition, Buttercup explains, \"I suppose it might be because Dead Fans will sometimes speak of their former lives as humans, but this is the first time a human has been brought to the abbey. Nevertheless, the mice at Redwall Abbey are sworn to care for travelers and revivers until they recover.\" She puts a clawed digit to her chin at she mulls a thought over. \"Though, I suppose the abbots and abbesses will need to convene on the matter of your treatment after three days of your staying at Redwall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you make that sound as if I can expect a hazing,\" you accuse with a tongue in cheek, the facade of a piercing gaze falling when you imagine a throng of student's with paddles smacking you across the rear as you march to the other side of a room, and a smile cracks across your lips and you chuckle, \"Ah, freshman year. Those were good days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, that is simply a matter of business,\" she replies nonchalantly, \"between Vermin and Woodlanders, each to their own and so forth. How we let them off helps revivers settle in to their roles. Until then, however,\" smiles kindly, \"is there anything I can do to make yours a lovely stay at Redwall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think over the kind little mouse's offer, scratching your head in thought. Your cheap wristwatch seems broken, maybe you could ask her for a sundial. The thing said waterproof to fifty yards and it couldn't handle. . .however deep is the Moss. Though being carried over here let you drip-dry a bit, your clothes are still soaking. Your shoes are completely logged, shirt and pants are clinging uncomfortably to your skin, and your underwear are beginning to chafe. Which gave you the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't happen to have a spare pair of underwear, would you?\" You look her up and down, noting the minimalistic outfit of a habit, white apron and bonnet. Maybe they don't even have undergarments, for all you know. \". . .Or does everyone 'go commando' around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Buttercup once again stares, completely lost as you wait for an answer. \"I'm not sure---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm totally cool with that,\" you add with a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression goes blank for a moment before she shakes her head, \"I will see what I can arrange for you.\" And with that, the little mouse hurries off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Buttercup disappears around the doorway, you lie back and stretch your arms and legs out, way over the head and foot of the bead, your frame clearly too tall for the frame made for critters slightly bigger than a mouse. Popping your neck some with a twist to the left and a twist to the right to get that kink out gets you feeling much better already. You let your limbs fall down limply over the sides of the bed while you get to thinking that some shut-eye might not be such a bad idea right now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You take a moment of pause to close your eyes, enjoy a good scratch on the crotch and toss about the bed, but when you can't get comfortable you bolt upwards and swing your feet to the floor. \"Nah, forget it. I'm at Redwall. <i>The</i> Redwall,\" you say to yourself as you look around the spacious infirmary. \"Should at least check out more than one room before moving on, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaguely, you recall the multitude of times that Redwall's infirmary was described in the books and it looks about right with two rows of beds set up against the walls. Open windows let the let shine in and the fresh air flows through the muggy room with every passing breeze. And you were not the only one dragged in from the river, so it seems. Several bodies apart from your own occupy the beds, some more restful than others, but none of them seem to have given you any mind. Yet. You spy a doorway at the far end of the room and make your way towards it, moving past the sleeping figures bundled up in their covers, and wave enthusiastically to those who stare look at you in confusion. One thing that catches your eye is a cloth of a purple and red diamond pattern that is draped over the bedposts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd know that harlequin getup any day. Slagar!\" you exclaim loudly enough to make the other stir as you lean over the foot of the bed. The head pressed against the pillow turns over as the red fox's eyes squint against the light trying to focus on you. \"So cunning, so shrewd,\" you continue to comment , \"a villain so, ehhh, by the books, shall we say? But I guess that's why you were easily identifiable.\" You grin as you absentmindedly flick one of his toe claws peeking out from under the covers and they recoil away. \"Tell me, what'cha doing back in Redwall? Did the abbot turn a blind eye to you, again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlagar raises his paws from under the covers and rubs them over his face. You notice that it is free from the scarring that his signature hood was intended to conceal. He releases a growl from his throat as he groans out, \"Ambushed by the Long Patrol, I am pitied by the Redwall mice once more, and now, am I to be haunted by this revolting wretch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou purse your lips at his insult and fire back, \"You're one to talk. Last I remember, you looked like a fox who took a hot clothes iron to the face. What happened Slaggy? Got a little lift-and-tuck in your downtime . . . at the bottom of the well?\" You snicker as you see the fox's face twist through a phase of being shaken moving onto anger and then a sudden exuberance as his paws shoot out for your throat in a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to speak, but your words come out in a gurgle and completely incoherent. \"Aaakk! Thesh eshcalerted v'rry qwerklr.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Augh! This escalated very quickly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite any misgivings you might have had about the fox and his condition, Slagar's grip proves to be solid as your own hands close on his wrists to pry his enraged fingers loose while they cut off your air supply. Strangely enough, while your struggling with that, eyes bugging out with the unpleasantness of it all, you do not lose consciousness. The scene drags on for a good minute and Slagar is pinning you down, getting a few swipes in with his right paw, and you still clock him square behind the jaw hard enough to topple him sideways. The fox's paw releases your throat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" you exclaim, sitting up. \"You had me going for a moment there! I mean, you went all Boston Strangler on me when I thought you'd be, blaaaaugh, all comatose like---\". You are cut off when the fox launches at you again, knocking the wind out of you as you yelp loudly. Once again you are not winded as the scuffle continues to rage between the pair of beds. Now the attention of the other critters awake enough to see whats going on has been shifted to fight that is increasing in intensity, curses and insults flying, slaps and punches landing, pained groans and girly screeches ringing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving had enough, you decide that a dignified retreat is in order. You scramble under the nearest bed, huffing and gasping from the exhaustion, covered in nasty scratches and fox wounds. Trying to pull yourself up on the other side is caught short by Slagar grabbing you by your feet, prompting another surprised yowl from you. Looking around, you spot a shrew looking groggily at your from the bed ahead of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Ya gotta help me!\" you implore as you scratch at the stone floor for traction. \"That meanie fights dirty! He bites and <i>scraaaa</i>-tches! <i>No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!</i>\" Your wails land on deaf ears as your are pulled back under, finger nails scraping at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all this commotion I'm hearin' all the way from the hall?\" A voice interrupts Slagar as something jabs him hard in the ribs. He halts his attempts to turn you spinal column into an accordion as the current caretaker of the infirmary confronts the recently revived fox. Sister Sloey confronts Slagar with naught but a wooden spoon to branding before his nose. \"There will be no fightin' within these walls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet, mouse.\" Slagar says hoarsely, the scuffle with you draining much energy from his already weakened state. \"The newcomer needs to be taught a lesson in humility. The sooner he learns his pla-AAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the other hand decide that you were not out of it just yet. Springing back in with a second wind, you pick up a diminutive nightstand and smash it violently into the distracted fox's head for a decisive victory. The fox flies forward quite a ways, forcing little Sloey to spring desperately out of the way as he crashes to the ground for the K.O..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww yeah, and it's a home run to the left field! Red fox; corner pocket!\" You raise your fists and pace back and forth before the downed fox while spouting sports goals to add insult to injury. The shocked mouse that you barely acknowledge bolts out, calling for assistance. \"All hail to the mighty mountain of man that is (your name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curtail your victory babble as you eye the fox crumpled on the floor. \"Hay, Slagar, you just unconscious, or are your dead?\" You as while rolling him over. He doesn't seem to be breathing, and your not one to check for a pulse or anything. Maybe the way one eyelid is open more than the other and the tongue hanging out, the worst should be assumed. \"He might be dead,\" you muse. \"But,\" you consider all details, including the fact that you're still holding your breath from the excitement of the fight, deciding that things are not all what they seem, \"I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather unceremoniously hauling Slagar back to the bed by his tail, you heave him back up, plant him face first in his pillow, body falling pretty much prone eagle except for one arm hanging off the side. Now he looked like someone hung over after downing five four-ohs the previous night. Adding the final touch by yanking the covers across to him land mostly on his upper half completes the look of a sleeping frat boy. And you congratulate yourself. \"Sleep tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where was I?\" you ponder, scratching your chin. \"Oh, right! Let's hit the abbey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start for the door once again, getting only a few paces away from seeing the chamber beyond when something moves into your way. It's a figure, tall, robust and imposing. She is feminine in build and in her attire. When her eyes meet yours and glare down daggers back into your sockets, your mind seems to click a connection in. You don't know how you know, but you immediately identify the badger as Constance from the first two books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why, Sloey?,\" you whine at the mouse standing behind the mountain of black and white. \"You two aren't ever in the same book together and you send in the most ornery badger to grace Redwall?\" The comment comes out as a question from your incredulity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, Dead Fan, Redwall Abbey is a grounds for peace and healing when it comes to you revivers,\" the badger mother footsteps thunder as she approaches you. \"Your strange talk, your foul temper won't sit well with us Redwallers, nor with any other goodbeasts. The vermin are likely to shred you to ribbons the moment you open your uncouth gob. Perhaps a few more murders on your soul would help you settle down. I'm sure the abbey council would not forgo throwing a reviver as troublesome as you right over the walls. So it's your choice Dead Fan,\" she menaces, teeth baring as she points a claw to your vacated bed, \"abide the abbey or shove off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, maybe Cregga <i>was</i> worse,\" you concede as you back away from the advancing badger mother, \"but I still didn't like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer deepening growl and flexing claws say that you better make a choice, quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" you look heavenward to the left, \"behave myself and probably get chaperoned for the rest of my stay at Redwall.\" Your eyes shift right as you continue to ponder, \"I could make a tactical retreat, making things worse for myself. Or I could.. .. . . .. . \"</span></div></div>",

Sister Buttercup overhears, and thinks you're talking to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, something happened to you first. You seem a bit dazed, so something or somebody probably hit you over the head pretty hard. After that, you, uh, you died. Then you floated up in the river near the Abby, and, as mice of the order of Redwall, its our sworn duty to look after you until you recover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Still feeling dazed, you just keep up the conversation, despite a few key words clamoring for acknowledgement in the back of your mind, you're too over-awed to keep track of much of anything. \"What happens then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She hesitates for a few seconds, as if reluctant to tell you. \"As a rat, and probably a wrongdoer, there's a good chance some of our warriors will put you out on the road, once you're well enough, of course,  and from there you can go wherever you like. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Realizing you may soon be kicked from the abbey jolts you into a full reclamation of your faculties. \"What?

Usually, we've gotten nothing but a few hard lessons from letting vermin, er, your kind, stay in the Abbey after we revive them. But, you do seem a bit different than the norm. Most of the villains we drag from the river are more than a little <i>rougher</i> than you, and you just seem...Different. I can't put my paw on it, but I'll tell the elders that you don't want to go, and I'll put in a good word for you. In the mean time, if you're serious about staying, you'll probably have to be moved to the cellar when you're feeling better, in case you're simply trying to steel something or get up to something else like that.\" You nod, suddenly feeling quite tired.

Keeping you hemmed in but otherwise ignoring you as they chat to each other, they escort you far down the path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right, mates,\" A hulking male with an eye-patch booms. \"I think we've gone far enough with this one. Now listen up, rat. We're civil beasts at Redwall, so we'll give you food for three days, if you don't wolf it all down right away. After that, you can go where you like and do what you like, just not back to the Abbey. We're not about to give you a weapon, as you're as likely to attack us the moment we turn our backs as try to, say, go fishing with it.\" He unceremoniously thrusts a small pouch at you, and then turns to to his fellow riverdogs. \"Come on, mates.

Hunh, I would've just tossed him back in the soup if I'd been the lucky one to find him.\" Talking among themselves of the massive, feared, blind adder, they jog back the way they had come, rounding a bend and starting the back down the long walk to Redwall.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sigh despairingly, looking down the path in the other direction. While you knew that this was probably some kind of dream brought on by the accident, and you'd be around in no time in a hospital somewhere, it still seemed a cruel joke by Dame Fortune to land you in one of your favorite fantasy world as a universally disliked villain. By all appearances, the question now was; 'now what?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Off to your right stretched the 'flat'lands, slowly rolling hills that stretched to the horizon in a sea of grass. You think you can make out a few short little points in the distance, possibly mountains, and another, bigger one back towards to the north. You seem to faintly recall something about a huge tribe of pygmy shrews living down that way, maybe they'd be more accepting than the Redwallers? You don't give yourself time to enjoy the irony in that thought as you sweep your gaze back to the left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 On the other hand, the left side of the path gives way to thick forest, and you can't see very deep into the brush; who knew what could be waiting in there? There certainty could be greater opportunities to find food, once your supplies run out.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And finally, there's the broad, dusty path that runs down for ages, until it's lost in the green of a copse growing on the 'flatlands' side of the road. Maybe you could head south, and then... Just see where it took you. You had already seen in person that death was a stranger in this world, so knew you didn't have to worry about much.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Redwallers had been attacked countless times before by vermin, including many rats. They had every right save what their reputation suggested to be leery of keeping them around.

Anothe' lazy little pup wot thinks he can go bludering intu' whoever eh wants, eh?\" The rodent you jostled punches out, catching you in the side of your snout.

Even Matthias had been unable to best him in battle- his slaying had only come because of the Joseph Bell falling on top of him. Cluny had used many strategies during his siege of the Abbey- tower, tunneling, battering ram, and a few more. In the end, it had taken the capture of a dormouse's family to provide him with the means of entering the place, when the head of the family was forced to betray Redwall in an attempt to rescue them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCluny then began to walk among the various vermin, swishing his long, and barbed, tail. \"Well, it seems some of you once followed me,\" he said as he stopped in front of one particular rat. \"Ah Redtooth, my old friend.

Curses fly and officers crack whips as you negotiate the large trench with difficulty, a large team of rats bearing a heavy battering ram particularly hampered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Glancing at the huge, well-worn thing, you try to recall everything you know about Brockhall, and wonder if it might be over-kill. The place wasn't that big; certainly not a great fortress like Redwall. It was an ancestral home of an ancient tribe of badgers, far older than the Abbey, possibly older than the <i>late</i> fortress Kotir. It has served as a base for the group of resistance fighters called the Corim, and was the birth place of numerous famed badger warriors. After the establishment of Redwall, it had eventually been abandoned, and taken over by a nest of serpents, who had fought with a vermin expedition from the far north, and were eventually slain themselves by a small force of Redwallers. No attempt to re-colonize it was made, and generations later, it was occupied by the vermin army known as the Ravagers, who had been driven out by Redwallers as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Given the timeless nature of this place in relation to the book-series you had read, there was no telling who controlled it now. <i>As long as it wasn't badgers.</i> You think, remembering the way their size, ferocity, and skill had been described, and hoping that you'd never be on the wrong end of their great weapons. It occurs to you to ask a native what they know of the place. \"Hay, Grigtail, who's in control of the Hall right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He shrugs, looking unfocused as he watches his feet carefully to help discourage stumbling. \"Dunno. Heard it was Raga Bol's gang o' bullies who had it last, but that place changes hands more often than a gem in a crowd of Gonfellin mice. Could be anybody by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nod, about to question him further, but instead jump in the air and yelp as something snaps you in the ear-tip with enough precision to draw blood. Gritting your teeth in pain, you look to where Mangetail holds his whip aloft threateningly.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Silence in the ranks there, or I'll give you another few licks with my leather beauty here!\" He snarls, and you don't respond, just hunch in your shoulders instinctively to make yourself a smaller target, and go back to marching in relative quiet, entertaining images of the captain with your ax protruding from the front of his snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Cluny deems the army to be far enough from the Abbey without alerting possible reinforcements, you swing about and begin to punch your way through the dense woodland. Order is difficult to maintain with tree-trunks to swerve around, logs to climb over, and brackets to cut through, and mosquitoes harry you insistently, but at least the captains can't aim their disciplinary tools as well, though not for lack of trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The slog keeps your mind off the impending battle, and you are startled as orders to halt are bellowed loudly, and you catch your first glimpse of Brockhall. </span></div></div>",

The tree's canopy was apparently thick enough to block out light from above, resulting in it being surrounded by the large clearing. Tucked away at the base of the trunk, in a hollow surrounded by several huge, protruding roots, rests an innocuous door, the only thing suggesting that the great tree was anything other than another impressive forest giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Division halt! You six, get up there and make sure we're not disturbing anybody's precious tea-time.\" Captain Mangetail gestures to you, Grigtail, and several other Troops in your row, and you dutifully start making your way across the field to the door. Up close, it seems almost a bit sinister, a small, unmarked portal nestled in between piles of dead leaves. You look for the doorknob, and notice that door isn't completely untouched as you go to yank it open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There are an abundance of small scratch-marks, as if somebeast had desperately tried to get in in a hurry. You pause and lean down to examine them, but are interrupted by a scarred, jet-black fox. \"Well, aren't you going to open it sometime today?\" He growls, spitting irritatingly close to your foot-paw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your still-sore ear throbs painfully, but you glance at his impressive collection of war wounds and decide to keep your mouth shut, giving the knob a hard tug instead. It creeks, but otherwise doesn't budge; the tree must have warped the frame as it grew. Grigtail gives you a hand, and after some straining, you wrench it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A blast of some musky, foul smell pours out, setting your fur on end with its cloying scent. A flight of crude steps cut out of the earth lead steeply down into darkness. \"Er, why don't you go first, Jubbra?\" A small, golden furred rat that looked like a mouse- or vice-versa- pipes up from behind you, fiddling with a long dagger. A hulking ferret who had been standing next to him shoulders the fox out of the way to get to the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Duh? You got it, Aze-Kame. Phooey! The smell that these badger 'oles have -makes you think of a serpent's rotting carcass at noontide in mid-summer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well ain't that poetic.\" Grumbles a rat from behind you as you reluctantly follow Jubbra down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You carefully descend on the ladder-like protrusions, the musky smell growing stronger and the light from the door above seemingly being devoured by the darkness before accomplishing much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't suppose anybody brought a light? I can't see mah' paw in front of my face.\" Complains the same rat who had rebuked Jubbra's metaphor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I gotta flint.\" Says Grig, his voice rebounding and echoing surprisingly well through the stifling dark, audible for several moments afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Keep it down, will ya'?! Or I'll put my hatchet through the back o' your thick skull. Maybe that'll shut yew up!\" Snarls the black fox from the rear of the group, waving a short, elaborate ax for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, shud-up you stuffy old bushtail! There ain't nobeast here anyways. What're you scared of? The dark or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-beast talks to Thorn-claws Oak-Breaker like that!\" He yelps, trying to clamber over both you and the other rat to get at Grigtail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Duh, looks like this is the bottom guys.\" Grunts Jubbra. Shielding yourself from the crazed fox with the haft of your ax, you step out- and tumble down face first, the other rat and Oak-Breaker landing on top of you in a heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, wot? Uh, there's a step there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I found an old torch-bracket.\" Calls Grigtail from off to the side, and light reveals the dusty chamber as he puts his flint to use. Cobwebs dominate everywhere, sticking between old furniture and roots hanging from the ceiling. A closed door is set into the wall off to the right, near to where Grigtail found an unused torch, and the chamber divides up ahead. Down here, the sickly-sweet smell is almost painfully strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You clamber back to your paws, dusting yourself off. Breaker doesn't say anything, and it occurs to you that the fall might have briefly stunned him. <i>Finally, some luck.</i> You think, looking for another torch to put to light. Farther down the tunnel, Jubbra's already done so, quietly chatting with the blonde rat you now were beginning to suspect might be a jerbilrat from the distant south as they both explore father down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlowing the dirt off of an old table, you slowly turn to the weasel. \"Looks like you were right, Grigtail. This place is empty as a tomb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That idea is contested from the deep-voiced scream that materializes from down the tunnel. The torch that had marked where Jubbra and the jerbilrat he had called Aze-Kame were flickers violently and goes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like Jubbra!\" You grip your axe tightly, staring down the tunnel, in time to see Aze-Kame bolting towards you as if there were a pack of rabid wolverines chasing him. He runs smack into Breaker just as the fox rises to his feet, and falls down, babbling incoherently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down! Where's Jubbra? What happened?\" Asks the complainative rat, slapping Aze on the head to get him to pay attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-g-gone! It's s-s-snakes!\" Squeaks Kame, words almost inaudible from the rustling and hissing that emerges from the darkness ahead, just beyond the flickering torch light. A set of pale eyes reflect in the light-and then another, and another. Hissing fills the air, as well as a fresh wave of deathly sweetness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, you idiots! This way!\" Howls Braker, bolting for the nearest exit-the door to Grigtail's immediate right. Not about to argue, you grab Aze-Kame by the scruff of his neck and race after.                    </span></div></div>",

Soon Zassalisss will come to show you ...eternity.\" A sibilant voice hisses, and then the banging resumes two-fold. You back away, holding onto your axe for comfort, as the jirbilrat and the fox also grip their weapons and move away from the door as it starts to creek and splinter under the punishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, Grig, I guess this is good-bye for now.\" You gulp, looking for your companion. \"Grig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We're in here mates!\" His voice calls from the thin-air to your left.

The huge oak tree actually grows out of the woodland behind the ridge, and just so happens to be the marker for Brockhall. After the break you took, your provisions that you received at Redwall are depleted, and night is falling. Ahead several lights shine through the trees, accompanying the sounds made only by several hundred vermin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You rub half-consciously at you ear, which still twinges every now and then from the whack you got earlier while marching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Looks like you were right, Aze -this is the place. Let's see what they have been up to while we were gone.\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emerging into the clearing, you all quickly cover your snouts. The unceremoniously heaped corpses of three adders are burning in the corner, just far enough away from the heavy undergrowth to avoid a forest fire, and putting up a smell every bit as horrible as the one they gave off in life. Next to them is a pile of what were likely the first unfortunate troops to enter the hall after you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In the clearing proper, several dozen soldiers of various species sit around random campfires, eating a meagre supper. Across the way stands a partially completed palisade that looks like it will soon ring the area around the front entrance, with a counterpart jutting from the opposite side of the entrance,  near to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The front door in question is packed with more vermin hurrying in and out, carrying supplies, weapons, plunder, furniture, and other items both ways. Cluny and most of the other officers aren't to be found, with the exception of a few calling orders, but not at nearly as high a tempo as when you were forming up for  marching earlier .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you eagerly step out into the open, a gruff voice calls out from the right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ahoy! You three! Stop and be counted!\" A rat with an spear marches up, looking you all up and down, muttering to himself. \"Looks like a group of lazies who snuck off when we were cleaning out the hall and buildin' that fence. Probably didn't wanna do anything dang'rous or hard. Rotten wibbles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In answer, Addon steps forward indignantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey! We're scouts who had to go in that there hole first and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Than what you doing up here? The hall's back there. Underground. Or didn't you notice?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was gonna say that! We were sent in first, and those serpents attacked us. They got two of us, and we barely escaped with out tails.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Un-hunh. And I thought ol' Scrap-ears and those stories of his about giant spiders with stingers like bees that live a thousand leagues southwards was crazy. You're prob'ly nothing but a group of short-term deserters who ran off when the Chief told us to charge, and came back when we was getting de loot together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, where's the Chief? He's gotta know how we 'scaped. There's a secret tunnel!\" Says Grigtail, leaning forward on his scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"In the main chamber. Hunh, I'll bet you got out by sprouting wings and flying to through the ground. Runs off when there's fightin\u2019 to be doin\u2018, and then come back and tell a pack o' lies to a dedicated patroller. Hunh, I'll take you to the Chief all right! Foller' me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You all trade a mixture of irate and slightly worried glances. In retrospect, the idea that you had simply run away for a few hours when you had been ordered into battle seemed a lot more likely than you had gone in and then come crashing out of the bushes several hours later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No one would know you weren't lying, at least not completely, unless they had watched you go in earlier, or found Jubbra\u2019s body. Which was probably guttering out right in the fire over yonder. He would have been assumed to be a casualty of the vermin\u2019s later attack on the snake den.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hopefully the Warlord would at least let you show him the tunnel before passing judgement. Hopefully he wouldn't have anything better to do than listen to what simply appeared to be a group of yellow-bellies explaining themselves.  </span></div></div>",

It looks vastly different now-apparently even a marauding mob of vermin makes for a better caretaker than a group of snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Lanterns, candles, and torches are now scattered about. Already, many of the cobwebs have been swept away, and a few vermin are busy cutting back the encroaching roots. The main tunnel you had entered into earlier and only seen the opening segments of seems a lot smaller now that it's well lit.  Soon it opens into a large central chamber, with half a dozen or so other doors and tunnels leading off of it in a rough elliptical pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A huge wooden column, which you realize in shock must be the huge old oak-tree\u2019s tap-root, penetrates through the ceiling in the middle of the room, the lower reaches carefully carved into the shape of a massive throne. Although probably built for a giant badger lord, Cluny is big enough to look like it was made for him specifically, reclining there with his dreadful horned helm in one claw and an ornately decorated wooden goblet in the other. Aids, officers, and guards surround him, conferring with him constantly. before you get around to noticing that, however, both you and your companion's eye flick to the sizable pile of treasure lying before the Warlord, ranging form valuable weapons that must have lain stored in the depths of the hall for ages to fine silverware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 After a few minutes, the sentry is able to come to Cluny's attention, saluting with his spear. \"Chief, I found these three slackers trying to sneak back into camp a few minutes ago. They keeps making up stories, sayin' that they scouted out the place and found some 'secret tunnel'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Cluny sits up straighter, looking almost surprisingly interested. \u201cDid they now?\" He looks past the rat, directly at the four of you. \"If you're lying, you'll all be lucky to be dead beasts by this time next season. But even an atypically stupid soldier wouldn't try to come back if they'd ignored orders from one of my officers. It seems I have nothing to lose but much to gain from determining if you're telling the truth. Now, show me where this tunnel is.\" He rises, motioning you to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The obviously surprised sentry paws at his spear irately. \"But chief, they're just desertin\u2019 cowards, they only- Youch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He yelps as Cluny's tail slaps him across the snout. \"Quiet, fool. You are dismissed. Now, return to your post.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You lead the Warlord back the way you came, into the side chamber. Cluny doesn't ask for any guards to accompany him, or for you to put down your weapons; completely confident in his ability to kill the four of you bear-pawed should you try something before he can pass judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Like the rest of the place, the chamber looks vastly different from the first time you scrambled through it. Torches now stick from the walls over bags of supplies, and vermin sit on the various low rock ledges, resting, talking, and squabbling after a long day. They all leap to their paws when Cluny comes in, before he absentmindedly waves them back to ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"It's back here your honor, behind this rocky bulge-ish thing.\" Stammers Grigtail. He glances at you, Addon, and Aze for a moment, then walks into the rock wall and abruptly disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Warlord cocks an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a narrow liddle crevice, see, sir and-.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCluny steps forward, feeling the wall carefully. Eventually, his right paw plunges into the hidden portal, and, with a gasp, he steps around it and squeezes into the opening.  You wait expectantly, ignoring the intrigued glances that several of the other vermin occasionally shoot your way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 After a few seconds, Cluny materializes in front of you, making you all jump reflexively. Beckoning you closer into the hollow, he whispers: \"You did well, boyos. Our enemies would have a great way to sneak on us if they had found out-and somehow, they <i>always</i> find out about such things. Now, where does this lead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In turn, you explain the rout if follows, Cluny questioning and listening to you intently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Very good. Several officers were killed while cleaning out this dump, and some more recruits were rounded up from the woodlands today. I'll need somebody useful to keep a weather eye on them.\" He reaches into a deep pocket and produces a quartet of iron symbols; a single blazing eye coiled about by a bladed rat tail. \"Congratulations; you've all been promoted to Under-Captains. Stake out some ledges in here, and report to Captain Mangetail tomorrow.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He stalks off, leaving you to stare at each other in breathless excitement. </span></div></div>",

As Grig was in the group of pole-arm carriers ordered to advance first, he cautiously moves back up to the entrance, poking his scythe downwards wearily. \"Now git down that ladder and wait for the rest of us.\" Says the officious weasel, giving him a little shove before starting after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both vermin quickly descend into the gloom created by the dimming torches, followed by a succession of other soldiers. After a half dozen or so have reluctantly vanished from sight, urged on by a cadre of threats and insults from the watching Cluny, you once again make the climb, keeping a hand on your axe the whole way down. Fresh torches lit by the small, slowly milling crowd light up the decrepit room, illuminating the various piles of refuse and detritus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The commander stands at the front, sniffing in the choking air and apparently waiting for a greater build up of armed beasts behind him before advancing. \"Keep a weather eye out, boys.

He drops his armament to the side with a clatter, takes the top box from the stack, and begins trying to force it open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hullo? I think I found some treasure, mates! 'Ere, help me with these 'ere boxes and-\" With a crashing of chests and the yelps of surprised warriors, the pile explodes outwards with staggering power. The unlucky ferret is sent flying back under the force- and snatched from the air by the first mouth of the three headed monstrosity now towering before you all. Torchlight dances and writhes on the squirming primal scales, throwing horrible shadows against the walls and making the monster's great crown glow as if made of fire bound in a rictus.         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Zassalissss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Harssacssss!\" It snarls as it comes crashing towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yells fill the chamber, reverberating and rebounding as vermin stumble back or charge forward, dropping blazing torches and tripping up in confusion. You are knocked to the ground as someone collides with you, Grigtail yelling and falling back and landing atop as a fallen light singes his foot. The creature hurls the limp body of the torn ferret into the throng, bowling rows of beasts over like ninepins as it rears back to strike at the scurrying mob and following up with the battering rams of its blunt snouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vermin cower and fall back in disorder, cursing and brandishing arms as their fellows press them back from the fight, or dropping their weapons and scratching at the earthy back wall, the twisting folds of reptilian flesh rapidly battering those in foreranks senseless. Some attempt to climb back up the ladder, obstructing the reinforcements trying to reach the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And both Zassaliss and Harssacss continue to lunge forward, spade-shaped heads darting around slashing halberds and swung picks to gouge furred bodies. Both heads pull back as fast as they hit, letting the unspeakable poison do its work whilst they select fresh victims in the melee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Contrary to the chaos, the weasel officer had leapt forward fearlessly at the creature's sudden appearance, ducking narrowly under the flying body of the ferret as it blew a hole in the ranks behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Blood n' booty!\" His falchion cuts into the base of the serpent's broad trunk as it rears to attack the hordebeasts once more, spattering the walls with cold blood. It hisses and pulls back, dragging it's siblings with it and throwing off Harssacss aim as he nips at a rat staggering blindly across his path. The head which had first killed the ferret and thus far held back slashes across at the weasel too close inside the reach of her brothers -only to be unexpectedly rebuked by a volley of sling-stones fired from the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You scramble to your paws as the head on your left -Harssasss, if you remember correctly- lungs forward yet again, engulfing the entire forequarters of an unlucky stoat. A javelin hurled from the rear of the group pierces it's throat, and it releases its' doomed catch, rattling its belated last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And still the weasel in the center of the throng presses on, hacking and stabbing, forcing the two adders back in their struggle to bring their fangs to bear on him. Stones and other missiles pour from the doorway above at the foe, and the vermin, seeing the monster in retreat, slowly rally and charge, trampling and elbowing the afraid and injured, bringing their weapons to the fray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Under the ever growing momentum, the mighty reptiles are pushed back into the main cave, hissing and spitting venom all the while, where the vermin can surround them and hit them from all sides.  Desperately wounded, with Harssacss dead and all escape cut off, the remaining duo fight on in a rage, thrashing and swaying, growing more ferocious and reckless as death steadily nears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You manage to crawl to the edge of the passageway and catch a breather, narrowly escaping being trampled under foot by your comrades, before being swept along in the crush.

The air is knocked from you as you roll down the staircase into the gloom. Grigtail staggers groggily to his feet, holding his scythe up in the direction of the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, in here! It's the Taggerung!\" Yells somebody from above, as a terrified group of vermin spill down the stairs. Having regained his javelin, which he wields in one paw with the dagger in the other, the otter leaps down the stairs, landing in the midst of the group like a spiked bowling ball, laying about with both weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A mushroom cloud of dust rises up with the impact, further hampering your ability to breath as you scrabble away.

A ferret attempts to climb the stairs out, only to be knocked senseless by the otter's thick tail. A burly stoat swings desperately at him with a club, and is truck three times in vital areas without coming close to landing the blow. Three rats throw down their weapons and flee down the tunnel, one taking the knife square in the back of his head. The two others don't make it far; with a sound more like a roar than a hiss, a roiling mass of reptilian coils boils into the chamber, running the two rats down and advancing like a hurricane-driven thunderhead toward the mass of bodies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Having run out of standing enemies-all the vermin either knocked unconscious, slain, or to injured to move- the 'Taggerung', eyes suffused with blood, bellows primally and charges to meet the serpents, broken spear-shaft raised high. He disappears into the mass, wrapping around the central coil and biting down at the back of the serpent\u2019s neck, stabbing it in the throat with his shattered weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Realizing that this is your one chance as the two titans crash together in the tunnel, you scramble up the stairs yet again, this time on all fours. Outside, the battle had died down slightly in this region, with only the strongest combatants now facing off over a field of bodies and an ocean of gore. You pick yourself up to all fours and run on as a weasel you had heard Cluny address as Scragg and two squirrels crash into the bushes next to you, all having lost their weapons and now clawing at the others with their bare paws. Having been half blinded by a swipe from the squirrel\u2019s claws, Scragg sets his teeth to one\u2019s throat, while the other batters away at his head in an attempt to break his stranglehold. Behind you, the squirrel picks up a dagger blade minus a hilt and stabs Scragg through his remaining eye, forcing him to finally pull back, taking the other squirrel\u2019s neck with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you run on, dodging enemies and dueling creatures, looking for a place to sit out the storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A beech tree towers ahead, its' root network having grown over a large hollow, and sliding down, you dive by a small pile of vermin bodies bearing the marks of shrew rapiers and worm your way into the cover. Crouching there, you almost absentmindedly realize that you've lost your axe, as you listen for sounds of a party of woodlanders or vermin. After a short time, your adrenaline ebbs, and the sights of countless grotesquely mutilated creatures screaming and swaying, as well as your various close calls with death in the past few moments, catches up with you, and you slowly drift asleep...</span></div></div>",

The scent of blood hangs thick on the air, along with the other hideous smells accompanying any battlefield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell's gates.\" You breathe, feeling like you might be sick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.

Last I saw you, we were both trapped in a hole with a Taggerung and those snakes going at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same ways as yew. I was right on your tail when you bolted, but a got clipped in the 'ead by some big old hare with a broadsword coming out. Lucky it was at an angle, so I didn't spill out my braincase, but it knocked me out of it fer a while. I went down like an anchor and fell in some bushes. Nobody paid me much heed, but there's still some shrews nearby. They were left to put out the fire some idjit started, when the woodlanders arrived. The rest all went off after Cluny; he's gonna be in trouble right now, if not dead already. We got routed good on this one. But I think that they're starting to file back in to see to their dead, which is why I wanted to get out of  here.. Anyhow, I picked myself up a little while ago, and started looking around fer loot and stuff, and that's how I found you. I'm thirsty as a jirbilrat, and there's a river not far from here.

About to follow him through a gap in the otherwise dense forest, you trip over something hard and cold. Looking down, you notice a curved sword lying ownerless on the ground, arcing blade stained red. Inspecting it, you see that the blade is well-looked after and free of burrs, and the pommel is neatly carved into the shape of a howling wolf's head. Searching through the undergrowth, you manage to find a matching leather scabbard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahoy? You coming mate?\" Grigtail calls from ahead, and you wipe the sword of on some ferns before slipping it into the sheath and hurrying after the weasel.                 </span></div></div>",

The red sun is long hidden by the great trees on either side, but it's last lengthy rays blaze powerfully through the wood pillars, colliding and silhouetting the dust clouds as they signal the crickets to begin their nocturnal chorus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what 'appened back there? How'd your lot know when to hit ours'?\" Asks Grigtail, as the silence between you all lengthens like the shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another traitor in your ranks, I suppose. Wouldn't be a big flippin' big surprise, wot? I heard somethin' about the higher ups on our side of the line mentioning that that Damug Warfang beast had sent 'em an envoy or some such sort, and the bloke told them that Cluny would be passing through here trying to cause havoc, and had asked Damug to bring his boys along to make life harder for us when we went to put 'em down. Damug refused him sharpish and told us about it, something 'bout hating Cluny more than us, wot, or so I heard before I had an encounter with some Juska, and got sent to the Far North.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferret nodded sagely, adjusting his scythe for a more comfortable position. \"Must've been a Tuesday. Warfang's been crazier than two score mad frogs in a hole since the last time Rose Eyes done piked him. Nasty way to go it was for him, bein' skewed on an axe-pike. \"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"<i>Lady</i> Crega Rose Eyes, doncha know! And did yu' ever see what happened to her after she charged Kharanjul's horde six seasons back in the deep south?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if'n there was e'er something that could stand up to a mad badger, it'd be dem wearets; they could fight with the best at the worst of times. How'd it go on her?\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling strangely out of touch as the two go on to half argue, half brag about their alignments exploits in some battle or other, you glance over into the gloom stretching off to either side of your way, the sun having reluctantly gone to it's bed some time ago. A faint, faerie glimmer in the depths of the foliage snags your gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hay, what's that over there?\" You say, gesturing with the blade of your sword.   <br>\r\n         <br>\r\nPenny stops short and follows your pointing weapon. After a few moments of consideration, \"Probably some beast havin' a little campfire, wot. Redwall's still a long way's off; let's go ask if they got any spare grub for some poor exhausted travelers.\" She says, starting eagerly into the brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold-up, mates. I don't smell any wood-smoke here... But there is something like rotted eggs when the wind blows right. Ah don't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know what kind of scoff smells like that, but I bet it's good. I can just picture it now; a little family of mice or voles or other travelers or some such, a nice cozy camp, and all kinds of delicious grub set out and toasty warm. Pasties and cheese sconce and flans and whatnot.  C'mon now, sharpish, or I won't be savin' any for you!\" She says, moving eagerly off the path. You and Grigtail exchange glances before following the hare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnused to your new senses, you wouldn't have noticed the absence of smoke on a still night such as this, but decide to differ to the ferret's judgement. And something doesn't feel right; the sensation is repetitively similar to the advance into Brockhall earlier, but without the bad smell. To boot, the mysterious light doesn't seem to be getting any larger as you all advance, tripping and stumbling in the dark. It just sits at eye-level, twinkling and glimmering strangely, too far off in the dense vegetation to be easily made out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny maintains a personal commentary of the various varieties of 'scoff' awaiting you, the quiet sounds and Grigtail's muffled curses as he stumbles into the odd branch or shrub in the gloom the only noises. Even the crickets and night-birds have gone silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis occurs to you as queer just as Grigtail, close by to you right, yells something panicked and indecipherable. <br>\r\n\"Grig? What happened? Grig?!\" You call, hearing Penny crashing through the brush towards the shout. You step forward, and the ground seems to chuckle maliciously with almost sentient cruelty, sucking greedily at your paws as you begin sinking. You leap backwards again to solid ground, Penny calling out from somewhere near by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out; it's a swamp-Unggh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light, now with nearly half a dozen copies of itself floating eerily about in the air, suddenly materializes next to you. Something strikes you in the back of the head, and you lash out reflexively with your sword as you tumble to the side. An outraged hissing sound fills the air- and you are hit again, flopping limply to the mud.               </span></div></div>",

Then, you heard the cawing, and the hissing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you opened your eyes, you saw that you were in some kind of cavern. All around you was a number of carrion birds; crows, raven, jackdaws and more, as well a a number of smooth and grass snakes, as well as frogs and toads.  You also saw that your left limbs were tied to a post, and those of your right were tied to another. \"This is just great,\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At last you're finally awake,\" said a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were giving us a worry,\" said another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to your left, and then to your right.

You turned your head towards her, and saw the boiling lake. \"Or they might have hare, rat, and weasel stew, singly or mixed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why haven't the Redwallers taken care of them?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrigtail chuckled. \"Because vermin and carrion, and others, have the right to live where they want, so long as they don't cause too much trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we'll be saved?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doubt it,\" Penny said. \"So far as I know, the Doomwyte flock hasn't started a War; either they'll cut as down and play Host, giving us food and such, or they'll have us tossed into that lake so that they have something to eat, potentially having us tell whomever we see in the Next life that they are on the Warpath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard a strange drumming sound, and all three of you looked to see a large raven approaching.

You grumpily wonder how far it is to the Hall as the ferret behind you treads on your heel, causing you to stumble and nearly skewer yourself on your weapon.

Now, you can hear a boisterous marching song booming out, accompanied by drums. Your curiosity piques as the marchers come around a bend, abruptly ceasing their march as they see the barbarous mob of vermin arrayed in their route. Line upon line of smartly-tunicked, well armed, and impeccably assembled hares stare at you, though it is the figure of the massive badger standing at the front that draws your attention. Wearing a long, forest green tunic and brown belt, he is unarmored. Whispering out of the corner of his mouth to an older hare with a handlebar mustache, he slowly reaches up and removes something from a sheath on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 'Sword' would be an accurate name for it, though it doesn't seem to do justice to the gargantuan slab of sharpened metal he now holds in two massive, scarred paws. All around you, vermin curse hatefully, shifting nervously at the sight of the armed hares, who could only be the famous Long Patrol of the exotic seas-side fort Salamandastron. \"Old Lord Brocktree!\" Gasps Grigtail nervously, fur standing on end. Ahead, the hares have begun to shift themselves, broadening their formation on to the flatlands, lowering pikes, stringing bows, and unsheathing a variety of fine blades. Behind, the officers break up their talk, issuing orders.</span></div></div>",

When BJ was done, the kid said something to the remark that, 'If Heaven is anything like Redwall, I wouldn't mind going.' I guess the Big Guy up there liked the story Himself, and created this world for him. At first it was just those from the first book who resided here, along with those who had no names, plus the kid- he's a fat little dormouse by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by 'no names'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those who exist but don't have a name- the random rat or mouse or whatever that existed in the book and was mentioned briefly. After all, most of Cluny's Horde were not named, same with others,\" Grigtail said, taking a bite of his cheese. \"Of course, as BJ made more books, more True Characters came to reside here. After a while, so did fans who had died- illness, accident, whatever it was that took their lives. Well, some of these fans had made their own stories while they were living, and wanted their characters with them. Well, the Powers that Be granted their wish, but the guy didn't stop there; and any character that was in a Redwall story created by a fan ended up here. So, you've got three groups- True Characters, which were created by BJ, Fanfic Characters, those created by Fans, and Dead Fans, those whose souls have crossed over, and were placed here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds a little tricky to remember all that,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrigtail shook his head, and chuckled. \"Not really.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some hours later, you were walking around the inside of the mountain. The hares who lived there were really nice, and you were starting to notice certain differences between them. Some were easily recognizable, such as the dark furred Rake Nightfur, monocle wearing Pergord Habile Sinistra, and you were sure you'd seen the odd-looking Cuthbert Frunk. Others however, were not so easy to recognize, as they'd only been minor characters. Then, there were those you'd never read about- these were the Fanfics that Grigtail had told you about. Then there were some others- their eyes were not like those of the others, they were more human-like. These had to be the Dead Fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually made it back outside, where you saw Grigtail. The weasel was sitting on a rock, gazing out to sea, where hares were still pulling people out of the water, and sending them towards the tables, which were still loaded with food, and fresh stuff coming out at regular intervals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you and smiles. \"Lovely sunset,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" you said as you sat next to him. \"Hard to believe that in a few days we'll be separated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrigtail just grinned. \"There's always the next life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just chuckle at this. \"I guess there is that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked back out to sea. \"Tell me, what it painful when you died?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you died in the Real World, was it painful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the sand. \"I think I was hit by a car. I had just bought the last book I needed to complete my collection when BAM! I just felt this pain all over my body. Next thing I knew, I was in the water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did it happen to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few days before we first met,\" you said. \"I was taken to Redwall, and a few days later, they gave me a sack of food and drink, and told me that I had to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That always happens,\" Grigtail said with a chuckle. \"And don't worry, it's not just vermin they do it with, same with this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you ask. \"Do they try to keep the numbers of guests down so that they have food for others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only partially true- but it's more to get us acclimated to living again, and to make sure that our energy is at its maximum before we leave,\"  Grigtail said. \"In truth, you don't need food or drink to live in this world, but having some makes moving possible, and easier for healing purposes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that a pack of desert rats had me tied between two dead trees, hanging me upside-down,\" Grigtail said. \"I was stuck that way for two seasons at the least, without a drop of water passing my lips, as they left me, after taking my supplies. Let's just say that I was glad when a passing adder decided to take me for its meal. First thing I had when I came out of the river was water, and I mean straight from the river- lowered it by a paw's length, or so some have told me.\" He chuckled at this. \"It was like liquid gold. And the food afterwards, even the simple breads and cheeses, I ate them so slowly, a certain hare named Stag asked me if I was ever going to finish the rest of my plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then fell silent, his eyes turned to watching the sea once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look towards where he was gazing, at the revivers, as they were called. \"Are you waiting for someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"My creator- he's got a childhood form of Leukemia- terminal. He'll be here shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel it,\" he said. \"I can feel him breathing, trying to get oxygen to his blood, his heart trying to pump the blood to his body, and I can hear his mother finishing his favorite book- <i>Mattimoe</i>- he just loves that story.\" He then looked at you and said, \"Hold onto me, please.\" He then wrapped his arms around you. \"Just hold onto me, please. This is going to hurt me a great deal- I've seen it happen before to others, and they were in pain for days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was it?\" you asked, as you held the weasel in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the True Characters, all of them,\" the weasel said. \"They were in the midst of a battle when BJ had his heart attack- they had to hold onto each other- Maitthis held onto Cluny, Martin held Badrang, and others also held onto their rivals, all to stay on their feet.\" The weasel began to convulse violently, as if he was having some sort of epileptic seizure. His claws began to rake your back, and he began to hit you with his head, but you held onto him. When it was over, he just went limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?' you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be alright,\" he said trying to get his breath. \"But he's here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where he is?\" you asked. \"I'll take you to them if you want some help getting there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrigtail pointed...</span></div></div>",

This world is an extension of the books- what happened in them tends to happen here. This even applies to buildings- take Saint Ninian's Church for instance- In most stories set before <i>Redwall</i>, honest creatures tried to live there. In those after <i>Redall</i>, vermin gangs reside there, and it was burned down at a certain point. Now, I'm sure you know that Gonff and his family lived there, as did the Churchmice family- when they wish to reside there, it will look much the way it was for them, a cozy place. When Cluny is on the warpath, he'll make a base near there, and it will look much the way it did for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Redwall?\" you ask. \"At one point, Kotir was in that very location. Also, when Kotir was ruled by the Greeneyes family, the woodlanders lived at Brockhall, but later serpents lived there, and even later, Vilaya ruled her army from there. How do you explain that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny chuckled again. \"Truth be told, it all depends on who's on the Warpath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the most part, most of the vermin, including Cluny himself, coexist with the rest in piece- Ungatt Trunn and Lord Brocktree actually like to spar in the evenings on the landward side of the mountain,\" said Penny. \"It's fairly easy to get along with them actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said it was difficult for True Characters to get along with those on the other side,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you get along with your siblings?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the same with those created by the same person here,\" Penny said. \"My one Sibling, I guess you could say, is a white fox in the service of Gulo the Savage- a Fanfic much like myself. We <i>don't</i> get along at all. Of course, Gulo's always on the Warpath- thinks more with the stomach than his brainbox- and he killed both of us on that occasion. Like I told you, Savage fits him perfectly. Even adders are more friendly than he is, providing that you keep your distance of course- they will eat you if they are hungry enough, and you are within their reach- nothing personal, just business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a pool of water in the one sandstone quarry to the northeast of here,\" Penny said. \"Adders reside there, but Revivers do end up there at times- been there myself. For three days, an individual adder will seek out food for you, and make sure that you get the fruits and berries, and other such things you eat. After that third day though, you'd best get out of the quarry, for they will chase you out, and if you don't get out, they will catch you, and eat you, for they will have gone without food until then. For the most part though, they eat fish, or those who should of died otherwise- let's just say that having your neck caught in a noose isn't fun- makes seeing an adder a welcome sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait- Grigtail told me he starved for two seasons before an adder ate him,\" you said. \"But when our throats were slit, we died fairly quickly. How does that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If something doesn't kill you right away, you won't die,\" said Penny. \"When I was hung by a group of Juskas on the Warpath, my neck wasn't broken, which would have killed me. Instead I was being strangled- you don't need oxygen to live here, but it is nice to breathe. Be in that position a few days, and you're glad to see an adder slithering along the path, and a hungry one at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mentioned something about 'on the Warpath'. What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vermin get bored from time to time,\" Penny said with a smile. \"As do many others. When that happens, vermin like to get their arms and armor, seek out others of like mind, and purposefully cause trouble for others- telling those they kill to tell people that they are on the Warpath- and bored Warriors and Worthies pick up their weapons and go after them. Eventually, there's a grand old fight, Good Creatures win, Evil ones lose, it's all in fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all in fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the exception of Gulo- he's something else altogether. Others War because they get bored as I told you,\" said Penny. \"Gulo though, he wants as much food as he can get- everyone else. As it is, he's currently holding Brian Jacques captive in the Far North.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Fanfic, like myself, is at full power only if their Creator is alive, or if they've met up with them after they've come here,\" Penny said. \"Since BJ died, most of the True Ones have been at a quarter of their true strength. The only exceptions are the few who have ended up in the Far North, and found themselves in Gulo's clutches, in his base. One of them actually encountered an old mouse chained up in a cell there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is there a plan to rescue him?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny turned to you and...</span></div></div>",

Gulo has sixteen Named foxes and ermines, and around eighty Unnamed Ones, or at least that's the number he should have.

Next thing you know, ten others just show up, and clobber you to the point that you end up in the water instead of your foe. That's what could happen- we could be on the verge of victory, when over a thousand fresh foes show up, and Evil wins instead of Good. Those Unnamed Ones mean everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that would be a worry,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, Cluny and the others have been helping us learn new tactics, new fighting methods, and they wish to fight alongside of us during the coming War against Gulo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New tactics and methods?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different formations take some getting used to,\" Penny said. \"Not to mention unarmed combat- can't just rely on boxing and fisticuffs for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The True Characters are learning from us Fanfics and you Dead Fans,\" Penny said. \"You Dead Fans have your knowledge from the world of the Living, and Fanfics like me learn when our Creators do something Redwall related.

You carefully touch the headstone, brushing off some of the grass stains and a few dirt clods that had landed on it since your last visit to the grave the previous month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the woman behind you. \"We can go now mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother smiles, and begins to push your chair towards the car. You stick your hand in the pouch at your side, and pull out the book you'd gotten- it was <i>Mattimeo</i>. The covers on your old one had been torn off. This book though, it was covered in blood, your blood. You open it up, and look at the last page, and read the last paragraph-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"> <i>\"May your lives be as full and happy as ours, and may the seasons be kind to you and your friends. The door of our Abbey is always open to any traveller roaming the dusty path between the woodlands and the plains.\"</i> </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear comes to your eye- Grigtail had mentioned that it had been his creator's favorite book. Then you noticed a funeral procession. There was a woman there with a small pet carrier in her arms. As you drew closer, you noticed that the creature in it was a weasel, one that looked familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grigtail,\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at you at the mention of the name. \"How'd you know his name?\" she asked. \"Most people can't even pronounce it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your book, and looked back at her. \"Let's just say that your son saved my life,\" you said. \"Helped me realize it wasn't my time yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 Years later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter publishing your first book, <i>Journey though Animal Spirits</i> you managed to become highly popular among fantasy readers. Currently, you are on a tour through Liverpool. As you operate your moterchair, you notice a sign on the mailbox in front of you- <i>Jacques</i>. You turn your head and look at the home it's for. A sign says \"Museum of Brian Jacques: Creator of Redwall.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well pay a visit,\" you say as you go up the handicap ramp. After paying the admittance fee, you wheel through the building, stopping in each of the rooms. Eventually, you stopped at the room Brian himself wrote his stories in. You put your hand in the pouch on the side of the moterchair. Two books are in it, the one you'd written, and the one you'd bought ten years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you finding everything alright?\" a voice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head and notice one of the guides. \"Um yes, where can one leave a donation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of donation are you talking about?\" the guide asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out the blood-stained book. \"This saved my life some years ago when I was in a bad accident.

Open your mouth, see the sharp teeth inside, the little tongue. Pull faces, watching the reflection mimic every one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's me. That's actually me. I'm a rat?</i> A jolt courses through, a sick, anxious feeling in the pit of your stomach. <i>I look like the pet rat I had from when I was seven.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking, you hand the mirror back to Sister Buttercup. \"Thank you.\" Your voice sounds strange in your own throat, higher pitched from the shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Sister Buttercup tries a look of concern, but distaste shows on her slender mouse features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in Redwall ...\" You give yourself a quick pinch, just to make sure you were not dreaming. Redwall. Your favorite series of books, an Abbey set in the middle of Mossflower Woods, a sanctuary to woodland animals. If this was a dream, it was wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm in Redwall, and I'm a rat.</i> Instantly, your stomach plummets again. A rat. A vermin. A member of the bad species, hated by the peaceful dwelling inhabitants of Redwall. Small wonder, when rats enjoyed plunder, murder, and conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou always used to think it was a shame, how the bad ones were always bad, and the good ones always good. Blaggut was always your favorite rat character in the books, the only decent one in the whole series, but only because he was too stupid to truly be bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still feel like yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you could be the first good female rat. Sister Buttercup asks again if you're okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. Thank you for accepting me into your Abbey.\" You smile, making it as gentle as you can, lips closed. Your sharp teeth might otherwise alarm the tiny mouse in front. \"I know what I look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Sister Buttercup nods, terse. \"There's soup on the way, if you're hungry. And Martin would like to see you later, once you're recovered. Do you remember him, from earlier? He helped you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, suppressing the squeal on your lips. <i>Martin the freaking Warrior? Oh hell yes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you do.\" Sister Buttercup smiles, seeing some of your enthusiasm. The infirmary door opens, and a squirrel wearing a brown habit steps in, a steaming bowl of stew clutched between their paws.</span></div></div>",

It is as if finally seeing yourself gives the boost needed, the last tip into that darkness writhing inside. Memories - what were memories? They faded. They became fuzzy, unclear. Insignificant. You take in your new features with relish. Creamy white with brown markings scattered over your sinuous, snake-like body. You especially enjoy how sharp your claws and teeth are. You hand the mirror back to Sister Buttercup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could snap her neck. Look at how small she is. How weak.</i> You toy with the idea as Sister Buttercup puts the mirror away, but decide against it. There is no benefit in killing the frail mouse. At least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know who your allies are yet, who you can join up with. Alone in an abbey surrounded by nauseatingly sweet creatures, you may as well be a prisoner. You just need to bide your time, see if the soft, fat pacifists in this place would be willing to house you, or force you on your way through Mossflower, once the injuries fully healed. Maybe then you could find other ferrets. Other vermin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile disarmingly at Sister Buttercup, smoothing your features. \"Thank you once again for taking me in, Sister. I will always be grateful for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Buttercup blinks, then nods, looking strangely nervous. \"Hum, yes. You're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a slight brush of cold, you pull the blankets more about yourself. Sister Buttercup sees the gesture, and very hesitantly places her paw over your forehead, testing the temperature. \"You might be coming down with a fever. Small wonder, if you were in that water for a while. Winter waters are a terrible thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes, giving a large, theatrical sigh. \"Eh, I'm sure I'll be fine.\" The cold would prolong your stay in the abbey for sure. Whether this is a good or bad thing, you don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one thing you did know. Sooner or later, this thirst for blood needs to be quenched.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Ever since you could remember, you enjoyed reading the \u201cTales of Redwall\u201d series. You loved reading about those heroic mice, and their friends, as they fought against those villainous rats, and their ilk. You cheered the heroes, Martin, Gonff, Matthias, and the other brave ones. You booed the villains, Badrang, Cluny, Slagar, and the other evil doers. You wailed at the deaths of Rose, Father Mortimer, and the others who gave their lives to protect the good people. Then, you were saddened to hear about the death of the Author and creator, Brian Jacques, just as his last book was published. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne dark and rainy evening, you managed to purchase the book that you needed to complete your collection of Redwall novels. However, on your way home there was an accident, with you being one of those in serious condition. Your hands are locked in Death\u2019s grip on the book, as if it\u2019s all that\u2019s keeping you alive. Your physical body is attached to numerous machines, trying to keep you stabilized, while you remain in a coma. Your mind however, is in Mossflower Woods, near Redwall Abbey. Will you survive, and go back to the land of the living, or will you make the choice to stay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tAnyone and everyone from any and every Redwall book could show up. This means that Heroes, such as Martin and Matthias and other good people, will come to help you, while Villains, such as Cluny and Badrang and other evil ones, will be out to try and do you harm, in one way or another. Also, original characters are allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.\tDeath is not permanent. If someone in Mossflower, or the area around it, dies, they will come back after a time. (Similar to Riverworld) They will come back to life along the waterways, rivers, streams, ocean, sea, or on occasion, the Abbey pond, and they will be at their most physically fit age.  For the most part, they will be given clothing, similar to those which they wore in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.\tThe characters can heal up from any wound that is non-fatal, though some will wear things that make them recognizable to others, such as Cluny\u2019s use of his signature eyepatch. Thus, if one is to remove them, one must give them a \u201cfatal\u201d injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.\tShould you \u201cdie\u201d, there will be some problems for your body in the real world, mainly in the fact that you\u2019ll be in the coma longer. So, try to not \u201cdie\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.\tSpelling and Grammar are a must, though if you try to do molespeech, or the speech of any who have an accent, some leeway will be given, but there is one thing: do it right or don\u2019t do it at all. If you can\u2019t do the accent, don\u2019t even attempt. Nothing ruins a mole speech like a mole who can\u2019t speak molespeech right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.\tLeadership of the peoples is interesting. Given the fact that there are many Abbots and Abbesses who have lead Redwall, from Abbess Germaine to Abbot Thibb, and many Badger Lords who have lead Salamandastron, from long before Lord Stonepaw to Lady Violet Wildstripe, whenever something important comes up, such as a vermin attack, the various Abbots and Abbesses, or Badger Lords, will talk among themselves before coming to a decision, at which point they will pick a speaker to talk to those under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.\t Similarly, The Warriors of Redwall, who were chosen carriers of the Sword of Martin, from Martin the Warrior on down to Uggo Wiltud, tend to be in charge of the defense of the Abbey, and a leader will be chosen among them in the case of attack, and that one will be given the Sword, though if the foe is the enemy of a certain Warrior, that one will be given precedence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n8.\tAs for the Leaders of Vermin, from Ungatt Trunn on down to Razzid Wearat, each one has their own crew/horde. For the most part, the various Vermin tend to fight among themselves, with each Leader trying to control the land/sea for themselves. However, there are times when the Leaders join forces with each other, so that they can accomplish a common goal, such as to conquer Redwall or Salamandstron or wherever, but each one will scheme and plot behind the others backs, in order to take over the Horde for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9.\tThe Goodies tend to be mice, hares, moles, voles, shrews, otters, badgers, squirrels, hedgehogs, and some birds. *Note* There have been more than a few, who, due to how they were treated by others, insanity, or some other reason, who were not helpful, and would mistreat, or even kill, others. Examples include Skan, a shrew, Druwp, a vole, Tugga Bruster, a shrew (and Log-a-Log), and a few others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10.\tThe Baddies tend to be rats, ferrets, weasels, stoats, foxes, wildcats (or feral cats), wolverines, (which are thankfully rare), ermines, martens, polecats, and some birds. *Note* There have been a few who were actually good, or helped them out. Examples include Gingivere Greeneyes (and his wife and his distant descendant, Squire Julian Gingivere), wild/feral cats, Blaggut, searat, and a couple of others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11.\tYour species is something of a quandary. Are you still human or have you turned into something that would live in Mossflower, or are you a changeling, with the ability to change your species depending on who, or what, is around you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. There are three groups of people- True Characters- those created by Brian Jacques, Fanfic- those made by Fans of the series (you can make them up), and finally Dead Fans- those whose souls have ended up in Mossflower instead of Regular Heaven. As for the creation of Mossflower- BJ read the first book to a kid dying of cancer. Kid said that he wished that Heaven was like Mossflower. Big Guy liked the story, and granted his wish. Since then, fans of the story ended up coming to Mossflower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. Sexual Orientation is up for Grabs- Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Straight- all are fine, but limit the romance to hugging and kissing, for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you wish for more information about Redwall, please see the following sites<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://redwall.wikia.com/wiki/Redwall_Wiki\" target=\"_blank\">http://redwall.wikia.com/wiki/Redwall_Wiki</a><br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwall\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwall</a><br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redwallabbey.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.redwallabbey.com/</a><br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.sullivanet.com/redwall/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sullivanet.com/redwall/</a></td>",
