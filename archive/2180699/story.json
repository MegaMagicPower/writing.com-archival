The U.S were furious and demanded them to stop, but they didn\u2019t. The U.S then felt that it\u2019s allies would need the robots to combat the Soviet Union if they attacked so they taught and funded both Great Britain and Japan to creat their version of robots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The year was now 2018, and since the dissolution of soviet, the tension went down but the foreign and domestic violence were feared so the country who acquired the robots put them on use for the purpose to fight the terrorists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You are one of the person who were promoted to be the pilot, but which country do you hail from? </span></div></div>",

You had always had the dream to be part of military since your grandfather was part of military. While you were looking over the privates drill the warrent officer came to you and you saluted to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSergeant major matsunaga, army general want to meet you.\u201d Officer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You went into the building and once you\u2019ve got to the top room you knocked the door and went in. You saw an middle aged man with military cloth on drinking some tea. His name was Satoshi Hinoue, the army general who stayed in the military for long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSir, you need to speak to me, sir?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, I have a business with you.\u201d  Satoshi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He got up and came to you. You rarely seen him as he always doing paper works and giving orders to others on the daily basis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI have been confirmed that you are now promoted to pilot the robots we operate.\u201d Satoshi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were very surprised to hear that as the training for being the pilot of the robot is very long. You wondered why this happened and asked him the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBut Sir, doesn\u2019t the pilot need extra training for being part of it?\u201d You\u2019ve asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, but I have no doubt that you have potential to be one.\u201d Satoshi said, \u201cI\u2019ll take you to the dock station now so let\u2019s go\u201d Satoshi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes sir.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You and Satoshi got out of the room and headed out. As you two got out of the building and got into the van and headed to the dock. It took an hour and you two were now at the dock and once you two got out and went toward the dock, many military officials saluted at Satoshi and once inside you were astonished to see a giant robot cyborgs standing at the dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSir, this is...\u201d you said in awe.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cThanks to the current technology, they became semi-auto who are self aware to our voices. I\u2019m fortunate enough to see the progress is ahead.\u201d Satoshi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then told you to pick the cyborg you wanted.

As you did, you\u2019ve gotten closer to the cyborg as it was a female cyborg and once you were next to her, Satoshi spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAre you operable, MKG-II? Answer me.\u201d Satoshi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cVoice understood. I am fully operable sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were amazed to hear the cyborg talk. He explained that she was semi-auto cyborg, an robot that could walk and fight, but it the power would be magnified if there was a pilot who wields them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMKG-II, I am issuing you an pilot that will maneuver your movement and the fighting, understood?\u201d Satoshi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, army-general Satoshi.\u201d She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then pushed you forward lightly and you were speechless for moment then you saluted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNice meeting you MKG-II, I am sergeant master Matsunaga Himeno, reporting as your pilot.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The cyborg then opened her eyes, showing an red mechanical iris and looked at you and saluted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGreetings, sergeant master Matsunaga. I do hope we can be a good partner.\u201d MKG-II responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then asked where the cockpit were until her chest area opened, revealing the cockpit for you. You were amazed to see this and Satoshi came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGet in and the officials shall tell you how to handle the cyborg.\u201d Satoshi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You went forward, then the floor went down to the reachable point and you went into the cockpit. The chest area closed and you saw the screenshot of the view MKG-II had. You were very amazed and then the small screen that had one of the officials on were showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlright sergeant master, first you must understand the basics. The handles you see before you is where the robot would run, turn, and other techniques.\u201d Officials said, \u201ctry it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded then suddenly you felt the little tremor. MKG-II started to walk as the strains were cut off. You got the handles and leaned forward, making her to run out the building. You were little scared from height but pushed aside then twisted little and pulled back, making the robot turn and slide back. You immediately fell in love with this piloting as you tested more, MKG-II continue to walk, run and more. After 20 minutes, live image of Satoshi came forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGood work on how to maneuver her, sergeant master. You\u2019re a quick learner.\u201d Satoshi praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThank you sir, my father always told me to learn much as possible.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnd your father is correct sergeant master. From today until the further notice you will have drills on how to maneuver MKG-II and using a weapon for her. After all, she\u2019s a walking tank and not to be toyed with.\u201d Satoshi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI understand sir.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Satoshi nodded and you training as the pilot have started...</span></div></div>",

You were truly a quick learner as you manage to understand more on maneuver the cyborg and use an long range weapons from cannons to sniper rifle that suits the robot. When you arrived at the location Satoshi ordered, he came and you saluted to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSergeant Master Matsunaga, You now have a duty to patrol these coast line since we got an disturbing message that North Korea might have launched an missle. If you detect one, shoot it down.\u201d Satoshi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n MKG-II then lowers herself and holded hand toward you. You hopped on and as she rose, the hatch opened and you got in and closed and started to patrol the area as Satoshi were waiting for the answer. 10 minutes passed and nothing happened until the robot detected something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSergeant Master, I have detected an ballistic missle flying over my radar.\u201d MKG-II said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLet\u2019s take it down.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUnderstood.\u201d MKG-II replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She took out an tank cannon and aimed. Her iris moved as inside the cockpit you looked at the signal then you\u2019ve got the lock on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cReady...aim..fire!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You pressed the button and MKG-II pulled the trigger, shooting a high grade bullet with speed and within moment you saw an explosion in the sky. You sigh in relief that it was done and then went back to Satoshi. Satoshi then used the portable tv and linked up so he could talk to you then inside, you saw him on the left side of the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHave you done the mission?\u201d Satoshi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes army general. I have destroyed the ballistic missle.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGood, we don\u2019t need any attack from our neighbors.\u201d Satoshi replied, \u201cpatrol more in case anything happen, and meet me back at the dock at 1300 hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSir, Yes sir.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then left the scene while you patrolled. As You patrolled, you wondered if you should learn more about the these robots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then..</span></div></div>",
