Smaller houses with large yards are distributed seemingly at random as far as the eye can see. Some larger, some smaller, though all seem homely and sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the west lies the mountain range, a richly forested area that offers the most beautiful nature your eyes will ever fall upon. Wild and deep forest lakes fill the center of what was once a volcano not too far from your house, but still far enough that it is abandoned most of the year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe start the story now, by looking down at the house you live in. A slightly large and well-kept building with a wide back yard and high ceilings in two floors. It was left to you by your parents when they decided on a spur to move abroad and leave you to your own devices. But you learn to survive on the savings they left you, the already paid off house, and your close friend, who now shares a cool evening with you on the couch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a strong build, and a tall stature - whereas your best friend is entirely the opposite. You've often been bashed around by the jocks at the college you both go to, for wanting to befriend someone so small in stature. And jokes about 'predator and prey' often arose when your back was turned. But you didn't care, you had found a true friend and you knew that differences between you was only a strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two characters we follow in this story are..</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you flip through a magazine, you can't help but watch your friend Kory out of the corner of your eye, as he continues to work on one of his sketches. It doesn't help that his long, fluffy tail keeps accidentally brushing against your leg (although, the more it happens, the less you think that it's accidental). You turn your head to the side slightly and make eye contact with him, and a gentle smile crosses your face. He beams back, full of confidence as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that innate confidence that first made you take notice of the svelte young Red Panda. You've known each other since the beginning of the semester, when he first appeared on campus along with the hundreds of other wide-eyed freshmen entering the wonderful, scary, and amazing freedom known as college. Unlike the others, though, Kory had an air around him like he belonged there, like he knew what he was doing and he was ready to take on the world, or at least the small part of it that Canstania College represented. When you first sat down next to him in the Student Union and struck up a conversation, he didn't seem at all intimidated by the fact that you were a junior, or that you stood nearly a foot and a half taller than him and outweighed him by a good hundred pounds of muscle. If anything, that seemed to make him even more intrigued by you, and the two of you struck up a fast friendship, which has only grown stronger over the past two months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you finally say just before the silent staring at each other began to get awkward, \"what's the plans for tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plans?\" Kory asks, shifting slightly in his seat. \"What plans do we need to make?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is the last night before you leave town and head back home. Shouldn't we do something... I dunno, special, or fun, or whatever.\" Your voice starts to trail off at the end, realizing that you don't really have any good ideas of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKory laughs a little as he sits up straight. \"Ash, I'll only be gone for the weekend. I'll be back Sunday night. It's not that big of a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess.\" You sigh, shaking your head. You feel a strong desire to let Kory know how much he means to you, how you want to take your relationship... further... but you can't find the right words to do it. For all your size and strength, this is the stuff that makes you the most uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what.\" Kory leans in a little closer to you, resting his paw on your shoulder. Your pants become a little tighter at this, but you try to hide your arousal, for now at least. \"It's nice and cool out. Let's go have a walk through Barlo Park and shuffle our paws through the leaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, you nod. \"Okay. That'll be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKory quickly hops off the couch and runs to the hall closet. Before you can even stand up, he's already back with both of your jackets, and he tosses yours to you as he puts his own on. \"C'mon! Time's wasting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the park only takes about ten minutes, and when you get there, you're surprised by how empty it is, especially for a Friday evening. Usually, couples and families would be running up and down the paths, but you barely see anyone else there at all. It's almost as if you have the park to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk along one of the more leaf-covered paths, Kory starts to walk closer to you, leaning his head slightly against your shoulder. It's a nice feeling, and one that excites you, but you don't want to blow the moment, so you don't do anything crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's that?\" Kory's eyes light up as he looks down at your wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" you say, trying to see what he's asking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nice watch!\" he lifts up your wrist closer to his eyes to get a better look. \"Is it new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"No, it's one of my dad's old watches, I think. I found it just last week when I was cleaning up the basement. It doesn't seem to work, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Hang on a second.\" He gently removes the watchband from your wrist and starts to fiddle with it. You watch curiously, unsure of what he's doing until-- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! That should do it!\" He hands the watch back to you, smiling from ear to ear. Indeed, the watch seems to be running, though as opposed to a ticking it sounds more like a very low, constant buzzing. What's more, you notice that where the numbers should be, there are instead strange symbols, the likes of which you've never seen before. Well, as long as it still kept time the same way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kory!\" You slip the watch back on, looking it over again. As you nod in approval, Kory grabs your hand again, this time resting his paw in yours for a longer time. You look down at his eyes, and they appear to be looking up at you with a sense of affection and... maybe something more, you're not sure. Could he--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, c'mon and kiss me, you big lug, you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that seems to answer that question. Leaning in, you press your muzzle against his and lock lips for a few moments. Your whiskers brush up against his nose, and he starts to giggle. \"Heheh, that tickles a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you quickly say, backing away slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKory tilts his head, a sly grin on his face. \"I didn't say stop.\" He jumps up and pulls his mouth closer to you, a much more forceful kiss than before that lasts for a good twenty seconds. You're taken aback for a moment, but quickly get into it as much as Kory does. His hips press against your abs and you can feel his cock through his jeans, every bit as hard as yours. His arms wrap around your shoulders, and you can feel his claws dig in slightly to your back. And, for a moment, you feel a slight vibration on your wrist right where the watch is, resting against Kory's neck. You can feel it heat up slightly, but the heat seems to be flowing away from you and into Kory. As the kiss ends, though, you're not sure whether or not that was just your imagination at work, or something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that for plans, Ash?\" He winks at you as he turns around and starts walking away. \"I've got to head home now and get ready to pack. See you on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a little unsure of what just happened, you resist the urge to run after him, and simply watch him as he walks away, his hips moving slightly side-to-side as he walks, and his tail gently flicking in the breeze. Never in your life have you wanted anything more than you do right now, but you don't want to ruin what has already happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, though, comes the hardest part -- waiting a whole goddamn weekend until you see him again. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weekend came and went slowly.. More slowly than it ever had even since you started getting to know Kory. You spent many many hours reliving that one fleeting moment where you felt his soft lips play with yours, his small sharp teeth nibble softly against your muzzle, and not to mention his full sheath pressing insistently against your stomach... You had never felt more alive and more nervous to face the following Monday at class. You knew you would normally sit with Kory. Questions of fear and rejection ran through your head but also of love and affection.. You just had to wait and see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonday morning you scanned the halls looking for the small red panda. He was small and limber, so blending in wasn't difficult. But you usually had your eyes trained to find him by now. You felt a poke on your shoulder followed by the voice you knew so well by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cutie!\" came the chipper voice and your heart pounded in your chest, you put on your best and most loving smile and turned to look at him. Your smile faded and you gasped! His handsome face was no longer where you were used to looking, and you were staring at a far too tight shirt showing faint traces of the deep ruddy fur that you knew Kory had. Instead you had to look straight ahead to find his eyes beaming with barely contained glee. He stood quite a bit higher then when you had last seen him, now exactly the same height as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you over the weekend, dear Ash. I hope I wasn't too bad leaving you there like that\" He giggled and wrapped his larger arms around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-kory, what happened to you?!\" You ask dumbfounded at the sudden change, albeit happy to finally be able to properly hug the sweet red panda without having to almost kneel down or lift him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Ash? I kissed you\" He smirked and chuckled mischievously \"I went back home, and now I'm here again! Nothing really happens back home, you know it's more an obligation than something I enjoy.. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned back and stared lovingly into your eyes, and laughed softly when he saw your shocked expression. \"Surely you still can't be THAT shocked by what happened last time?! It's not like you haven't been eyeing me all semester, Ash.\" You continue to stare, still dumbfounded at Kory's new-found size, but he didn't seem bothered or even to acknowledge that he just grew a foot and a half in a single weekend. \"Kory you... You're big!\" You almost blurt out, mentally slapping yourself for your prosaic language; this is not at all how you had prepared to greet him this morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddya mean, silly?\" The panda giggles, still holding you in his arms. \"I'm no bigger than you are! Are you blowing your own horn, hon?\" He giggled more at that obvious pun. <i>If he's going to pretend nothing happened, I won't push the subject.</i> After all you were happy that he had found a growth spurt, unusually big as it might have been. You shake your head and try to throw back the loving smile you had prepared at home for your sweet friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? That's much better\" He giggles and leans in to kiss you again. Most of the classes have already started and the halls are empty, so you close your eyes and lean back into the tender kiss with full passion. You stroke your paws over his back and feels that strange buzzing in your left paw again, seeming like an electric current from your watch to the cute panda kissing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull back with a soft sigh and smile happily back at Kory, \u201cI\u2019m so happy to see you again Kory, I can\u2019t believe that you \u2026 I can\u2019t believe that we kissed.. Twice!\u201d He almost melted at the all too cute smile thrown to him by the still lithe, but suddenly much larger red panda in his arms. \u201cDoes this mean that we are?\u201d You start, but a finger on your muzzle shushes you effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now, Ash. Don\u2019t rush it, just go with it..\u201d He started to walk past you, swaying his hips in that seductive manner you had come to absolutely adore \u201cBut\u2026\u201d he stopped \u201c.. Yes\u201d He laughed and walked his larger body into the classroom, leaving you standing horribly aroused and a little perplexed at the mischievous panda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin to yourself and shrug your shoulders before heading into class yourself and set yourself down next to the still chuckling red panda. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the first class was over, you had two hours worth of classes on the opposite side of campus from each other, so as you stepped back into the hallway, Kory placed his arm around your shoulder and gave you a gentle squeeze and a peck on the cheek. \"See you in a bit, hon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your peripheral vision, you noticed that a few of your classmates had their eyebrows raised, and for a moment, you thought about trying to downplay any signs of affection, but when you looked back at Kory's big, sweet eyes looking directly at yours, your heart melted all over again. \"Bye, babe,\" you said as you leaned forward. You meant to kiss him on the mouth, but you still weren't used to his larger size yet, and instead your lips made contact with his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKory giggled, then kissed you right back on your nose. \"Don't miss me too much, Ash.\" As he pulled away, he brought his hand up through your hair, ruffling it a little, before dashing off down the hall in the direction of the Art building where his next classes were. The panda moved through the crowd of students as spry as ever, weaving in and out of traffic with an effortless grace, even at his increased height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you stood there in a daze, before you realized that dozens of eyes were staring at you. Snapping back into it, you cleared your throat, and when that didn't clear out the onlookers, you let out a low, menacing growl that did the trick, causing everyone to go back to minding their own business -- or at least pretending to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived five minutes late to your next class, slipping in the back and sitting in the last row. The room was a large lecture hall, and the subject was Biology, a topic which you knew a good deal about already. With today's topic, cellular structure, being one you already knew pretty well, you soon found yourself losing focus and starting to daydream about Kory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were certainly glad that he felt the same affection for you as you did for him, but his sudden growth over the weekend still gnawed at you a bit. Not that it wasn't a pleasant surprise, of course; in fact, if you had your way you might want him to be a bit bigger, since at your size and stature you rarely got to be around anyone bigger than you, and it would be intriguing to date someone whom you had to look up to for a change. But still, the fact that it happened so quickly, and that he (and everyone else except for you, for that matter) seemed to be so oblivious to it\u2026 that troubled you, and you couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. Still, he sure was damn sexy. You had seen him shirtless before at the pool, and he had an impressive little body, tight and limber. You couldn't wait to see how he looked now that he had sprouted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Biology, and the nondescript Statistics class that followed it (which allowed you to daydream about a shirtless, then naked, Kory even more), you had a break of three hours before your final class of the day, Literature, one you also shared with Kory. You wouldn't be able to see him, though, until an hour or so before that class started, as his Art Studio class was still going on. You had half a mind to sneak into that class so you could spend more time with your panda, but Kory had told you horror stories about the professor being a complete and utter dictator when it came to interruptions, so you didn't dare chance his wrath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you decided to head to the student union, keeping your eyes open for a certain-- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around just as a small yet hyper wallaby hopped right in front of you, nearly knocking you over with his enthusiastic greeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello, yourself, Nik,\" you replied. \"Hey, can I talk to you for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNik grinned, his tongue sticking out of the side of his mouth. \"What do you think we're doing right now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes and motioned with your hand for him to follow you over to a table near the wall. As the two of you sat down, you noticed that Nik still seemed to be hopping in his chair. \"You need to cut down a little on the caffeine, ya know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've only had two cups of coffee today,\" Nik countered. \"And a soda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Listen, I need to ask you something about Kory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNik's eyes lit up. \"Yeah, I heard the two of you became an item over the weekend. What's the question? Are you looking to buy him an engagement ring? I think emeralds would best match his eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!\" You frowned slightly, a low growl forming in your throat. \"Who told you that we were an item?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Ash, I've known the guy since grade school. We tell each other everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I've noticed.\" You shook your head. \"Listen, just keep this relatively quiet for now, okay? I mean, we're not keeping this a secret or anything, but the whole campus doesn't have to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Nik chuckled, \"it's kinda too late for that. Everyone's talking about you two.\" You gave him a puzzled look, so he continued. \"I mean, it's not everyday that two of the tallest, most attractive guys on campus start to make out in the middle of the hall. Most furs are bound to sit up and take notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's not fair. We weren't making out in-- wait!\" Nik's casual throw-away comment reminded you of the reason you wanted to talk to the wallaby in the first place. \"What did you just say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what? About you guys being attractive?\" Nik grinned as he leaned back in his chair. \"I'm not saying you're my cup o' tea, but there are plenty who would disagree.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not that!\" You started to scowl in frustration. \"I mean, you said\u2026\" Stopping for a moment, you tried to choose your words carefully. \"So, you also noticed that Kory's now my height?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so?\" Nik shrugged. \"He's been that tall since he was sixteen. I personally don't see how a red panda grows to be that big, but whatever. I'd chalk it up to genetics, but neither of his parents are anywhere close to that height. Perhaps he simply ate more than his share of vegetables--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were completely confused, and beginning to question your own sanity. Maybe Kory really had always been this big, and you didn't notice it until now. No, that's preposterous. You distinctly remember having to bend down to hug him before, and being able to lift him with relative ease. There was no way you could do that now without killing your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNik looked down at his phone, and his eyes bulged as he noticed the time. \"Crap! I'm gonna be late for chemistry. Talk to ya later, Ash!\u201d You didn\u2019t even notice as he jumped up and waved good-bye, as you were still lost in a fog of confusion about this whole situation. Nothing about any of this made any sense at all, and you felt your head begin to pound from all the confusion. What the hell was going on?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was only one place to go when you felt this way. You stood up and walked out of the union, heading down the sidewalk towards the rec center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got there, you quickly changed into your tank top and gym shorts, did some stretching, and headed straight to the free weights. Several other furs that you recognized were already working out there: a pair of wolves helping each other on the bench press, a burly lion doing squats, and a horse with the thickest thighs you had ever seen working on the leg press. You had seen these guys dozens of times here before, though neither you nor any of them had ever bothered to exchange names. Nodding as you made eye contact with some of them, you gave a friendly (if brief) wave hello. They grunted back their greetings, nodding in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the stack of dumbbells, you grabbed a pair of forty pounders, then found a nearby bench and sat down, starting to work on curls. Focusing on the exercise usually helped clear your mind, but you couldn't help shake the uneasiness you had felt since this morning. After a few cycles of twelve reps per arm, you walked back over to the rack to return the dumbbells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you put them back in their place, however, a sweet musk filled your nostrils, one you knew well, and you felt a familiar poke against your shoulder. This one, though, felt a little more forceful than normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kory?\" you asked, a bit puzzled. You knew for a fact that the red panda had never stepped foot into the rec center since the beginning of college, able to stay slim and trim with just his regular walking and light jogging, and with no interest in building any muscle mass. In any case, him meeting you here was definitely a pleasant turn of events. You brought a smile to your face, ready to greet your friend -- no, your boyfriend, you corrected yourself -- as warmly as possible. But as you turned around, you were met with a shock, in the form of a face-full of dark black fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gawked up at the seven-and-a-half foot tall red panda in front of you, eyeing him from head to toe. He had the same shade of reddish brown fur, the same neatly cropped and styled head of dark brown hair, and the same wonderful smile -- but everything was much larger than before. He stood nearly a foot taller than you, and, even more astonishing, his physique seemed to have gotten a little more muscular, his arms and legs now toned with a bit of definition to them. His shirt, the same short-sleeve button-up he was wearing earlier, now looked more like a vest, completely open and revealing the black fur on his chest and stomach. His formerly baggy shorts were now nearing their breaking point, able to cover less than half of his thighs, and in between his legs, you could clearly see the outline of a very prominent bulge aching to break free. His flip-flops were still there, but the edges of his feet were hanging over the sides, and the straps seemed like they would snap loose at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned down to kiss you, but you backed away, more out of shock than anything else. \"K-Kory! Wh-- what's happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears flattened slightly, and you saw a tinge of disappointment in his eyes. \"What do you mean, Ash? I got out of studio early, and I saw you just before you slipped in here, so I thought I would surprise you.\" He glanced to his right and left, noticing that all eyes in the room seemed to be fixed on the two of you, and he began slouch his shoulders. \"I guess that I should've known better, huh?\" He rolled his eyes and turned away from you, looking down at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frown that was now on his face nearly tore your heart in two, and you did your best to try and salvage the situation. \"No, no, it's nothing like that.\" You placed your fingers on his cheek, having to stretch a little to reach, and stood up on your tiptoes, gently kissing the white fur on the bottom of his chin. \"I just \u2026 wasn't expecting you here\u2026 especially like\u2026 well, like this!\" You gestured with your hand, trying to indicate how unusual, even ridiculous, his height seemed to you, without actually saying it aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm\u2026\" He didn't seem to pick up on your hints, and he still looked dejected. To hell with what anyone thinks, you told yourself. Taking a deep breath and sucking up all your courage, you wrapped your arms around his chest and tried to squeeze tight, leaning against his arm and kissing the bulge in his biceps. At this point, you began to realize just how big Kory now was; you could only barely fit your arms all the way around his torso, and his muscles were firmer and more powerful than you first thought just by looking at them. You began to grow aroused as you clung tighter to your large boyfriend. You could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if I upset you, babe,\" you said, looking up at him with wide-open eyes, and forced a little bit of a purr. \"I'm really glad you stopped by.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced back down at you, as if trying to decide something, before his lips finally started to slowly turn upwards. He leaned his face forward and buried his muzzle in your hair as he kissed you. You tilted your head slightly and began to kiss him on the side of the neck, gradually moving down to the exposed part of his shoulder. He placed a large paw on your back. \"Apology accepted, Ash.\" He began to caress your gently, slowly working his way lower and lower, causing your pants to tighten even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, you noticed that your watch, resting against Kory's bicep, again seemed to be buzzing and heating up. You remembered last Friday evening in the woods and this morning before class where the same thing happened as you were kissing Kory. And it was after this that he started having his growth spurts. Could the watch have something to do with Kory's unexplained explosion of growth? No, that wasn't possible-- was it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The strange buzzing from your wrist made you pull back from the tender kiss, watching your arm as the feeling dies down seemingly at the same time as the kiss, leaving Kory with a confused look. \u201cDid you feel that?\u201d You asked, looking back up at your new boyfriend, only to get a worried headtilt back from the too large red panda in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I feel what, sweetie? Your magical lips, your rising post-workout scent, your tight pants, or the jealous eyes around us?\u201d He giggled in that perfectly adorable way, which only made him seem even more ridiculously oversized. Such an adorable face, cute small voice and a chipper teasing attitude on a body that was now SOMEHOW much larger than anyone you had ever seen. But his words made your tummy cringe slightly, you were still new at being open about your feelings towards the sweet panda, and even opening up to those feelings with Kory filled you with dread of what might happen, opening up to everyone else in such a direct way was nerve chilling to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scanned the room, but noticed that even through the obviously gay display in the middle of the otherwise exceedingly macho rec center, not ONE single fur in the room had dared to turn his face your way. You were used to people being laughably unobservant about Kory\u2019s impossible growth spurt recently, and even to the point of not wanting to question it anymore, like everyone were in on one big April\u2019s Fool\u2019s joke with you, but this was different. It seemed like they were actually afraid of saying anything against the two of you making out in front of them, and looking back up at the smiling face that could always make your heart melt, you understood the reason easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKory\u2019s imposing figure was truly awe-inspiring. And if you hadn\u2019t known him as well as you did, even you would have been nervous being this close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran a paw over his impossibly stretched T-shirt, traced the tension lines running from his armpits and across his slightly bulged-out chest. At least a foot and a half of beautiful maroon bellyfur was visible between that tormented piece of clothing to the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKory.. Sweetie..\u201d you smile softly to yourself at finally being able to use these affectionate terms with your panda love \u201cHave you noticed any \u2026 Growth spurts recently?\u201d You looked up at his slightly confused expression as you finished speaking \u201cBecause I remember lifting you up in my arms to kiss you last Friday..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched Kory intently for a few seconds before his muzzle spread into a wide grin and a hearty laugh, \u201cAwwwr! My dear Tiggy, is that what was bothering you all this time? That I am bigger than you?\u201d He leans down and kisses your forehead affectionately before continuing \u201cYou know how much you mean to me.. I love you! To me you\u2019re the biggest man alive!\u201d He chortles above you. <i>Wow, was he really that oblivious to it? Maybe it wasn\u2019t a joke that he didn\u2019t notice. But how can that be\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just smiled and chuckled back figuring it best not to poke more at the subject here in public, and instead simply held Kory close to you, feeling his strong physique through his practically non-existing clothing. \u201cWell, growth spurts or no, we will need to get you some new clothes soon! I\u2019m not quite ready to share you with the world after all! And it seems like that shirt is one deep breath away from snapping!\u201d You both chuckle softly and the room sighs heavily around you from various muscle-heads making their silent disproval of your presence known in the most discrete way they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both exit out the doors to have some at least slightly more private time together before your final class. You started walking around outside together enjoying the calm autumn winds through your fur. The time for libidos to kick it up a gear, for warmth to return to the gentle air, and flowers to rise in the University common picnic area you were walking through now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself continually staring down at Kory\u2019s barely covered lower ribs that now took up the space where his head used to be, only to blushingly look back up to his newfound height, almost injuring your neck each time. You knew your boyfriend had somehow grown, and you had a very suspicious feeling that this strange watch of yours was somehow involved in the process. Now the only problem was, how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKory..\u201d You started, looking up to your far too tall boyfriend as he beamed back a happy smile, his eyes a deep blue you could lose hours in.. \u201cKory, do you remember you fixed this old watch last Friday?\u201d. A proud nod and a wiggle of his fingers \u201cYes of course, dear. Agile fingers! \u2026 You\u2019ll see..\u201d He grinned knowingly and you shivered violently, your tight pants giving a groan of disproval as your zipper was reaching capacity. It was lucky that the red panda had worn such stretchy pants, the sexy low-cut jeans he normally wore would not have survived the growing onslaught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.. Okay\u201d You blushed, but continued \u201cI know this sounds far out, but please bear with me. I believe that when you fixed my watch that day that something happened. I know you don\u2019t seem to realize it, nor does ANYONE aside from me, but it seems like every time we kiss and touch with me wearing this watch, a few hours later you\u2019ve grown a foot and a half.\u201d His face looked puzzled and he stopped and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to you and knelt down in front of you bringing him down to your eye level, which made you blush madly. He spoke softly and hushed \u201cLook, Ash, I know it might be tough on you to be with someone who shouldn\u2019t be taller than you but somehow are. And I know that you might be worried that I don\u2019t consider you to be special because of it. But I will spend every single day of my life from here on out to make sure that you realize how much I love you and that I will do absolutely anything for you. You are the only person I\u2019ve ever loved, and felt loved me back. Others have wanted me for my size or my\u2026 boyish nature \u201cHe blushed and gave a crooked smile at that remark. \u201cBut you are the only one I ever had this connection with. And if you truly believe that something might have happened with that watch and with my size, then I am not against exploring that with you. But\u2026 \u201c He sighed again and hugged you close, pressing his entire upper body against you. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is, please don\u2019t be worried\u2026 Love\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood stunned at his speech, but somehow oddly reassured. Maybe it wasn\u2019t the worst thing that could happen after all, getting a big boyfriend like Kory. Actually this might be the best thing that could have happened to him..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood up again however you noticed heard an audible RIP! Coming from your boyfriend\u2019s shirt as it tore at the sides and in the middle of his chest. Suddenly, it wasn\u2019t his chest being at your eye level it was his trim and toned soft-furred abs! \u201cOops!\u201d You heard from above you followed by a childish giggling laughter. \u201cI guess you were right, all it took WAS one deep breath for this shirt to give up on me.\u201d You stare wide-eyed at his bigger form started towering above you, now at least 9 feet above the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis too tight shorts had impossibly still held up and was struggling to contain the growing panda. The stretched fabric did absolutely nothing to hide what was underneath, and your jaw dropped at the sizable bulge that pushed up against the waistband of his shorts. The three spherical shapes that made up his impressive anatomy underneath made you gasp and blush wildly. You saw him looking down himself and grinned as he rolls his hips seductively in front of you. \u201cWell I guess you were to see me sometime, I might as well give you a little teasing with my attire, right?\u201d He laughed as you started to cover him up with your jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awwed with a pout, as he took your jacket and held it up to his crotch, pressing it against himself and licked his perfect lips \u201cHey good idea! At least now it\u2019ll smell like me, and I\u2019ll always be with you.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up with a stern expression, \u201cYou, me, shopping, now!\u201d and you both turn around to leave the university grounds\u2026</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I don't quite know where you expect to find me any clothes around here,\" Kory playfully protested as you did your best to pull him by the hand towards the parking lot where your car was parked. \"I always have to order mine through the mail. I thought you knew that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that he was right. There weren't any clothing stores around campus that would have anything that would come close to fitting Kory now. The only place you could think of that would come close would be the Big &amp; Tall store at the mall, and even that would be a stretch -- figuratively and literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pondering this problem for a few minutes, an idea struck. \"C'mon, we'll head downtown to the old market district. The dad of one of my old high school friends runs a tailor shop down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have something custom-made for me?\" Kory's eyes lit up, and he wrapped an arm around you, pulling you closer. \"Awww, how sweet of you, Ashton. But won't that be expensive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved that concern off with your paw. \"Don't worry about it. It won't be a problem.\" You still had a good deal of savings leftover from your parents, and you had some odd jobs that you did around campus and the neighborhood every now and then that brought in some money, so you should be able to swing at least two or three outfits. A thought began to trouble you, however: just how big would Kory get? It had only been a day since you first noticed him growing like this, and he was already taller than anyone you had ever seen before in your life. What if this kept up? Would you still try to clothe him if he grew to be fifteen feet tall? Thirty? Fifty? The thought of being with someone that large was intriguing but also presented a whole bunch of logistical problems. Shaking your head, you decided to not worry about that for now, and to wait and see what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got to your car, though, a new, more immediate problem started to arise. \"Ash, honey, did you forget something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You glanced up at Kory, who looked down at you, laughing softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember the last time I tried to fit in your car?\" He pointed a finger, and you gasped as you saw that on the passenger side of your car, the roof had a fairly noticeable dent sticking out of it... just about the size and shape of Kory's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My car!\" You cried. \"When did that happen?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA concerned look in his eye, Kory placed his large paw on your forehead, covering almost the entire top of your head. \"Are you feeling alright, hon? That's been there for a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your head back and forth between the car and Kory, you realized after a moment that your mouth was hanging open, still in shock. You shut it, but still couldn't disguise your bewilderment. Kory patted you on the back as gently as he could. \u201dDon\u2019t worry, Ash. Why don't we take the bus, like we usually do when we're traveling together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked to the bus stop, still slightly upset but trying to put on your most neutral expression, for Kory's sake. Your boyfriend seemed so optimistic and enthusiastic about everything, even though he was now walking around public virtually nude, that you didn't want to do anything that would bring him down. Thankfully, you didn't have to stand and stew in your worries for very long, as a bus pulled up within a minute of the two of you arriving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKory ducked his head and climbed onto the bus first. You saw the driver look up for a moment as the mammoth panda boarded his bus, then immediately shrug and turn his face back to the road with the gruff expression remaining on his face. As Kory walked down the aisle of the bus, having to crouch to do so, a couple of other passengers jumped back in fright, and you could feel the bus rock from side to side with each step he took. Heading to the back row, he  sat down, his legs sprawled out in front of him, leaving a little room for you to join him to his right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus trip downtown from the college was relatively short, and luckily the stop was almost directly in front of the tailor shop. You headed in, seeing your friend's father, a middle-aged black jaguar with greying hair and whiskers, turn around as he heard the door open and the bell above it ring. \"Welcome! What can I do for-- Goodness!\" You didn't even have to guess anymore what was causing his shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mr. Higgins,\" you began, \"I don't know if you remember me, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashton, of course!\" The jaguar's eyes lit up as he began to smile. \"I remember all of my children's friends. But who's this you have with you?\" he asks, indicating Kory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my, um--\" you hesitate for only a moment, before continuing, \"--my boyfriend, Kory. He's having a bit of a \u2026 uh, clothing emergency, I guess you could say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKory stepped forward, his ears brushing against the ceiling as he did, and stuck out his paw, without a hint of modesty. \"Pleased to meet you, Mr. Higgins. Ash tells me you can work wonders with fabric and needles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kory, yes,\" Mr. Higgins grabbed Kory's paw and shook it firmly. \"I'm pretty sure I've heard of you. Unless there are any other nine foot tall red pandas hanging around the college?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kory shook his head. \"Nope, not that I've noticed. And, believe me, we'd be pretty noticeable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes for you, Kory, and Mr. Higgins to decide what kind of clothes would work best: a simple navy button-up shirt with khaki pants, and a form-fitting t-shirt with shorts. The panther took his measurements, then you had to wait for about an hour as he worked on the clothes, finally returning with one outfit ready to wear, which Kory slipped on, and one outfit in a brown paper package for later. After paying for the order, you thanked him and headed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now, hon,\" Kory says, smiling down at you, looking really nice (and a lot more presentable) in his new shirt and pants, \"Is there anything else you want to do while we're down here?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From the day started till now, only a few hours had passed, less than what could be counted on one hand, and yet.. Kory had already grown to almost twice his size! Even though everyone seemed to not care, and you had long since chosen not to think more on it with the slight but ever present fear of going insane, you still couldn\u2019t help but to constantly stare where his head had formerly been to you. It was not your fault that this for all intents and purposes looked to Kory and the rest of the world around you to be directly at his crotch! Only Kory\u2019s voice above, made you lose your confused expression and look up and up till you reached his grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, are you sad now that I got clothes to fit me?\u201d You hear Kory giggle softly down to you, delightfully cheery and uncaring as ever and your skin blushed to a bright red under your black and orange fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, umm.. I was just lost in thought, I\u2019m sorry what did you say, dear?\u201d you clear your throat and correct your posture slightly, stretching up to feel like less of a kid next to your big panda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, that\u2019s what I was getting from your stares too.\u201d He mocked back at you. \u201cI was asking you if you\u2019d want to do anything else while we\u2019re in town, cutie. You know those busses are awfully unpleasant to ride, and until my letter writing bears fruit for my own private seat, I\u2019d really rather we make the best of our trips here\u2026 You know that!\u201d He leans down over me and pokes my strange watch. \u201cYou said something about this watch making me large, right? You remember, in the park? Maybe we\u2019d want to go have someone besides your remarkably talented boyfriend take a look at that.\u201d He smiled lovingly down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He had actually remembered? I thought my ranting had seemed insane, even to me, and gone on deaf ears\u2026 Not that I knew Kory to at all disregard me or anything I say; actually quite the opposite! No matter the imposing size he has now he still seems only to have eyes for me, and ever so sweet and caring as I remember him from the first day we met at the college not more than a few months past. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, maybe it didn\u2019t seem so odd that he would care enough about your concerns to remember. After all growing to his impressive size had even been astonishing to himself. Granted, to you it happened not in years, months, or even days - but in hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you knew that he had always loved to tinker with mechanics, a skill he has shown you more than a few times. So why wouldn\u2019t he be intrigued to follow your possibly derailed mind to find out more about a mysterious clock and its growing effects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! I think I know a place that might offer us some assistance.\u201d You smile up, grab Kory\u2019s paw, and almost drags him along with you in the most classic \u2018boy chasing the candy shop\u2019 fashion, which earned you a small chuckle from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your hasty steps and his impressively long stride, it took no time to reach what on the outside appeared to be nothing more than a worn down bookshop. Stepping inside, and still dragging Kory with you, you heard a loud bump against the doorframe. Fearing that he had bumped his head you gasp and turn around. You both had to laugh as you saw that he had certainly not bumped his HEAD against the door, but rather the door was filled from frame to frame with the neatly dressed form of your adorable red panda, the door only coming up to the bottom of his chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKory bent down low, and squeezed inside the small shop sideways, having to get down on all fours just to move about inside the cramped shop, and pushing you back slightly as his body filled the space. You stared on in amazement at the display still not used to Kory at this size, just as the red panda smiled widely and leaned in towards you to kiss your muzzle lovingly. His wide tongue playfully rolling across your lips and making you kiss him back with equal love and passion, wrapping your arms around his neck, and scratching gently through his soft fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a loud gasp behind you, \u201cHoly chime and whistle!\u201d making you break the kiss instantly and flip around to face a dazed shopkeeper who had just walked in from the back of the shop. \u201cOh, umm, sorry\u2026 Didn\u2019t quite see you there\u2026\u201d you stammer, blushing slightly at the public displays while Kory just chuckles and sends his greeting behind you \u201cHey! My boyfriend found this watch yesterday.\u201d You swallow heavily, not upset to be recognized as this extremely handsome panda\u2019s boyfriend, but still not overly confident, which as you were beginning to realize seemed odd considering your species \u2013 that the red panda was confident and outgoing, while you were nervous and introvert. But perhaps that\u2019s what attracted you to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step forward, with a large insisting paw at your back, and pull out the watch for the shopkeeper to look at. You knew this shop well enough, you had been here several times in the last semester looking for various gadgets and gizmos that might make good \u201cwill you be my boyfriend\u201d gifts for Kory, and while this shop seemed to have nothing ordinary it most certainly had EVERYTHING out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper hmmm\u2019ed ponderingly as he examined the strange markings on the watch. He flipped it over several times and seemed thorough in his search for clues as to why we had so suddenly burst into his shop, with what looked like nothing more than the intent to make out\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at you, and then over at Kory, who leaned slightly to the side to follow the shopkeepers movements with a very professional discrimination. \u201cAh!\u201d He broke the silence, making both of you jump, and Kory bang his head against the dark wooden rafters above. \u201cI think I\u2019ve seen a piece like this before. It is a very rare item indeed\u2026\u201d He placed the watch on the counter and hurried out back, rummaging noisily through boxes and shelves as you and Kory exchange nervous looks. \u201cAha! Here it is!\u201d Came the muffled voice, before the strange man walks back out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere is a book on items said to be built with supernatural powers. Novelty items of course..\u201d He smiles up at you and dumps the heavy and worn down book on the counter, and flips to a page with what appears to be your exact watch. \u201cIt says here, that this watch gives a loved one what he or she lacked most physically when the bond between you first was made, and does this through loving acts... And since the effect is physical, so must the act be!\u201d He mentions knowingly, before slamming the book shut. \u201cIt is said to have a way of controlling its effects as well, but of course, as I said this is a novelty item sold on the promise between lovers to bring them something magical, nothing more. Although it is quite rare to see these even in our time, so I suggest you cherish it.\u201d He smiles at you and gives you your watch back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look confused back at Kory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm, to give my loved one what he mostly lacked physically when our bond first was made. Obviously he was always small and slim\u2026 Well, THAT certainly changed.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin as you start to exit the shop with the struggling red panda in the lead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And the effect is carried out through physical acts of love\u2026 The kiss!</i></span></div></div>",

His clothes are tighter, a sliver of belly-fur now visible, and you're now eye-level with his crotch. In short, he has grown again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, hon?\" Kory asks, still oblivious to the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you start, but then stop.

Hell, this morning, you were my height, and before this whole thing started on Friday, you barely reached my chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you said,\" Kory murmurs, mulling this over as a middle-aged ferret passes by without so much as a glance at the humongous panda. \"But then why are you the only person to notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not entirely sure,\" you admit. \"It's almost as if the world is changing around us to conform with your height each time. All except for--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--my clothes!\" Kory interjects, looking down at the new shirt and pants that were already getting too tight for his giant frame. You notice his eyes lighting up, gears turning inside his head. \"Maybe you're on to something, Ash. But\u2026 I mean, the way I \u2026 the way I remember it, is that these clothes were already tight when I put them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They weren't though!\" you say excitedly. \"I mean, that's why we went down to the tailor's in the first place! To get something to fit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKory walks beside you silently for a moment. \"So, what's the watch have to do with all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the shopkeeper back there did say that the watch gives a loved one what he or she lacked most physically, through loving, physical acts. And,\" you pause a moment, gazing into Kory's curious eyes, \"every time we've kissed, a little bit later you've grown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm.\" Kory slowly begins to nod. \"I think I have an idea, then, an experiment of sorts. One I think both of us will enjoy quite a bit.\" You notice a devilish yet adorable grin form on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the book said loving and physical acts, right? Not necessarily just kissing?\" You nod, beginning to see where Kory is going, and you feel your arousal growing with each word. \"Methinks it's time the two of us get to know each other a little more\u2026 intimately, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I do.\" After only a moment's hesitation, you grab Kory's big hand and begin to run off in the direction of your house, which is by now only about a mile away. After a few blocks, Kory picks you up and carries you in his arms, able to move faster this way. And that doesn't bother you one bit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While not bothered by his suddenly much larger boyfriend carrying him around in his surprisingly strong arms, it was an unaccustomed feeling to be literally swept off your feet. To Kory it all seemed so natural of course; you wonder that if in his mind this happens all the time. What part of your history seems still, what changes, what... Is that creaking sound?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down in the direction of the sound just in time to see the once again skintight fabric of Kory's new pants against his crotch, and gasp. The promise of long desired intercourse with your all too adorable red panda was giving you a bit of a tent too, but what now struggled for space inside your boyfriends pants seemed unreal. A long rounded slab of what could only be Kory's cock curved around the contours of the panda's waist almost to his side pocket and pushed out the pants far enough that - in your mind - you could barely hint at the glistening meat underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKory\u2019s giggle from above let you know you\u2019d been caught in the act of so obviously gawking at his fronts. You swiftly look back up, blushing deeply when all he did was wink down at you and smile that cute smile of his that always made you melt. You started to wonder if this will even be possible now, and what happens when he grows even MORE? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re shaken from your thoughts when Kory stops and swings you down gently on your doorstep. <br>\r\n\u201cThat was fast!\u201d You comment as you fish out your keys; he just shrugs and grins down at you: \u201cLong legs, you know!\u201d He chirps and wiggles his toes up in front of you; that and\u2026\u201d He leans down towards you, in a chorus of creaking clothes, as you finally unlock the door and whispers in your ear, hot warm breath against your sensitive fur \u201cWith you here, I don\u2019t know how much longer these pants are gonna hold little ol\u2019 me in..\u201d You feel a shiver run down your spine at that and even more so at the giggle that followed. He was so casual about it, so natural, so\u2026 annoyingly and wonderfully cute and sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed his much larger paw in yours and \u201cpulled\u201d him inside the house, only stopping for him to kneel and then duck down under the doorframe, reminding you to get that enlarged as well as the entire house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the bedroom you immediately start fumbling with your pants with one paw while your other paw struggles to pull your shirt over your head, making what could only be described as an impromptu raindance in front of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally make your escape from the restraints of fabric, you peer over on the bed. Where Kory - still as fully clothed as he can get and still big as ever - is sat, legs out to the side, large enough that both hind paws can fully rest on either side of the bed. His head is tilted slightly and he\u2019s got the biggest blush on his face, one that you quickly match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look handsome..\u201d He offers carefully, as you realize that this is actually the first time you and he will see each other down to just your fur. You look down at yourself, and spread your arms wide \u201cIs my panda liking what he sees?\u201d You joke and grin over at him, as he replies with a gasp and a sharp \u2018POP!\u2019 as his pants button shoots off onto the floor. Unblinking you take in the sight as the zipper rolls down over his bulge, revealing a wildly stretched pair of rainbow-coloured undies. He stays his paws and just watches you watch him as his cock seems to harden and unfold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize now that he was only soft before as his red meat moves outside his tights (looking more like briefs currently) and up his belly, stretching slightly past his bellybutton before it begins to throb rhythmically. You\u2019ve already moved towards the bed and close in on the huge cock, that would have been impressive on Kory was he at a more normal size, but here and now has to be at least 16 inches of hard throbbing panda meat. You move in closer, your muzzle a mere inch from its surface and you can feel Kory\u2019s tension as he holds his breath almost afraid of the first touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bask in the scent of his musk, and the heat from him is amazing. Your cock now fully free and throbbing against your flat tummy as time slows down for you and lets you let in the sight and smell of your boyfriend for the very first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour whisker accidentally drags across the moist surface of his cock and with a loud gasp from somewhere above, his cock throbs out and punches you in the nose sending a dollop of pre over your muzzle. \u201cMmh, this will be fun.\u201d You smirk and realize that even now at his impressive size, he\u2019s still as shy and submissive as ever. You are going to have to make the first move. You move your paws up his side and feel his body shake and tremble like a leaf under your palms, \u201cso sweet\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up on the bed, your head surprisingly not surpassing his own, rather he was now having to tilt his head slightly in order to fit inside the room. Had he grown again? So soon? You shrug and dismiss it; nothing will ruin this moment for you. You stretch up, and just reach his muzzle, kissing him tenderly and deeply lips brushing over lips before you once again move down his body with your kisses, and stand in over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering down you take a gentle but firm hold of his cock, making him gasp again and add to what seemed to be a sizable amount of pre running down the surface of his cock. You welcome the aid in what you\u2019re about to attempt when you, with a bit of dread, align his domed head with your butt and push down..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes clench shut and a moan escapes both your lips as his cock presses against you and forces its way inside you with a wet squelch. You pant softly and hold that position, afraid to move and his arms now finally move just to hold you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of clenching you start to get used to his massive size and gather the courage to move up and down a bit, and there\u2019s more than enough inches to take from ! Getting into a good rhythm atop of him, you see him start to shake a bit more than usual and grit his teeth as his shoulders suddenly bumped into the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no..\u201d Is all you managed to say as your boyfriend started to grow. More and more of him came slowly but surely into existence right before your eyes, His torso elongated before you, his back curved along the ceiling and his legs stretched out almost wall to wall in your small room. But what you really focused on what his cock that grew ever bigger inside your already tortured tailhole. However that part seemed to grow even as the the rest of Kory\u2019s body stopped expanding. The balls that you've had a firm grasp on during your \u2018ride\u2019 had already doubled in size, filling your palms fully and his cock now seemed to push you up on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was definitely new! You leap off his growing cock forcing a loud moan from the red panda as his cock flops back onto his body sending a large spurt of pre flying onto his chin! He cock now reached all the way up to his ribs! And his spherical balls all but filled the leftover space between his thighs before suddenly the growth stopped\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of you said anything for a while before with a drunken smile Kory opened his eyes and focused down at you with a silly smile. \u201cWow..\u201d He started \u201cI had no idea you could even attempt that! I mean, I\u2019m not exactly small\u201d He giggled and grabbed his cock with another throaty moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god, he\u2019s still unaware?!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mmmmm,\" Kory moans, \"This feels so much more\u2026 INTENSE than anything I've ever experienced before.\" He slowly starts to move his paw up and down his cock, which is so thick that even he can't wrap his fingers entirely around it anymore. He then pulls his hand back and rests it gently on his knee, smiling down at you. \"I shouldn't get carried away; I don't want to have all the fun to myself, now, do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggles, not batting an eye at the dumbfounded awe that you stare up at him with. Not only had he outgrown another set of clothes, he was now in danger of outgrowing the bedroom, and his cock had gotten so huge that, even ignoring the insanity of the idea of a nearly-twenty-foot tall red panda, he was now carrying around a slab of meat that probably wouldn't fit in any pair of pants even if he was normal sized. And yet, he was still oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" he asks, looking down at you still grinning. \"I mean, I know you're not going to try to fit me inside of you again, but that doesn't mean we have to stop\u2026 does it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screaming of your brain is drowned out by your emotions and your own throbbing tigerhood. \"No, of course not, dear,\" you breathe heavily, taking in the now-overwhelming panda musk that was now filling the room. The heat radiating from his cock is stunning, and as you touch it again, another bit of pre spurts out, running down your hand and sending a shiver up your spine and causing Kory to moan even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, Ash, that feels so GOOD!\" You realize that he must have been intentionally trying to keep his voice down earlier, as now that he isn't trying to control himself as much, his words boom through the house; you're pretty sure that, if they're home, your neighbors on either side can probably hear him. That would be the least of your problems soon enough, you realize, but it's still somewhat troubling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing your other hand on the opposite side of your boyfriend's cock, you steady your feet against Kory's as you begin to work up and down his shaft. He's certainly more squirmy than he was before, though that may be a result of the diminishing space in the room he has to work with. You lean over his stomach as you continue to paw him off, reaching your tongue out and licking the slit of his cock, which causes an even larger spurt of pre than before to shoot out onto your muzzle. Freeing one of your paws from his cock, you move it down and place it against one of Kory's balls, an action that feels not entirely unlike palming a basketball - a warm, fuzzy basketball. Kory seems to like this a lot, as it causes him to involuntarily kick his right footpaw, sending it through the bedroom wall into the living room, causing a sickening splintering sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooops,\" he says as he grins sheepishly, his tongue sticking out slightly in an extremely playful, cute manner. Damn, the damage to the wall really sucks, but this situation is so incredibly hot that it may end up being worth it. And, as you look up at the horny panda and see the cracks in the plaster forming in the ceiling and walls which are struggling to contain his head and shoulders, that hole is just the beginning of the damage. He's definitely getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving both hands back onto his cock, you start to work even more furiously, and Kory's moaning gets louder and louder. \"Ohh, Ash!\" he cries out after another minute. \"I'm getting close!\" His body is now nearly doubled over on itself, as he's come about as close as he can to filling up the room. You're definitely starting to feel claustrophobic, but Kory doesn't seem to mind, as if this is -- like everything else -- commonplace for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next, however, is anything but commonplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can sense Kory's muscles begin to clench, and out of the corner of your eye, you see his toes curl. Wanting to not miss the most amazing climax you'll ever get to see, you focus intently on his bulging cockhead, which is red as a cherry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thrusts his hips and begins to cum, though, he rapidly begins to get bigger, seemingly in time with his cumshots. The first shot is so intense that the force of it nearly knocks you back, or maybe that was the force of Kory's head pushing through the ceiling into the attic above. The wall behind his back gives in and collapses, exposing the outside, and he begins to stretch out his legs, causing that wall too to crumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second spurt causes his head to go entirely through the roof, and his cock is now double in size from what it was just a few minutes before. At this point, you can only wrap your arms around it and hang onto it like a life preserver, as your growing panda destroys the rest of your house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the third shot, his legs have cleared the other side of the house, and only the frame and about half of the roof is left, the rest having come crashing down around the now-fifty-foot tall Kory. The fourth and final one simply finishes the rest of the job, sending the shingles flying all over his stomach, causing you to wince as debris rains down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, it's over. As the dust settles, you look up to see a gigantic, if very much satisfied, red panda where your house used to be. Still clinging to his cock, which is now longer than you are tall, you try to catch your breath, coming to terms with what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Kory said, looming over you as he pants, \"That was\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable?\" you suggest, hoping that surely by now he MUST be aware of his growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he chuckles, \"it's certainly satisfying. But, still... there's just this one thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould it be? you think to yourself. Could he finally be aware of what's happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKory smiles and looks down at you. \"You see...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While you were distracted, Kory was slowly pulling away, still grinning widely as his arm rested on top of your shoulders. You couldn't help but stare at him before you felt his arms slowly pulling away from around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish we had more time together, but I have to head back to our place to finish up a project for tomorrow. I'll be skipping Literature today to get everything done.\u201d Kory's voice shook you from your thoughts, and you just gave a small nod before it really registered. Your face sank, but his finger pushed your cheek up, forcing you to keep gazing at him. \u201cHey, I'm only going to be gone for a couple of hours. You're not gonna miss me <i>that</i> much, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKory gave a small chuckle, but you only manage to nod a little. \u201cI'll admit, I've been a bit distracted thinking of you today...\" He seemed to look down a bit, grinning as he looked noticed the slight bulge developing in your pants. \"Okay, more distracted than usual.\u201d His hand moved from your cheek to press onto your shoulder, his grip tight against you as he held you. Your arm started to reach around his, but the sight of your watch forced you to stop. You slowly turned your arm away, making sure not to touch him with the watch as you kept your other arm firmly to his body. \u201cBut I want to keep my eyes on you today...\u201d You looked over the strange symbols plastered over the face of your watch. \u201cI think that there's someth...\u201d Your words drifted into silence as you saw Kory's sly smile. You took a moment to realize what you just said, and you can't force yourself to stammer out anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll see if I can finish early. We should have the evening together if I can.\u201d Kory's hand slid down your arm, holding it tight. \u201cAnd I'll take care of dinner tonight. I'd rather not leave you near an open flame, if you're going to spend the entire time daydreaming about me.\u201d He leaned down to you, his mouth gently pressed to your forehead. You couldn't make a sound as you felt it. You only managed to nod your head, brushing into his neck as you did. You left a kiss right above the rim of his shirt before the two of you pulled apart, his tail sliding off from your leg as he turned away. You were still grinning as you gave him a small wave goodbye as you watched him turn to walk out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence filled the air as the door closed, and you sighed before turning around. The others in the room suddenly resumed their exercises, the clang of metal sounding out again by the time you looked around the room. You only glanced over everybody, but you couldn't be sure if they were uncomfortable, upset, or even jealous of Kory. However, nobody seemed surprised to see the massive red panda that had just left. Something was definitely weird, and after what had just happened, you weren't in any state to continue your workout. You quickly picked up your things before walking out, your mind wandering somewhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the watch as you walked through the campus, too distracted to care where you were going. Your thoughts turned more and more towards it, trying to remember exactly when everything had happened. Things were normal before Kory had left for the weekend. He surprised you when he came back, but you were the only one who seemed to notice. Then, a few minutes ago, he had managed it again, somehow sneaking up on you while he was another foot or so taller and a good deal stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't any other explanation for it. The only thing that might've done it was the watch that you had on. You could see one the hands on it ticking along smoothly, but you weren't sure what it was keeping track of. Glancing around for the nearest clock, you fumble and quickly lift your watch up, trying to compare it to the large clock installed on the side of a nearby building. It took a couple of minutes to be certain, but the clock's hands weren't moving at the same rate. You could only guess what it was doing as you took it off, flipping it around and trying to get a good look at the back of it. It seemed ordinary enough to you, but after a few moments of examining the watch before you remembered something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKory had done something with the watch to get it started again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any tools or anything besides his hands, Kory had done something to get the watch started again. That meant that there had to be some way of adjusting the watch, if you could figure out how. There were a few knobs along the edges, but they had never responded before. On closer inspection, you could see a few scratches along the back. It might be possible to pry the watch open, though you weren't sure exactly how it might work. You would have to ask Kory when you got a chance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts snap back to Kory as you grip the watch by the strap. If the watch <i>had</i> done something, then it would explain how Kory had inexplicably grown over the last few days, and the last few hours. You always had a funny feeling in your arm whenever the watch brushed up against him. It happened back when you first kissed, and when you held him this morning... It even happened a little while ago. So, if you were right, then the next time you saw Kory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't sure whether you were more distracted by the memories of your embrace, or by the idea of Kory changing more. You had always found him attractive, but the idea of him as a massive, powerful hunk was even more difficult for you to ignore. You could imagine him easily throwing an arm around you, pulling you into his chest as he looks at you with the warm smile he always gave you. You could reach up and pull yourself up against his neck, nuzzling up against his body and press your mouth to his, feeling his sheath press up to yours as the two of you kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were snapped out of your reverie by the sudden stampede of furs coming through the area. A quick glance back up at the clock told you that it was almost time for you to head to Literature. You stood up rather quickly, wanting to avoid the glances that numerous people were giving you as they walked by. You never found time to change from your workout clothes, and you had to assume that the rumors of you and Kory were only spreading more. Hoping that nobody had noticed the slight shape forming in your pants, you started dashing towards your class, uncertain of what you were going to do. Literature usually wasn't too busy, and you normally spent the time speaking with Kory. If he was gone, then you might get some time to examine the watch in closer detail. However, if Kory had changed again, then you didn't want to be surprised the next time you saw him. The idea of running in, only to have him looming over, easily dragging you in after him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay. Being surprised wouldn't be too bad. But you couldn't keep on acting confused every time you saw him. If you could get a better idea of exactly how much he's changed, it might be useful in helping you act normal the next time you saw him. You didn't use it too often, but you might be able to check through your phone for a photos or a text conversation that could help clear things up a bit.</span></div></div>",

You turn your head down a bit as you feel a rabbit's tail lightly wiggling against your thigh. He sits right next to you, supposedly to watch TV with you. But at a glance, you can see that his eyes are busy looking right at your chest and neck. You only let off a quiet chuckle as you roll your head slowly, letting your neck tense and shift around. The rabbit's leg shifts against yours as he watched, and you could feel him sliding away slightly when his gaze met yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is it? I was... I wasn't looking at you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiight. Let me know when you figure out what's so interesting about the wall, then.\" You can't help but smile as you felt Alan turning away, his blush clear as he crossed his arms huffed a bit. You smile and just pull him in, giving his head a quick ruffle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a coincidence that the you and Alan had met. You had decided to rent out the spare room in order to earn a bit of extra cash, and he had been the only one that you were comfortable with accepting. Most of the smaller guys that you had met were a bit frightened the moment they saw you, and had passed up the place after taking a quick look around. On the other hand, you didn't trust any of the jocks to leave the house intact when they get a little reckless. The party you held last year taught you that the hard way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you first met Alan, You had expected him to run off like most of the others. He had the same cute, nervous expression on his face when he saw you walking out to greet him. His ears drooped a tiny bit, and he always seemed a little scrawny to you. However, while he seemed nervous about the idea of living with you, he had liked the look of the place. You were quite surprised when he agreed to take the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did take him a few days before he was willing to do anything beside head straight to his room and close the door. He only poked his head out for the first time while you were cooking dinner. He had meekly asked for some after seeing the rather sizable amount you had made for yourself. That night was the first time the two of you actually spent a bit of time talking to one another, but after he got used to speaking with you, the two of you seemed to get along great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, Alan started getting more comfortable around the house. He was always a little jumpy if you suddenly came in or if you managed to sneak up on him. It was always amusing to see how much he jumped whenever you suddenly grabbed his shoulder from behind. However, it quickly become a natural occurrence to the two of you, and it felt like most of the time, he ended up brushing his tail against you whenever he jumped. You couldn't help but think that he was doing it intentionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou certainly didn't mind that. You enjoyed getting a bit of attention, and more than a few people would want to get their hands on your body. It was part of the reason you were always training hard, and you were usually more than happy to let someone get a good feel of your arms. You were quite a bit taller than most others, at six feet and a few inches on top. And with the lifting that you've been doing ever since middle school, you dwarfed most of the people you've met. Combined with your light gray fur and your fierce grin, you certainly had the look of a predator. But because of that, most of the people were a bit intimidated by you. Whenever you were in a bad mood, people tended to give you a wide breadth. Alan was the only one who had asked when you were upset, and he was the only one who had ever risked trying to cheer you up when you seemed like you might bite someone's head off. He had been quite worried when he tried to give you a hug, but ever since then, the two of you had grown more and more relaxed and comfortable with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with the amount of time you two spent together, you started suspecting Alan of having a bit of a crush on you. It was difficult to miss the stares that he would give you when you had arrived back from a workout, or when you were busy cooking. Even when the two of you were sitting together, you could notice his eyes glancing around your body and his hands restlessly fidgeting as his hand rest in your lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you had never said anything to him, you had grown fond of the idea of pulling him in tight and kissing him. Even though he was so shy, he always had a warmth that made him easy for you to speak to. The only thing keeping you from asking him out were the small signals he wanted to be the one to ask. With some of the quiet conversations he's made, it always felt like he was close to finding the courage to ask you out, and you didn't want to ruin that chance for him. It would feel too much like \"jumping him\", as it were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, Gren? I-i've got something to ask...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" You smile casually as you turn your head down. The TV was turned off at some point, and all of Alan's attention seems to be turned towards you. From the sound of it, Alan's going to try again. You happily reach a hand forward, before pulling him a little closer by the shoulder. Alan's eyes looking right at yours. He had a deep blush on his face this time, and you only let your hand move to his side, gently holding him in place. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I was wondering...\" Alan struggles to keep his eyes looking at yours, but he manages to keep speaking as his gaze falters. \"I-if you want... I mean, if you're interested... Would... Would you want to... You know... Go out with me sometime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break into a wide grin before leaning in, your lips pushing in against his. You hear a sudden gasp coming from him, your hands barely keeping him from jumping back as he felt it. The kiss only lasted for a second, but Alan was redder than you ever remember seeing him as you pulled away. \"There... That wasn't so hard, was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you knew I was going to ask? I... I thought I was...\" Alan's eyes are staring towards the ground as he speaks. You reach a hand forward, only giving a firm nod as you pulled him in closer, your arms now firm to his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering when you would. Took you a while.\" You lightly nuzzle in against one of his ears, chuckling as you just pull him close, your arms firm to his body. \"I'd love to go out with you sometime, Alan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-great!\" He just grins wide, nearly jumping into your lap as he tries to get his arms around you. You chuckle and just lift him in your arms, shifting onto your feet and holding him gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on... I got something for you. I've been saving it for when you were feeling brave enough to ask.\" You reach into your pocket, taking out a small box. You open it up for him, revealing a simple wooden charm on a string. You had found the charm somewhere in the woods, and had decided to attach the string yourself. The slight pattern and shape of it had reminded you of a curled-up rabbit, and it reminded you of Alan when you had seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushes a little bit as he took a good look at it. \"R-really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just something I thought would fit you.\" You grin as you just press the box into his hands, kissing his cheek as he stared. \"Something to remind you that you don't have to be nervous around me.\" You lightly pull the charm out, lifting it over his ears. He tries to keep exactly still for you as you place it onto his neck. You can almost swear you were feeling a warm tingling as you lowered it, it lightly tapping against his shirt as he reaches up and grasps it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only manages to make a small sound, before looking up at you. \"T-thanks... So, I'll meet you here after class tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" You yawn and stretch out a little as you stand up with him still in your arms. \"We'd better get a good night's sleep, then... Want to be awake for tomorrow.\" You smile as you see him nod eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right... Tomorrow...\" The two of you stand there, holding each other for another minute or so before breaking apart. You went straight to your room after, hoping to give him some time to process everything. Hopefully, tomorrow, the two of you could go out without him being worried about others seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it would be early tomorrow when something odd happens.</span></div></div>",

You groggily look at the alarm clock, shaking your head a little bit. The red numbers displayed the time clearly. With a grunt, you turn back to the door way. You can see Alan's shape in front, and you rubbed your eyes a bit to try to clear them out. \u201cAlan, it's six in the morning. What's wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry...\u201d He slouches a little bit, his ears brushing against the door frame as he does. \u201cI just... felt a little weird today...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren't sick or anything, are you?\u201d You yawn and stretch out before slowly trying to sit up, your sheets falling from your chest and piling near your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, nothing like that... Just a little odd.\u201d He had put on the same tight shirt and jeans that he usually wore, and he shifts side to side as you look at him. \u201cI mean, it feels like the roof got a little lower or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThought you said that the place was comfortable enough for you.\u201d You yawn and slowly slide off the bed, stretching out a little bit. You could see Alan turn away nervously. Letting out a quiet chuckle, you reach over to your shelf, throwing on a pair of sweats over your boxers before speaking again. \u201cWhat, having second thoughts about your living arrangements or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan's head shakes wildly in response, and you only smile as you walk up to him, placing a firm hand on his shoulder. \u201cOf course not!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and lean in, nuzzling his cheek for a moment before giving him a squeeze. \u201cMmmm. That's good to hear. I doubt I'd find a better roommate.\u201d His blush grows deeper as you hold him, and you keep him there for a moment before slowly releasing. You press your forehead to his, only leaning in a little to do so. \"Hm... Your temperature feels okay... Don't think you're sick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinks a few times as he feels you leaning in against him. He looks up at you for a moment, before he suddenly realizes what's happening. He was incredibly red, and you could swear he would jump out the window just to avoid being seen like this. You just grinned and took a hold on his hand. \u201cCome on. If we're both up, I might as well make some breakfast for us. You should take it easy until you can get your bearings again, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives a small nod in response, following you out of the room. You chuckle quietly as you moved to the kitchen, lightly pulling him along with you. Alan sits down at the table and staring at you while you work. You let your tail brush gently over your legs as you cook, grabbing a few things from the cabinets and turning on the stove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're making a bit much, aren't you?\u201d Alan asks with a rather quiet voice, bending a little to look over the food you're cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot any more than usual... Is your appetite not very good today or something?\u201d You turn your head, a little curious as Alan sits. However, his gaze quickly turns down to his hands, and he seems to murmur something to himself before responding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, it's fine...\u201d Alan continues staring into his hands as you worked, clearly still lost in thought. \"I guess I'm just a little out of it...\" He only looked back up when you placed his plate in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press your hand onto the top of his head, ruffling his fur a little bit. \"Just didn't sleep well, maybe?\" You place your own plate nearby, sitting next to him. He shakes his head before picking up a fork and getting to work on his meal. \"If you say so. Just take it easy, okay, little guy?\" You start to wolf down your own meal, only just noticing Alan's blush as he ate rather absentmindedly. You can't help but smile when you notice him looking around, glancing at you between his bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finish, you lean back in your chair, tilting it back a bit as you look at Alan. His plate is empty, but he's still staring at it as he thinks. You reach over the table, grabbing his hand suddenly. He looks up, a little startled as you hold him. \"Come on, Alan. What's on your mind? You've been out of it all morning. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...\" He paused for a moment, his eyes level with yours for a moment. He suddenly stands up, pulling you a little with him. \"Hey, Blake? How tall are you, again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Six foot three, I think. Didn't you ask me that before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right... Just making sure... I think I forgot. Felt like there was more of a difference between us.\" Alan moved a little, shifting on his feet, rising up and down a few inches as he moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, a two inch difference isn't <i>that</i> much.\" Alan seemed to flinch as you spoke, his ears sagging a little bit. \"What, disappointed or something? Come on, you're already one of the bigger bunnies that I know.\" You smile and nuzzle in against his cheek, though he shakes his head a little bit. But before you pull away, he finally perks up a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right. Thanks, Blake. Think I just... you know. Need to clear my head and everything. Um... You remember how much I weighed? Last time I checked, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a random question, but you shrug it off as you pick up the plates, moving them to the sink. \"Um... 180 or so from last week. Why? Need to check again or something? Maybe you should check again, if you're feeling out of it. Make sure you didn't lose anything weight you're sick or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah... Definitely need to.\" He quickly dashed out of the room, leaving you shaking your head a little as you tried to understand exactly what was going on. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whatever was wrong with Alan, it was definitely rattling him. He'd left the kitchen in a hurry after which you heard him running the water in the bathroom down the hall. After a few more minutes, though, you heard the door slam and caught a glipse of him heading down the road at a jog. On the table were his wallet and keys:  forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twinge of concern washes over you and, for a moment, you consider going after him. You stop, though, realizing that it's probably nerves over the impending date you and he have scheduled. It occurs to you that Alan may not have ever dated another guy, before. It could be that you are his first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought makes you smile but also gives you a twinge of concern. Young guys could be awfully nervy their first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should phone; just to reassure him. He always had his mobile on him:  all you need is the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go through his wallet but find no number, just his driver's license.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan Whittaker,\" you huff under your breath, \"don't go all Single White Female on me, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't find his phone number but, after looking around, you find his phone by the couch in the living room. Deciding that whatever happens, happens, you go about your day and wait for him to come home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClasses are fairly ordinary, a bit more homework from your calculus professor than you would have liked, but still tolerable. You didn't see Alan anywhere on campus all day. Your stoic decision to not get worried has started to seem increasily irrational by the time you arrive back at your countryside home. You look to the mountains in the distance and sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you call the police?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun continues to set in the west as you wrestle with your conscience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gren?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan's voice takes you by surprise and you jump. Spinning around, you see him just beyond the door in the shadows of the first floor landing. Cast in darkness, you can only just make out his general, long-eared outline. Even if you couldn't tell by the tremor in his voice, his use of your last name, \"Gren\", was a sure sign he was nervous. You'd only gotten him to start calling you \"Blake\" about two weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nervous rabbit falters, not answering you right away. \"I ... I think something's wrong with me,\" he says. \"I mean ... really wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a bit as you step forward. \"Geez, Alan; what?  What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he steps into the light of the living room lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink and can't help but stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan stands up to his full height, a full foot and a half taller than you. His muscles have grown and he looks like his clothing were just painted on, it's so tight. His big feet slap against the carpet as he ambles forward. Easily seven-foot-nine, the towering rabbit doesn't get terribly close but, rather, just hangs his head and shyly says, \"I...I'm growing.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You quirk a brow and sigh with relief that it wasn't anything serious. \u201cBut, Alan, you told me you\u2019ve already seen tens of doctors about your size. Apart from congratulating you and looking slightly bewildered when they thought you weren't looking, all checked out fine, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan took a step forward, having to bend awkwardly under the suddenly too low frame and took on an utterly surprised look. \u201cYou\u2019re serious, aren't you?\u201d He hummed lowly. \u201cYou really don\u2019t see me as any different? Nothing\u2026\u201d He stretched his figure upright, his long ears splaying out to the sides as his head met the ceiling \u201c.. Out of the ordinary here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force a smile and suppress a chuckle \u201cThat was kind of my first hint of your attraction towards me. That you said this place was comfortable for you..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the bookshelves guarding one corner of the living room with mostly Alan\u2019s fantasy and sci-fi fiction, you lean down to dig through the bottom row of your own more gloomy horror novels, shockingly heavy on werewolf titles, and pull out a stack of papers hidden between \u201cCry Wolf\u201d and \u201cMoon Called\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou show the half crumbled papers to be house listings, big red circles around each with high ceilings or permissions to build them, and Alan lets out a soft gasp and whimper as suddenly his necklace started to shine with a faint icy-blue aura. Both of you stare at the illuminated jewelry and Alan sighs \u201cNot again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few long seconds nothing seemed to happen other than Alan looking down on you, his handsome face briefly distorting with anxiety before turning to one of pleasure. He puffs out his white fluffy chest, making his fur-tight shirt pull even tighter and snap a few strands across his shoulders. His muzzle opens slightly, and with a hushed moan Alan began to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head pressed further against the unmoving ceiling, making his legs bend and his thighs take more and more of Alan\u2019s increasing weight. His jeans, already bought to be tight on him two feet ago was unsurprisingly ready to burst, and with the sound of stretching cloth and flesh it did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan\u2019s jeans burst on both sides showing his milky and randomly black dotted fur barely covering the strained definition of his muscles underneath, as his growing body unclothed itself for you. Within less than 10 seconds Alan had gone from an already impressive seven-foot-nine to nearly nine, and his necklace was still glowing merrily. His shirt had begun to rise up over his lean stomach, showing more muscle definition than you\u2019d expect from a rabbit, and the tears over his shoulders ripped across his chest and down his sides, pulling the strands of the fabric so thin and so far apart the cloth was noticeably less opaque; almost like a winning wet-shirt contestant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost noticeable change, at least to Alan, was at his crotch. The jeans did a valiant job at keeping him contained, the seams stronger here than anywhere else, but there was so much more rabbit to contain as well. And it was clear to both of you that whatever Alan was going through, he enjoyed it muchly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan blushed furiously at this point, not planning his long anticipated date to start and end quite this quickly. He moved his heavy body and sat down in front of, and half filling, the doorway he entered through earlier. His larger-than-life paws extended out towards you and with one final surge of size pushing his head up to ten-feet-eleven, and finally ripping his tortured trousers to tatters around his legs, making them look like very revealing hotpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me.. you saw.. THAT\u201d Alan panted heavily, resting his paws in his lap to hide the obvious bulges. \u201cBecause I really don\u2019t think I can go through this alone..\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His head gives a feeble nod, the desperation clear on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" He's still panting for breath, one of his paws still covering his lap while the other rises to try to hold his chest. His hand pauses as it pushes against the bottom of his pec, his head suddenly twitching downward when it makes contact with the tense-looking muscle... \"It must've been a few feet... You saw it, right? Please tell me you noticed...\" His eyes jump towards you, but a sinking feeling fills your chest as you try to meet them. You shake your head briefly, turning your head down towards the ground. Alan's barely holding back tears as he looks down at you, \"Gren... Please... I can't...\" His breathing is labored, and he's trying to cover up with just his hands, barely able to conceal any part of his impressive, toned body. \"This is crazy... If this keeps up, I'm going to...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan... Alan, it's okay.\" You quietly move up against him, placing your hand firmly against his wrist, squeezing as much as you're able to. As usual, he doesn't budge an inch, but his ears still shift a little, turning to your direction. \"I promise, you''ll be okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gren, I don't know what's going on!  Nobody's this big! But suddenly, I've grown to this size...And you can't... You must think I'm insane! What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to deal with the fact that I'm-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan. Alan!\u201d You try to shout, but you're not sure if he can even hear you over his near-breakdown. \u201cAlan, take a breath, okay? It's okay! I believe you!\" You reach forward, clenching his hand firmly like you always have before. But even when you grab him, he's still talking over you, too caught up in his rant to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, you must think I'm crazy! Hell, if you told me you were shrinking, I wouldn't believe it, either! But I can't stand this! If I you don't even believe that I'm growing, how am I supposed to-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace for a moment, before bracing yourself against his arm. You suddenly jump, pulling down his arm as you do. His arm flexes automatically when you grab him, and you manage to sling yourself up enough to press your arm against his shoulders. The moment you can reach it, you firmly pull his head down to meet yours. He's hunched over a little awkwardly as you pull his forehead to yours, your eyes locked to his. \"Alan! I said I believe you, okay? I believe you're growing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... What? You do?\u201d You still spot traces of tears on his eyes, but he's now staring right at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlan...\" He's still breathing hard, but you give a small nod to him, confirming your words for him. \"Look, Alan... I don't know what's going on either. I mean, to me, you've always been 10' 11\u201d.\u201d Alan flinches at the number, the record-breaking height a shock to him. You try to give him a comforting pat against his shoulder. \u201cBut I can tell you're worried. So, I promise, I'll do whatever I can to help you through it, okay? I don't need to see you growing to know that whatever's happening is a shock to you, and if there's anything I can do to help, I want to do it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGre- Blake...\u201d You're suddenly pulled off your feet, the familiar lightness filling your body as Alan literally sweeps you off your feet to pull you in tight against his chest. \u201cThanks...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and softly squeeze against his shoulder as you lean in. \"Of course, Alan.\" Your nose bumps softly against his cheek, the shade of red showing up clear on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a few minutes before Alan's calmed down enough to let you go. He shuffles a little awkwardly as he looks to you, lowering you to the floor as he looks at you. \"Um... Blake...\" He awkwardly fumbles with his hand again, still trying to cover up. \"Can you... You know... Turn away for me? It's... Kind of embarrassing... I'd prefer if...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right...\" You can't help but break into a small smile as you turn away. You hear a few heavy footsteps from behind you, the rabbit fumbling around for something as you wait. After a few couple of minutes of unsuccessfully searching, you have to shout, \"If you need it, there's a large blanket for you on the couch. You can cover up with that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" The surprise in his voice is obvious, but after a few moments, it sounds like he's found it. There's a slight thump as he sits onto the floor, and you turn in time to catch him sitting on the floor, the blanket strewn across his lap. \"Thanks, Blake... I... I know it's kind of our first date and all, but I didn't really think we'd... you know... You'd see my unmentionables tonight...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You try to turn away again, not quite sure how to break it to him. \"Um... Alan... I've... Kind of... Already seen...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" The entire building shakes from the sheer volume of his shout, and you're almost certain that the neighbors heard him this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Um... You... don't know, right? Well, you've always... No, you haven't... This you... You in this universe?\" Your head's a little fuzzy as you try to figure out how to best explain it. \"Whatever it is... Well, before, you said you had a hard time getting clothing that fits you... And... We kind of set up the blanket for you after the first time your pants...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh...\" Alan's ears slouch, and from what you can hear, it sounds like he's trying to pull the blanket over his head. You can't help but break into a small smile as you approach him again. You reach under the blanket, fumbling around before grasping his paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Take it easy. This must be crazy for you, too... But we'll figure this out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you sit in silence for a few minutes. But eventually, you feel him move. The blanket slips enough for his head to peek out from the edge of it. The rabbit's still worried, but despite it all, you spot the small smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" </span></div></div>",

His eyes seemed to grow wider and wider as Alan's height increased, until they were as big as saucers when the incredible spurt ended. When the now-giant rabbit spoke, his voice was much deeper and louder. Those huge paws, as thick as they were, couldn't quite cover the bulge between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf could only stare in silence for a couple of moments while his brain caught up with the reality of the situation. In the meantime, Alan sat there mostly naked, his ears flattened against the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...I don't believe it.\" The wolf could hear a ringing in his ears, and it was hard to catch his breath. He was stricken with the feeling that a part of the world had opened up to him that he should never have seen. Either his entire understanding of the universe was flawed, or...there was something seriously wrong with Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake? Blake...\" The rabbit boomed at him, leaning closer to peer. \"Maybe you should sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nodded dumbly and sat there, right on the floor. For a moment he couldn't really understand what he was seeing. That couldn't have been Alan's leg. It was far too big, sprawled across the floor like a huge, mottled-fur couch. The rabbit shouldn't...shouldn't be filling up his room. No one should be that size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt paws around him, gently pushing him down on the floor. His vision blurred as he stared at the ceiling, and he thought <i>Yes, a nap would be good</i> before he lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*          *          *           *          *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake woke up on the couch, quite suddenly. He gasped, then held his head against the dull throbbing in it, then wondered if the surreal scene that played out before him was a dream. He looked around. He was in their apartment, but Alan was nowhere to be found. Maybe it was a dream. He breathed a sigh of relief, even though it raised all sorts of other questions about what would cause such weird sensations in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good, you're awake.\" A voice rumbled near him, familiar but much deeper and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf startled and stared at the corner. Sure enough, Alan was there in his near eleven-foot glory. The rabbit gave him a sheepish grin and a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that was a dream,\" the wolf moaned, slumping back onto the couch. So it was true. Alan had grown, inexplicably, and that had all kinds of terrible, wonderful implications. Magic was real. There was more to the world than he had ever dared hoped for. He should have felt like a kid who had just seen Santa at Christmas, but there was a mild dread in the pit of his stomach instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish it were,\" Alan said, shifting his massive weight closer to the couch. He bumped it slightly, sending the furniture scooting a couple of inches along the floor. \"Sorry,\" he muttered with folded ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Blake shrugged. He hadn't broken anything yet, but at his size in this room it was only a matter of time. \"How...how long have you been having these sorts of episodes or whatever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan perked his ears, the tall appendages slapping against the ceiling before he remembered to sit down on his haunches. \"Just a few days ago. When we...you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got together?\" Blake couldn't help but grin as the giant rabbit nodded and blushed. Even despite the fact that he was twice the size he should have been, he was still the same old Alan. \"But...how big were you before all this started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you don't remember anything?\" Alan looked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf shook his head. \"No, I just...I just remember the last one. Before then you were about eight feet tall, right?\" Again, Alan nodded. \"That's the size you should be, in my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a few inches over five feet a few days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan shook his head and bit his lower lip with those huge buck teeth. Blake felt a stirring in his pants that he was surprised by. It's nice to know that he's warming to the idea of such an oversized partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...it's been happening a lot. And every time this thing glows.\" The rabbit lifted a blue crystal that dangled from a silver chain. Up until now, it had been mostly hidden in his thick fur. It was an easy thing to miss -- unless it glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake perked his ears and leaned forward to stare at it. It was comically undersized against Alan's large fingers, but he could see it all right. It looked just like a quartz crystal, only it was the color of turquoise, deep and rich. The wolf wouldn't have guessed it as anything special, but plainly it was what was causing the rabbit's excessive spurts. \"That's...weird. Where did you get it from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan quirked his ears in thought for a moment. Then he said:</span></div></div>",

It was odd; it seemed like something he should remember. Like something with great affectionate value to him. Like\u2026 A totem? That was the best description the rabbit could come up with before Blake interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if this necklace made you\u2026 uh, grow\u201d Blake grimaced as he said those words, and forced himself to stare at everything besides the big rabbit filling the room. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you taken it off?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a joke, right?\u201d Alan glared down at his wolven companion who continued to stare at the wall beside him or at the tall ears stretching along the ceiling \u201cAs if that thought never occurred to me too.\u201d He pulled the string up and nearly forced his head through the ceiling as the strap caught on his chin. \u201cIt does grow with me, it seems, but it took the liberty of shrinking just small enough to be stuck first.\u201d He spoke as if the necklace had an intention with being around his neck and enlarging him, but as far as either of them knew, it may have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake raised a finger and opened his mouth before getting cut off \u201c.. and no, the string doesn\u2019t cut with any scissors or knives we own either.\u201d Alan shuffled carefully on the floor making the floor creak in protest as he lifted his weight up on his arms and stretched one long leg out along the floor and his glare softened \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Gren.. I never meant to be.. Whatever it is I\u2019ve become\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, for the first time since he came to Blake could look Alan eye to eye and gave him a stern look \u201cWhat you\u2019ve become, Alan dear, is a bigger version of \u2018you\u2019; and \u2018you\u2019 are the only person ever to see through what everyone else sees in me and dig your way through to my heart. I saw it in your eyes then, and I see it now. You\u2019re the best thing to happen to me, and who can argue that more of a good thing is worse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was unsure of whether he had sounded like the cheesy, babbling, dullard that he felt saying it, or the comforting and caring wolf he wanted to show Alan he could be. All he could do was to look for any signs in the large rabbit\u2019s eyes as to whether he was successful or not. He at least felt the need to emphasize his point by reaching out and placing a paw onto Alan\u2019s stretched legs, and felt the muscles under his paw contract and shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan had been able to find a blanket to wrap around his body before the wolf had woken up, but now as his legs had moved so had the mass that seemed to round the blanket at the rabbit\u2019s crotch. And with the contact, the spheres seemed to jump and round the fabric further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan blushed furiously and attempted to cover himself up with his paws. Blake withdrew his paw and stared openly. While Alan had doubled his overall size, the bulges that now seemed to push his legs apart slightly - much to the bunny\u2019s discomfort - had clearly done more growing than that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan whimpered and ran a paw across the blanket which concealed less of him than it did a minute ago, and sighed. \u201cI guess there\u2019s no reason to pretend you didn\u2019t see that.\u201d He said, and moved his paws to the side letting the smaller wolf get a good look at the distending crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sat there motionlessly, while the blanket heaved to Alan\u2019s heartbeat and an alluring musk began to draft through the room. The large rabbit moved carefully forward, getting on his knees and paws and leaned in over Blake before, in one fluid motion, planting his large lips across the wolf\u2019s entire muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Antonio Jaliero was on the track team and was one of the only sports-minded guys at Avondale College Blake could stomach. He was taller than Blake and leaner, too. But most cheetahs were. His spots, however, were curious in that they seemed to spiral outwards from his head in wider and wider circles as they approached his waist. Below that, they grew smaller and tighter, again, until his feet became lost in their umber tone. Seven feet tall, he was always the guy who loomed over everyone else when the local jocks in the sports fraternity, Kalama-U, dragged him along for pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy he was standing at his door, Blake didn\u2019t know. Glancing out the window, he could just see the big basketball player standing by the second-floor walk-up to his condo apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d Alan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a man over ten feet tall, he sounded awfully timid. Part of that was probably due to him being mostly naked, now. The only parts of his clothing that were left after his growth spurts were tiny rings of fabric around his ankles and a shredded \u201ccollar\u201d of his shirt that stretched across his broad shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnton,\u201d Blake said. \u201cAntonio; from the gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe cheetah?\u201d Alan\u2019s eyes widened a bit and he chewed his lower lip. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio knocked again while Alan and Blake argued. Alan didn\u2019t want to risk discovery and thought they should just wait until the jock went away. Blake, on the other hand, thought it would look suspicious because their neighbors in the condo clearly knew that he was home and, if Antonio started asking around, he\u2019d find out. Plus, his car was in the side lot next to their tiny, picturesque home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Blake said, \u201cAnton is pre-med \u2026 sports medicine, I think. Worse comes to worst, maybe he\u2019ll know what\u2019s happening to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think they teach magic curses in sports med?\u201d Alan asked with uncharacteristic sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake just smiled and left the living room. Antonio was knocking again as he crossed into the kitchen and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d the cheetah said. He looked down at Blake with his bright, yellow eyes. His tail, poked through the tiny hole in the back of his jogging shorts, swished impatiently. \u201cYou forget?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blinked. \u201cForget? Forget what?\u201d The humor of his statement didn\u2019t strike him but made Antonio smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny,\u201d he said. \u201cThe party \u2026 the fund-raiser at the frat house.\u201d When Blake looked blankly in return, the cheetah frowned. \u201cTo raise money for the new bio-hike trails out at Ashcone Park?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshcone Park was the national nature preserve about an hour\u2019s drive from town. Blake went there, often, to go hiking along the old, weathered slopes of the extinct volcano. The rich, deep forests around its base had originally been cut by logging companies before a native tribal group managed to get them to stop cutting down their ancestral home. With equal money from the state, they\u2019d turned the ground into a national park and nature preserve. They could still use it for cultural observances but, most of it ...most of the time... was open to the public. Blake loved the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had no memory of some sort of trail fundraiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Antonio was looking concerned. \u201cYou okay, man?\u201d He put his furred palm against Blake\u2019s forehead. The wolf tolerated it but scowled. \u201cYou running a fever?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sick,\u201d he replied. \u201cI just haven\u2019t heard of this, before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio cocked one brow. From the other room, he could hear Alan rustling around. He was probably trying to move around a bit on his hands and knees since he couldn\u2019t stand up any more. The ceilings may have been high but even ten feet was shorter than Alan, now. He wouldn\u2019t have believed it if he hadn\u2019t seen it; he still had trouble believing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake:  you\u2019re the one who told us about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told us about it. When you ran into us a couple weeks ago out on the trails. You were hiking; me and the rest of the basketball team were doing our jogging on the trails. You said you\u2019d met a park ranger or something who said they were raising funds to fix some old trails and build a few new ones. We hatched the plan, there, to put on a fundraising party at the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Blake knew that Antonio was pulling his leg. But why would he make up a story like this? He wasn\u2019t like most of the muscle-headed morons who lived at Kalama-U. Maybe one of the others had put him up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, Anton,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re saying this, but\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a crash\u2014of something fragile breaking\u2014echoed from the adjacent living room. Blake looked back, concerned, and Antonio jumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Blake said, wondering if Alan was okay. There was no sound or cry from the room after the breaking noise so he guessed something had fallen over. \u201cLook, we\u2019re busy right now, and\u2014\u201d</span></div></div>",

The long-legged athlete was easily able to get past him in a few steps. He stopped, staring, at the sight through the door into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake joined him with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShattered lamp on the floor next to one of Alan\u2019s oversized feet, the now-giant rabbit sat on his cotton-tailed rear with the blanket, again, over his lap. The insides of his ears were reddened in embarrassment. He raised a hand, shyly, and waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake grimaced and went back to close the outside door. \u201cSo, now that you know Alan\u2019s \u2018little problem\u2019, maybe you can...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck happened?\u201d Antonio exclaimed. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s \u2026 he\u2019s huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah. I am. Good call, there,\u201d Alan said with a bit more wryness than he probably intended. \u201cI\u2019ve been growing an inch or two in little spurts for the last few days.

You did give it to me! To \u2026 to feel confidence! I wore it the night you and I first, uh...\u201d he trailed off, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio chuckled and shook his head. \u201cSay no more.\u201d He clapped Blake on the shoulder and smirked. \u201cAlways knew I didn\u2019t have a chance; you like the small, shy ones, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow is not the time, Anton,\u201d the wolf snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this made sense. He didn\u2019t remember the meeting on the Ashcone Park trails, finding that pendant-thingy, or giving it to Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t remember that?\u201d Antonio asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the only thing,\u201d Alan said. \u201cEarlier he didn\u2019t even noticed I\u2019d been growing. Only when this thing glowed and I started getting bigger, again, did he finally see it as out of the ordinary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blinked. \u201cBut, this is impossible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagic,\u201d Antonio said. \u201cLook, clearly something\u2019s messed with you guys\u2019 heads. And I\u2019d wager it has something to do with that glowy-thingy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan furrowed his brow for a moment as the words sank in.

I have to get outside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panic in his booming voice was enough to spur Blake to action. Antonio was already out of the door, opening it wider for the outsized rabbit to have the best chance he could of squeezing through. Alan grunted as he thumped the short distance towards the door, getting noticeably larger with each step. Blake watched in moderate fascination as he watched the rabbit's leg muscles ripple through his thick fur, growing larger and stronger to hold up what must have been his rapidly increasing weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was nearly bent over double by the time he reached the door, and the proposition of him making it through without any damage was looking less and less likely. Still, Alan didn't waste any time trying. He immediately sank to one knee, the house shaking as he did, and thrust his head and shoulder through the door frame. The rabbit inhaled and his chest briefly swelled alarmingly thick, growing to fill the frame before he got it through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to have been thirteen feet tall by now, and he was still growing. He landed with a room-shaking thud on his side and tried pulling himself the rest of the way. Every movement shook the inside of the house a little worse as his weight (and strength) increased by leaps and bounds. Worse still, that endowment was growing to obscene proportions. That sheathed cock was nearly as thick as one of Alan's forearms, and the tip reached down nearly to the rabbit's knee! It flopped like a fallen log as he wiggled out of the shrinking frame, then pushed against one side as the balls under it surged larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake thought he wouldn't make it; by the time his knees were through, the house shuddered alarmingly every time he replaced his weight. Those massive paws of his were the last challenge to get through, and they were growing even larger all the time. The big wolf could hear Alan grunt, his voice astonishingly deep and loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're almost there,\" he heard Antonio say. \"Just be careful with your feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan's paws slammed against the wall, nearly taking it out. He stopped, and his paws grew to brush the opposite wall of the narrow hallway the door opened into. \"Shit! Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK. Just, be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit wiggled, then slid his paws through the door. His claws gouged a good chunk of the door on the way out, but considering he nearly ripped the door frame apart entirely it wasn't the worst that could have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake got out of the house just in time to see Alan crawl out into the front yard and stand up to his full height. The glowing pendant winked out and his height leveled off at what must have been...sixteen feet tall, if the fact that Antonio only came up to the top of his thigh was any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, oh my God. I'm outside and I'm NAKED.\" The rabbit's paws were wringing and his ears were flattened against his skull. He looked like he could die of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's go around the back. You can hide behind the fences there if you sprawl out. It'll be more comfortable too.\" Blake heard himself speaking, but he had no idea where the words were coming from. It was almost as if another person had thought them, and he was just tasked with the job of vocalizing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan thumped his way into the back and promptly sat down, leaving behind a trail of oversized pawprints pressed into the grass. Blake could scarcely believe this was happening. Wasn't there some kind of physical limit to how big someone could grow without tearing themselves apart? How much longer until Alan reached that? Or would the magic protect him from that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shut the back gate behind him. Alan was already sprawled out in the back yard, his enormous frame taking up a huge portion of it. He looked to be on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're getting worse all the time,\" he wailed, his voice shaking the windows of the house. \"How much bigger am I going to get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, babe.\" Antonio rubbed the rabbit's head, trying to soothe him. \"But we're going to figure this out before you get too much bigger, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Blake stepped up, suddenly remembering where he was. Here was this rabbit that he cared about, deeply, and he was hurting. \"I'm so, so sorry that this happened to you, Alan. I never meant for any of this. If there's any way for me to reverse it, I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat finally seemed to calm him, and he turned to face the wolf. Good heavens, his torso was the size of a billboard. \"I know you didn't mean for this to happen to me. The necklace was a really sweet gift. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt his ears darkening. \"You're welcome, Alan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio rolled his eyes as he appeared from behind the giant rabbit. \"Now that the tender moment has happened, perhaps we could turn our attention to how we stop Alan from getting any bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's blush deepened. Was the cheetah jealous or something? \"Sure. Though I'm not sure what sort of leads we have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah shrugged. \"Maybe we could scout around the trail where you found it in the first place; there might be some clues there. Or we could check the lost and found...if I lost a magic amulet in the woods, you'd bet I'd want it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan lifted the huge necklace in one paw and squinted at it. \"Or maybe we could take down these symbols and try to find out if they mean anything. They can't be here for no reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio quirked an ear. \"Maybe, but we wouldn't have a good idea of where to even start. I don't think any of us are well-versed in ancient or magical languages, are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's more to go on than stumbling around in the woods hoping to find something,\" Alan rumbled. It looked like he was getting a little testy. But who could blame him? In the past few hours he had practically tripled in height with no end in sight. He had gotten too big to be indoors, and there was no guarantee he'd ever be able to get small again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Antonio was opening his mouth to speak, his fangs flashing for a moment. He was a bit less understanding, and didn't take to snark too well. Blake had to speak up quickly to prevent him from saying something to escalate things.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201dMaybe it would be best if we split up?\u201d Blake said loudly as to interject before Antonio could let the situation take the better of his already sour mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pair of eyes both switched to glare down and over at the wolf who did his best to not sink straight into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan slammed a paw into the ground, making a scary impression in the dirt \u201cWhat?!.. You want to leave me here?\u201d The glow seemed to return even quicker than it had before deep within Alan\u2019s soft chestfur and the rabbit\u2019s body jumped a taller foot and then another, leaving his hand outsizing its previous print and a moan escaping his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Blake winced \u201cno, I\u2019d never leave you, Alan. I just feel that maybe we ought to look for more information about this thing\u201d He gestured meekly to the still faintly glowing jewelry; \u201cand since I doubt we will find any here aside from the markings, maybe Antonio and I ought to see what we can find; while you try to make sense of them.\u201d He attempted with a slight smile \u201cafter all, you were always the brainy one.\u201d And finished with <i> even if now you have the body too </i> in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit shrugged and sighed \u201cI guess.. Maybe you\u2019re right. But what if I grow bigger, Blake? What if I outgrow this yard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s eyes grew wide at the prospect as he glanced around the neatly trimmed grass, getting pulled up in mounds by the rabbit\u2019s sporadically expanding frame. Antonio coughed and shielded his face as his cheeks flushed. Yeah, he was definitely jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you do, then I\u2019ll definitely find you again, and hopefully I\u2019ll have an answer to this.. problem.\u201d Blake brushed his hand over Alan\u2019s leg and smiled up at a rabbit who seemed to express fear and pleasure at the same time, and very near tears. He needed to be strong for Alan, even at this size; Alan needed Blake to lean on\u2026 Metaphorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake\u2019s hand lingered, Alan pulled his legs up and hugged them close to his chest and buried his short muzzle between his knees. An adorably submissive act for his new stature had it not been for the tree of a limp cock that fell from his legs and nearly took out a chunk of their new granite water fountain right next to Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf stared and resisted the need to faint from awe and admiration while the cheetah rolled his eyes and promptly walked out of the gate with a burning blush evident in the white of his ears. Blake backed away slowly, while keeping his stare locked on the glistening ebony flesh while the faintest blue hue could be seen shimmering on the glossy surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he turned to exit the yard, Alan lifted his head and smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, babe.. Hurry back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the sidewalk, Antonio was there waiting for him, with his back turned; somehow seeming more tense than he did back in the yard. The cheetah stared straight ahead and chuckled \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I like the world more or less now that I know magic exists. Of course, as curses go this isn\u2019t the worst one he could\u2019ve gotten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake huffed and swiped a hand across Antonio\u2019s head \u201cI don\u2019t really need your notion of \u2018things that could be worse\u2019. Let\u2019s just focus on fixing this mess I\u2019ve put him in, and then we can ..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio cocked one brow, and stared perplexed as the sentence died suddenly \u201c.. yes?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe fund-raiser!\u201d Blake shouted and grabbed his friend\u2019s paw, pulling him across the street and into the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe what? Dude, are you okay? Don\u2019t you have something better to do right now? Like curing your boyfriend.\u201d The bluntness of the statement made Blake smile. Antonio was right, Alan was his boyfriend now, and it felt even better when someone else said it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah jogged behind the nearly winded wolf through Ashcone Park still pulling his arm as if to mock the fact that he belonged to the fastest species. The park was immense and yet people seemed to be everywhere during the summer months. Everywhere, except upon the barren slopes of the volcano. The lack of open grass and faint smell of sulfur made for a bad camping and picnic area and perhaps that\u2019s exactly what made it Blake\u2019s preferred hiking spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even for him, it had been a long time hiking along the older trails before he had found the caves that adorned the steeper Southern part of the mountain. Where he now remembered to have found a so far untouched chamber of... \u201ctribal stuff\u201d.<br>\r\nSomething sacred, something probably valuable, and something definitely tied around Alan\u2019s neck back in his backyard. Alan.. He could only hope his rabbit was okay.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Antonio grunted as he slithered his body close against the rock wall, fearing the drop ahead was he to step forward once. Not just because he felt sharp rocks tear at his fur like an out of control barber, but because today's expected party had been his one highpoint the entire week. And now, instead of going to it, he had stumbled head first into the rabbit hole and found the rabbit ate a lot of 'EatMe' cookies - or whatever the fuck was going on..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're nearly there\" Blake in front was determined to speed ahead with surprising grace and soon disappeared behind a corner. A few steps further, a shaky and annoyed peek around the rock face, and Antonio was greeted with the wolf's smug grinning face and behind it, a cavernous.. cavern, like a giant ripped out a large chunk of the volcano and then covered up the bare rock with soft moss and low hanging ivy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah crept around the corner and sighed in frustration whilst willing his legs to stop wobbling. \u201cSo this is your idea of a plan? Drag me half way across the park and up a mountain, for a cave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVolcano..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. This is stupid! What are we even supposed to f..\u201d the cave grew silent as the cheetah noticed the markings on the walls. Identical to the ones on Alan\u2019s neck-totem and more impressive than that, they were all faintly glowing in frequency with an unheard beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had wasted no time admiring the cave as he had the first time, and was already digging through piles of rock and stone searching for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat Is this place, Blake?\u201d Antonio steps forward and runs a paw across the walls, feeling the foul temper wash away and in its place, an oddly happy and warm mood fill him the closer he walks into the \u2018crater\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you before\u201d the wolf grunts as he rolls away another boulder stacked in the bottom corner. \u201cit\u2019s an ancient ritual site of some sort\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.. So what are you looking for now?\u201d he traces a finger into one of the glowing markings, and feels his fur stand on end and lets out a hushed moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAha! Found it! Here help me with this.\u201d Blake stands back from the rocks he had thrown around and pulls with him a long thin rope, looking ancient yet oddly pristine. The wolf begins to pull on the string and from the rock floor a small square cut hatch seems to open. Antonio is quick to join in pulling on the rope, and when the heavy purposely cut piece of rock finally flop onto the floor he\u2019s also the first to run over to the new opening. Walking on volcanoes might not be his favorite pastime, but treasure hunting certainly may be of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the side of the square hole are more of the same mysterious markings, seeming brighter and more energetic than the ones lining the walls above. Antonio\u2019s eyes light up in bright amber with childish curiosity as he sees that on the bottom there are a small assortment of shrines and a few scrolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark grey paw reaches down into the primitive safe and pulls out a pawful of the neatly rolled papers. \u201cThis is what we came for! I\u2019m sure the answer to whatever is happening to Alan is in one of these. And maybe a way to stop it..\u201d The cheetah looked up as Blake unwrapped a random scroll and attempted to make sense of the text. Points for trying, but they both knew he had no chance at academic papers even now that he had finally found reason to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake bit down on his tongue in a display of \u2018trying too hard\u2019 while he \u2018read\u2019 his scrolls, the cheetah reaches down to pull out a shrine. A dull and wooden one rests amongst the shiny metal, yet the wood is riddled in glowing marks and begs for him to pick it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious as any cat, his eyes shine bright as he lifts the shrine noiselessly to his muzzle and gently opens the lid. Nothing but blackness seems to reside inside the box. Darker than he\u2019d expect it to be on a bright and sunny day even if he was in a part cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, and without a sound the lid snaps open and a dark haze erupts in Antonio\u2019s face, making him sneeze and drop the box back into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Blake turns just as Antonio straightens himself back up to a seated position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing! Nothing, just this stupid dusty air is making me sick is all\u201d the cheetah crossed his arms and assumed his most menacing glare. Suddenly feeling a bit woozy and dizzy yet still oddly warm and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, I guess I\u2019m not going to figure out what this says anyway.\u201d Blake sighed and piled the scrolls up in his lap, pulled off his belt and tied it around the papers. \u201cI can only hope Alan can make some sense of them. I need to get back to him anyway, I don\u2019t like the way I left him behind\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, Alan might\u201d Antonio nodded and scooted gracefully back towards a wall to use as a support before even attempting to stand. Although, as soon as he was up the feeling of discomfort vanished, as quickly and oddly as it had started; leaving him with nothing but warmth filling his every cell and fiber. As the two of them began to exit the cave, Antonio took one last glance around the place, and the comforting glow of the symbols. Though, they looked different somehow. Familiar, like he could actually read them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them stepped out of the cave he thought he saw one line reading: \u201cTo lord over all that swims, walks, and flies; let his true stature be revealed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah shuddered as he started the long hike back. He was unsure what had happened, but one thing was certain. They needed to get back to Alan to see if he had found out more. And more than that whether he had...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Antonio followed Blake as the wolf made his way down the broken rock contours of the old, fern-and-vine-shrouded trail. The dead cone of the volcano loomed behind them like the body of a fallen god, buried in the Earth\u2019s crust. Around them the verdant green of the park was lush and full; the leaves rustled and muffled all surrounding sounds as they went. He couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling of comfort and laziness that had crept into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the most he wanted to do was sit down, relax, and maybe jerk off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it felt so <i>good</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Anton:  keep up,\u201d Blake called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah nodded and redoubled his efforts. He\u2019d been high before but while this wasn\u2019t exactly like those experiences, it was close enough for him to know he should just ride this out as safely as possible. Whatever had been in that black dust seemed to be having a soporific effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake kept pushing ahead until they were back on clearer paths. The way they\u2019d come had been closer to a game track or animal trail than anything the park service would have built. He wondered how many people knew it was even there in the first place. He brought himself and his cheetah companion to the main trail and, finally free of the closeness of the foliage, broke into a run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t even hear Antonio calling after him as he jogged away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his sensitive muzzle to the wind and caught Alan\u2019s scent. He wasn\u2019t far off or had at least passed this way recently. He half-closed his eyes and let the exhilaration of his running fill him like it had his primitive ancestors. The wolves of old had been runners:  pack hunters. To track his newly-found boyfriend by scent stirred him in ways he\u2019d not expected. They were thrillingly primal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rounded a bend where the trail branched off into a small picnic ground. Leaping over a hillock of ferns and wild geraniums, he came to a stop and stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he tilted his head back as the bunny turned around at his approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes rose from Alan\u2019s knees up past the rabbit\u2019s ample groin, over his toned stomach, past his chest, to his blushing face. The giant man\u2019s long ears twitched as a breeze flowed by. Blake felt his mouth hanging open but didn\u2019t close it. He clutched the assorted old scrolls, stones, and carved idols in his arms, protectively. A small, feral part of himself felt an instant of fear at being in the presence of something four times his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely coming up to Alan\u2019s thigh, he gulped air while trying to think of something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Blake,\u201d the rabbit said, shyly. \u201cUh, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to fit in your house.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
