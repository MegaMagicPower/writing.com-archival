            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was walking down the streets of Boston, looking for more places that were hiring, when I noticed a poster from Mattel.<br>\r\n\"Think <i>you</i> look like Barbie? Stop by inside and see what experts from Mattel say! If you win, you can get a cash prize of $10,000 and a photo shoot! Must be 18 or older to enter.\"<br>\r\n\"$10 thousand? Wow. That'd be helpful. I haven't touched my Barbies since I was like 12. That money does sound appealing though.\" I thought to myself. I convinced myself to give it a shot, and texted Jessi telling her about it. She replied \" I would win it just because of my size\" and that emoji that's crying from laughing, and we continued our conversation from there.<br>\r\nInside the warehouse where the contest was happening, there was a screening/questionnaire type thing were they for basic info about me, like my height, hobbies, and some questions concerning Barbie, like what my favorite doll is. After that, they directed me to a wardrobe filled with Barbie-like dresses. I quickly picked one out. It was a pink (of course) dress that went down to my shins. I went to another room that was filled a bunch of other blondes in pink dresses; there must've been at least 100.<br>\r\nAs I sat there, waiting for blonde after blonde to go, I managed to convince Jessi to come in and try it with me.<br>\r\nOnce she arrived, we had a good 20 minutes to talked before I was called in. When I was called, they took me to yet another room, this time with two Mattel representatives. I walked in and saw this tiny lady, who must've been at most 3 and a half feet tall. She didn't look like a midget, as her limbs weren't oddly shaped. I'm pretty sure the dress I was wearing was bigger than she was tall.<br>\r\nAnyways, I know something was really fishy when as soon as she saw me, she said \"oh yes\u2026 you're perfect\u2026\" in a voice much deeper than I was expecting from such a little lady. It almost sounded masculine. <br>\r\nHardly letting me talk, she asked me some of the same questions I was asked at the screening. After all the questioning, the normal sized assistant went out of the room and got a cow girl outfit, and cheer leader outfit, and a bikini (for beach volleyball) for me to try on. Taking off my dress, I tried on the cow girl outfit, the bikini, and then the skimpy, almost too small because of my long legs cheerleading outfit last. With each outfit, the little lady kept saying perfect in that deep voice. And the more I looked at her, the manlier she seemed. <br>\r\n\"Well, Charlotte,\" she said, in a voice that was unmistakably a man's, \"congratulations. You win.\" She, er, he started making his way towards me. With every step he took, he seemed to get taller. It got to the point where I went for over twice his size, to twice his size, to him being up to my boobs, to up my shoulder, to my size, to taller than me, to twice my size, to easily towering me.<br>\r\n\"Wh-wha-what are you doing!! How are you growing?!\" I yelled, even though I knew I was somehow shrinking, because everything around me was bigger. Even the dress I wore was giant now. All I had left was the little Barbie cheerleading outfit that shrunk with me. As I started checking out the now-giant man walking toward me, I noticed a little bulge in the woman's (or rather girl's skirt, as he was the size of girl no older than 6). \"You little freak! I'll sue you and Mattel!\" I started backing up to the massive doll house behind me, while scanning the room to where I was going to try and run to. <br>\r\n\"Now, now.\" The little man said. \"The tables have turned here, Charlotte. You went from the tallest in the room, even taller than my 5'10\" assistant, to the smallest. I suggest you start behaving, or things could end poorly for you.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm serious! I'll sue Mattel for everything it has!! Make me big again!\" I shouted upwards at him, still backing up. <br>\r\n\"Do you really still think I work for Mattel?\" He asked me, rhetorically, while adjusting his blonde wig. \"Oh no, I have my own business.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Does it involve shrinking girls? Especially tall, blonde ones?!\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" The more I backed up, the more he slowly made his way to me. \"Just look at my assistant.\" She walked over to us and towered the dwarf, who towered me. She stared straight down at me, and I straight up at both of them, and she just smiled and waved down at me. I eventually hit the doll house's door, and pressed myself against it. He (hardly) bended over to get closer to me, while putting his hands on his knees, and began bringing his face closer to me. \"Oh yes. I've outdone myself this time, haven't I, Janine?\"<br>\r\n\"Why, of course, Mr. Peter. Olivia will be most pleased with her new doll.\"<br>\r\nThe not-so-little-anymore man who is dressed like a business woman quickly, and easily, picked me up with one of his hands. Before I shrank, I'm pretty sure one of his hands would completely fit in the palm of one of mine. <br>\r\n\"Listen, Charlotte, you see the doll house behind you? You better get used to living in one of those. My daughter always locks up her Barbie dolls in their tiny little houses when she's done playing with them. You'll be spending a lot of time in there, especially when she gets bored of you, like she did with all her other dolls.\"<br>\r\n\"I assume those other 'dolls' are girls you shrunk just like me?\" I asked while still being held in one of his giant hands. I put my hands on his fingers and tried moving around to get more comfortable. As I was adjusting myself, I saw that his erection was bigger. Although I shrunk 5 feet, I know for sure it was bigger, but not by much. After waiting for a reply and not getting one, I asked him, while still squirming around in his hand, \"how does this possibly turn you on? You're a little-ass man, with a giant assistant who <i>easily</i> towers over you, holding a <i>shrunken girl</i> in a skimpy cheerleading outfit. I mean, not to be full of myself or anything, but I can understand how <i>I</i> can possibly turn you on. I mean I have a crazy body. But that usually happen when I'm NORMAL size, and everything about me is <i>big</i>, like my boobs, and <i>long</i>, like my legs. Not when I'm a foot tall! How does holding a shrunk girl get you hard, and how is it not ruined when you see a giant lady standing behind you? You're hardly at her hips for crying out loud!\"<br>\r\n\"Giantess.\" He replied to me. <br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"The correct form of a female giant is 'giantess', not 'giant' as you said.\"<br>\r\n\"I see. Trying to change the subject,\" I replied. \"Yeah if I was you I probably wouldn't want to talk about having a little ass dick either. I mean, I'm like 12 inches tall and it's most likely not even 1/4 of my size\u2026\" I said cooly, trying to irritate him.<br>\r\n\"You little BRAT!\" He yelled squeezing me a little. I tried my hardest not to give him a reaction. He put me on the ground and started taking off his skirt. \"We'll just have to see how big it is compared to you. I may be 3 and a half feet tall but it still big enough, especially for a girl <i>your</i> size!\"<br>\r\nI actually got scared at his threat, as it almost seemed like he was going to rape me. At the size I am at, he was right, it would probably be huge compared to me. I was lucky that the \"giantess\" assistant quickly pulled up his skirt before he was able to pull down his underwear. <br>\r\n\"Sir,\" she started, easily pulling him back. \"That's rape. We're not in that business. All we want are some new dolls for Olivia.  Please take a seat. I'll take care of her and we can keep moving on.\"<br>\r\nShe walked over to me, and I began walking backwards to the doll house. She quickly caught up to me with her huge legs which gave her massive strides. She bended down and began talking to me. \"Listen, I know this isn't what you expected at all, but please cooperate. I'm working on stopping this madman. Just please get in the dollhouse and stay there.\"<br>\r\nNot wanting to get that close of a situation again, I listened to the huge lady and got in the doll house and waited. I saw her go to the dress I was wearing and take that, along with the other outfits they gave me to wear, and hid them. I couldn't even use my phone because it was probably half my size. I was forced to stay in the doll house as girl after girl came in for they interview. They were all quickly dismissed as they didn't meet \"Barbie criteria\". I could only hope Jessi doesn't meet the criteria either. I, unfortunately, think she will, and end up getting shrunk like me, but only by roughly 4 feet instead if 5, because every time we go out, people always asks if she's my little sister because we look very very similar. I see Jessi come in to be interviewed and pray to God she doesn't get shrunken. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I watch a now gigantic Jessi come in to the room from the 3rd floor of the doll house in my pink Barbie cheerleading outfit, I couldn't help but laugh. The little man walked up to Jessi to shake her hand, much like he did with everyone else, but since Jessi is only 4'10\", she didn't seem nearly as tall compared to the little man, named \"Mr. Peter\" according to Janine, the assistant, as I did, or even some of the 5'3\" girls who were in here. Obviously, Jessi was several inches taller than Peter, but I didn't seem that way as she's so tiny\u2026 or short, as <i>I'm</i> the tiny one now. <br>\r\nShe has always been fascinated with people shorter than her and always asks why they are so minuscule.<br>\r\nSeeing her ask Peter why he is so short and his reply that \"he has a condition where growth hormones never developed blah bah bah\" and her buying his response made me face palm, but I still couldn't help but laugh at how cute and silly she is.<br>\r\nOnce they decided to get started, Jessi stood in front of the doll house I was in, but unfortunately faced the other way. I moved down to the second floor for a better view and couldn't help but notice how bizarre this doll house was. It was pink inside and out just like any normal Barbie doll house, but it wasn't like any of the ones I had as a little girl or like the ones I see on TV. It almost seemed like a normal house.<br>\r\nFrom the second floor window, I was level with the back of her knees. I knew I had to somehow get her attention somehow as they were quickly progressing in the \"interview\". They were asking Jessi her hobbies and all (how they determine the outfits they give you). She said almost the same thing as I; loves country music , cheerleader, love the beach (that's the bikini, whereas mine was volleyball). Since I guess they got a \"cheerleader Barbie\" they probably didn't want another so they asked for another idea for a third outfit.<br>\r\nAs Jessi was thinking, I began scouring the house for things I can throw at her. I found a closet in one of the rooms filled with rubber Barbie shoes. I took as many as I could and ran back to the window where Jessi was just saying a common nickname for her was \"princess\". This is because she can be a really annoying little brat when things don't go her way, and since she usually does get things her way, we say she is a princess because she is so demanding. It really has more of a negative connotation than a positive one. When that was said, Janine went and got her a Barbie princess dress. She started changing into her outfits, I tried throwing the shoes out the window at her. None got even close. Luckily she was so big that no one saw the shoes lying on the floor. I threw two pairs at her before giving up. I didn't want to yell her name in case of someone else hearing, or her asking if she hears anyone calling her name, and I also didn't want to go outside because I don't know if they would see me or hear or me.<br>\r\nAfter really thinking about the situation, I'm glad I wasn't able to get her attention because they might shrink her if she realizes that I'm shrunken and threaten to call the cops. All I could do now what watch my giantess friend possibly fall victim to same trap as I did. <br>\r\nAfter she put on the dress, Peter came up really close to her, about three inches aways from her. <br>\r\nJessi, in the pink Barbie princess dress, looked down at Peter, not knowing that it is really a tiny man, smiling and asked \"so? Do you think I could be Barbie?\"<br>\r\n\"Well Jessi,\" the man in little girl's clothes who was towered by my 4'10\" friend began, \"you're definitely pretty\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

With that nod I knew it was coming.<br>\r\n\"\u2026 and I <i>do</i> think we could use you.\" He said,with his normal voice as he slowly began his approach.<br>\r\n\"Jessi!\" I shouted from the third floor (I moved up to try and get a better angle while throwing shoes at her from her butt's height). I wanted to watch her shrink to she how it looks from a different angle, but I couldn't help running down after I saw Janine pull out a weird gun looking thing, quickly firing at Jessi, and notice Jessi lose some height.<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds of that, the third floor view went from being level with her ass, to her lower back. I quickly sprinted down stairs and noticed the second floor was soon level with her back from the window across the house. When I got to the first floor, the windows now had a clear view of her much smaller butt. I ran to the door and tripped over her giant pair of short shorts that normally would be like booty shorts to me, but now I could easily fit in the pockets of. I looked up and noticed Jessi get smaller and smaller in the dress. I got up and stood by Jessi while she was shrinking. I wasn't even half her size when I got to her. We both looked at each other and, despite the chaos, she couldn't help but say that I was so little and pat me on the head while she was slowly diminishing.<br>\r\nJanine came over after hiding the gun, picked me up by pinching my top with her finger nails, and picked Jessi up the same way when she was small enough. Jessi finished shrinking while being suspended over what seemed like hundreds of feet from our size.<br>\r\nShe asked the very same questions I did while being shrunk, but go no answers.<br>\r\n\"Well, Janine. I think two new dolls today is excellent. Tell everyone to go home please.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir, of course. But, where do I put the girls?\" She asked, lifting us up to clarify who she was talking about.<br>\r\n\"What girls?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. Where shall I place the dolls?\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, of course. You can place them in the doll house. Oh, and after you tell them to go home, make sure you shrink the clothes back. Even the new outfits we got today. I'll be waiting in the car with the dolls.\"<br>\r\nJanine placed us in the house and went on doing what she was commanded.<br>\r\nI told Jessi everything. Everything they told me, everything I heard, and everything I picked up - even about the doll house.<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it\u2026 this house <i>does</i> seem a bit off to be a doll house. It isn't made of plastic, it has porcelain toilets, the walls seem like normal walls, and, most importantly, it isn't really \"open\" like most doll houses are so that the little girls can play with the dolls. It seems like a normal house.\"<br>\r\n\"But that's impossible. You can't  <i>shrink</i> a house.\" I replied <br>\r\n\"Why not? He shrunk <i>us</i>, didn't he?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess he did\u2026 somehow. I still can't believe it. We're not even a foot tall now. Some cross dressing freak the size of the 6 year old kids babysit shrank me a whole 5 feet! That's <i>60</i> inches! I would have been much more happy if he had shrunk me down to 60 inches instead.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026 same here\u2026 I mean I've always wanted to be a Barbie doll and a princess since they're usually perfect, but I don't know about it anymore. Shrinking down to 60 inches would have been a million times better\u2026\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Jess? You do know 60 inches is 5 feet right? You technically would've <i>grown</i>.\"<br>\r\n\"Welp. I guess I wouldn't've minded being shrunk to\u2026 let's see - 58 minus 11.5\u2026 hmm\u2026 46.5 inches instead. I don't care how small that is. I at least wouldn't be able to be picked up by a 3'6\" midget with one hand.\"<br>\r\nWe decided to look around the doll house some more to see if we could find some evidence that supports our claim of this being a normal house that was shrunken. While looking, Jessi and took a closer look at the closet where I found all shoes. Jessi quickly ditched her princess dress for a more comfortable knee-high dress.<br>\r\nWe searched as quickly and thoroughly as we could, as we could only imagine we didn't have much time. After checking all the rooms, we didn't find much. We began to talk after essentially giving up.<br>\r\n\"So, where do you think we are right now?\" She asked me. <br>\r\nI looked out the window And it seemed dark around. \"I dunno.\" I replied. \"The house isn't shaking like it was before when I think we were being carried. When I look outside, it's all dark, so probably inside a car? It's probably all black interior.\" Almost on cue the house was lifted up and Jessi and I feel to the ground as we couldn't keep our balance. Next thing I knew was the was opening right down the middle into halves. We saw Peter staring at us getting ready to talk. <br>\r\n\"Now there. So you don't think I'm a pedophile who keeps shrunken girls for my own pleasure, I'm going to explain what the deal is. I used to be a 6'6\" scientist. I accidentally created a shrinking device one day and shrunk myself 3 feet. This was several years ago, and never made major news as I refused to make a deal out of it. After shrinking myself, I changed my focus to perfect the device, and after years, I finally was able to do it. The doll house you two are in right now is one houses that was normal size that I shrunk.\" I didn't really care for any of this story. I just wanted to know why I was shrunken along with Jessi.<br>\r\n\"Ok, but why shrink us??\" I asked, cutting him off.<br>\r\n\"I can see that you like getting right to it, don't you? Well, after perfecting the shrinking process, I used to do it on women that made fun of my height. I shrunk them to about 4 feet so that they were still taller than me, as I have a thing for taller females. But one day, this perfect looking blonde, with the nicest body I've ever seen walked by me. She didn't even see me or give me the time of day because I was so small next to her 6'2\" body. Even though she ignored me completely when I tried talking to her, I knew I had to have her as my own. I, luckily, had put my shrink ray in my wife's purse.  So I quickly grabbed it, and followed her. When we were alone, I put the strength of the gun to Barbie size at a slow rate. I got her attention by offering her a free pair of shoes if her feet were twice the size of mine or bigger. She took of her knee high boots, falling for my trap, and I zapped her. Slowly but surely she began shrinking before my very own eyes. Next thing I knew, she was my size.  As she kept shrinking, I felt no regret. I would have her as my own personal toy. When she finally got down to Barbie size, I picked her up, and dropped her in her very own boot and went back to my wife with her boots. When she found out what I had done, I told her that the shrunken lady wasn't for me. I instead surprised Olivia with her, and ever since then, my precious Olivia has wanted human dolls, as they are more fun according to her. So, you two are the new Barbies to her collection.\"<br>\r\nI had so many questions and so many things to tell him, like how illegal and morally wrong this is, but all I could ask after being that disgusted was \"when will you make is big again?\"<br>\r\nHis reply made me and Jess cry on the spot.<br>\r\n\"Never. I never created a growth ray. I got fired before I could. That's why I'm still this short. It's not that bad though. There'll be plenty of other dolls to communicate with, and you get three meals a day and showers as well.\"<br>\r\nHe closed up the doll house after telling us we were almost at our new house. After Jessi and I finished crying, we started speculating who Olivia could be. <br>\r\n\"I think it's his freaky wife who never got over playing with dolls. I wouldn't be surprised. She's probably shrunken to the size of a baby doll so she can be small but still bigger than us.\" I suggested.<br>\r\n\"No way. This freak likes taller ladies so his wife is probably like 6'4\" herself. He most likely threatened to shrink her if they didn't get married. I agree that she may a thing with dolls still so she probably hasn't left him for that reason either.\"<br>\r\nWe finally got to Peter's house. The doll house was shaking a lot, and then finally put down. We went to the third floor and looked out the window. We couldn't believe what we saw. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Peter was eye level with her boobs would be if she was old enough to have any. I guessed that she was about 4'6\", 4 inches shorter than Jessi normally is.<br>\r\n\"Do you think <i>that's</i> Olivia?!\" I asked Jessi. <br>\r\n\"Dear God, I hope not. That's one <i>big girl</i>. She's probably as tall I was before all this! Hold on, let's see if we can hear what they're saying.\"<br>\r\nWe couldn't really hear, but we definitely managed to catch him say \"Olivia\". Soon enough, they walked over to us. Peter led the way for the giant little girl behind him. She quickly and easily pushed him aside with no effort at all. The house opened right down the middle again, and Jessi and I stated at each other.<br>\r\n\"These are my new dolls? I like them.\" She grabbed my with her right hand and inspected me. \"A cheerleader? Hmm\u2026 your hair is <i>all</i> wrong. Later I'm gonna have to tie it in a bow and all.\" She placed me down and picked Jessi up. \"And just what are <i>you</i> supposed to be?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, sweetie, tha--\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not talking to you, dad!\" She shouted over him. \"I'm talking to my doll.\"<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Jessi asked, pointing at her self. <br>\r\n\"You <i>are my</i> doll, <i>aren't you</i>?\"<br>\r\nAgainst my will, I chimed in. \"She's a princess! Look her princess dress is over here!\" I ran over and picked it up and showed it to the girl. She shifted her view to me, and had an angry expression. I gulped hard.<br>\r\n\"Since you're a new doll, I won't punish you. But next time you speak out of turn, there'll be consequences.\" She looked bad at Jessi who was still in her hand. \"So you're a princess?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026 I guess\u2026 I'm just not in my, uh, princess dress. If you put me down I can try it on to show you.\"<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" She said while placing Jessi back down on the third floor. Looking at her dad, she asked if she could have 3 friends over to play with her new dolls. Peter agreed. \"Thanks daddy. You're the best. Now, could you leave me alone with my new dolls so I can play with them?\" Before letting him reply, she began forcibly escorting the 3 foot man out of her room with no problem. Before even turning around from closing the door, she warned Jessi that \"she had better be in her princess dress before I turn around, or else you'll be in big trouble. And you better remember that big for you is now even bigger because you're a doll now.\"<br>\r\nI looked over at Jessi and she was still trying to get the dress off. Since we weren't used to the Velcro that Barbie clothes had, she was having some trouble. I looked at her and whispered \"I'll stall her\". <br>\r\n\"Hey, little girl!\" I instantaneously yelled, not thinking about the whole \"little\" part. \"We're not dolls, you know! We're people too! I think you should respect us!\" She immediately turned around and stared me down. I knew I was in trouble.<br>\r\n\"<i>Little girl</i>? Do you not see how tall I am compared to you?\" She picked me up with her massive hand and held me by my waist. \"I can easily control you.\" She put me down on the floor by her leg and said \"you're not even half the size of my leg. How can you possibly call <i>me</i> a <i>little girl</i>? That's it. I really like you because you're a cheerleader Barbie, but you need to be punished. What will I do this time\u2026?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I didn't mean to make you angry!\" I yelled up at her from the floor.<br>\r\nNot paying any attention to me, she said, \"I know!

That's why you're my favorite doll. You're obedient. But I still have to punish you.\"  The giant girl made her way to me. Just before grabbing me, I looked at Jessi and she was putting on the other dress and mouthed \"thank you so much\" and \"I'm sorry\". I nodded my head as her massive hand easily grasped me. She walked over to her end of her bed to where the toy box was. From my point of view, the toy box was about half her size, and God knows how many times larger than me. She opened the top and as she was about to place me in, she said, \"don't worry. It's only about for an hour until my friends are over. Then\u2026 I'll decide what to do with you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the box, I noticed that where she placed me was almost like a jail cell. I was a room with thick (to a girl my size at least) wooden walls, and a large, barred door so I can see the rest of the toy box. I noticed other cells like mine. I wondered if there were other dolls - I mean girls - in the prison with me.<br>\r\nI turned around to observe the rest of my cell and noticed that it wasn't all <i>too</i> shabby. I had a pretty big cell, probably because it was in on of the four corners of the toy box. There was a couch, a love seat, a table, (all plastic and pink of course) on one side. I had a bunk bed, probably because this cell could serve as a two doll cell. As I continued to look around I saw someone sitting at a chair looking at a vanity mirror with the little lights on. I wondered if it was a battery operated Barbie vanity or a shrunken one. I assumed the first because I don't see how it would still work if it was shrunken, since there is no electricity in the giant, pink, wooden toy box. The only sources of light for us were the large holes on the ceiling of the toy box that were scattered around enough so that a good amount of light could enter, except in the middle of the toy box. The middle was, for some reason, pitch black. I could see faint light from what I imagined were other cells. <br>\r\nUp until now I was silent. I walked to the figure to see who, or what, it was. When I got close enough I noticed it was a Barbie doll\u2026 an actual one.<br>\r\n\"Boy, you're a lot bigger than I remember.\" I looked at what she was wearing to see if maybe I would steal it, but it was a pink gown that looked much more uncomfortable than the cheer leading outfit I was wearing. I turned off the light of the vanity and tried to take a quick nap on the bottom bunk. <br>\r\nI was abruptly woken up when Olivia (the giant girl) opened the toy box, allowing light to flood in, and said, with her booming voice, \"ok, dollies. It's free time. You have 15 minutes to roam around then it's back to your rooms for 55 minutes, then lunch. Oh, by the way, you have a new friend for the moment. That's why I gave you an extra 5 minutes for free time. She's the cheerleader Barbie so make sure you play nice!\" She almost sounded like an innocent, sweet little girl when she spoke the last sentence. With the light from the open roof flooding I could see her removing the wooden jail cell bars to allow the prisoners to go in the \"free zone\". I was the 4th cell she opened up and I reluctantly went in the middle. I didn't know what to expect. To the closest cell to my right came out a tiny (even to me) brunette girl. She looked up at me and said \"so you're the cheer leader, huh? Well, it's a pleasure to meet you! I'm Gabriella, but you can call me Gabby.\" She extended her hand out to shake mine. It was a very formal introduction on her part.<br>\r\nI shook her and while saying \"Hi! I'm Charlotte\u2026 or at least I was. I guess I'm 'cheerleader Barbie' now. If you don't mind me asking, what kind of Barbie are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not Barbie. I <i>was</i> Teresa, and her favorite one at that. But, I 'misbehaved' so she shrunk me down to Skipper\u2026 <i>your</i> little sister.\" I was really happy she didn't shrink me down now, as Gabby was up to my shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Ohh ok.\" I replied. \"So, how did <i>you</i> end up being shrunken in the first place?\" I asked her, while looking around to see the 4 other girls, 3 blondes and one other brunette, leave their cells. At this point she closed the toy box and removed what ever object was on top to allow light to flow in the middle revealing all the Barbie things inside, like more furniture. <br>\r\n\"I was at the mall, trying on heels when some little man approached me offering help, implying that he worked at the store. He was about 1/4 of my size, especially with the 3 inch heels I was wearing making me 6'6\". I bent down to hand him the heels to see if I could get them in a larger size, when he said 'I'll just make <i>you</i> smaller to fit in the heels' and so he shrank me. I've been Olivia's doll ever since, and I was one of the first ones. What's your story?\"<br>\r\nI explained Gabriella everything that happened to me and Jessi and as I was telling the story, the other girls gathered around us. There was only one other blonde girl who Skipper's size.<br>\r\n\"So you arrived today <i>and</i> you're in the toy box? Wow, she must really like you to spare you like that. Usually she gets rid of the really bad dolls.\" One of the girls said. I didn't really want to know what she meant by that, so I began meeting the other girls.<br>\r\nAbout 10 minutes went by and Gabriella decided to give me a tour of the toy box. It was a lot larger than it seems. Two things really interested me for some reason. One was a ruler she put so we could measure ourselves for whatever reason, and the other were windows she put around in between the cells. I frantically went to them to see if I could see the doll house Jessi and I were in that she placed on top of her desk. One of the windows had a perfect view of the doll house and I could easily see Jessi. She was still in the princess dress, but looked a little different. She was roaming around the house, going up and down the floors, almost looking nervous. She was probably worried for me. Around the toy box, the other dolls were all looking for her before deciding that she was out of the room. I looked down to Gabby and asked her why don't they try to escape.<br>\r\n\"The last dolls who tried to escape left from the window frames. They managed to knock down the glass and managed to survive the fall. They made it as far as the door before they were caught. We never saw them again. But that's why they reinforced the glass with more hot glue and added taller legs to the bottom of the toy box. No one else ever even attempted to escape, and I recommend you do the same, especially since she seems to really like you for leaving you here, and not where ever she puts the bad dolls.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I never considered escaping. This girl is too big.\"<br>\r\nGabby and I continued talking until free time was over. As she loomed over us to make sure we went to our cells, I whispered to Gabby, \"boy, she really does run this place like a warden.\" She looked up at me and replied saying \"you don't know the half of it.\" Before going back in our cells, she said \"you know, you really <i>do</i> look like Barbie.\"<br>\r\nAfter being locked up I started thinking about all the other girls that I met in here. There was a Bride Barbie, a Ballerina Barbie, a Nurse Barbie, and two Skippers, one of which was Gabby.<br>\r\nAfter being locked up for what seemed around 5 minutes she opened the top again.<br>\r\n\"Cheerleader Barbie, it's time to go play! My friends are here!\" I got off of the bed and she immediately picked me up like Janine did; pinching my top with her index finger and thumb. She put me back on the third floor of the same doll house I arrived in, but on the opposite half (remember how I said the house split down the middle? I found out it was a modification Peter himself did so they can easily find us in the houses). I looked at the door and saw a little, older looking lady, who I would say us about 4 feet fall do 4'2\", escort 3 giant little girls into the room. I scanned the other half of the house for Jessi but couldn't find her. I immediately thought that I was in some big trouble with these girls.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The four little, or \"young\", girls gathered around the house I was in. Olivia was easily several inches taller than all of the girls.<br>\r\n\"This is one of my new dolls. She's a cheerleader. She's my favorite so <i>I'm</i> gonna be playing with. I also have another doll in this doll house. I like her a lot too, but not as much, so I'm gonna be playing with her too. I already played with her a little bit, she's really fun. I think she's sleeping. Let me try and find her.\" Her huge hand went to the other half of the house and began opening all the doors to try and find her.<br>\r\nI looked up from her hand to the girls staring at me and noticed that the three friends were looking right at me. There was one red haired girl with freckles. She was the 3rd tallest out of the four. There was a light skinned girl with jet black hair and what seemed to be milky smooth skin. She was the 2nd tallest (shorter than only Olivia of course). The third, and shortest girl, was another blonde like Olivia. She was hardly taller than the mother, and a lot shorter than Olivia. She also seemed to have smooth skin.<br>\r\nOlivia stopped searching around for a moment and looked at me and told me to introduce my self. Since I'm really kind if a girly girl, I curtsied with my skimpy little skirt while saying \"Hi, I'm Char\u2026lotte\u2026\" I knew I screwed up while introducing myself half way through saying my name. Olivia had that same angry expression as before. I put on a fake giggle and said \"Oopsie! I'm sorry, I'm Cheerleader Barbie!\" while making my voice high pitched to sound like Barbie. I did a cheerleader pose when saying \"cheerleader Barbie\" by putting my right fist in the air, with my left fist at my waist, and then alternating them after I said the first syllable in \"Barbie.\" I had a very similar smile on my face that I would when I'm cheering. I was happy my experience came in helpful at this moment.<br>\r\nOlivia's expression to changed to a kind of surprised and happy one at the same time as she smiled. She continued her search for Jessi and found her while the red headed girl began saying how \"cool\" and \"cute\" I was. All I could do was stand there like I would when I'm cheering at a football game.<br>\r\n\"Aha! Found her.\" She was almost dragging Jessi out from the first floor as she was sleepy as hell.  \"Girls, this is Princess Barbie. Believe it or not, this is my first Princess Barbie.\" Jessi was almost immediately wide awake when she realized what was going on. I analyzed her to find out what seemed so different about her as she introduced her self as well. She began waving like Cinderella, or any of the princesses at Disney Land/World, would while saying \"Hello, I'm Princess Barbie! It's a pleasure to meet all of you!' She rested her right hand over her left hand and let them both hang in front of her. I finally realized what was different about her. To be honest, it was more what <i>wasn't</i> different about her. Her hair was different, her makeup was done a lot more, she had gloves on her arms that reached to her elbow, she had a tiara, other little features that made her look like an actual princess.<br>\r\n\"So, girls, those are my two new dolls. You guys can play with the Princess Barbie for now while I do Cheerleader Barbie's hair and makeup, because it is <i>all</i> wrong.\" I couldn't get mad at her statement as she was right (and also 4 feet taller than me and could completely dominate me). But, I mean, in my defense I wasn't <i>expecting</i> to be shrunken and become some giant 9 or 10 year old girls new cheerleader Barbie doll, so I did my hair and makeup for a normal occasion. Jessi and I made quick eye contact letting each other know we are both okay before Olivia picked me up and made her way to a real vanity set that was on the adjacent wall. \"There are more dolls in the toy box and in the houses in the other room if you guys want to go play with them. I'll meet you guys in that room when I'm done here, okay?\" The three girls agreed and headed out after checking the toy box. Two of them grabbed a doll, both blondes. Gabby was still in there. I wasn't really surprised though. She probably doesn't get too much attention because she's Teresa, or Skipper now, I guess.<br>\r\nFrom the wall where the desk that our doll house was placed on, I could hear Jessi.<br>\r\n\"Oh, miss Olivia! Pardon me, oh dearie, but could you possibly pick me up and place me on the vanity set so I can watch? I'm stuck her all so alone in this doll <i>house</i>. Not even my <i>castle</i>!\" I was surprised to hear her talking like that. It was almost like she was brainwashed.<br>\r\n\"Why, of <i>course</i>, Princess Barbie.\" Olivia said, making her way to Jessi. She picked Jessi up, placed her on the vanity along with me, and said that she will return shortly.<br>\r\n\"Jessi! What in the world is going on?!\" I asked her immediately when the door was closed.<br>\r\n\"Nothing, but when she was doing my hair and makeup I was asking her questions that would help me land on her good side. All of this is an act. She told me to be a princess, and since I always wanted to be a princess and Barbie, I've always kinda mentally practiced, so here I am! But, listen. I recommend you ask her some questions I did. Like what should you call her and how you should act. That will help. And don't try and fight her, obviously.\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh, no, not again. She put me in the slammer for talking out of turn. Like I'm gonna be the most obedient doll ever now.\"<br>\r\n\"Dolls? Char\u2026 we're not dolls. We're <i>humans</i>.\" She sounded like she was in disbelief when I said that.<br>\r\n\"Jess, we may as well be dolls. There are 5 other girls in the toy box when I was in it. <i>They</i> always refer to <i>themselves</i> as dolls. Some have been here for <i>months</i>. There's no escaping this. We just have to play along to this cruel game we're in. I mean, there are apparently more dolls in the room next door. By the way, are you wearing heels? You're taller than me now\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why?\"<br>\r\n\"How do they <i>fit</i>?\"<br>\r\n\"Same way everything else does. We have very similar proportions to Barbie.\" At that, Olivia came back in with a little pink, plastic vanity stool for me, I'm presuming. \"Oh, welcome back, miss Olivia!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks you, Princess! Ok, Cheerleader get ready for your makeover!\" She plopped down the stool and I sat on it. She opened a drawer at her side after sitting down her self and began. She started with my hair, and I assumed now was the best time to ask questions.<br>\r\n\"So, uh, miss Olivia? Should I call you miss Olivia as well?\"<br>\r\n\"No. For you I was thinking that you should call me \"Coach Olivia\" or \"Coach\" since it makes more sense for a cheerleader. I will occasionally call you Cheerleader, or something with cheer, instead of Cheerleader Barbie since it's quicker.\"<br>\r\n\"Understood, coach.\" I replied. Not really thinking it through, I asked, \"Um, coach? Would it not be easier for you to call use by our <i>real</i> names? Like calling me Charlotte instead? Please don't get angry! It's a simple question!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I understand your questions now, so whatever you ask I won't get angry. And I mean anything you ask will not get me in a bad mood. So ask anything and everything. But to answer your question, I may have multiple dolls with the same name, but I generally have no dolls with the same profession. Since I play with almost <i>all</i> my dolls and try to treat them as good as I can I prefer it like that. But, if I get to like you as much as I want to I may just use your real name\"<br>\r\n\"Oh ok. I can't lie, That actually makes sense. Um, another question I have is how should I behave? I would assume like a cheerleader, but the common perception of a cheerleader is that we're all dumb and we're not!\"<br>\r\nOlivia giggled and replied by saying \"Just act all happy and giddy and perky, like you did when you introduced yourself. But you only really have to do it when I'm around or one of my friends.\"<br>\r\nI asked some basic questions like old she is (9 and half) and how tall she is (4'7\") and why her mom is tiny as we'll (her dad shrunk her while testing out the shrink ray and made her 4 feet tall). I really pushed my luck when I asked her why she does this.<br>\r\n\"Do what?\" She asked. Jessi looked at me with her eyes wide open, almost as if to say don't do it. <br>\r\n\"Why do you keep shrunken women who have lives as your dolls?\" She stopped brushing my hair and was quiet for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Before I even finished the chapter, I exceeded the character limit of 10,000, so I'm using this point as a place where you can pick Olivia's reaction to my question.*</span></div></div>",

To be honest, I do it because regular dolls are boring to me. I've never liked them. They have no personality.\" At this point I found it hard to believe she was only 9. \"After I saw my dad shrink and then him perfecting the shrink ray I asked him to bring some real dolls for me. He did and I always took care of them. The ones who are \"bad dolls\" I give to my cousin who takes care of them too. I don't throw them away or anything. I also do the three punishments I do because I don't want to physically hurt anyone. I have actually asked my dad to return the girls back to normal size but he said he hasn't finished the growth ray to do it yet.\" <br>\r\nIt was quiet for a little bit until I said \"maybe you need a Scientist Barbie?\" and even Jessi couldn't help but laugh at that one. Olivia continued brushing my hair as I couldn't help but wonder if she had told the truth. I mean, I would think its weird as a little girl to have human dolls, and especially if my friend had human dolls. But I did realize that no one in the toy box said she mistreated anyone or anything similar, so maybe she isn't lying. My eyes closed themselves as the giant brush brushed my hair. It felt really good. All of it. Having my hair done, even if it is done be a girl almost 4 feet taller than me, and having the light bulbs emit it's warm light on my face. It was almost like I was getting spoiled. She soon attempted to put a pink bow on the back of my head, but failed because her fingers were way too big. Jessi offered to do it and successfully did it with one try.<br>\r\n\"Do you know that Jessi, er, Princess Barbie used to be my flyer? She was only 3 inches taller than you, at 4'10\" and I was 5'11 and a half\". We used to be cheer partners, that's why she did it so easy.\" I explained to her because she looked surprised.<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, so you were tiny <i>before</i> all of this then?\" She said. We all laughed. We oddly clicked together. All three of us. Jessi and I weren't even trying to brown nose or trying to get on her good side. We were just being ourselves.<br>\r\n\"Ok, now time to do your make up. This won't take too long.\" She got out a make up kit made for normals sized girls. At one point I thought half of the things in it, like the brushes, were taller than Jessi and I.<br>\r\n\"Why, miss Olivia, aren't you a little too <i>young</i> for make up?\" Jessi asked. I assume she didn't have the courage to ask before. <br>\r\n\"Oh, no. This isn't for me. My mom bought it for me so I can use it on you dolls.\"<br>\r\n\"Half of this stuff is bigger than us!\" I said. \"How can you possibly use this for us.\"<br>\r\nOlivia jumped in saying that Peter had shrunken a make up kit to make it easier. Olivia finished her explanation by saying that she had finished most of one of the kits on Jessi, and that she needed to use a new one, hence the normals sized brushes and lipstick and all. She quickly got some make up equipment that was much to small for her out and began.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'm pretty good at this. I've been doing it for months.\" She had done my foundation, blush, eyeliner, and everything else perfectly. The only thing missing was lipstick. <br>\r\n\"Ok, this is the only time you'll get a say. Do you want pink or red lipstick? If you say pink I'm gonna have to go shrink some more.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll use red. That's what we use when we cheer anyways.\" With that being said, she awkwardly handed me the tiny red lipstick. I picked it up, puckered my lips, put it on and went to go look at myself in the vanity mirror, which served as a whole body mirror for Jessi and I. I absolutely loved the way I looked. I was extremely impressed with her job well done that I even went over and hugger her arm, that was probably bigger than me itself.<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's no problem.\" She said smiling. \"I love doing these things. But we should go to my friends now.\" She was about to pick us up when I stopped her.<br>\r\n\"Hey, coach. I have an idea. You should let us walk inside the room while you introduce us and we do something someone with our profession would do. Like, you would introduce me and I would come in doing a bunch of hand springs, and Princess would come in waving like a Disney Princess.\" They both thought it was a good idea so that's what we did.<br>\r\nOlivia introduced Jessi first, so she walked slowly, waving just like before. I had to wait for her to finish for me to be introduced. When it was my turn, I came in doing a whole bunch of handsprings. But it was abruptly interrupted when the little red headed girl picked me up mid-stunt.<br>\r\n\"Wow! You're so awesome!!\" She said as she brought me over to her face. In the background I could hear the light skinned girl say \"hey, Princess. Get over here.\" And then Jessi fast walking to her, trying not to break her princess poise.<br>\r\nI looked up at the little red head holding me and thanked her.<br>\r\n\"I'm Shannon by the way. Shannon O'Donnel.\"<br>\r\n\"It's great to meet you! I'm Cheerleader Barbie! Let's be great friends!\" I said back at her. I'm kind of BS'ing what I say, because it's not like I know what Barbie would <i>actually</i> say. I also had that big, fake smile on like before. That's one of the worst things about cheering.<br>\r\n\"You're very pretty!\" She told me. I was starting to hate this. I had to lie to the poor girl to try and act like what I assume Barbie would.<br>\r\n\"Thanks you! You're very pretty too! You're like a life size version of me!\" I still had that stupid high pitched voice on. I felt bad. It definitely was not great to meet her, I definitely do not want to be \"great friends\" with her, and she wasn't all <i>that</i> pretty. The other little blonde and the light skinned girl and Olivia were definitely prettier than Shannon.<br>\r\n\"I wish I was a life size version of you. I have red hair and freckles. You have blonde hair, perfect skin, and perfect everything else. Olivia and Michelle are life size versions of you\" You could kind of see and hear the sadness. She must not get much attention.<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Was the only reply I could muster back to her. I had no idea what the light skinned girl was doing with Jessi, but I could see Olivia standing by the door, and Michelle, who I'm assuming is the littlest blonde girl, looking for some other dolls. <br>\r\nAt this point, Olivia told us it was time to go eat and feed the other dolls, and then we'll come back and play. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At dinner I found out that the favorite dolls get to eat lunch with at the regular sized dinner table instead of with the other dolls. It's kind of unfortunate as I wanted to meet the other shrunken girls and see if Olivia is actually really nice or not. It was pretty awkward to eat lunch with the man who shrunk Jessi and I. He kinda kept staring at us, and we could feel it. He also kept asking questions about us, such as \"How do you like your new dolls?\", \"Are they behaving?\", and \"are they fun to play with?\" I sat between Shanon and Michelle on a little doll table, while Jessi sat between Cristina (the light skinned girl) and Michelle. To them, the space between us were a few inches, but to us they were several feet. We ate normal size food with shrunken silverware, and, as you could probably imagine, it was very, very difficult.<br>\r\nDuring lunch we also found out that Cristina had just turned 10 two weeks ago and is 4'5\", Michelle was the oldest at 10 and a half but shortest at 4'2\", still 2 inches taller than the mother. Shannon, who also could not stop staring at me, or poking me, and, little by little, moving the table cloth so I could be closer and closer to her, was 4'4\" and turned 9 about 3 months ago, making her the youngest.<br>\r\nWhen dinner was over, Shannon pounced at the opportunity to pick Jessi and I up to take use back to the room. She ever so carefully and softly picked me up, while haphazardly picked Jessi up.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Shannon.\" I yelled from her hand. \"Could you try and be more delicate with her? She <i>is</i> a princess after all.\" When I finished my sentence we had entered the empty room with all the other dolls.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I don't know how. She's not even pretty.\" She said while bringing Jessi up to her face as well. \"You hear me? You don't deserve to be a princess. Charlotte does. Not <i>you</i>.\" I can't say I'm surprised she remembered my real name when I let it slip when first introducing myself. Shannon stood near the middle of the room with both Jessi and I being held in each of her hands raised near her face.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you think that'\" Jessi said, obviously sounding hurt. <br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Shannon replied while tossing Jessi several feet, even to normal sized person, onto the bed. She yelled all the way, bounced really high, and ultimately landed safely. I could see her crying out of fear for her life from the grasp of the giant 9 hear old. <br>\r\n\"Jessi!\" I yelled. \"Shannon! You giant bitch! How could you do that!?\" I asked her, extremely angry. I didn't even try to sound or act like Barbie anymore. Since Jessi and I actually do look really similar, I lied to Shannon saying that she was my identical twin sister and that she should like her as much as she likes me.<br>\r\n\"But you're so much prettier! She's just a spoiled little brat who's princess. You left your princess life to do something you love; cheering!\"<br>\r\n\"What the fu'\" I thought. \"Does this crazy chick actually think this is all real? I <i>could</i> use this to my advantage I suppose.\" Since Jessi is a couple of weeks older than I, I continued my lie.<br>\r\n\"Shannon,\" I started, putting my Barbie voice back, \"you still must respect her. She's a couple of minutes older than me. Because of this, she is in line for the throne. That means she is going to be queen one day! You may not like her, but please, please, <i>please</i> respect her. I beg of you. Do it for me.\"<br>\r\n\"Ughhhh, fine. Only for you though.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Now, could you place me down next to her? I want to check up on her' and, sorry for insulting you. I wasn't myself as I got really scared for my princess sister.\"<br>\r\n\"It's ok.\" She said while placing me down on the opposite side of the bed.<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks for putting me as far away as you possibly could.\" I thought. I ran as fast as I could in the pink, rubber, Barbie shoes as I could. For some reason, I could feel the eyes of all the other dolls staring at me after I called her a \"giant bitch\" but I didn't care. I just wanted to get to Jessi.<br>\r\n\"Jess, are you okay?\" I bent over to help her stand up. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said, wiping the tears from her eyes, \"it was just terrifying being thrown like that.\" We got up, but had troubles balancing ourselves on the bed for whatever reason. I didn't want to risk anything like that again with Shannon, seeing that she seems to be a loose cannon. I did apologize to her again, however. She quickly sat down on the floor and threw her arms on the bed, which made but Jessi and I fall. Shannon giggled. When I managed to look up, I saw her massive hand coming to (presumably) grab me.<br>\r\n\"Oh, bother.\" I thought to myself.<br>\r\n\"Cheerleader-- or should I say Charlotte? -- you are too cute and funny. I wish I could be you.\" She was spinning me around, inspecting every inch (all 11 and a half!) of my body. She even rolled up my skimpy cheerleading skirt, I don't know if it was to see my legs, or what but she even took off my top. \"You have such a perfect body. Mine isn't anything like yours.\" She was in the process to take off my skirt too, but luckily Cristina came in. <br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Cristina asked Shannon. She quickly stood up, and moved her hands behind her back, hiding me. <br>\r\n\"Nothing! Why? Hmm?\" You could hear the nervousness in her voice.<br>\r\n\"Oh'kayyy' Well Mrs. Peters want to know if you want to sleep over. She wants you to go talk to her. Come with me quick, so we can start monopoly. C'mon.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok! Be right out!\" I assume Cristina left, because she turned around and put her hands in front of her. \"That was close! Stay here!\" She said as she put me on a doll house on a shelf.<br>\r\n\"I mean it isn't like I have much of a choice!\" I replied<br>\r\n\"Aww, you're so cute and little. I wish I could be your size so we can be best friends! I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\nShe left the room, left Jessi on the bed, and left me in a doll house in my bra and skirt. I didn't imagine that there were any guys around, put I still crossed my arms to cover my boobs, as I felt uncomfortable.<br>\r\n\"Well, I could try to go back to Jessi' or I could explore the doll house. I honestly don't know what to do'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I went outside and looked down.<br>\r\n\"That's a hell of a drop\u2026 maybe there's some paper or clothes or something I could use as a parachute. The shirt I was wearing this morning, that was actually a little too small, but now is entire bigger than me would be perfect. God, I feel absolutely small and vulnerable saying that\u2026\" I could see Jessi waking over, picking up my cheerleading top, and folding it. \"Something that <i>really</i> makes me feel tiny\u2026\" I began to think, while sitting on the edge of the shelf, dangling my inch long legs and feet with the pink, Barbie shoes on it, \"is the fact the Jess now wears the same size clothes that I do. I mean, my pants were almost as tall as her. My shirts would only fit on one of her shoulder, and go down to her knees, and my feet were like twice the size of hers. Even when she was in heels I towered the poor girl. Oh Lord\u2026\" my train of though led me to making myself feel smaller and smaller. \"Some 9 year old can hold me with one hand. That's not even the worst part. I could probably fit inside the shoes of 75% of the girls volleyball team now. I'm the size of a Barbie doll now. Ugh, I have to stop thinking about things that make me feel little. I stood up, looked down at my boobs, cupped them and said out loud \"I'm not small. These babies are big.\" I turned around and faced the doll house.  I started walking towards it. I stepped inside expecting it to be filled with Barbie dolls. I wasn't disappointed. There were various dolls in this two story house that seemed like it was a mansion before being shrunk. \"Maybe I can find something to wear that isn't pink. I'm starting to hate this color.\" I saw to myself as I start exploring. \"Hellooooo!?\" I yell, to see if I can find a fellow human/doll or whatever you want to call us. Unfortunately, it seems I'm alone. It can't be that bad, because who knows if there's a deranged, forgotten doll up here that kills me or something. As I'm walking through the shrunken mansion, I can't help but notice all the real Barbie dolls scattered around the house. \"Hmmm\u2026 maybe these were Olivia's dolls before her dad got that shrink ray.\" Out of nowhere a crazy idea came to me when I thought of the shrink ray. \"Oh my\u2026 that would never work\u2026 would it?\" As I was still walking around look for anything not pink, I tried convincing myself that my idea of a revolution where all the shrunken girls take action at the same time could never work, and even if it did, it would takes months of planning, and he's to get everyone together several times. <br>\r\n\"Ugh, I give up. Everything here is pink. I'll just get the cutest thing I see. I better hurry though. It's already been like 5 minutes since Shannon has left the room. Unless\u2026\" I make my way to a window and see Jessi on the pillow by herself. \"Ok so I haven't been forgotten\u2026 good.\" I re-search the house for the cutest clothes I could find while thinking about this revolution.<br>\r\n\"It'll never work.\" I think. \"We're all less than half than any of their sizes. Not only that, what would we be able to accomplish? They can pick us up with one hand or trap us under practically anything. Besides, if we even do manage to find the shrink ray, what are we gonna do with it? Shrink Peter? He's our only hope at getting back to normal. Shrink Olivia? Well, it's weird but\u2026 she sorta grew on me already. But if it gets us back to normal, it might be worth it. But who's to say he won't just make Olivia big and punish us? Or punish us before he even makes it? Shrink his wife? Well the same thing applies\u2026 who's the say he'll return us to normal too?\" I interrupt myself for a moment when I see a cute dress. \"Oooh! This is totally cute. I'm gonna wear this.\" I'm surprised by the fact that they managed to ONLY get pink outfits to shrink. I mean, it's not like pink is the only thing Barbie wears. While putting on the dress and headband, I go back to the idea. <br>\r\n\"There's nothing we can do with the shrink ray. It'll be too big for us anyways\u2026 unless we manage to shrink the shrink ray. HA! That'll be funny. Just bounce it off a mirror and make it hit itself. Darn it. I don't want to be a doll forever. Maybe if I run this by Jessi she'll have some good insight.\"<br>\r\nAfter putting on my dress I go outside of the house and wait for Shannon, or anyone really, to return. I look down and Jessi is still on the pillow. \"It's been 10 minutes. Does it take that long to confirm sleepovers?\" From the shelf I'm on, the bed seems hundred of feet down. The drop would probably kill a girl my size. To a normal sized person, it's a few feet. Tall enough for a 4 foot girl to reach while she's kneeling on top of the bed that's significantly high up. \"Do I want to wait this out, or try to get to Jess?\" </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">So this is a project I hope I keep constantly updating and don't abandon after one summer like I do with all my other ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere we take on 5 foot 11.5 inch tall Charlotte's point of view as we go through her story and how she ended up shrinking to Barbie's petite little size of 11.5 inches. <br>\r\nCharlotte is a volleyball player and a cheerleader, although she's not as important to either of the varsity team she happens to be on. This is because she's the shortest girl on the volleyball team by 3.5 inches (at least), making her too small to play volleyball, and the tallest girl on the cheerleading squad by over 6\", making her too tall to be a cheerleader. Despite these critiques, she is very good at both sports. <br>\r\nAs mentioned, she is 5'11.5\" tall, just narrowly missing that 6' mark, and LOVES country music. She also loves dressing up like a country girl, knee-high leather boots and all, but also loves wearing dresses. Her best friend is her 4'10\" flyer Jessi who is also blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Charlotte was a little girl, she's always been told she looks like Barbie, and/or that she model. She thinks it's her lucky break when she sees a promotion from Mattel to do a Barbie photo shoot. </td>",
