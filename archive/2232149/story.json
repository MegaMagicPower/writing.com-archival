Please report to the principal's office\".</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door swung open, and a very fat, short, stout boy with brown hair, waddled into the principal's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mrs. Hunsinger, did you call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Dylan! Dr. Shepherd is waiting for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA middle-aged woman with greying brown hair sat behind a desk. She pointed past her waiting room, to a door on the other side of the room, which had gold-leaf lettering painted on the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. E.J. SHEPHERD - PRINCIPAL\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mrs. H\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, and watched the boy waddle across the room, past the chairs for people to wait in, past the side-tables stacked with out-of-date magazines, and past the pot-plant, which seemed to be the only thing in the whole room with more life than Mrs. Hunsinger. He knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" said a man's voice. Dylan pushed the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called, Dr. Shepherd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Dylan! Wonderful! Yes, come inside! Close the door, young man, and sit down\", said the principal, pointing to a couch on one side of his office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Shepherd got to his feet. He was a middle-aged man, overweight, and wearing a grey, two-piece suit with a rather boring striped, blue tie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Dylan...um...as I understand it, you signed up to be a student guide, didn't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh! Yeah!\" said Dylan, sitting down on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! And you're willing to be the guide, companion...friend, I guess...of any new students who join the school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Or I'll try to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good!\" said Dr. Shepherd. \"There's a new student who just started this week, and I wanted to buddy him up with someone who was going to be friendly, and helpful, and who could show him around town and stuff like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" said Dylan, eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic! You wait here, I'll go get him. He's in the meeting-room nearby. I'll just be a minute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan sat on the couch while he waited for Principal Shepherd to return with this...new student. Who could he be? Or she? Or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould the new kid like him? What if he hated him? Dylan got to his feet. One of the reasons why he had volunteered to be a Student Guide was to try and make friends...which wasn't easy when you were the fattest kid in school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan!\" said Dr. Shepherd, waddling in, \"This is Flavius! Flavius, this is Dylan, he'll be your guide, companion, and hopefully, your new best friend!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan peered curiously around, and his jaw DROPPED!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriding into the room was the most stunningly handsome, perfectly perfect, amazingly BEAUTIFUL boy that Dylan had ever seen in his life! He trembled when he felt something stirring in his shorts, just from LOOKING at the boy! His whole body seemed to radiate some sort of primeval aura, as if his body wasn't just glistening from the sunlight coming in through the windows, but even from his own body sparkling in gold! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was tall - at least a head taller than Dylan. He had thick, luscious, golden-brown hair that was all messy and hung around his face like a lion's mane. He was broad-shouldered and had a strong, angular face. His skin was flawless, his teeth straight as a ruler! He didn't have an ounce of fat on him, and it was obvious, even under his jeans and polo-top, that he was in absolute PEAK physical condition! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan wondered if perhaps this kid was a runner? Or a swimmer? Or a cyclist? He stared at the boy's thighs and butt, which looked way too-well-formed to be real! Dylan felt his mouth go dry when he spotted the THICK bulge in the boy's jeans! It was as unmissable as everything else about him, and he swallowed quickly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flavius, this is your new companion, Dylan!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!...'kay\", said Flavius. He held out a hand and grasped Dylan's chubby paw, squeezing so hard that Dylan felt his knuckles cracking! He winced! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah!!\" he gasped, and pulled away. Flavius chortled, \"Sorry dude...Cool!...I...I mean, yes sir...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. You two can spend the rest of the day together. Dylan, show Flavius around the campus. He'll be following your timetable from now on\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK!\" said Dylan, \"Sure!...C'mon uh...Flavius...this way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old are you?\" Flavius asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten!\" said Dylan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! We're the same age!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan STARED at Flavius. If Flavius was ten, Dylan was a poodle! He was almost six inches taller than him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...sure!\" said Dylan, quickly. When just his handshake could almost break Dylan's wrist, he decided that perhaps it would be a good idea NOT to piss off the new kid. He could probably send him through a brick wall if he wanted to! <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could feel Flavius's eyes burning into him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So um...uh...w-what kind of name is Flavius, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an old Latin name\", said Flavius, \"It means GOLDEN...y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran his fingers through his thick, luscious golden locks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!...Uh...yeah!\" said Dylan, feeling stupid for some reason. \"Um...you have...um...nice hair\", he said, sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" said Flavius. He swept it back out of his face. The sunlight shone off of his polished features and well-sculpted physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is the cafeteria...and through there are the boys' toilets...the girls are on the other side over there...down this corridor is the assembly hall...and over there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed across the corridor, \"Is the school library. It's on two floors, and there's a staircase and a reading and writing room, and then next door upstairs is the computer-lab and tech-support room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" said Flavius. He turned to Dylan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have many friends around here?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan didn't know why, but the question pierced him like a knife! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at Flavius, blushing deeply, \"N-not really...nobody wants to be friends with...y'know...the FAT kid...\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan wasn't ashamed of his weight. He was rather proud of it, actually. He was never the athletic, active type, and preferred comfort over speed, good food over fast lap-times...he guessed that Flavius was everything that he was not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool!\" said Flavius, \"I think I like you!\" he said. He reached out and rubbed Dylan's full, round belly. Dylan gasped, and belched suddenly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius smirked and rubbed his belly a little more firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, tubby-tubby-tubby!\" he teased. \"Nah dude, you're cool. You look good with a few extra pounds on you...what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan turned to where Flavius was staring at the...</span></div></div>",

Let's go check it out, dude...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan nodded and he waddled ahead of Flavius to the doors, pushing them open for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head down the steps and then turn right\", he said. Flavius nodded. Dylan closed the door behind them and hurried out after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\" said Flavius, staring at the playground again. A slide, a jumpy-bridge, ladders, cargo-nets, ropes, monkey-bars, swings, a seesaw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe!! Wow, this looks awesome...\" he said, walking around it and checking it out. \"I love it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be lunchtime soon\", said Dylan, \"We could come back after we've eaten and play on it, if you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, totally!\" said Flavius. He climbed up some steps to a tower right at the top of the playground, towering an easy twelve feet up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peasants! Kneel before thy god!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan laughed and Flavius chuckled and jumped down the stairs and back onto the grass below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't have jumped down like that\", said Dylan, \"You looked kinda fun up there...y'know...all...noble or whatever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" said Flavius. He drew his hair back. The sun shone down on him and he almost seemed to glow golden yellow in the daylight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...thanks, man\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was busy showing off on the monkey-bars to...nobody in particular, when a sound behind him made him turn around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey fatass! Did you have lunch yet, fatass? Y'know it's almost midday, right? Or did you have lunch before you have lunch so that you can have lunch again and then have lunch after lunch so you can have three lunches a day, because you're a fatass??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius flipped off the monkey-bars and landed on the ground. He turned around and spotted a boy with dark hair standing over Dylan...not by much...but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piss off, Arlo! I've got stuff to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can see that! Being a fatass!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" said Flavius, \"S'goin' on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArlo turned around and spotted the new kid. His jaw dropped when he was struck by Flavius's freakish beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he hardened up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you care, Twinkles?\" he snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave him alone, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you MAKE me!? Or are you scared you'll bruise that pretty pretty kissy-girl face of yours!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next happened so fast that Dylan could hardly believe what he was looking at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom halfway across the playground to right up against him, Flavius had closed the distance between himself and Arlo in what felt like half a second! At the same time, Arlo was grabbed by the throat, hoisted into the air an easy six feet and then hurled backwards! He hit the wall of the school's cafeteria, knocking him out cold! Students who were in the cafeteria rushed to the window when they heard the commotion and stared outside. Dylan gawped in stunned amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew Flavius was strong...but not THIS strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't see nothin'\", he said to Dylan, firmly. Dylan nodded, too terrified and awestruck to disagree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right!\" he said quickly, and waddled after Flavius, \"Dude wait up! H-how did you...what...dude! That was Arlo Benton! He's the biggest bully in school! Do you know what you've just done!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, tubby. He ain't gon' bother you no more...He'll have me to deal with...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan hurried after Flavius as he walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can't...we'll get in...you'll be expelled! We...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, he's fine\", said Flavius dismissively, \"Chillax, bro...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius raked his thick golden hair. \"Nothin' to worry about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan gulped. Then he spotted the gold rings on Flavius's fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...we-we're not allowed jewelry and stuff at school...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? S'not like teachers are gonna care what I'm wearin'\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look expensive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Course they are. They're gold...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? Like, some rich, movie star's son? Or whatever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius laughed. \"Yeah sure, let's go with that...\" he said. </span></div></div>",

He was also much taller than every other kid in the room by a lot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan followed after Flavius, gasping at his radiance. His whole body seemed to GLOW with gold. He simply couldn't get enough of Flavius's amazing body - he looked fantastic from literally any angle - even looking at his ass was an experience to behold - firm, round, and sculpted, it looked like it had been carved from polished diamonds, and it filled out his jeans to a positively scandalous degree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...s-s-seriously!\" Dylan panted, \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Flavius\", said Flavius simply. \"Flah-Vi-Us.

It tickles!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Dylan spotted something on Flavius's hand. A solid gold wristwatch, with \"PATEK PHILIPPE\" on the dial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" he gasped, \"Your folks must be RICH!! My dad only bought one of those after he got promoted at work, and you just like...have one, lying around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh...yeah, I bought it last month. I thought it looked cool. I have a few more at home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you, like Richie Rich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why not?

Where'd you g-waah!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan, in his rush, had bumped into a bookcase, knocking something off the shelves...which he then promptly tripped over! Spinning around, he grabbed a hold of one of the railings and tried to pull himself upright! The entire bookcase creaked and rocked, and Dylan hit the ground! He let out a yelp of terror when he saw the towering mass rushing towards him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...it wasn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-huh!?\" he gasped, still out of breath from hitting the floor so hard that he was sure he broke something!

He reached out and grasped Flavius's wrist...it was like grabbing frozen granite! Rock hard and smooth! He could feel the corded muscles bulging underneath his triceps...Dylan recoiled! Flavius was definitely MUCH stronger than he appeared...and he appeared to be strong enough to throw a tank off of a cliff! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius snapped his fingers and Dylan coughed and blinked. When he stared around him, all the books that had laid on the floor were now back on the shelves...neat, tidy, and all in order!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS EVERYTHING ALRIGHT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan JUMPED about two feet in the air when Mrs. Ervine came hurrying down the aisles, \"I heard someone shouting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'alright Mrs. E.

He grasped Dylan by the arm, and squeezed so hard that Dylan was SURE his arm was going to break!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Oh I see!\" said Mrs. Ervine. \"Um...very well then! Dylan, DO be more careful!\" she said, before smiling, and leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW DID YOU DO THAT!?\" Dylan hissed at Flavius, as they walked to the reading-area at the end of the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what? Stop a bookcase from falling over? I caught it! Duh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius sat down and Dylan STARED at him. SOMETHING was not right here! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! You were about a MILE ahead of me! You couldn't have made it from HERE...to THERE...in half a second! There's no way a regular kid could catch and hold an ENTIRE bookcase like that! OR push it back upright! Or...OR be as strong as you are! Or have all this kinda...kinda MONEY!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your watch! Your jewelry! OK, I might buy that - perhaps your folks are STUPID RICH - but all the rest of it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan relax! It's fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S NOT FINE!!..If MY parents were so rich they could afford to buy their kid a LUXURY wristwatch, I wouldn't be going to THIS dump of a school! How come YOU are? And don't say your parents are cheap, because THAT...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured to all of Flavius's expensive jewelry, \"Says that they're pissing gold!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? You're mad at me because I'm RICH?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I...I DUNNO! You're so PERFECT! I can't stop STARING at you!

He always had this effect on people...on...mortals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, calm down!\" he said, and laughed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I mean...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan STARED at Flavius. There was CERTAINLY something NOT right here. Flavius was just FAR too PERFECT. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hair shone like spun gold. His face was soft and smooth, his eyes a rich blue. His body was jacked! Even though he was wearing jeans, boots and a grey polo-top, there was no hiding his massive physique...or his massive endowment! Dylan stared openly at the full, packed bulge in Flavius's jeans and gestured to it wordlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and you've got money and strength and everything!\" he said, once Flavius started actually paying attention to him again. \"HOW are your parents...are you like some sort of scientific freak or something?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius laughed. \"Wow you have SUCH an incredible imagination\", he said, rolling his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...I...think...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius smirked. He leaned forward and stared down at Dylan, smiling sweetly. Dylan stared up at him and blushed. Did he HAVE to look THIS cute??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...you would easily become the coolest kid in this school by FAR just from standing up!\" Dylan said, \"You're tall, you're like...FREAKISHLY good-looking...you're strong!...Nobody would mess with you, that's for sure...not after they saw you throw Arlo into a brick wall...and you're rich! So seriously, who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you keep a secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you're not the president's bastard son or something, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius laughed! \"Nah!\" he said. \"I am a deity\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...a w...a diet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"De-i-ty...You know? A god?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan burst out laughing. \"Yeah right! God...good one, man...no seriously, who are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Dylan yelped! He felt himself being lifted off the ground by an immeasurable, invisible force! He was slammed into the ceiling and spun around, slowly, until he was hanging upside down in the air! The candy-bar in his pocket fell out and Flavius caught it in one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You DARE to challenge my power,<b> mortal</b>?\" he rumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-holy shit!\" Dylan gasped. \"Dude put me down!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius waved his hands and made Dylan fly around the room like a model airplane!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, okay I believe you!! Put me down!!\" Dylan gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius snapped his fingers and Dylan floated carefully back to Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...h...how did you...what...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dared to doubt my powers\", said Flavius, smugly, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I yeah...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Flavius Aurelius, God of Youth, Strength, and Beauty\", he said, \"And YOU, Dylan Richards, are one of my millions of subjects. I am your Lord, God, Emperor, your ultimate ruler, and guardian, all rolled into one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" said Dylan. \"Um...Hi!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna kill me now or something, are you, since I know your secret or whatever, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...that'd be sweeet...\" said Flavius. He smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I was just kiddin'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius laughed. Then he smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the God of Youth\", he said, \"it's my job to keep an eye on the kids around the world, and make sure they're doin' alright overall\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Cool!\" said Dylan. \"...what makes me so special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You're cute, OK!?\" said Flavius, \"And even GODS have favourites, a'right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow. A cute, sexy, all-powerful GOD thinks I'm CUTE! Oh my...\" said Dylan, pretending to swoon and blush. Flavius burst out laughing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuddup!\" he said, and punched Dylan in the arm...perhaps a little harder than he'd wanted to, because he sent Dylan flying off his feet into a sofa nearby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh woops! Sorry dude...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...you're really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you want me to make you walk on water or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piss off, man, I'm not a magician!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was Dylan's turn to laugh, and he smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...you wanna be friends with the fat kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not? Like I said, I like you, man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...I've...never had any real friends before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well you got the best one in the world, now\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius gripped Dylan by his arm and easily pulled him back upright, Dylan wincing in the universal STRENGTH that was contained in Flavius's awe-inspiring physique! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besides, I think you look cute\", he reminded him, and patted Dylan's bulging belly. Dylan blushed, for real, this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan stared around, \"Nobody else knows this, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only those who I tell, know about it. And besides. If you DID tell someone else, who's gonna believe you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...right\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius smirked. </span></div></div>",

About the size of a large cookie, and just as thick! It was studded with diamonds and other jewels, intricate designs, and something written in Latin around the edges. It was solid gold, and came with a long, gold chain which Dylan could wear around his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...I...I mean...uh...thanks!...You're not gonna kill me for that, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius stared at him intently for a minute.

It was raging hot and the sand was almost being fried under his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a week since Dylan had met his new friend Flavius, and yet in all that time, he had hardly seen him more than a handful of times. After his first encounter, he'd only spotted him twice, all week! Now that it was the weekend, he could relax and enjoy a proper summer by the beach with his friend Wesley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley was short, brown-haired and tanned, with soft chocolate eyes and a cheeky grin. He wore thin-framed spectacles and had a necklace of mother-of-pearl disks around his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon dude! I wanna get a good spot before they're all taken!\" Wesley squeaked, as he stumbled across the sand to the beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys hurried around the corner of a cliff and found the perfect spot for them to play, away from the larger crowds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan dumped his buckets and spades, and the two boys started digging in the sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man it's hot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys started digging a massive hole, piling the sand up around them and building walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far down do you think we can get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't stoppin'! At least it's cooler down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaves washed over the sand and Dylan started carving out a trench leading to the hole, to fill it with water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sweating!\" he gasped. It was 110 degrees outside! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your shirt and stuff off!\" said Wesley, \"It's just us here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan yanked his shirt off, and kicked off his shorts and sandals, until he was standing in just his child's XXXL trunks. He tossed his clothes onto a large, flat rock nearby where Wesley had also started putting his clothes, along with some towels they'd brought with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley reached over and tugged at the gold chain and lifted up the heavy, golden medallion hanging across Dylan's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" he said. \"It's even got a diamond thing in it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held it up to the sunlight and it shone through the huge diamond in the middle of the medallion, and out the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faaancy!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan nodded and held the medallion up to the sun. It let out a BLINDING flash that dazzled both the boys! Suddenly, Dylan stumbled back, tripped over his bucket and crashed into the waves behind him!...</span></div></div>",

As he sank beneath the water, he felt a sudden movement all around him, like some kind of powerful shockwave! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe staggered to his feet, coughing and spluttering! He fought his way back to the beach - which wasn't easy with how deep his feet were sinking into the wet sand - and he stood there in his soaked-through swimming-trunks!

He fell flat on his fat ass and looked up to see a beautiful red and gold galley being rowed through the water towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe galley was several dozen feet long, with two dozen oars sticking out - twelve on each side. At the front of the galley was a boy beating on a drum, and at the back, Dylan could just see another boy with his hands on the tiller of a large rudder. The middle of the galley had a large, enclosed cabin with windows on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe galley rowed right up to the beach and stopped in the sand. A ramp slid off the bow and into the surf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beating on the drum stopped and the boy who was doing it got up, walked down the ramp and pointed at the galley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our Master invites you to visit him\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...?\" Dylan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy gestured again to the ramp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...wh...who...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan stared around, in case there was anybody else there. Apart from Wesley - they were alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our Master invites you to visit him\", the boy said again. He pointed to the gold medallion, resting at the top of Dylan's huge, round belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M...OH!\" he said. \"Oh thanks! Uh...yeah okay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan?\" said Wesley, nervously, \"W-where are you going!?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I'm going to uh...uhm...visit a friend!\" said Dylan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he stopped, one foot on the ramp, \"Hey! You should come too!\" he said suddenly, \"C'mon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what!? I don't even know...where...how...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan climbed aboard. All the boys were young, shirtless and wearing sandals with dark blue trunks on. They stood up as he boarded and gestured towards the main cabin in the middle of the galley. </span></div></div>",

He passed the boys with their oars and entered the cabin. At the same time, the ramp was raised and the boys at the back started rowing, pulling the galley away from the beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabin was luxurious in the extreme! In the middle were two chaises on which the boys were invited to lay. Either side were enormous buffet tables loaded with food! Out the windows, Dylan could see the scene changing as the galley was steered and turned around. The rocking of the water felt relaxing underneath him. In the distance, he could hear the steady beating of the drum. More boys dressed in blue trunks started serving hem food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do your master want with us?\" Dylan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master wants you to be comfortable\", said the boy who had been beating the drum. He had taken a rest and was letting another boy take over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Oliver\", he said. Dylan smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what seemed like no time at all, the galley started to slow down, and Dylan sat up as it slowed to a stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view outside the windows changed and he GASPED when he saw what awaited them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had pulled up outside what looked like a GIGANTIC tropical island oasis in the middle of nowhere! Through the trees and bushes, the sand and everything else, he spotted TOWERING white walls that SOARED into the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe galley stopped and the boys climbed off. Oliver walked them onto a white stone jetty, and along a roadway of more large, flat, white stones. They crossed a bridge and entered a walled area built near a massive waterfall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond the gigantic wall, Dylan and Wesley were BLOWN AWAY by a GIGANTIC, gleaming, snowy-white palace of marble and gold which sparkled in the summer sunlight! It stretched out for MILES in every direction! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOAH!!\" said Wesley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached what looked like the towering, grand entrance, they saw gold letters above the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>\"FLAVIUS AURELIUS DEI ADOLENSCENS ET VENUSTAS\"</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uuuuh...\" said Dylan, trying to read it slowly, but he could only guess at what he was seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" Wesley whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered. The entrance foyer was gigantic and cavernous! The boy, Oliver, led them up a small flight of stairs, through another set of doors, and into an even MORE gigantic room further beyond! At the far end, past several large pillars and enormous stained glass windows, was a slow, rising flight of stairs with two landings halfway up. The two boys climbed. As they set their feet on the bottommost step, they felt a cold shivering sensation ripple through them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys climbed the stairs. When they reached almost the top, they spotted a large red and blue canopy. Underneath is a blue chaise with a golden frame. Reclining on it is a figure of unsurpassed beauty and youth, fawned over by at least another dozen slaves, fanning, massaging and feeding him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley's jaw dropped, and Dylan gasped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Flavius!?\" he blurted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius shifted on his throne, and Dylan gasped when he realised that he was just wearing a jockstrap...and what looked like a crown made of pure gold, studded with diamonds, shaped like a laurel-wreath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he said, \"You guys made it! C'mon up here, dudes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan waddled upwards, and was about to speak, when Flavius cleared his throat, and held out his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan dropped to his knees and kissed the gold ring on Flavius's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe...attaboy\", he said, stroking Dylan's hair. \"Aaaaand you too, Wes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...okay!\" said Wesley. He also knelt and kissed the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's how it's done right there...\" said Flavius, smugly. \"Never forget, boys. I am your GOD first, and your FRIEND second. As such, you will show me respect and obedience first, above all things...and in return I will give you my friendship\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys gulped nervously. Flavius laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill!\" he said, \"I ain't gonna do nothin'...you guys are alright...\" he said. He shifted on his throne and snapped his fingers. Instantly, slaves brought forth a pair of chairs for his two guests to sit on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I invited you here to let you two know that you are now both living within my protection\", he said. \"I know you two guys get bullied a lot, and I want you to know that so long as you have that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to medallion hanging around Dylan's chest, \"You'll have me watchin' your backs...from here, most of the time, but whatever...\" he said. </span></div></div>",

In fact, it\u2019s gonna be my treat, bruh!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius swung his thick, long arm around Dylan\u2019s neck, as he pulled the shorter but stockier boy closer towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here, dude! I want everybody to know that from now on, you and I are gonna be bros, okay?\u201d Flavius added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d Dylan mumbled. He felt a little uncomfortable with Flavius walking next to him with his arm resting on his shoulder. What if any of the tough guys from school would see him? Then again, Flavius was a cool, big and tall guy, so hopefully he would help him out in case he\u2019d get in trouble with the high school thugs. Of course, Dylan had no idea how strong Flavius was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys reached the small 7-11 convenience store which was only two blocks from Dylan\u2019s house. They walked in, and Dylan went straight for the candy aisle. Flavius wandered around a bit, scoping out the drinks in the cooler, before settling on one of the sports drinks. Then, he joined Dylan and took a chocolate bar from the same shelf where Dylan had grabbed one for himself. The pair walked up to the counter to pay. There was a long line, so Dylan just stood outside and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan was just looking at the cars in the parking lot when suddenly two motorcycles pulled up. He did not recognize the riders until they stepped off the bikes and removed their helmets. They were Victor and Wyatt, two 17-year-old students on the high school wrestling team. The high school was located down the street from the grade school and the Brookdale Middle School which Flavius and Dylan attended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well\u2026\u201d Victor sneered. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t the neighborhood fat-boy!\u201d he said to Dylan, who was standing just a foot away from the entrance to the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here, chubby? Getting FATTER?\u201d Wyatt added. \u201cThe sun won\u2019t melt your fat away, you know, butterball?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up! Leave me alone!\u201d Dylan shouted back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor shoved Dylan against the brick wall. Dylan groaned as his back and head hit the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen here, Lard-face! If you don\u2019t give us a few bucks right now, then I\u2019m gonna punch a hole in your fat belly\u2026 Right about NOW!\u201d Victor hissed as Wyatt looked on with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuzz off! Go steal money from somebody else!\u201d Dylan yelled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyatt reached down and placed his hand around Dylan\u2019s neck, forcing his head against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better be nice to us, or else\u2026\u201d Victor threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two thugs were grabbed by their jackets from behind and they were quickly raised off the ground and suspended in the air as they heard a voice come from behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr else\u2026 WHAT?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFLAVIUS!\u201d Dylan shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius held the two thugs over a foot above the ground before he turned towards the brick wall, where he flung both thugs.  They fell to the ground, moaning in pain before they both managed to get back on their feet so they could turn to face the man who pulled them away from Dylan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou thugs leave my little bro alone!\u201d Flavius spoke in a serious tone of voice. \u201cNext time you pick on Dylan, you will answer to ME!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young men rushed to their motorcycles and they placed their helmets on their heads before they started their engines and rode off in a hurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Flavius. Those guys are always picking on me. Now you know what I have to deal with all the time. I owe you one.\u201d Dylan sighed. He almost started to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Heyyyy! You\u2019re my bro! My pal! Those guys are a bunch of morons, okay?\u201d Flavius smiled as he placed his big arm on Dylan\u2019s shoulder as he nudged him to start walking. \u201cThey won\u2019t bug you anymore. Here is your chocolate bar!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius munched on his power bar while Dylan nibbled on his chocolate bar while the two boys walked to the house. Once they arrived, Dylan\u2019s mother appeared to know everything about Flavius\u2019 arrival and about him staying over at the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan led Flavius into his bedroom where Flavius set his bag down on the floor while Dylan went to use the bathroom to freshen up. When Dylan came out of the bathroom, his jaw dropped wide open when he saw that his bedroom had become three times bigger than it was before, and the ceiling was at least 20 feet high. The bedroom was huge! There were now two beds, two desks, two dressers and two bookcases in the large bedroom! Plus, Flavius\u2019 bed was enormous! It was over 10 feet long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What\u2026 What happened to my room?\u201d Dylan stuttered. \u201cIt changed! It mean\u2026 It\u2026 It GREW!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is OUR room now!\u201d Flavius explained. \u201cI had to make it bigger and I had to raise the ceiling to adjust for my true height!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-y-your height?\u201d Dylan wondered. \u201cUhh\u2026 Y-y-you mean\u2026 You\u2019re supposed to be even TALLER than you\u2019re now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, exactly!\u201d Flavius smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before Dylan\u2019s very eyes, Flavius started to grow, and grow\u2026 and GROW. Within moments, Dylan\u2019s new buddy was over nine feet tall! Dylan was barely reaching his waist! Flavius was towering over him like a true preteen GIANT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa\u2026 WHOA!\u201d Dylan gasped, taking several steps back. \u201cNo way\u2026 I must be dreaming\u2026 No\u2026 freaking\u2026 way\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I better explain a few things, huh?\u201d Flavius smiled, as he looked down on his pal, who was just staring at him in complete disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So I guess you don't have anything to worry about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what...who-who are you!?\" Dylan gasped.

He wanted to take things slow, and reveal himself, one thing at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan and Flavius joined Dylan\u2019s parents at the dinner table, where they scooped up some helpings of spaghetti and meatballs along with salad and baked chicken. The food was simple and delicious, but Flavius decided to add an extra taste to everything, making the meal even more tasty. He quietly snapped his fingers, and extra dashes of peppers and spices were added to the pasta and spaghetti, making everything just amazing. The chicken had an additional curry taste to it, and the salad had more vegetables added to the bowl, like olives, onions, and cucumbers. Even sliced eggs were added. The food had never tasted so rich before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, mom, I didn\u2019t know you could cook like this!\u201d Dylan smiled as he gobbled up his spaghetti, finishing up his second bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe food is wonderful, ma\u2019am.

It was great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen dinner was over and everybody was done eating, Flavius gracefully stood up and collected all the empty plates, glasses and silverware. In no time at all, he washed all the dishes, he dried them off, and he even put everything away. Dylan\u2019s mom was very pleased, indeed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan and Flavius finally retreated to their large bedroom where they crawled on their large bed, feeling satisfied after having eaten such a big meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, that was so good!\u201d Dylan sighed. \u201cThe only thing that could top it off would be some chocolate for dessert\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChocolate?\u201d Flavius spoke, as he lay on the large bed next to Dylan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan rolled to his side so he could face his bigger pal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026. Okay, since you\u2019re a god\u2026 Do\u2026 Can you grant wishes?\u201d he asked his bigger, divine friend and roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude\u2026 I can do just about anything! But\u2026 I\u2019m no genie! I\u2019m a god! I don\u2019t grant wishes. I make things happen if and when I want them to happen! I\u2019m always in charge!\u201d Flavius stated as he slowly stood up from the bed and wandered over to the foot of the large bed. \u201cLet me show you what I REALLY look like!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius gently pulled his shirt over his head, revealing his large, expansive torso, containing his big, bulging pecs and his ripped, well-defined abdominal muscles. He finally exposed his long, thick arms, which were big and round with his thick triceps and biceps. He was incredibly muscular! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan\u2019s jaw dropped wide open. Flavius was truly a big guy in every area! Now only was he very tall, but he was incredibly muscular from the looks of it! And, Flavius was not even done showing off everything, yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Flavius carefully removed his long, baggy sweatpants, revealing his thick, long, ultra-muscular legs. Never in his life had Dylan seen a kid with such thick, wide, bulging quads and calves before. He was truly a sight to see. Flavius was bigger than the biggest muscle man in those bodybuilder magazines! By now, Flavius was only wearing his bright, white briefs, which covered his groin. Dylan could see his whole body, from his feet to his head. And, the boy looked incredible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Dylan. Now, I\u2019m gonna grow back to my TRUE size. I want you to see what I really, REALLY look like, without all those clothes on!\u201d Flavius announced. \u201cI\u2019m kinda shrunk right now. So, I\u2019m gonna have a little growth spurt\u2026 So, don\u2019t freak out, okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius stood exactly straight up as he craned his head back while he closed his eyes firmly shut. Then, he let out a soft moan while Dylan looked on. Very slowly, Flavius began to grow taller and wider, all at once. His long legs grew even longer and thicker while his torso expanded in every single direction. His shoulders widened even more while his arms bulged at the same time, making the boy slowly grow into a young, Hulking giant. Within moments, the young god had grown into a 9-foot-tall muscle giant. Dylan could only look on with his jaw wide open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-F-Flavius?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026 Man\u2026 That feels good to be normal again!\u201d The giant boy smiled, looking down at the smaller mortal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan began to feel exceedingly small, when, for the second time that day, he could barely reach up to Flavius\u2019 waist. If Dylan looked straight ahead of him, all he would see were Flavius\u2019 thick, long, powerful legs. Flavius looked even more impressive now since he wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes. Dylan had a true sense of what the boy god looked like, how big, and how muscular he really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Flavius lay down on the large bed, resting his head on the giant pillow as Dylan looked on. The boy\u2019s body seemed gigantic to him. His legs were endlessly long. His torso and shoulders were very wide. Dylan had never seen anybody as BIG as Flavius before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan just sat on his bed, staring at the giant boy as he grabbed the little chocolate candy bar. He took a bite and chewed on it, as he looked over the expansive body before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I bet you could eat a LOT at that size!\u201d Dylan said. \u201cI mean\u2026 Your body is just\u2026 HUGE!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, pal\u2026 You could eat a lot, too\u2026\u201d Flavius smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026 I don\u2019t have much. I mean\u2026 all I got is this stupid chocolate bar. One more bite and\u2026 It\u2019s gone. I wish I had more of it to enjoy!\u201d Dylan said sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to answer your previous question, I could grant a wish, if I wanted to!\u201d Flavius chuckled. \u201cDo you want more chocolate?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan stared at the small chocolate bar in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell, yeah!\u201d he responded. \u201cI could eat three or four of these!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Let\u2019s put that statement to the test, shall we?\u201d Flavius laughed, as he snapped his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, after this next bite, the bar\u2019s all g\u2014\u201d Dylan mumbled, as he took one more bite. But, wait! The moment he bit off a piece of chocolate, the bar grew back on the opposite end! \u201cHEY! What the heck?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery time you bite off a piece of that chocolate bar, a new piece grows back on the other end of it!\u201d Flavius explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dylan asked, staring at the chocolate which had mysteriously grown in length. He examined the bar before he brought it up to his mouth before biting off another chunk, and\u2026 ZONK! The bar grew again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh! Unlimited chocolate! Man! I must be dreaming!\u201d Dylan cheered. \u201cThis is so COOL!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan lay down next to Flavius, quietly munching away, until he had another ten or eleven bites. He was getting rather full by now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhhh, man\u2026 My tummy hurts\u2026\u201d Dylan moaned, as he set the chocolate bar on the dresser. \u201cI ate too much\u2026. Uhhhh\u2026.\u201d Dylan placed his hand over his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here, big guy! I\u2019ll give you a belly rub!\u201d Flavius ordered. Flavius snapped his fingers again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Dylan\u2019s body began to levitate through the air before he rested on top of Flavius\u2019 mighty torso. Dylan\u2019s head rested on his pecs, where he lay wonderfully comfortable. Flavius then reached down with his big arms and his large hands, and he began to rub Dylan\u2019s big belly with his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhh\u2026 Uhhhh\u2026 Ohh, God\u2026. Uhnnnnggg\u2026. Urrghhh\u2026 Ohh, this is\u2026 The best\u2026 Belly rub\u2026 Ever\u2026\u201d Dylan moaned, as Flavius\u2019 shovel-sized hands gracefully passed over his belly, rubbing it in an up-and-down motion. It felt so good, that after 20 minutes, Dylan fell sound asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so cute\u2026 Sleep well, little Dylan\u2026\u201d Flavius whispered as he began to hear a light snore coming from Dylan as his mouth dropped slightly open while his eyes were closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius snapped his fingers and all the lights in the room shut off. He went to sleep as well, with Dylan sleeping on top of him. It would be their first night together as friends, brothers, and roommates. For Dylan, it would be the beginning of an incredibly unique relationship. His best friend was a god! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He yawned when he woke up and rolled over, to find Dylan fast asleep next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muurrrgggghhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dyyyyyylan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius leaned over and gave Dylan a kiss on the back of the neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Wh-what!?\" Dylan yelped, jumping upright! Suddenly, he rolled off the bed with a crash!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!!\" he groaned!...He'd landed on top of his LEGO house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude, but I had to wake you up. I gotta whizz!\" Flavius grunted, and got up and went to use the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couuld've just tapped me on the shoulder!\" Dylan groaned as he pulled plastic bricks out between his chubby toes. \"Aww man, it took me two days to build this thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude! I didn't wanna have to climb over Mount Dylan, here...\" he said, rubbing Dylan's sizable belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hah-hah! What's the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"6:30\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan yawned. \"School...\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it isn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Saturday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!...Gee...I wish all school weeks passed this easily...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan turned to Flavius, \"I mean...you could make that happen, couldn't you? Speed up time or whatever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius sat on his bed and rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude. I am a GOD. Not a fucking GENIE! Okay!? I'm here to do a job! Not grant your stupid wishes! You have any idea how insulting that is to me!? You ask me that again, and someone is gonna get themselves into a lot of trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I..\" Dylan began, \"I didn't think that...I didn't...I mean...oh...um...yeah I...I guess it would be...yeah. You're not gonna turn me into a frog or something, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius glared at Dylan, but then he smiled, \"Nah\", he said, \"But c'mon dude, no more wishes or whatever, okay? If you want something or stuff, just ask! It's so humiliating being asked to grant wishes all day. I'm not some stupid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I get it! Sorry!\" said Dylan, groaning. Flavius nodded. He went to the window and opened the blinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man it's hot out!\" he said. The sun was starting to rise, and it was already blazing hot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like to do?\" Dylan asked. \"We could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
