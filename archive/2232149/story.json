Please report to the principal's office\".</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door swung open, and a very fat, short, stout boy with brown hair, waddled into the principal's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mrs. Hunsinger, did you call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Dylan! Dr. Shepherd is waiting for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA middle-aged woman with greying brown hair sat behind a desk. She pointed past her waiting room, to a door on the other side of the room, which had gold-leaf lettering painted on the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. E.J. SHEPHERD - PRINCIPAL\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mrs. H\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, and watched the boy waddle across the room, past the chairs for people to wait in, past the side-tables stacked with out-of-date magazines, and past the pot-plant, which seemed to be the only thing in the whole room with more life than Mrs. Hunsinger. He knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" said a man's voice. Dylan pushed the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called, Dr. Shepherd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Dylan! Wonderful! Yes, come inside! Close the door, young man, and sit down\", said the principal, pointing to a couch on one side of his office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Shepherd got to his feet. He was a middle-aged man, overweight, and wearing a grey, two-piece suit with a rather boring striped, blue tie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Dylan...um...as I understand it, you signed up to be a student guide, didn't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh! Yeah!\" said Dylan, sitting down on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! And you're willing to be the guide, companion...friend, I guess...of any new students who join the school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Or I'll try to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good!\" said Dr. Shepherd. \"There's a new student who just started this week, and I wanted to buddy him up with someone who was going to be friendly, and helpful, and who could show him around town and stuff like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" said Dylan, eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic! You wait here, I'll go get him. He's in the meeting-room nearby. I'll just be a minute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan sat on the couch while he waited for Principal Shepherd to return with this...new student. Who could he be? Or she? Or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould the new kid like him? What if he hated him? Dylan got to his feet. One of the reasons why he had volunteered to be a Student Guide was to try and make friends...which wasn't easy when you were the fattest kid in school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan!\" said Dr. Shepherd, waddling in, \"This is Flavius! Flavius, this is Dylan, he'll be your guide, companion, and hopefully, your new best friend!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan peered curiously around, and his jaw DROPPED!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriding into the room was the most stunningly handsome, perfectly perfect, amazingly BEAUTIFUL boy that Dylan had ever seen in his life! He trembled when he felt something stirring in his shorts, just from LOOKING at the boy! His whole body seemed to radiate some sort of primeval aura, as if his body wasn't just glistening from the sunlight coming in through the windows, but even from his own body sparkling in gold! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was tall - at least a head taller than Dylan. He had thick, luscious, golden-brown hair that was all messy and hung around his face like a lion's mane. He was broad-shouldered and had a strong, angular face. His skin was flawless, his teeth straight as a ruler! He didn't have an ounce of fat on him, and it was obvious, even under his jeans and polo-top, that he was in absolute PEAK physical condition! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan wondered if perhaps this kid was a runner? Or a swimmer? Or a cyclist? He stared at the boy's thighs and butt, which looked way too-well-formed to be real! Dylan felt his mouth go dry when he spotted the THICK bulge in the boy's jeans! It was as unmissable as everything else about him, and he swallowed quickly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flavius, this is your new companion, Dylan!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!...'kay\", said Flavius. He held out a hand and grasped Dylan's chubby paw, squeezing so hard that Dylan felt his knuckles cracking! He winced! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah!!\" he gasped, and pulled away. Flavius chortled, \"Sorry dude...Cool!...I...I mean, yes sir...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. You two can spend the rest of the day together. Dylan, show Flavius around the campus. He'll be following your timetable from now on\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK!\" said Dylan, \"Sure!...C'mon uh...Flavius...this way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old are you?\" Flavius asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten!\" said Dylan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! We're the same age!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan STARED at Flavius. If Flavius was ten, Dylan was a poodle! He was almost six inches taller than him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...sure!\" said Dylan, quickly. When just his handshake could almost break Dylan's wrist, he decided that perhaps it would be a good idea NOT to piss off the new kid. He could probably send him through a brick wall if he wanted to! <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could feel Flavius's eyes burning into him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So um...uh...w-what kind of name is Flavius, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an old Latin name\", said Flavius, \"It means GOLDEN...y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran his fingers through his thick, luscious golden locks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!...Uh...yeah!\" said Dylan, feeling stupid for some reason. \"Um...you have...um...nice hair\", he said, sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" said Flavius. He swept it back out of his face. The sunlight shone off of his polished features and well-sculpted physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is the cafeteria...and through there are the boys' toilets...the girls are on the other side over there...down this corridor is the assembly hall...and over there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed across the corridor, \"Is the school library. It's on two floors, and there's a staircase and a reading and writing room, and then next door upstairs is the computer-lab and tech-support room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" said Flavius. He turned to Dylan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have many friends around here?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan didn't know why, but the question pierced him like a knife! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at Flavius, blushing deeply, \"N-not really...nobody wants to be friends with...y'know...the FAT kid...\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan wasn't ashamed of his weight. He was rather proud of it, actually. He was never the athletic, active type, and preferred comfort over speed, good food over fast lap-times...he guessed that Flavius was everything that he was not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool!\" said Flavius, \"I think I like you!\" he said. He reached out and rubbed Dylan's full, round belly. Dylan gasped, and belched suddenly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius smirked and rubbed his belly a little more firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, tubby-tubby-tubby!\" he teased. \"Nah dude, you're cool. You look good with a few extra pounds on you...what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan turned to where Flavius was staring at the...</span></div></div>",

Oh, that's the school's swimming-pool\", said Dylan, who noticed Flavius staring out of a window to a large, glass building nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, cool! Love swimming, dude\", Flavius said, \"Hope I get to use that, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like swimming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a-a bit...\" Dylan said, blushing. \"I...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you don't like to swim with other people watching, 'cause you're FAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan's face BURNED with embarrassment and Flavius laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill, dude...you're cool, you're cool.

I guess that's why Dr. Shepherd asked you to be my buddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius wrapped a massive arm around Dylan's chest and gave him a rough bro-hug! Dylan laughed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop!\" he said, \"That tickles!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!? How about this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius dug his fingers into Dylan's fat-rolls and jiggled them around! Dylan squeaked and pushed him away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop!!\" he gasped, and laughed. Flavius smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess that means we'll be living together. I'll be here for a few months at least\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Cool, I guess!\" said Dylan, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Flavius. \"It'll be fun, man!\" </span></div></div>",

In fact, it\u2019s gonna be my treat, bruh!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius swung his thick, long arm around Dylan\u2019s neck, as he pulled the shorter but stockier boy closer towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here, dude! I want everybody to know that from now on, you and I are gonna be bros, okay?\u201d Flavius added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d Dylan mumbled. He felt a little uncomfortable with Flavius walking next to him with his arm resting on his shoulder. What if any of the tough guys from school would see him? Then again, Flavius was a cool, big and tall guy, so hopefully he would help him out in case he\u2019d get in trouble with the high school thugs. Of course, Dylan had no idea how strong Flavius was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys reached the small 7-11 convenience store which was only two blocks from Dylan\u2019s house. They walked in, and Dylan went straight for the candy aisle. Flavius wandered around a bit, scoping out the drinks in the cooler, before settling on one of the sports drinks. Then, he joined Dylan and took a chocolate bar from the same shelf where Dylan had grabbed one for himself. The pair walked up to the counter to pay. There was a long line, so Dylan just stood outside and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan was just looking at the cars in the parking lot when suddenly two motorcycles pulled up. He did not recognize the riders until they stepped off the bikes and removed their helmets. They were Victor and Wyatt, two 17-year-old students on the high school wrestling team. The high school was located down the street from the grade school and the Brookdale Middle School which Flavius and Dylan attended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well\u2026\u201d Victor sneered. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t the neighborhood fat-boy!\u201d he said to Dylan, who was standing just a foot away from the entrance to the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here, chubby? Getting FATTER?\u201d Wyatt added. \u201cThe sun won\u2019t melt your fat away, you know, butterball?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up! Leave me alone!\u201d Dylan shouted back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor shoved Dylan against the brick wall. Dylan groaned as his back and head hit the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen here, Lard-face! If you don\u2019t give us a few bucks right now, then I\u2019m gonna punch a hole in your fat belly\u2026 Right about NOW!\u201d Victor hissed as Wyatt looked on with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuzz off! Go steal money from somebody else!\u201d Dylan yelled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyatt reached down and placed his hand around Dylan\u2019s neck, forcing his head against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better be nice to us, or else\u2026\u201d Victor threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two thugs were grabbed by their jackets from behind and they were quickly raised off the ground and suspended in the air as they heard a voice come from behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr else\u2026 WHAT?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFLAVIUS!\u201d Dylan shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius held the two thugs over a foot above the ground before he turned towards the brick wall, where he flung both thugs.  They fell to the ground, moaning in pain before they both managed to get back on their feet so they could turn to face the man who pulled them away from Dylan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou thugs leave my little bro alone!\u201d Flavius spoke in a serious tone of voice. \u201cNext time you pick on Dylan, you will answer to ME!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young men rushed to their motorcycles and they placed their helmets on their heads before they started their engines and rode off in a hurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Flavius. Those guys are always picking on me. Now you know what I have to deal with all the time. I owe you one.\u201d Dylan sighed. He almost started to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Heyyyy! You\u2019re my bro! My pal! Those guys are a bunch of morons, okay?\u201d Flavius smiled as he placed his big arm on Dylan\u2019s shoulder as he nudged him to start walking. \u201cThey won\u2019t bug you anymore. Here is your chocolate bar!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius munched on his power bar while Dylan nibbled on his chocolate bar while the two boys walked to the house. Once they arrived, Dylan\u2019s mother appeared to know everything about Flavius\u2019 arrival and about him staying over at the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan led Flavius into his bedroom where Flavius set his bag down on the floor while Dylan went to use the bathroom to freshen up. When Dylan came out of the bathroom, his jaw dropped wide open when he saw that his bedroom had become three times bigger than it was before, and the ceiling was at least 20 feet high. The bedroom was huge! There were now two beds, two desks, two dressers and two bookcases in the large bedroom! Plus, Flavius\u2019 bed was enormous! It was over 10 feet long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What\u2026 What happened to my room?\u201d Dylan stuttered. \u201cIt changed! It mean\u2026 It\u2026 It GREW!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is OUR room now!\u201d Flavius explained. \u201cI had to make it bigger and I had to raise the ceiling to adjust for my true height!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-y-your height?\u201d Dylan wondered. \u201cUhh\u2026 Y-y-you mean\u2026 You\u2019re supposed to be even TALLER than you\u2019re now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, exactly!\u201d Flavius smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before Dylan\u2019s very eyes, Flavius started to grow, and grow\u2026 and GROW. Within moments, Dylan\u2019s new buddy was over nine feet tall! Dylan was barely reaching his waist! Flavius was towering over him like a true preteen GIANT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa\u2026 WHOA!\u201d Dylan gasped, taking several steps back. \u201cNo way\u2026 I must be dreaming\u2026 No\u2026 freaking\u2026 way\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I better explain a few things, huh?\u201d Flavius smiled, as he looked down on his pal, who was just staring at him in complete disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He jumped back onto his bed and whipped the covers up over his head, when his room was filled with BLINDING golden light! Suddenly, the light vanished, and Flavius had returned to his 'mortal size'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I should explain a few things\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the bed and reached for the covers, but Dylan yelped and scrambled back! He reached out and picked up a fake, wooden sword that he'd picked up at some Renaissance Fair or whatever, and swung it through the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from me!\" he yelped, \"W-what are you!? Some kind of alien!?\" he said. \"Dad! Mom!

The blankets were whipped off of Dylan's body and Dylan himself was sent hurtling into the air! He bounced off the walls until he was floating in mid-air in the middle of his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan...Dylan, Dylan, Dylan..\" said Flavius slowly, \"I REALLY don't want to hurt you...so please stop freaking out...for five minutes? Please? So I can talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan YELPED as he felt his whole body spinning around the room, rushing through the air until he was slammed against the ceiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better\", said Flavius, calmly. \"Now Dylan...what I am about to tell you is personal...private...and secret. If you tell anybody what I'm about to tell you, then I WILL have to kill you. But then, even if you did tell anybody, nobody would really believe you, would they? So I guess you don't have anything to worry about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what...who-who are you!?\" Dylan gasped. He struggled but wasn't able to move as an invisible force kept him pinned to the ceiling! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Flavius Maximus\", Flavius said. \"Prince of Youthful Perfection. Defender of Children and Youthful Innocence...I have been sent to the Mortal Realm to watch over the children of the world...My father is the God-Emperor of Universal Creation, which makes me not only royalty...but divine royalty...I have the power to do whatever I wish...but as I have said...I am the Defender of Children...I am here to protect you...and guard you against those who would do you harm...provided, of course, that you keep my secret\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you really...really are a god?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius waved a hand and suddenly the floor exploded into raging lava!

Oh wow, now I'm offended!\" said Flavius, \"Perhaps I should just leave you up there now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE! Not cool!

Flavius quickly shrunk back to his normal size, changing his clothes to a casual sweatpants and long-sleeve t-shirt. He wasn\u2019t quite ready to reveal his true physique to his buddy, yet. He wanted to take things slow, and reveal himself, one thing at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan and Flavius joined Dylan\u2019s parents at the dinner table, where they scooped up some helpings of spaghetti and meatballs along with salad and baked chicken. The food was simple and delicious, but Flavius decided to add an extra taste to everything, making the meal even more tasty. He quietly snapped his fingers, and extra dashes of peppers and spices were added to the pasta and spaghetti, making everything just amazing. The chicken had an additional curry taste to it, and the salad had more vegetables added to the bowl, like olives, onions, and cucumbers. Even sliced eggs were added. The food had never tasted so rich before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, mom, I didn\u2019t know you could cook like this!\u201d Dylan smiled as he gobbled up his spaghetti, finishing up his second bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe food is wonderful, ma\u2019am. Thank you so much!\u201d Flavius said politely. He just smiled as he looked on at how Dylan was enjoying the food. It made him so happy to see Dylan eat. It was great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen dinner was over and everybody was done eating, Flavius gracefully stood up and collected all the empty plates, glasses and silverware. In no time at all, he washed all the dishes, he dried them off, and he even put everything away. Dylan\u2019s mom was very pleased, indeed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan and Flavius finally retreated to their large bedroom where they crawled on their large bed, feeling satisfied after having eaten such a big meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, that was so good!\u201d Dylan sighed. \u201cThe only thing that could top it off would be some chocolate for dessert\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChocolate?\u201d Flavius spoke, as he lay on the large bed next to Dylan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan rolled to his side so he could face his bigger pal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026. Okay, since you\u2019re a god\u2026 Do\u2026 Can you grant wishes?\u201d he asked his bigger, divine friend and roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude\u2026 I can do just about anything! But\u2026 I\u2019m no genie! I\u2019m a god! I don\u2019t grant wishes. I make things happen if and when I want them to happen! I\u2019m always in charge!\u201d Flavius stated as he slowly stood up from the bed and wandered over to the foot of the large bed. \u201cLet me show you what I REALLY look like!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius gently pulled his shirt over his head, revealing his large, expansive torso, containing his big, bulging pecs and his ripped, well-defined abdominal muscles. He finally exposed his long, thick arms, which were big and round with his thick triceps and biceps. He was incredibly muscular! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan\u2019s jaw dropped wide open. Flavius was truly a big guy in every area! Now only was he very tall, but he was incredibly muscular from the looks of it! And, Flavius was not even done showing off everything, yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Flavius carefully removed his long, baggy sweatpants, revealing his thick, long, ultra-muscular legs. Never in his life had Dylan seen a kid with such thick, wide, bulging quads and calves before. He was truly a sight to see. Flavius was bigger than the biggest muscle man in those bodybuilder magazines! By now, Flavius was only wearing his bright, white briefs, which covered his groin. Dylan could see his whole body, from his feet to his head. And, the boy looked incredible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Dylan. Now, I\u2019m gonna grow back to my TRUE size. I want you to see what I really, REALLY look like, without all those clothes on!\u201d Flavius announced. \u201cI\u2019m kinda shrunk right now. So, I\u2019m gonna have a little growth spurt\u2026 So, don\u2019t freak out, okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius stood exactly straight up as he craned his head back while he closed his eyes firmly shut. Then, he let out a soft moan while Dylan looked on. Very slowly, Flavius began to grow taller and wider, all at once. His long legs grew even longer and thicker while his torso expanded in every single direction. His shoulders widened even more while his arms bulged at the same time, making the boy slowly grow into a young, Hulking giant. Within moments, the young god had grown into a 9-foot-tall muscle giant. Dylan could only look on with his jaw wide open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-F-Flavius?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026 Man\u2026 That feels good to be normal again!\u201d The giant boy smiled, looking down at the smaller mortal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan began to feel exceedingly small, when, for the second time that day, he could barely reach up to Flavius\u2019 waist. If Dylan looked straight ahead of him, all he would see were Flavius\u2019 thick, long, powerful legs. Flavius looked even more impressive now since he wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes. Dylan had a true sense of what the boy god looked like, how big, and how muscular he really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Flavius lay down on the large bed, resting his head on the giant pillow as Dylan looked on. The boy\u2019s body seemed gigantic to him. His legs were endlessly long. His torso and shoulders were very wide. Dylan had never seen anybody as BIG as Flavius before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan just sat on his bed, staring at the giant boy as he grabbed the little chocolate candy bar. He took a bite and chewed on it, as he looked over the expansive body before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I bet you could eat a LOT at that size!\u201d Dylan said. \u201cI mean\u2026 Your body is just\u2026 HUGE!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, pal\u2026 You could eat a lot, too\u2026\u201d Flavius smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026 I don\u2019t have much. I mean\u2026 all I got is this stupid chocolate bar. One more bite and\u2026 It\u2019s gone. I wish I had more of it to enjoy!\u201d Dylan said sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to answer your previous question, I could grant a wish, if I wanted to!\u201d Flavius chuckled. \u201cDo you want more chocolate?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan stared at the small chocolate bar in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell, yeah!\u201d he responded. \u201cI could eat three or four of these!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Let\u2019s put that statement to the test, shall we?\u201d Flavius laughed, as he snapped his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, after this next bite, the bar\u2019s all g\u2014\u201d Dylan mumbled, as he took one more bite. But, wait! The moment he bit off a piece of chocolate, the bar grew back on the opposite end! \u201cHEY! What the heck?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery time you bite off a piece of that chocolate bar, a new piece grows back on the other end of it!\u201d Flavius explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dylan asked, staring at the chocolate which had mysteriously grown in length. He examined the bar before he brought it up to his mouth before biting off another chunk, and\u2026 ZONK! The bar grew again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh! Unlimited chocolate! Man! I must be dreaming!\u201d Dylan cheered. \u201cThis is so COOL!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan lay down next to Flavius, quietly munching away, until he had another ten or eleven bites. He was getting rather full by now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhhh, man\u2026 My tummy hurts\u2026\u201d Dylan moaned, as he set the chocolate bar on the dresser. \u201cI ate too much\u2026. Uhhhh\u2026.\u201d Dylan placed his hand over his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here, big guy! I\u2019ll give you a belly rub!\u201d Flavius ordered. Flavius snapped his fingers again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Dylan\u2019s body began to levitate through the air before he rested on top of Flavius\u2019 mighty torso. Dylan\u2019s head rested on his pecs, where he lay wonderfully comfortable. Flavius then reached down with his big arms and his large hands, and he began to rub Dylan\u2019s big belly with his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhh\u2026 Uhhhh\u2026 Ohh, God\u2026. Uhnnnnggg\u2026. Urrghhh\u2026 Ohh, this is\u2026 The best\u2026 Belly rub\u2026 Ever\u2026\u201d Dylan moaned, as Flavius\u2019 shovel-sized hands gracefully passed over his belly, rubbing it in an up-and-down motion. It felt so good, that after 20 minutes, Dylan fell sound asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so cute\u2026 Sleep well, little Dylan\u2026\u201d Flavius whispered as he began to hear a light snore coming from Dylan as his mouth dropped slightly open while his eyes were closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius snapped his fingers and all the lights in the room shut off. He went to sleep as well, with Dylan sleeping on top of him. It would be their first night together as friends, brothers, and roommates. For Dylan, it would be the beginning of an incredibly unique relationship. His best friend was a god! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He yawned when he woke up and rolled over, to find Dylan fast asleep next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muurrrgggghhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dyyyyyylan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius leaned over and gave Dylan a kiss on the back of the neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Wh-what!?\" Dylan yelped, jumping upright! Suddenly, he rolled off the bed with a crash!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!!\" he groaned!...He'd landed on top of his LEGO house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude, but I had to wake you up. I gotta whizz!\" Flavius grunted, and got up and went to use the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couuld've just tapped me on the shoulder!\" Dylan groaned as he pulled plastic bricks out between his chubby toes. \"Aww man, it took me two days to build this thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude! I didn't wanna have to climb over Mount Dylan, here...\" he said, rubbing Dylan's sizable belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hah-hah!

Speed up time or whatever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius sat on his bed and rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude. I am a GOD. Not a fucking GENIE! Okay!? I'm here to do a job! Not grant your stupid wishes! You have any idea how insulting that is to me!? You ask me that again, and someone is gonna get themselves into a lot of trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I..\" Dylan began, \"I didn't think that...I didn't...I mean...oh...um...yeah I...I guess it would be...yeah. You're not gonna turn me into a frog or something, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavius glared at Dylan, but then he smiled, \"Nah\", he said, \"But c'mon dude, no more wishes or whatever, okay? If you want something or stuff, just ask! It's so humiliating being asked to grant wishes all day. I'm not some stupid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I get it! Sorry!\" said Dylan, groaning. Flavius nodded. He went to the window and opened the blinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man it's hot out!\" he said. The sun was starting to rise, and it was already blazing hot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like to do?\" Dylan asked. \"We could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
