            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">It had been just about a week since your dad went missing and the rest of your family got turned into special zombies, while you had definitely noticed a change in their behavior, at least they aren't trying to devour your brains.  You're currently in bed, though it's the morning you've found that you no longer have much to do as normal zombies don't attack your mother or your sisters anymore so now your mother is the one who goes out and collects supplies most of the time.  Looking to your side you could see your sister Mary clinging to your right arm as she slept naked, even though you've asked her to stop she says \"if you won't let me sleep with you then Mom or Sis will have to sleep with you\" of course this isn't for no apparent reason, depending on how close a zombie is to you, you have to be closer to your mother or one of your sisters to not be detected, you found this out through some experimenting with the zombies in the street though it isn't effective up close, it's just so that you don't attract zombies during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the covers slightly with your left hand, you looked your sister up and down as she slept, out of all your family, she was probably the safest, your mum would probably try to kiss you and Liz... well she'd definitely do something.  As you were absentmindedly observing Mary, you realized just where your right hand was.  the back of your hand was rubbing up against her privates and the second you made that realization you tried to move your arm away but her grip was like iron, you were stuck in a truly humiliating position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took over an hour before you managed to free yourself from your little sister's grip and as you walked down the hall, right on cue, Liz stepped out the bathroom with only droplets of water upon her grey skin, yep, just like with Mary, you had also gotten used to Liz walking out of the bathroom with nothing on \"hey Sis\" \"hey Bro\" she said in response to your greeting with a smirk across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived in the kitchen to the sound of your mother Becky humming to herself while making you breakfast \"Hello Ken\" your mother said while giving you a beautiful wide smile \"hi mom\" you said while trying to stop your face from turning red, the reason you were blushing was because of your mother's change, while your sisters adopted their habits, like Liz walking around nude and Mary sleeping with you naked, your mother had adopted a habit more straight forward than her daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Becky had finished making breakfast she brought it over to you at the table, you were about to dig in when \"aren't you going to thank mommy\" she said while pointing to her cheek, you knew what she was going to do but you played along as to not upset her, just before your lips met her cheek she moved her head so that you would lock lips with her instead \"oops, silly me\" she said, like all the other times she just brushed it off as an accident, when you saw her lick her lips you decided it would be safest to start eating now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just finished eating your breakfast when both of your sisters walked in, Mary still with dreary eyes.  You think now would be the best time to tell them how you feel \"hey, I want to go out on a supply run\" they all had varying degrees of surprise on their faces and your mother looked like she was going to oppose but before she could say anything you continued speaking \"I know that you're just going to tell me that it's too dangerous but I really need to get out of this house, it isn't fair that I'm the only person who isn't allowed outside\" while opposed, they did seem to understand where you were coming from so your mother spoke up \"ok Ken but only if you take at least one of us with you for protection\" she said this while still wearing a conflicted look on her face \"yes of course mum, I promise that I'll always take one of you with me and thank you for understanding\" you felt both relief and nervousness, hopefully after spending so long inside you haven't lost what it takes to survive out there \"so, who're you going to take?\" Mary asked inquisitively \"well I think I'll take...</font></span></div></div>",

You were walking down the road hand in hand with your mother, while this was embarrassing, it did mean that you attracted less attention from the normal zombies, everything around you was trashed, all the streets were in disrepair and had been looted dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a good 3-4 hours to arrive at what was once a supermarket but was now an unidentifiable mess, walking around inside you looked at the shelves with your mother, most of the food had already been taken but you managed to find the occasional can of some strange brand of beans on a lower or higher shelf, it looked like whoever looted this place last must have been in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were staring at the surprising and slightly worrying amount of canned beans you now possessed when your mother grabbed you and pulled you into her embrace causing you to drop your bag.  Before you could complain to your mother about making you drop your beans, you noticed it too, there were zombies snooping around and boy were you unlucky.  A roaming horde had wandered into the store you were inside and though they hadn't been alerted to your presence yet, they were gradually encroaching on you and would eventually surround you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up your bag while still hugging your mother and trying to stay as quiet as possible, after getting it on your back, you and Becky began walking down the aisle away from the store entrance as there were too many zombies there, you were hoping to find an emergency exit but before you could get out the aisle, a zombie began walking down it from the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now trapped, in one direction there was a horde and in the other, there was a single zombie but if you killed said zombie, the horde would definitely notice, the only reason you haven't already been noticed was because of your mother holding you so close and speaking of your mother, she's being very unresponsive, almost like she's lost in thought, you were about to ask if she was ok when she said \"there's only one way we're getting out of this together\" you looked at her with an exaggerated expression of surprise at how she had managed to come up with a plan to get you out of this dire situation \"you need to be inside me\" she said with her 100% serious face on, \"WHAT\" you almost screamed which got the attention of some zombies but luckily they didn't seem to know where the sound originated from, \"well it's simple, zombies take less notice of you the closer you are to one of us but if you get to close to them they'll notice you, so you just need to be as close to me as possible which is inside me\" she gave you a second to decide before you said \"yes\" if it meant you'd survive then you'd do anything \"so how am I getting inside you\" you asked which she replyed with...</font></span></div></div>",

After agreeing that continuing to check these more populated areas was pointless and dangerous, you both decided to walk towards a small wood that wasn't too far away in hopes of finding something to hunt or at least some berries to pick.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both had adventurous spirits and weren't afraid of the undead beasts that lay in the forest.  While walking,  Liz joked about how it would be funny if you ended up getting turned by a zombie mouse but you knew that was impossible as something that small couldn't inject enough zombie virus for you to turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile exploring you and Liz completely lost track of time, the sun had set and you were in a dark forest, \"we can't go back when it's this dark, it's too likely that we'll get lost on the way and be in an even worse situation, we should wait till morning when we can see\" your sister made a solid point, if we tried going back while it was pitch black then we would just get lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to get a fire going after about an hour or two of trying, it was freezing, you hadn't packed well for cold nights as you hadn't expected to be stranded through the night, you had started eating into the rations in your pack but soon lost your appetite because of the cold weather, \"Mum and Mary must be worried sick\" your sister said while staring at the ground seemingly unbothered by the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting colder by the minute and your sister was now trying to provide you with as much warmth as possible by hugging you close to her, the warmth her body provided had severely dropped since she turned but it was better than nothing \"I think I may know a way to warm you up but you're not going to like it\" she said in a quiet voice, all you could respond with was \"I'm freezing\" as you didn't care what she did to you, you just wanted to get warm.  To your surprise, she parted from you and started taking her clothes off \"what are you doing\" you said in a moody tone because it looked as if she was just showing off that she didn't feel the cold at all \"well I don't want to rip my favorite shirt\" she said as if it was obvious \"what, I still don't understand\" you said while shivering \"well when you're inside me, my belly will probably get really big, so I don't want you to rip my shirt\"<br>\r\nthis was getting absurd \"if you don't believe me then I'll show you I can fit you... probably\" after she said this she proceeded to slide her hand down her throat then back out again but she didn't stop there, she did this with her vagina, urethra and her anus which really worried you \"so which do you want to go in?\" she said this while you were desperate and you didn't have the will to refuse her.</font></span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">It's been just over a month since the infection began, your family was doing fine but one day your father went out on a supply run and didn't come back, so after waiting hours you finally decided to go look for him.  You never found your farther and while angry and depressed, you searched for food in hopes that you may stumble upon a clue to what happened to him but while you did find the food you were looking for, there was no sign of your farther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally got back to your house, you instantly knew something was wrong as the door had been knocked off its hinges and splinters littered the entrance.  Upon entering your house you were met by the horrific scene of your mother and sisters standing there covered in blood, their skin grey and their eyes bloodshot.  Clearly an extremely powerful zombie must have broken down the door and turned them all into zombies... or that's what you would have thought if you didn't hear your little sisters callout and greet you as you came in, now you were more confused than anything but your mother explained everything to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had left, a strange zombie broke down the door and went around biting everyone with such speed that they didn't have enough time to react.  When your family turned, the strange zombie introduced himself to your mother as Dr. Anti-Z.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZ explained to your mother about how he created a way to make undead beings with living qualities like healing and \"sanity\".  His plan was simple, create good zombies to eventually fight the bad zombies, Z doesn't want to eradicate humanity so he made it so that the only special zombie who can turn people is himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen age 16(you)<br>\r\nWith your extensive gaming knowledge, you will overcome this apocalypse... or at least that's what you thought at first but your farther's disappearance and the rest of your family being turned into zombies has really made you rethink your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave age 40(your farther)<br>\r\nMaybe you'll find him but he's probably been eaten by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky age 34(your mother)<br>\r\nShe's a loving mother who's a bit on the plump side but not so much that you'd call her fat, in your opinion the extra weight is in all the right places.  After turning into a zombie she's become more motherly to you, it feels like whenever she has the excuse to she'll give you a kiss on the lips and say \"oops, I meant the cheek\" and act as though it was an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz age 10(your sister)<br>\r\nShe's somewhat of a trouble maker most of the time, she likes playing \"fun\" made-up games with you.  After getting turned into a zombie she's become more revealing, she repeatedly walks out of the bathroom after having a \"wash\" without wearing anything and when you question her why she doesn't have a towel and why she miraculously always leaves the bathroom when you're around, all she said in response was \"well I keep on forgetting my towel and us meeting is just a coincidence\" she said this all while trying to hide the smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary age 4(your sister)<br>\r\nShe's a lovely person to have around as she practically radiates joy and she's very playful when she's with you.  After turning into a zombie she's become more attached to you, she likes spending as much time as possible with you and almost never lets you out of her sight unless you're your with your mother or sister, her new habit does go a bit too far as she now won't let you sleep alone which would be fine but the fact she does it naked makes you a bit uncomfortable but most nights you can just try and ignore her, unless she's clinging to you, then you probably won't get much sleep.  When you asked her why she has to sleep nude, she claimed that it was too hot even though you knew your family members could no longer feel pain or temperature but they do still have the sense of touch left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nkeep in mind that they don't have the power to turn people.<br>\r\nmay include vore(no digestion), unbirth and the normal stuff<br>\r\nNo death, gore, scat or m/m</td>",
