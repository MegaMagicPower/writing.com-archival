Yes I know how my last name sounds\u2026I have no idea as to why there\u2019s a last name called that but\u2026anyway back to my story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a normal night back in my room, I was trying to get to sleep but couldn\u2019t because of the dam heat\u2026it was around summer and you know how the nights can be like right? Anyway, it\u2019s gotten so hot that I just had to open my window to get cool air into my room\u2026but that was my\u2026well you can say\u2026it\u2019s my biggest mistake of my life. I don\u2019t remember much as at the time I just thought of it just a crazy dream as in it a bright white light flashed down upon my eyes, blinding me. When I opened my eyes again, I found myself lying on my bed.          <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my clock on the bedside, it read seven o\u2019clock and I was like, better get ready for school! So I rushed out of bed, into the bathroom, zooming past my eighteen year cousin Riza Small. \u201cHay I need a shower!\u201d said Riza as she banged the door. I be right out I said back to her as I was doing my normal business as all boys do when getting up in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes or so, I walked out and gone passed Riza without noticing something was different. I got back into my room and got myself changed, I noticed that my clothes felt a little lose but at that time I hardly took note of it. I grabbed my bag and headed downstairs and into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might as well tell you about my family, you see when I was only ten years old\u2026my parents died in a tragic car crash and my father\u2019s sister decides to take me in as part of her family. My aunt\u2019s name is Sara Small. Sara is a single mother of two daughters, both of which are twins\u2026I just mentioned one earlier on. Anyway my twin cousins are both two years older than me. My cousins\u2019 names are Ritz and Riza. The two of them goes to college but I can\u2019t remember what it is that they\u2019re studying. Well anyway off to school I must go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI arrived at my school in less than twenty minutes, lessons doesn\u2019t start till eight fifteen which was just under ten minutes from now. During this time, I bumped into my best friend Ronnie Jones\u2026we go way back but I save that for another time. The two of us just talked until the bell went off. The rest of the day went by in a breeze as I went back home\u2026I just pretty much fell asleep as I dropped onto my bed\u2026I must have pretty tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I woke up the next day\u2026I noticed something was strange the moment I sat up and looked around and noticed that things were out of place. As I got out of bed I felt something was little strange with the way my clothes felt but I was properly too sleepy to even notice. I got into the bathroom before Riza or even Ritz wanted to get in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy\u2026I must have been so sleepy that I didn\u2019t even notice that the toilet was just about as tall as my waist. Once I finished my business, I walked out and there stood both my cousins looking at me as if they saw a ghost. I just ignored them as I walked back into my room, with the girls following me but they just stood by the doorway. As I was about to turn to them, I saw a glimpse of my reflection on my mirror and I saw me shrouded in my clothes that was twice as big as they once were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t believe it\u2026I slowly walked towards the mirror to take a closer look at myself, I\u2019ve shrunk more than half of my size\u2026as there looking back at me was a three foot teenage boy. I just couldn\u2019t keep it in any longer as I just let a out a loud scream which caused my aunt rushing upstairs to see what the trouble was but as she reached her daughters, she looked shocked as she saw a half pint of boy that was once known as Paul Small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the three of them walked into the room as they just couldn\u2019t believe what they can see in front of them. I just looked up at their faces\u2026scared at what\u2019s to come. The twins wished they could stay but felt that they should leave me allow as they headed off towards college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis just leaves my aunt who just yesterday I towered over but now she towers over me. \u201cIt looks like none of your clothes will fit you anymore\u2026better find some old ones to wear\u201d she said as she stood up and grabbed my left hand pulling me along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara dragged me into her room, she pick me up and placed me on her huge bed. I looked down and saw that my feet cannot reach the floor. Sara went through her cupboard and took out a big box and dropped it right next to me. She opened it and I looked inside and saw many of my old clothes that I once worn many years ago. \u201cYou\u2026kept these?\u201d I asked as I looked up. Sara just smiled down and answered, \u201cI just wanted to keep the memories of you growing up, in fact I still have my twin daughters\u2019 clothes since they were born all the way till they were you\u2019re age\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that, Sara took out all of the clothes that she thought might fit me and to surprised me most was that the only clothes that almost fitted me as they were a bit lose was my ten year old ones. From that, I put on some of the clothes\u2026I just couldn\u2019t believe this was happening to me\u2026me\u2026I didn\u2019t do anything wrong so why am I being treated this way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t wanted to think much of it so I decided to just go downstairs and watch TV till I could put my head around it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just then the front door began to knock. \u201cYou just sit here while I go get the door\u201d said Sara as she stood up and headed towards the door. As she opened it, Ronnie and her friend Becky, the two of them are the same age as me and strangely I never really thought of this but the two of them is in fact the same size. Becky\u2026I have no idea as to why\u2026but she seem to hate me. I haven\u2019t done anything to her. She grew up along with me and Ronnie so I thought we could be friends but she just didn\u2019t want to know. Despite of this she can always be seen in every class Ronnie was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the story, <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSara let the two of them in but she told them that there\u2019s something different about me. Ronnie was the first to enter and all she saw was a little me sitting on the sofa looking at her. Slowly she walks towards me as I got off the sofa and stood up. I have no idea as to why, but Ronnie kneeled down and hugged me, pulling me close to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow\u2026how did you shrink?\u201d asked Ronnie as she let go of me. I looked up at the pretty face that belongs to Ronnie and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026I\u2019m sure that this will go away in a few days\u201d \u201cHmm\u2026do you really think that?\u201d asked Becky as she stood up as tall as she could. Looking up, I could only say yes. \u201cWell then\u2026if that\u2019s the case, then we better get used to you being small\u201d said Becky as she leaned towards me with her face up close to me. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHave you gotten clothes that will fit you?\u201d asked Ronnie. I just looked at the floor and shocked my head. \u201cThen\u2026\u201d she looked at Sara \u201cCan we have him go shopping for new clothes in the morning then?\u201d asked Ronnie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026after all Paul does need some proper clothes for school on Monday\u201d said Sara as she smiled at me. \u201cI have to go to school\u2026like this?\u201d I asked as I couldn\u2019t believe what she said. \u201cOf course you do\u2026after all, where\u2019s the fun for the other BIG people that would love to see you if you don\u2019t show up\u201d said Becky as she patted me on the head.         <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stayed true to her word that we would go clothes shopping. Ronnie dragged me to the bus stop and the two of us waited for our bus to show up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I knew it, I saw Ritz and Riza walking up to the same bus stop as us. \u201cOh hay Ronnie\u201d said Riza as she waved at us. \u201cHi Riza, hi Ritz\u201d answered back Ronnie as she waved back at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my twin cousins came up to us, to me it felt like they were taller than before, I looked at their feet and spotted that they were wearing high heels that made them to me five inches taller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Paul\u201d said Riza as she patted me on the head. I just rubbed my head as I looked up at her with a smile. \u201cWhere are you two going today?\u201d asked Ronnie. \u201cOh we\u2019re going to go clothes shopping\u201d answered Riza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to the mall, would you like to join us?\u201d asked Ronnie. \u201cWe love that\u201d said Ritz as she smiled at the two of us. Just then the bus we needed to go on showed up. Being a gentleman that I am, I allowed the girls to go on first and as I was about to climb on, I noticed that I couldn\u2019t really make it on as the gap between the bus and the floor was too far out of my reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the bus driver and saw that she looked at me; she looked back and said, \u201cHay\u2026isn\u2019t the little guy with you three?\u201d I just heard the girls laughing as my face were turning red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed that Ronnie stood up and was making her way towards the entrance but all of a sudden I began to flout a few feet in the air. \u201cDon\u2019t worry I help you out little man\u201d said a young girl whom was the one that held me in her hands. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I looked up and saw that Noemi was walking towards us and took a seat in front of us. I kept my head down as she looked at us. \u201cHi Ronnie, are you baby sitting this little man?\u201d asked Noemi as she smiled down at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the three of them to laugh out even more which I slowly looked up and looked at Noemi. Noemi looked at me for a while as she had that look as of she seen me before. \u201cI don't know why, but the little guy looks just like Paul\u201d she said as she looked at Ronnie and my twin cousins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's because it is\u201d said Ritz as she rubbed my head. \u201cIt is?\u201d said Noemi as she looked at he all shocked but strangely came to terms with it. It must have the longest bus ride in my whole life, as all I wanted was to get off this thing and go home as I kept on feeling the eyes looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe did however made it to the mall, I felt scared at walking through the mall filled with giants, mainly scared at seeing people I knew at school. I felt myself being shoved by Ronnie to start walking. I looked up and saw that Noemi was following us. \u201cSo do you need any new clothes?\u201d asked Ronnie as she looked at Noemi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I need some for summer holiday. Oh by the way, I'm having a beach party next week, you and friends are all invited to come\u201d said Noemi as she looked at us four.

We've entered a store and I noticed a very tall saleswoman walking towards us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, would you like some help?\" asked the woman as she smiled down at me then looked back at Ronnie. \"Oh yes please, as you can see, we need some new clothes for Paul here\" answered Ronnie as she rubbed my head. \"Okay then, lets see what we got for the little man\" said the woman as she lead the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we were walking, I could hear Ritz and Riza trying their hardest not to laugh. \"Here we are, If you need any help let me know\" said the woman as she stopped by the section that holds children clothes. \"Oh you got to be kidding me\" I said as I looked at how silly some of the clothes were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we need to buy some of the plain looking ones\" said Ronnie as she went through the clothes and noticed that more of them had cartoon characters on them. So I looked up and saw the three of them going through the clothes and took out a dozen of shirts, shorts, trousers, jumpers and even dare I say it, boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theses look like round your size\" said Riza as she held the boxers above me. \"Only one way to be sure\" said Ronnie as she called over the woman before. \"Yes?\" asked the woman. \"Where is the changing room?\" asked Ronnie. \"This way please\" answered the woman as she led the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as we reached a changing room, the three of them placed the clothes inside and watched me walk in. Well, to save you all time, I might as well tell you that the clothes that the girls picked out for me were alright as they fit well on me, not too tight and not too lose. I told them to buy theses which they did. For some reason, for my short size, the girls thought it would be funny to see me carrying the bag of clothes that was been bought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that only lasted for ten minutes as Ronnie took the bag off me and carried it herself. \"Well then, since you bought what you wanted, now we can get what we want\" said Ritz as she looked down at me with a grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we were walking towards the store that the twins wanted to go, the four of us ran into,   </span></div></div>",

Nothings wrong with his body, except for the fact he was some how shrunk. I recommend that he just try to live you life while we check for some sort of cure. I'm going to send samples into the highest research of medicine,\" Dr. Reeds explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was it... My story was sent into the world of science...

I walked up to my bed and sat down on and slowly I felt a huge sense of shame coming over me as I was lost within my own self pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy...why was this happening to me? I did nothing to anyone to have this brought to me, so why...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my cheeks all wet as I found myself crying. I felt lost within the world of giants and after today, I felt that what lies tomorrow, I may feel even more worst than before as it was Monday and despite being this size, I'm going to school. Yeah...like I wanted to go school where I will be treated like a child like Sara did back at the doctors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan...why did my doctor say that I have to live my life as if it was normal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo me, it felt like only like minutes since I began to sulk inside my room but to my surprise it was hours as my door began knocking that brought me back to own thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" I asked trying to hide my weeping voice. \"Its Ritz...are you alright?\" answered the voice behind the door. \"Yeah I'm fine, why you ask?\" I asked back as I jumped off my bed. \"Its just that mum said you two had a fight at the doctors and you ran off into your room\" answered Ritz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you asking that? You never worried about the times me and Sara fought\" I said. \"True but that before you've shrunk, Come on open the door\" said Ritz. Feeling a bit guilty, I opened my door by taking the lock off and in came Ritz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just sat on my bed and talked for a bit, which was making me feeling a bit better. After that she left and I suddenly felt sleepy as I knew I had a big day tomorrow, it was the day that I have to enter the school of giants.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dressed in my new clothes I felt that at least I had things that fit and didn't have to wear my old clothes that Sara saved all those years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting in Sandy's office, early before the school bell rang, it seemed to me to be ages before she turned up. It was one of those grand offices with plush fittings and some very nice antiques on shelves. The most notable of which was a massive tapestry on one of the far walls. Boy, this woman must be loaded, I couldn't help but think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Sara\" she said cheerily as she walked in, \"So what is the reason for Paul absence?\" I was taken back again by her exceptional height, so much more apparent now that I had shrunk, since last seeing her. Even as she sat down at her desk, I could see a major difference in the way she appeared to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Miss Anderson\" Sara said as she smiled at her. \"Hold on...where's Paul?\" asked Sandy as she looked at me and thought I was seven year old. \"Its...me miss\" I said as I waved a little on the chair that I was sitting on. Sandy looked at me funny and it took her a long time before she knew it was me as when she did, her eyes widen in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the reason why Paul wasn't at school Miss Anderson\" answered Sara as she rubbed the hair on my head. \"Well, it's rather difficult to explain\" I said as I haven't even got a clue as to how it happened. Sara took over and explained almost everything and was told by the family doctor for Paul to live out his life like normal till she could find a cure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is rather too fantastic for me to believe and yet there you are...small\" Sandy said  a bit incredulous, after hearing Sara speak. With that, and a deep breath on my part, I stood up. \"Oh my!\" she exclaimed, her hand covering her mouth, \"I know that you said he was small but I didn't think he would be that small\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the moment I was dreading came about as all six-foot something of the amazon that was the Headmaster, Sandy Anderson, Making her self a match to my Doctor Jessica Reeds.\"Oh my god, you are so small\" she whispered, walking in a circle around me, as if inspecting me. I merely stood there, looking at her as Sara just looked on as if it was funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh...\" I spoke, eager suddenly to get out from under her scrutiny as quickly as I could. Sara butted in, \"As you can see, he's a little vertically challenged, but I think he be okay for school\" \"Well, I hope you won't find things too challenging today\" \"I'm sure he manage\" said Sara as she stood up and walked towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he will right Paul\" she agreed with Sara as she looked at me as she made her way back to her desk, \"Uh, yeah\" I replied, as me and Sara walked out of the office and headed toward the form room which I dreaded as I looked at the clock and saw that the school bell was about to go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As I entered the room, I saw my form room teacher, Amber Scarlet standing by the white board. She has long blond hair, wears glasses along with a red short sleeve top, a long black skirt along with black high heels. Once she finished writing on the white board, she moved over to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Miss Scartlet,\" offered Sara with a confident smile and walked straight over to the desk that Amber was sitting there, one of her normal procedures of the day.\"Hey Sara\" said Amber as she looked up from her desk. \"Paul's back in today\" said Sara as she looked down. \"Feeling better today is he?\" asked Amber as she looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am\" I answered as all I walked next to Sara and I noticed that all I could see was Amber's feet as I couldn't see over the top of the desk. Amber looked around and noticed that she couldn't see me. \"Oh I'm sorry...my eyesight must be failing me at such a young age\" said Amber as she took her glasses off and rubbed her eyes. \"Oh your eyesight is perfectly fine\" said Sara as she smiled at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" asked Amber as she put her glasses back on. \"In fact...where is Paul anyhow?\" \"Best stand up and see for yourself\" answered Sara as she looked down at me with a smile. Doing what was asked, Amber stood up and walked to the side of her desk. She looked at Sara and then she looked down at me, thinking of me as a child at first and then slowly she began to see that it was me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a hard gulp as I looked up at the teacher as she kneeled down to get a better at me.\"What the!\" she said as she stepped back, incredulous. \"Paul! What? what happened to him?\" Sara explained as much as possible, along with explaining that the family doctor told Paul can carried on living like normal till there was a cure found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then...just so that you know Paul, I'm still going to treat you like any other student in this school\" said Amber as she smiled at me. Just then the school bell began to echoed. \"Best take your seat before the others get here\" Amber said as she walked back to her seat as I walked over to one of the seats. \"See you after school\" said Sara as she went over to me and kissed me on he forehead like a mother would do to their child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara walked out of the form room as slowly students that in my form entered. I could feel the eyes of them looking at me as they sat down. I noticed that Amber was true to her word as she didn't add fuel to the fire as she just carried on doing what she does. Just then, Ronnie entered the room along with Becky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky spotted me first and then Ronnie did as well. The two of them sat down next to me. \"Still short are you\" laughed Becky as she rubbed my head as Ronnie sat there trying not to laugh.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before I even know it, the bell began to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your first lesson Paul?\" asked Ronnie as she stood up from her seat with her bag on her. \"Its science\" I answered back as I jumped off my seat with a small bag that Sara brought me for school. \"Okay then, see you on second lesson\" said Ronnie as she and Becky left the form room and headed towards their lesson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly walked out of the form room and slowly headed towards the science room as I didn't want to bump into any of the giants that was marching down the hallways. By the time I reached the classroom, the school bell rang again to say that the lesson has started. As I was inside the room, I saw my science teacher, Clare Jones sitting by her desk and I saw other students sitting at their desks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Jones looked at me and asked, \"Are you lost?\" \"Erm...its me Paul\" I said back as I walked towards her. This seem to have cause some whispers in the room. \"Paul? Oh my...\" said Clare as if she just remembered something. She went to her desk and looked at a letter that was given to her by Sandy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The head spoke something like this\" said Clare as she finished reading. \"Is there a problem?\" I asked as I kinder knew that there was one. \"Oh no, take a seat next to Amy and we can start the lesson\" answered Clare as she looked at me as I walked over to the desk that was next to Amy, the smartest girl of my year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, me and Amy are friends since the we began high school, we tend to hang out and she normally help me with my homework and sometime allow me to copy her work. But over the years, she slowly hanging less time with me as she began to focus more on strange events that happens around the world, such alien sightings. Well with her seeing me like this, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to my story,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat there, Amy looking at me and said, \"Wow...what happened to you Paul?\" I looked up at her and said, \"I don't know really, I woke up last Friday like this\" I don't know what it is but something tells me that Amy will be spending a lot of time hanging out with me.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

With all the eyes, it was for some reason making me feel smaller than the size I'm already at. I stayed at my seat looking up at the teacher as she walked between the white board, her table and towards our desks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell began to ring, \"Okay students you can leave for next lesson\" said Clare as she looked at all the students. Everyone apart from me and Amy stood up and headed towards their second lesson. \"Hmm, why haven't you two left yet?\" asked Clare as she noticed us still siting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm waiting for the moment to go\" I answered as I looked up at her. Clare looked at her watch and said, \"Well you better go before the second bell goes\" With her saying that, I stood and left the room, with Amy following me. \"Why are you following me?\" I asked as I looked up at Amy walking beside me. \"I have the same lesson as you Paul\" she answered as she rubbed my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really\" I said as we were getting closer to my English room. As we were getting closer to the English room, I saw that there was line outside and saw that Ronnie and Becky was in the line. As I walked towards them, I saw that Becky looking down at me with a smile on her face. \"Look out people, Pipsqueak is here. Careful not to trip on him\" laughed Becky which caused some of the students in the line to snicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie looked over at me and saw that I had a red face. \"Ignore them Paul\" said Ronnie as she tried to cheer me up. By this time, the English teacher, Janette Solace walked up towards the door to her room. \"Come on in class\" said Janette as she opened the door and let the students enter. Taking a deep breath, I walked in alongside Ronnie, Becky and Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was in the room I sat down next to Ronnie.

Perhaps you haven't heard about Paul?\" answered Becky. \"Why, is there something wrong with him?\" asked Janette as she looked at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Instead of me saying it, look at whom sitting beside Ronnie\" answered Becky as she pointed towards Ronnie. Janette looked towards Ronnie and her eyes looked passed me as she scanned the seat that I was sitting on. \"Are you lying to me\" said Janette as she looked back at Becky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, miss, I'm right here\" I said as I saw the teacher looking back at the spot that I was sitting on. \"Okay, where is Paul, are you lot playing a prank?\" said Janette as she looked at everyone. \"I'm here miss\" I said as I stood up on the chair. As I saw the teacher looking at me, it looked like she saw a ghost as her face was pure as white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...wow, that took the breath out of me\" said Janette as she moved towards her table and sat down on it's surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, Paul sit down please\" said Janette as she looked at me with her book open. Just like that, it felt like everything was normal; it was like that I was always this small as everyone went back into learning what the teacher was teaching us. Janette carried on reading the Romeo and Juliet and by the end of the lesson, she even told us that the school will be holding a school play that will be based on the book hat we've just be reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For those that are interested, please come to the class room after school to sigh up for certain parts\" said Janette as she closed her book.

Which if you think about it, it makes me feel like an outcast. When we made it in, I couldn't believe just how tall each of the shelves stood, I...i couldn't even dream of trying to pick some books that were out of my reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then\" said Ronnie as she walked towards the computers that were in the library. As I walked towards the computer and sat down onto a chair, again like with all the other tables I couldn't see over the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just sat there, looking at Ronnie as she logged on. For the next twenty minutes, she just Googled many things that was popular . As the two of us was getting into it, the school bell rings.

Can you think what would happen with someone my size with the rest of normal sized guys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we were walking towards the gym, Amber's voice echoed my name. The two of us stopped in our tracks as I looked up at Amber as she walked towards us.

Knowing full well that me being at this size, I'm not going to be that well at making my own ground herd. So I thought it would be best to just go along with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down within the gym, dressed in my shorts on the bench along with the other female students. I felt...do you believe it small. With all the girls looking at me, with them all beside me I just ask myself, why me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust because I'm below three foot, means that I'm not allowed to be the other guys at PE? I don't really know anymore. I might as well get used to it as I can see that I might not be able to grow back to my normal size any time soon and allow all these women to control everything that goes on in my shrunken life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the entrance to gym opened up with a tall blond hair woman dressed in gym clothes with a whistle hanging below her neck. She walked towards us all that was sitting on the bench, she looked at all of them, skipping past me for only a moment before looking back at me with wide eye and an open mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I be, fancy seeing you here Small\u201d said the woman. This woman's name is Melinda Manley, the female sports' teacher. From the way she said it gave a hint that she knew full well that I would be here. \u201cNow then ladies, I gather you all heard what has happened to Small here? I was told to play nice with him, so I thought it would the perfect time to do wrestling\u201d said Melinda as she walked up and down alongside the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut miss, surly you know that if he were to wrestle him he wouldn't stand a foot of a chance\u201d spoke one of the female students. \u201cHmm, good point...Penny you will be his partner\u201d said Melinda as she looked at the student she just said her name to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that name made everyone in the gym to laugh out loud. Now then, I guess you all are wondering as to why they were laughing. The truth is that girl that was spoke of, was Penny Lewis the shortest girl of the whole school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone made fun of her, even me back when I was normal height. Well every now and then, the she tend to hang out with me and Ronnie. Well back to the story, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the teacher blew her whistle, we all stood up walked over the the mats that were already laid out for us to use. Me and Penny walked towards one of the many mats, I stood there looking up at her, I never really knew how pretty she was well, seeing as how I'm the smallest boy of the school I tend to notice new things about people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up and saw that I was pretty much a foot shorter then her. \u201cYou all right?\u201d asked Penny as she grabbed hold of me by the shoulders. \u201cYeah\u201d I said back. To my surprise, she was able to flip me over and then pinned me down making it very hard for me to break free from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh I almost for to mention that Penny is very good at wrestling...which was very bad for me as for every round I cannot even pin her down due to my size. Everyone pretty much stopped what they were doing and watched on at me getting my ass handed to me by the smallest girl of the whole school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the lesson was over, and were told to go and changed clothes, Penny placed her hand on my shoulder and said, \u201cHay, I'm really sorry for hurting you\u201d I looked up at her worried face and said, \u201cIts okay, I guess we're even then?\u201d \u201cIn a way\u201d she said giving off a hint that she got plans for me in the near future. </span></div></div>",

I felt a bit red headed as I didn't want to be any part of this play but something in the back of my mind telling me to be part of the play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two going to join then?\" asked Janette as she looked up from the script of Romeo and Juliet. \"Well I am, not sure about Paul though\" answered Ronnie. I looked up at her and then I answered, \"Yeah I am\" \"Well then this might be an interesting play indeed\" said Janette as she wrote down our names onto a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy the role of Romeo little Romeo then Paul\" laughed Naomi as she smiled at me. I felt a little bit embassied as I looked at the faces of all the girls in the room that's going to be part of the play. For those that want to know who they all are, well you all ready know Becky and Naomi are in the class the others are, Amy, Shannon, Kellie, Allison, Penny and a strange one Cally Watchem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Cally Watchem is what you may a goth...she never really call herself one but she tends to dress up in black clothes, have black dye in her hair and even wear very tall high heel boots. I speak to her every now and then but I wouldn't even think of hanging out with her. She tend to be seen with two other friends that dressed in the same manner.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all stayed in the room waiting for anymore students to show up but no one else came. \"Well, seeing as how there isn't going to be anymore coming in, here you all are\" said Janette as she handed us all scripts with the name of the character we all be playing. I got my script and saw the name of the character Romeo. \"I'm Juliet\" said Cally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at her as I saw her looking down at me with a smile. Thinking about it, a thought came to mind, Romeo kiss Juliet...me as Romeo and Cally as Juliet.</span></div></div>",

I noticed that Becky was walking behind eying me. \"Well then Pipsqueak, best get those little lips of yours\" said Becky as she leaned over to look at me as we were still walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just felt my face getting red, Becky saw this as she just laughed at me as she stood up straight. \"Hay now\" said Naomi as she slapped the back of Becky's head. \"Hay!\" said Becky as she nurse her sore head. \"Do you really need to be like that around Paul?\" asked Penny as she walked beside Naomi. \"I don't have to answer that\" said Becky as she walked with her arms crossed behind her head. I looked at Penny and saw her smiling at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky saw this and said, \" You know...you two would make the perfect couple\" she said this as she grabbed hold of me and Penny and made us walk next together. I saw that Penny was getting a little red. \"Think of this way, you finally meet a man that looks up to YOU\" said Becky as she rubbed our hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I didn't know better, I would say that you're trying to get Paul away from Ronnie\" said Amy as she walked inbertween us. \"Oh shut up nerd\" said Becky. With that, me and the others apart from Becky laughed as we made it to the bus stop. The bus that I need to go on arrived, again, I noticed that I couldn't step onto the bus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, I felt myself rising up in the air and then landed inside, I looked back and saw that it was Amy. \"Thanks\" I said as I payed for my ride. With that, me and Ronnie took a seat and just talked like best friends do all the way to the bus stop that's near to my house. Once we got off, I said my goodbye to Ronnie as I walked towards my house. I stood there at the front door, took a deep breath and rang the door bell as I was too short to open it with a key.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door opened I looked up and saw another member of the Small family that dosen't live in the house looked down at me with a shock look on her face. \"Hi... </span></div></div>",

The two of them looked at me for a moment and just didn't really thought that it was me as they had the look that I was another child. Alex with her black hair in a pony tail walked up to me and said \"Hi, I'm Alex what's your name\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just sat there looking at her, I could hear the two aunts trying not to laugh. \u201cSweetheart, this is Paul\u201d said Mary as she put her hand on my shoulder.

With her saying that, I just knew she was somehow going to rub my height lost as the last time I saw her...I pretty much made fun on how small she was to me. She of course didn't like it and she did say that one day she will be bigger than me. Boy if I had known back than...I wouldn't have made fun of her as it would have saved me trouble with her in future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at her and saw that I was just tall enough to be only under her neck. I just hung my head in sham as I now know that I'm the shortest member of the Small Family. \"Paul why don't you play with the girls\" said Sara as she spoke to me as if I was younger then these two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at her with a 'what are you talking about' look. \"Hay don't worry, we brought our Nintendo WII\" said Veronica as she headed back upstairs. \"Go on, the grown ups are talking\" said Mary as Alex was dragging me. As Alex dragged me upstairs, she brought me into my room. I saw that they connected the Nintendo WII to my TV.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the Little Man, what should we play?\" asked Veronica as she knelt down and took two games and hung then above my face.  </span></div></div>",

The three of us held a Wii remote, well to me, I found holding it hard due to the size the remote was to my little hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could hear both Veronica and Alex giggling above me as they saw how big the remote was for me. Well due to my shrunken size I couldn't really play the games really well and...to make this short...I lost at each one.

Not that I mind and all with my shrunken height I got more to fidget around with. I slept like a log till it was morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did I know it was morning well...I had a very rude awaking as both Veronica and Alex jumped on me. They just kept on jumping on me till Aunt Mary and Sara told them to stop it which they did after a few jumps. \"Come on then Paul, best get ready for school\" said Sara as she smiled at me as I looked at her.

As for Wednesday...lets just say that it was strange. It was really strange as we all didn't really act out the play the way it was written to be as. Instead Janette rewrote the Romeo and Juliet a little and what I mean by little? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell she changed the title to be...wait for it, wait for it...you got yet? No? Okay then, she changed it to be Pipsqueak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease don't tell me that you didn't see that coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway the other changes she made was that the role of Romeo was that he gotten shrunken down in size, lets just say my height and that he tries to win the heart of a normal size women. He tries in vain until he set his eyes on Juliet and that when the story stays the same. Not really looking forward to this one and well, to keep the whole play a secret I shall not write anymore of it till the first showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Noami was true to her word about inviting me and the others to her beach party on Saturday. Sara bought me some swimming trunks of my size for the party. At first I didn't really want to go as I don't want to be laugh at my school friends but Ronnie talked me into and well lets just say that within an hour the party begins.    </span></div></div>",

Well, I was dropped along with Ronnie, Ritz and Riza by Sara as she was driving to work. After the party she told us that we should take the bus home. Anyway back to the party, when I stood out of the car with all my belongings, Ronnie stood next to me while the cousins were behind me looked out at the beach and saw what everyone was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis looks like its going to be fun\u201d said Riza as she rubbed my head as she walked off first towards Naomi. I looked ahead and saw that Naomi was wearing a black two piece bikini. She saw Riza moving towards her and waved back. \u201cGlad that you could make it, are the others with you?\u201d asked Naomi as Riza came close enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Riza pointed back towards me and the others. With that Ronnie and Ritz began to walk towards her, Ronnie looked back and asked me, \u201cWhat's the matter? Cold feet again?\u201d I looked up a bit nervous and answered, \u201cNo, no...I'm coming, I'm coming\u201d I mean think about it...I'm going to be shrouded by women wearing nothing by bikinis plus it doesn't really help with being shrunken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad that you came make it\u201d said Naomi as she looked at Ronnie and Ritz. I slowly looked up at Naomi with a clear view of her naval. Naomi looked down at me with her hands on her hips with a smile on her face and said, \u201cI'm really glad that you showed up\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at her with a puzzled looked. \u201cCome now, get in your swimwear and have some fun\u201d said Naomi as she walked off to greet some new arrivals. With that I saw Ritz and Riza going off on their own, which left me and Ronnie alone. After a while, the two of us walked along the beach, finding a good place to lay our towels which we found. \u201cCome on Paul, get your kit off\u201d said Ronnie as she began to take clothes off. Beneath her clothes, Ronnie was wearing a yellow two piece bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just didn't really know where to look, with me being small I found it hard to look up to Ronnie. \u201cHay why haven't you taken your kit off?\u201d asked Ronnie as she placed her right hand on her hip and let her other dangle. \u201cWhat oh...I'm going to\u201d I answered as I slowly took my shirt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment I took my shirt off, I suddenly felt the shorts that I was wearing being pulled down. \u201cOh my god!\u201d shouted a very familiar voice. I froze as I slowly looked at whom pulled my shorts down, showing to everyone swimming trunks that's meant to be kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up and saw the face which belongs to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
