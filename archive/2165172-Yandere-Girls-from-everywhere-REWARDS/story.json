            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Y/N. You were born into a family of Nekoshou, a rarer kind of Nekomata. You had two sisters. Their names were Kuroka and Shirone. Both of your sisters had golden eyes, but Kuroka had black hair while Shirone had white. <br>\r\nShirone was always quiet while Kuroka was loud. In a sense, they were each others opposites and you were the bridge to connect them. They were always affectionate with you in childhood, with Kuroka always setting you in her lap while petting your ears, and Shirone sat in your lap forcing you to pet her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were always a little intimidated by Shirone. She was such a forceful person when it came to you, and she always tried to make sure you only looked at her. All your childhood friends were scared away from you because Shirone threatened them, and she threatened you into never leaving her. Even after you were all taken in by a devil and Kuroka was turned into a reincarnated devil, she still kept you to herself, using her natural strength that opposed her small frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirone stayed by yourside every minute of ever day, even while you were showering or sleeping, she stayed with you. Shirone also hissed at any girls other then Kuroka that came close to you, scaring away many potential friends you could've had. You we're lonely, even if Shirone and Kuroka stayed by your side. Your life got repetitive quickly because when Shirone learned about some people being gay or Bi Sexual. She kept all genders away from you, except for, of course Kuroka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Kuroka was said to have went mad with power and murdered her master, though you doubted that greatly. Kuroka always had the utmost skill in keeping her power in check, and you watched her train with it. None of the general devil population knew this of course, and called for you and your twin sisters heads, believing that more of devils would die if the two of you were allowed to live. This wasn't true of course, but the devil population was frightened by Kuroka's powers and pushed that hatred onto the easiest targets, you and Shirone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were brought to a jail cell, though the guards let you stay together due to the glare Shirone gave them. You were even set to be executed together as some show of \"niceness\". You, of course knew that it was just to make sure one sibling didn't lose control because the first sibling died. As your heads were being laid against the guillotine you heard a mans voice yell out to stop, and immediately the executioners ran away from the guillotine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release the girl, my sister wishes to add her to her peerage\" The red haired man who had spoken this was easily recognizable by appearance. He was the Lucifer Satan, the strongest devil alive and hero of the great war. His words left a hidden undertone to them that the executioners noticed. 'the boy can die though'. Shirone called out to you, screaming your name and starting to let out wisps of magic. Sirzechs Lucifer knew that letting you die would cause Shirone to never listen to Rias, so he ordered the executioners to let you go too, if only to keep Shirone calm. You were both brought to the Gremory Estate in nothing but the prison uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirzechs led you and Shirone towards the the main lobby, where Shirone was told that she was going to meet her new master. Shirone stated that she was fine having a master, but only under the condition that you belonged to only her, and not her new master. Sirzechs, not really caring much about you allowed her request, and Shirone let out what could possibly be the biggest smile you had ever seen her use. After she signs the legal documents, you would belong to her and her alone, and you couldn't escape or the devils would hunt you down to finish what they started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were terrified of the future with Shirone as a devil. Before when she was just your twin sister, she kept everyone away and stuck to you like glue, but now that she owned you, she could keep you locked away or handcuffed to follow her around, and you couldn't say or do anything to counteract her orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered the main lobby and there was a small girl with red hair sitting there with a black haired girl. You assumed that the redhead was Lucifer's sister and your sisters new master, but you didn't know who the black haired girl was, but she was pretty. The redhead jumped to her feet when she saw your sister enter, already excited to induct the newest member of her peerage. Since she was a devil born of a pure-blood family, she already had her set of chess pieces, and only the queen piece was missing, presumably used on another person already. The red head introduced herself as Rias Gremory, and the black haired girl revealed herself as Sona Sitri, presumably the sister of the current Leviathan. Rias asked who you were when suddenly Shirone cut in, saying that that information is irrelevant. Rias looked to her brother quizzically, and he told her about the \"special\" arrangements between you and Shirone in exchange for her being a devil. Sona also seemed interested in you, but was quickly glared at by Shirone when said interest was noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias got Shirone's attention and said something shocking. \"Your new name is Koneko Toujou, as a symbol that you left your sister behind for a new life with me.\" Shockingly to you, Shirone, or Koneko now, nodded, already having all she needs in the form of owning you legally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias asked what attribute Koneko would like to have added, and she immediately responded with strength, which meant bad news for you if she got it. She kept you with her enough with her current strength, If she got any kind of boost she would completely overpower you in anything, in worst case scenario she could molest you and you couldn't do anything to oppose it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias pulled out what appeared to be a rook piece and told the newly named Koneko to lie down on the floor. Koneko dropped to the floor on her back, and Rias stood over her, placing the rook piece in between her breasts before standing up again and chanting some kind of speech to presumably revive Koneko as a servant. After the speech is done the Rook piece melts into Koneko's skin, presumably showing that it was done correctly. Koneko, after standing up stomped on the floor to test her power, and the floor broke and created a tiny crater. Koneko then grinned savagely at you, already thinking of the things she could do to you with that much strength. You, on the other hand pale in fear and start sweating profusely, looking over to the Lucifer next to you with pleading eyes. He simply shrugs his shoulders and pats you on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>Timeskip to nighttime</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko had filled out the paper work later that day that would legally make you her possession, someone that she can do whatever she wants to with no legal repercussions. Koneko dragged you all the way to her room, soon to be both your rooms, as she slammed the door open which was thankfully reinforced with steel, or you fear she would've tore it right off. Koneko pushes you onto the bed and says \"Stay\" with a withering glare, which causes you to freeze in fear on the bed. Koneko strips to the nude and orders you to as well. You hesitated, so Koneko slammed her foot on the ground, making a super loud thud that no one else heard because of soundproofing done to the room as well. You, being in the room heard how loud it was and understood the treat, 'Do what I say or feel pain!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Follow instructions in hopes that she won't touch you too much tonight<br>\r\nB: Try to compromise with her to keep your clothes, which will probably just piss her off<br>\r\nC: Try to compromise with her to do nothing but sleep tonight, which will probably piss her off twice as much as before, maybe leading to reverse rape.</span></div></div>",

You start taking off your shirt, but start to get uncomfortable at how strongly Koneko is staring at you, drool already starting to form at the corner of her mouth. You look away from Koneko, before fully removing your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back to Koneko and you see her tail pop out and start waving while the drool on her mouth starts growing, an obvious sign that she's excited and wants you to continue. You take off your shoes and socks, which seems to annoy Koneko because of how slow you were, which she showed by tightening her hands and squinting her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to take off your pants, and you suddenly hear Koneko panting, and you start to blush, despite the circumstances. Koneko noticed you stop, so she stomped on the floor again, once again making a large bang and snapping you out of your daze. You hurriedly remove your pants to possibly pacify Koneko, which leaves you in only your underwear. Koneko, in addition to everything above, starts to go on the bed and crawl towards you with the drool practically about to touch the bed and her tail swinging at lightspeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly take off your underwear because of how embarrassed you are, before Koneko suddenly leaps towards you, tearing the underwear off and leaving you stark naked just like her. Since the bed is rather small, there isn't much space, and you have to squeeze together to fit two people, which works well for Koneko, but not so much for your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko suddenly pins both your hands above you with her newfound strength and locks lips with you, you being unable to resist her newly gained strength. Her arms weren't the only thing to gain strength it seemed, as her tongue easily broke through the barrier that was your lips and proceeded to explore every inch of your mouth, with Koneko's other hand feeling all over your body, from your small chest to even your ass. Koneko even touched your dick a couple of times which again, despite the circumstances, felt incredibly good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko suddenly ends the lip lock and starts to breath heavily, and you do as well. When you looked at Koneko, it seemed as if she was satisfied with just that for today, her eyes lidded over and her breathing slowed. Koneko suddenly let go of you and rolled to the side, prompting you to turn away from her as fast as possible to prevent her from grabbing your dick in the night, however useless turning around would be. You suddenly felt her hands circle around your back and arms, pinning your arms to your side and leaving you frozen in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grip suddenly increases, causing you to feel slight discomfort, though no pain due to your naturally resistant nature as a Yokai. Koneko's breathing slows, signifying that she's asleep, causing you to let out a breath of relief that your virginity wasn't stolen that night, though you suppose it should happen fairly soon considering how close you had been to losing it tonight. You feel yourself start to drift off, the exhaustion of the trial created by Koneko catching up to you and overriding the slight discomfort caused by her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Sona Sitri entered the room, looking for you to possibly convert you to overwrite the property laws that Koneko signed earlier, and she also fell in love at first sight, being enamored by your adorableness though not able to convey it due to her stoic nature (Possibly introduce Serafall here too).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Akeno snuck in, not having heard of the \"Owner and Object\" relationship between you and Koneko, wishing you have you for herself (Possible fighting or maybe even a truce to keep all outsiders out).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Nothing happened, and the next morning came, an alarm waking both of you up at the same time.</span></div></div>",

Even in her sleep, Koneko constantly rubbed her face against your back, purring the entire time. Since you were still awake you heard the door to the room open and a young girl with black hair, purple eyes and red rimmed glasses tiptoe in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized her as Sona Sitri, the younger sister of the Maou Leviathan from the conversations before. She seemed to be looking for something, before laying her eyes upon you and frowning, for what reason, you don't know. Koneko had long since retired her Neko ears which means her hearing was reduced significantly compared to before. Sona walked towards you, quietly before whispering to you \"I can get you out of being her possession. Just find me while you're alone and I'll tell you how\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing these words filled you with joy! Escaping Koneko for good is blessing enough, but the pretty girl from before is the one saving you from her. If you couldn't fall asleep before, you definitely couldn't fall asleep now due to the jitters from hearing Sona's words. You stayed awake until the sun rose, still as energized as before, her words still echoing in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Koneko's arms untangle themselves from you before you heard a yawn coming from behind you. You turned around to see Koneko stretching like a cat would, pushing her back in the air and all. Koneko looked around and then at you, remembering the events of yesterday and what she was aloud to do to you now. She gave off another large smile, hugging you again before letting go and jumping off the bed, walking over to her closet and pulling out clothes that were left for her. You, however, were forced to reuse the same clothes as yesterday because the Gremory's hadn't expected to have to supply for a boy as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on the plain clothes you were given from the jail before your execution and waited for Koneko, knowing that if you left before her she would get angry at you. Koneko finished putting on her clothes, which was a casual shirt with a casual skirt. All around casual. Koneko grabbed your hand and pulled you out forcefully, making you faceplant on the floor. Koneko continues to drag you across the floor, not caring about you falling and not exerting much strength either due to her recent strength gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually manage to stand up again and thankfully, the floor outside your room is all smooth, nothing that would hurt being dragged across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, do you have an opportunity to find Sona and do you find her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Koneko left you alone to do something with Rias and you successfully find Sona.<br>\r\nB: Koneko left you alone to do something with Rias, but you don't find Sona and maybe got caught.<br>\r\nC: Koneko never left you alone for the entire day, leaving you unable to reach Sona</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While you were being dragged around by Koneko she suddenly got a call on a phone, which you presume she got from Rias or the Lucifer at one point yesterday. Koneko pulls out her phone and answers it, before giving a monotone \"Yes?\" into it. You can hear the faint mumbles coming from the phone but not the actual words coming from it, which is strange because your ears should be able to hear perfectly at that distance. You see Koneko adopt an annoyed face before again, in a monotone voice saying \"Fine.\". Koneko hangs up before looking at you with a serious face and saying \"Go back to the room. If you aren't there when I get back you will be punished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face Koneko gave you at that time scared you, so you obviously said that you would be back before she did. You decided that now was the time to look for Sona, as per her instructions. Thankfully, you saw her earlier as Koneko was dragging you, thank the maou. You go into the garden where you saw Sona sitting at the table, and arrive quickly due to your photographic memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Sona still sitting at the table you saw her at before, even though it's been about half an hour since you've been there. You walk up to Sona and see that she's sleeping, which seems unusual for a heiress to do in public, but whatever, she promised that she would save you. Once you get close enough, you start telling Sona quietly to wake up, as shouting could possibly alert your sister. When she doesn't respond, you move to poking her in the shoulder, causing her to become startled and look around, not unlike a sleeping beast that was awoken. Sona continues looking around frantically before laying eyes on you, before calming down \"So, you were able to get away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah.. Someone called my sister and she had to leave somewhere\" You reply, the excitedness of being away from your sister already making you super excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I tricked Rias into thinking that she and Koneko should do <i>bonding exercises.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle, thinking about Koneko's face as she's doing said \"bonding exercises\", since Koneko had never been one for social contact. You suddenly hear Sona speak up. \"So, there's only one way I can free you from your sister's control, which is _______\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: \"- to be my slave rather then Koneko's. I'm a more important devil in the general societies eyes so they would rather I stay then she stays\" (Less Freedom, and Sona's Peerage can also take advantage of you)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB\"-  to join my peerage, since a person can't be under more than one person and I'm more important to devil society. You also become stronger to defend yourself from your sister\" (More Freedom, and stronger)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC \"- to become my sisters slave. If I ask her to accept you she would, and devil society would have no choice but to accept her decision (Very well protected, but Serafall is much more \"Forward\" then Sona, which would probably still lead to molestation. Less then Koneko, but still molested)</span></div></div>",

Sona pulls out a phone and calls who you assume to be Serafall Leviathan. You hear a loud voice come out of it, much louder then Koneko's phone, which allows you to listen in to the conversation. The first words you heard from the phone were \"SO-TAN!! YOU'RE CALLING ME I'M SO HAPPY!!\". The loudness of the voice suddenly causes your cat ears to fold to block out the noise, though not helping much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the loud voice a bit longer, before Sona manages to calm the owner of the voice down. \"Nee-sama, the little neko from before needs to become your slave to escape being owned by his sister, will you acc-\" Before Sona could even finish the sentence you hear the voice start screeching again. \"YES SO-TAN I CAN HAVE THE TWO BESTEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BESIDE ME!

You feel as if you should recognize this woman, but you don't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the woman starts shouting, her voice the same as Serafall Leviathan from the phone call, which means this woman is the Leviathan. \"SO-TAN AND Y/N-TAN! HUG TIME!\" Suddenly, you feel unbelievably strong arms circle around you and pushing you towards Sona, the grip even stronger then Koneko's post-devil. You can see why people respect her as the strongest female devil in existence, considering how physically strong she is even though she's primarily an ice user.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden you feel yourself separated from Sona and instead ensnared by both of the strong arms. You feel yourself being lifted in the air and spun around by someone, presumably Serafall Leviathan. You start to regret your decision to promise yourself to her, but it's too late now.

We're gonna be together forever, and no one is ever going to take you away from me, or I'll make them disappear.\" As she said the last bit her voice got creepier and, considering you were much shorter than her, scared you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself get lifted again like before, but not swung around this time.

You were taken through endless corridors, until you finally reached a large set of double doors, curved at the top. Serafall kicked it open and you felt as if you went blind, the pink of the room literally everywhere, poster of <i>Sera-tan</i> posted all over the walls, and a large pink bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerafall gave you no time to get used to the room though as she dropped you on the bed and stripped. You blushed at this because Serafall was quite possibly the most well-endowed woman you had seen thus far, devil or not. Serafall noticed your blush before squealing and jumping towards you, instantly giving you a death grip not unlike Koneko, although this felt more carefree, as if she knew that even if you were taken away, she could take you right back, and she wasn't wrong in thinking this, considering her power put her above all other female devils sans Grayfia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerafall snapped, causing the lights to go off before snuggling into you, hugging you like a teddy bear. You hear snoring behind you before thanking the Satans that Serafall didn't molest you in bed night one like Koneko, but then you realized the irony of your statement considering she herself is a Satan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you were about to fall into dreamland, you felt an immense power suddenly appear next to you, your Nekoshou senses further magnifying the intense power that appeared. It felt greater than anything you had ever felt before, even greater than the Lucifer Satan himself. When you looked towards the intense power, you saw what appeared to be a young girl in gothic lolita clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even comprehend it, you heard snakes approaching your bed. Not long after, you felt Serafall jolt awake from the power emitted by the Gothic Loli in front of you. Serafall let out a shiver, before looking over to the source of the power, immediately recognizing the Primordial Being in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why have you come here Ouroboros Dragon?\" Serafall let out, obviously shaken by the being in front of her. The name \"Ouroboros Dragon\" sounded familiar, before you finally linked it to the Primordial Dragon of Infinity, one of the most powerful beasts in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... have come... for him...\" the Ouroboros Dragon replied, talking with unusual pauses in between her words. (Going to use Ouroboros Dragon to refer to Ophis until her name is revealed)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want Y/N Ouroboros Dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that... is his... name? I wish to... take him with me to... the dimensional gap.\" The Ouroboros Dragon replied, the pauses still as prominent as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Serafall's arms squeeze around you before Serafall shouted out \"Are you insane? He'll die in the dimensional gap\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will... give him... my snake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said this, you felt a snake curl around your leg, before pulling you away from Serafall. Serafall was so distracted by Ophis that she didn't realize you were being pulled away until you left her grip, causing her to attempt to freeze the snake on instinct. The snake immediately broke through the ice and continued to drag you towards the Ouroboros Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.... go to... sleep,\" the Ouroboros Dragon said, before sending a blast of magical energy at Serafall, causing her to immediately slump over, although still visibly breathing. You look towards the Ouroboros Dragon, before opening your mouth and attempting to scream. However, Ophis immediately gagged you with the snake that was pulling you away and muffled your screams for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself being surrounded by intense power, before being lifted by some kind of psychic force towards the Ouroboros Dragon. \"My... name is... Ophis. You will... stay with me... forever,\" the newly named Ophis said, in the same Monotone voice as before. The snake that was gagging you suddenly entered your mouth and slithered down your throat, causing your gag reflex to go crazy. As the snake was entering your stomach, you felt it being absorbed into you, causing you to gain incredible power, yet also feel a strange connection to Ophis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... was my snake. It will keep.... you safe from... all harm and... tell me... where you are.\" Ophis said. Up until that point you were shivering in fright at being so close to such immense power, but when the snake was absorbed into you, you felt less scared of Ophis's power. The psychic power from before pulled you towards Ophis before you felt yourself be forcibly kissed by Ophis, her tongue unnaturally long and intruding all over your mouth, giving you no chance to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Happens Next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: The rest of Devil kind rush the room, causing Ophis to fight them all, you getting taken YET AGAIN by someone who wanted to take advantage of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Ophis quietly opens a tear, bringing you to her private room in the Dimensional Gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Something Else? I dunno.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had barely heard it while you were awake so you doubt Koneko would react much to it since she was sleeping. You looked up and saw a blacked haired girl with purple eyes and voluptuous breasts despite her not looking that much older than you. She had long black hair in a ponytail that reached all the way down to her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the black hair girl mumbling to herself, looking around the room. Despite the fact that you heard her mumbling, you couldn't understand exactly what she had been mumbling to herself. She looked around the room and her eyes locked onto both you and your sister. You saw the girl put her hand up to her mouth and give a little smile as if amused by what she saw. She walked towards the bed as stealthfully as she could and bent down, looking you in the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantaneously she grew a blush upon looking at your face, making you afraid of what exactly was going to happen. You saw her raise her hand to your face but considering Koneko's grip on you, you couldn't really move much to avoid it and even if you did, waking up Koneko while another girl in the room was just asking for Koneko to go on a rampage. You felt the dainty hands stroke the side of your face and you involuntarily let out a purr, your natural instincts reacting to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you felt Koneko stirring behind you, probably awoken by the shaking caused by the purr you let out. What happened next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Koneko falls back asleep, letting Akeno leave without being found out.<br>\r\nB: Koneko wakes up and immediately goes ballistic. <br>\r\nC: Koneko wakes up and surprisingly knows who Akeno is, and agrees to keep you within the peerage.

I, however have a proposition for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is?\" Koneko replied, seemingly pacified by the black haired girls words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keeping him inside the peerage of course! With our powers combined we could not only beat most devils but also prevent him from escaping. So, how about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Koneko grumbling, as if annoyed by the truth of what the other girl had been saying. You, however, grew terrified at the idea of not only one girl, but multiple girls being crazy for you. Of course, talking out now would only lead to punishment so you were forced to stay quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" You heard Koneko mutter out. \"If It'll protect him from all the hussies that try to take him, I'll settle on sharing with the group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was those words that sealed your fate as what could only be described as a toy for a group of devils that all overpowered you.

Nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise,\" Koneko muttered back. This wasn't the worst group of devils you could've been enslaved to but it certainly wasn't the best. At this point you considered the fact that you were still not handcuffed to a bed a blessing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we know each other, it's time for some bonding!\" Akeno exclaimed, before jumping into the bed on your other side. Considering the bed was only made for 2 people Akeno and Koneko were forced to hug you as close as possible. Of course, that worked great for them but not so much for you. You were completely stuck, awaiting the following morning where the news would be broken to the rest of the peerage. All you could do now is sleep...</span></div></div>",

There were no girls to either side of you or in the room. Of course, the doors and windows seemed to be locked, an understandable thing considering you were seen as a slave, someone who held no loyalty and would try to escape at a moment's notice. The room looked the same, minus a few things out of place, not something unordinary for someone's room. You looked down at the bed and noticed a piece of paper.

What's your favorite kind of place? Desert? Beach? Mountainous?\" Daisy asked, getting your attention. She leaned in close with a flirty expression as she asked, \"Or perhaps you'd like to work as my personal handservant? I can guarantee that you'd be perfect for the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of helping Daisy dress up or undress ran through your mind, making your blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your offer is as generous as you are beautiful, Princess Daisy,\" You said, making Daisy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Daisy. If you get to call Peach by her name, then you get to call me by my name,\" Daisy said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Peach was the one frowning, though she hid it quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the conversation shifted to one about upcoming sports events.The princesses liked the fact you were a fan of theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they left you, the two kissed you on your cheeks at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a bush nearby, a certain female Koopaling was glaring at the two princesses.

After a moment of thought, you realized that would probably be the case... until you saw how Crazy-in-love Wendy was towards you.<i> 'There might be a chance the princesses might not be able to save me before Wendy decides to 'marry' me.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy tossed you in her clown car before sliding in next to you, making sure you felt her large bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find go to my personal castle in Chocolate Island!

She looked towards her troops and yelled, \"Let them go and let's get back to my castle, you losers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your relief, Wendy's troops did free your parents before the Koopa trops began hopping in pipes.

Your hands were pulled behind your backs and you had handcuffs put on you. You can't see your parents anywhere, so you assume they've either been caught already or escaped before they came, you hope the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're roughly pulled off the floor and pushed into the police car, none of the officers even talking to you. You were taken down to the police station, set to have a long time in jail for smuggling, however unaware it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day Princess Peach was informed by her police chief that they caught one of the smugglers, that it was a young man with H/C hair. Princess Peach gasps before hurriedly telling the chief to bring you to her. The police, obviously thinking that Peach wanted to punish you herself, left you handcuffed and with blindfolds on because he believed that \"Trash should not look upon the princess\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lying in your cell before burley police officers started pulling you off the ground and putting your handcuffs back on, before tying a fabric around your eyes, presumably to make you sightless. You get pushed into the familiar feel of a police car before being driven who knows where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour of driving, you feel the car stop, and the telltale jingle of the castle blasting through speakers, leading you to believe you were at the castle at Peach's request, though why she kept you tied up, you do not know. You continue to be pulled, ignoring the gasps of the various toads around the castle, before the officer pulling you suddenly stops, before knocking hard on a door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Peach. I brought the prisoner, just as you requested!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring him in please\" You hear Peach's melodic voice answer back to the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly shoved and brought to your knee's, presumably in the same room as Peach, before you hear a gasp coming from Princess Peach. \"Why is he blindfolded and beaten? Why is he still handcuffed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh, he could be a danger to you, and trash does not deserve to lo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIVE ME THE KEYS TO HIS HANDCUFFS AND GET OUT OF HERE NOW\" Princess Peach suddenly yells, scaring you and probably the police man as well. You hear the jangle of keys and then you hear someone suddenly slam the door shut, presumably the police man leaving. You feel the blindfold around your eyes unwrap and become blinded by the sudden light of the room you're in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, you see the Princess in her night clothes, which makes sense because it's night time. The thing you didn't expect to see, however wasan expression of lust on Princess Peach's face. Unknown to you, when Peach saw you all beaten and handcuffed, she started to get turned on because of you being handcuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Princess Peach tells you that she must administer some sort of \"punishment\", which is probably just self satisfaction for her.<br>\r\nB: Bowser suddenly breaks in on the request of Wendy, before kidnapping both you and princess Peach, you as a gift for his adopted daughter.<br>\r\nC::Daisy walks in an misunderstands the scene, believing that the Princess put those marks on you. </span></div></div>",

Only if Wendy doesn't find out,\" Pom Pom 2 replied, licking her lips as she looked at you. \"He is pretty cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the two Pom Poms, You saw them looking rather hungry at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you-\" You uttered before the Pom Poms began to fondle your body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a naughty human! Tempting us with your hot body!\" Pom Pom 1 said with a crazed look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Stop!\" You cried out. Alas, they were too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only Wendy hadn't taken an interest in you. Wouldn't you like a threesome with some sexy Pom Poms? We're willing to share you with each other...\" Pom Pom 2 asked as she and her friend then held you in place, nearly smushing you with their bodies being so close. \"The stupid Peach and Daisy? Not so much... If they tried anything, I'd smash them into teeny-tiny bits..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no I'm not interested...\" you said, worrying about Wendy's temper if... No, when she finds out about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We bet a kiss or ten will fix that attitude!\" The Pom Poms cooed before puckering their lip and slowly coming towards your head.</span></div></div>",

You must go on tons of adventures and stuff, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You chuckled. \u201cWell, yeah, I kinda do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOh, please tell us all about them!\u201d Peach said, ecstatic. \u201cI want to know every detail~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cSo do I~\u201d Both these princesses leaned closer to you, ready to be enraptured on what they expected to be epic tales of battle, fortune and triumph. It was surprising to see these two very important women so enthralled by you. It was fun, and you didn\u2019t mind, but just\u2026 surprising. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you may have even thought they were in love with you!..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...which, of course, they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As you told them only slightly exaggerated stories of your various victories, smiting many an evil-doer (including the likes of Bowser, Wart, Fawful and Dimentio, to name just a few), finding a large quantity of riches and rescuing a number of poor, defenseless peasants and princesses, their minds only thought more of their undying love and devotion to you. They never wanted anything to hurt you\u2026 and if something did, they\u2019d regret it. Or if anyone else tried to take you for themselves. While they didn\u2019t like sharing, they practically had no choice, but if anyone else dared try and win you over (without at least consulting them), there\u2019d be consequences\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As of right then, though, you knew none of that. All you knew that perhaps you were an even greater hero than you thought, if you caught the attention of these two fair princesses!<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    \u201c...and those are all the ones off the top of my head,\u201d you finished, taking a deep breath. That\u2019s a lot of stories to tell\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWow, you\u2019re even cooler than I thought!\u201d Daisy remarked, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cYou\u2019ve done so much for everyone\u2026 especially us\u2026\u201d Peach said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cReally?\u201d you responded. \u201cHow have I done much for either of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWell, I can see her point,\u201d Daisy answered. \u201cOut of all the kingdoms you\u2019ve been in, you\u2019ve been in ours more than most, so you\u2019ve saved many of our people\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cNot to mention how many times you\u2019ve saved our kingdoms from grave danger, some of which we didn\u2019t even know about!\u201d Peach added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cYeah! Like that secret society bent on replacing us with different princesses! Neither of us knew about it, but you followed the clues and locked \u2018em up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cAnd that time you figured out that Tatanga and Princess Shroob were trying to fly down here and kidnap us just by noticing their ship in the night sky! A ship that was only a purple dot! A DARK purple dot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cAND, in the last few baseball tournaments, you even ruined Bowser\u2019s equipment, just because the prize money would go to kidnapping us! I mean, who does all that??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    They were almost like fangirls, enthusiastically repeating to you stories you just told them, simply because they loved them so much. Actually, they weren\u2019t almost like fangirls, they WERE fangirls! Or\u2026 perhaps not, you thought. You figured, if they loved your stories, they probably also love-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cNot only that,\u201d Peach continued, \u201cbut you\u2019ve saved the world so many times! Like that time you destroyed an asteroid coming straight for us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cAnd when you-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cYes, yes, I know, you two, I did TELL you both,\u201d you interjected, covering both their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...the mouths of princesses!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You quickly retracted your hands. \u201cUh, sorry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cHey, it\u2019s fine!\u201d Daisy reassured. \u201cWe kinda owe you, anyway, considering all you\u2019ve done, for, well, everyone\u2026 especially us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cYeah!\u201d Peach said, as if she\u2026 got an idea! \u201cWe owe you lot. We REALLY need to repay you.\u201d<br>\r\n    \u201c...Yeah!\u201d Daisy said, as if she was catching on to whatever idea Peach theoretically hatched. \u201cIn fact, you can ask us to do whatever you want, and we\u2019ll do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cUh-huh! So, our knight in shining armor, what do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...Yeah, they\u2019re into you. Quite a bit, too, it seems. Seriously, they\u2019re even leaning towards you in such a way that their arms press their boobs together, which are already shown off, with all the cleavage. You even tried looking directly at them, and they either don\u2019t notice, or don\u2019t mind. Of course, you don\u2019t mind, they\u2019re PRINCESSES, and GORGEOUS, but they seem a bit\u2026 overly loving? Eh. This is a huge opportunity that you need to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    They probably want you to ask them out or something, but you could also just flat-out ask to fuck, or do anything intimate, really. Or you could do something weird like ask them to be your slaves. Hell, they might even be into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Or something else, something really creative...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Or you could reject their offer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    All up to you, it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    (Well, first up, you wanna take up their offer? Don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t.)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yup, this is what they wanted.

And it didn\u2019t SEEM overkill\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cThis was your plan all along, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d you remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201c...Yeah, it was,\u201d Peach giggled, as she started to move to your lap. Daisy did the same. As a warrior, it was relatively easy for you to keep them both on one leg, holding them up with your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cI mean, who could blame us? You\u2019re such a cutie~\u201d Daisy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cAlright, alright\u2026\u201d you said, brushing it off, keeping any concerns of spying to yourself for now. \u201cOh, also, is this order a one-time thing, or-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cNope!\u201d Daisy cut you off. \u201cYou can basically order us to do whatever you want, and we\u2019ll probably do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201c...Probably?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWell, we don\u2019t want you wandering off with any other women,\u201d Peach explained. \u201cYou\u2019re OUR boyfriend, and we won\u2019t allow any cheating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cYeah, if any girl even looks at you funny, she\u2019ll regret it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...Oh. They WERE crazy. Well, at least you can keep them under control\u2026 somewhat. Well, at least you can let all self-control go when you\u2019re alone with them. In fact, you let your hands slide all the way down to their huge, soft asses, and they didn\u2019t seem to mind, seeming even happier than before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, the relationship just started, they\u2019ll probably calm down after awhile, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOkay, then, where should we go?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cMmm, I believe that\u2019s your decision, honey,\u201d Peach replied, apparently already on to nicknames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know many fancy restaurants or whatever,\u201d you explained, \u201cso I think suggestions would be nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOh, there\u2019s this great place in the town east of here, I think it\u2019s called Goomba Gourmet, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cYes, it\u2019s quite lovely,\u201d Peach said. \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive, but we;ll pay for everything, if you want~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You shrugged. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go!\u201d You were about to get up, but Peach signalled for you to stay down while Daisy whistled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A sports car being driven by a toad suddenly drove up, previously hidden from view. \u201cWhere do you three wanna go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cGoomba Gourmet, please,\u201d Peach told her as you three got in the back, you in between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cGotcha,\u201d he responded, as he started driving there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The princesses leaned on your shoulders, seemingly very content with the situation, while you decided to just relax and not think about how crazy they seemed, and to just enjoy having two beautiful girlfriends for the time being. You caressed them wherever you felt like doing so, and they let you, happy as can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cTable for three, please,\u201d Peach ordered, and the staff quickly rushed to get you three a table, any table you wanted. The princesses picked out a booth by a window, and you three were sat down, same arrangement as the car, with you in between the princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    After you ordered your food, from a waitress who got no small amount of glares from your dates (and reminded you of someone, especially that name on her nametag\u2026 Rosa\u2026), you noticed someone waving at you. It was Mayor Pauline, who you\u2019ve rescued a couple of times. You gave her a nod back before Daisy cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cHow the fuck do you know her?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201c...Huh?\u201d You suddenly remembered their crazy tendencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cShe asked how you know Pauline over there,\u201d Peach said, sharing Daisy\u2019s frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWell, I\u2019ve saved her a few times while wandering New Donk City,\u201d you explained. \u201cI told you two, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The princesses shared a look. \u201cI\u2019ll go talk to her,\u201d Peach sighed, getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOh, you don\u2019t have t-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You were cut off by Daisy. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d She turned your head to hers, you now facing away from Pauline. \u201cNow, let me show you what dating a princess is like~\u201d She gently moved your head towards hers and pressed your lips to hers. You reciprocated the kiss as you wrapped your arms around her, unaware of what was happening between Peach and Pauline\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...After a bit, you heard Peach\u2019s voice yet again. \u201cAhem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Daisy separated you two, both of you panting. \u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t resist, since I had such a cute face to myself~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cHmmph. Well, then I\u2019ll just have to do this~\u201d Peach leaned into you and pressed her lips to yours, and you reciprocated this new kiss, forcing Daisy in the somewhat awkward position of being next to all this. You didn\u2019t think much of that, though, as all you could think about were Peach\u2019s soft lips\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201c...Okay, this is as long as we went,\u201d Daisy stated, separating you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Peach sighed. \u201cFine, fine, it was fun while it lasted~\u201d Peach winked at you. As you blushed, you noticed Pauline\u2019s table was now empty. What did Peach-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cFood\u2019s ready!\u201d your waitress said, serving you three your food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As she bent down to serve it, her low-cut uniform allowed her huge jugs to take up quite a bit of space in your vision. This happened when she served drinks and appetizers as well, which seemed to tick off the princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As Daisy reached out for her food, despite the waitress trying to put it right in front of her, she seemingly accidentally knocked Peach\u2019s water over, spilling its contents all over the waitress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She stood still, in shock for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d Daisy said as the waitress quickly put down the food, blushing a deep red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, Princess!\u201d the waitress assured her, nervously laughing. \u201cI\u2019ll just get a new uniform\u2026 and a new water\u2026\u201d She rushed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cActually, I have to go to the bathroom first, before eating,\u201d Peach said, getting up and going as you and Daisy chowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...When Peach returned, smiling, you saw the waitress rush outside of the restaurant, seemingly upset, as she tried to cover her still-wet dress. Before you could comment, a manager rushed over to your table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cVERY sorry about her, princesses, we had no idea she was flirting with customers!\u201d he apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, sir, just don\u2019t let it happen again!\u201d Peach forgave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201c...Yeah!\u201d Daisy said, catching on. \u201cHow about we get a male waiter instead, just to be safe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWhatever you need, princesses,\u201d he complied, as he rushed to get one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...Yeah, they were crazy. No doubt about it. This wasn\u2019t something that would just blow off either, probably, they were full-blown yandere, meaning you were pretty much trapped in the relationship now. Your orders could be somewhat of a control, but they\u2019d probably ignore them if they went against their yandere instincts of keeping you all to themselves. Hell, it was a shock they could share you amongst the two of them! You just had to live with this now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    That poor waitress, too. The spillage was obviously not an accident, and just meant to humiliate her, and possibly send a message. And then, her source of income was taken out from under her. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And what happened to Pauline?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The least you could do is apologize to one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You decided to wait before asking to go to the bathroom, so the timing wasn\u2019t suspicious. It worked, as the princesses seemed none the wiser of your true intentions. As you walked away, you decided the girl you were going to search for was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As long as you can remember you've been mistreated by your father because you weren't talented like your sister was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were honestly terrified of your sister. Everyone in your family listened to her, even your dad because she supplied the income for the family with her paintings. She could scold your dad and get away with it because your dad depended on her for money. She could literally molest you and you couldn't say anything against it because you know that she might get angry, and an angry Kazuki is something you would never want to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just came home after playing with a new friend at the park. She was a shy girl with pink hair named Sachi. As soon as you entered the room you and Kazuki shared she asked why you were so late. You told her that you were playing with a friend, and she asked if it was a girl. You know that lying to Kazuki is always a bad idea, so you tell her the truth, which is yes. Kazuki immediately starts getting agitated which scares you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuki shouted out \"Why are all your friends girls? Do you enjoy seeing me jealous? Is that it!\"<br>\r\n\"N-n-no, of course not Nee-Sama. I would never want to make you angry\" You stammer out, shocked at the loudness of her voice.<br>\r\n\"No, you wouldn't, would you?

You were trained regularly in swordsmanship so you could represent the family, and it started to show in your body. Girls around your age always blushed when you passed by with either a tight shirt or no shirt at all. Being shirtless even caused you to gain a fanclub in your hunter training school. One day the teacher sent the classroom home with news. \"We will be visiting Schnee headquarters in Atlas tomorrow so you can learn more about how dust is made for your futures. Be sure to get your form signed by then to go.\" The teacher then handed out said form before releasing you all to go home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive home and luckily enough, it seems both your parents are home at the same time, which is rare since they're both high level hunters. \"Welcome home Jaune!\" you hear them both call out, before responding back with your own \"I'm back\".<br>\r\nYou walk up to your mother and show her the form, and she reads it to herself silently, before signing in her portion and going to your father, asking him to sign it too. Your father spots something your mother did not, which is a slight line of text that is barely noticable in the contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-If the Schnee family should get interested in a student, they are allowed to take them into their house from their families without consent-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father, still against the possibility of you being taken away, refuses to sign the paper and saying that you just have to stay home. Your mother turns to you and tells you that she would convince your dad to let you go, and you trust her, before going into the backyard to train. After a couple hours of training you go in for dinner, your mother handing you back the fully signed form, telling you to have fun during your visit, but to stay safe. You finish dinner and wash your plate, before going upstairs to bed to watch some DustTube before going to bed, the excitement of going to <i>the</i> Schnee headquarters taking over your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>The next morning!</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in the morning, feeling more refreshed than ever before. Your parents had already left for their daily mission and your sisters were still sleeping, leaving you to say goodbye to no one as you exited your house for the last time, not that you knew at the time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at school on time, and the teacher is accepting the forms early. You hand in your form before getting on the bus to the airport so you could fly on a Dust Plane over to Atlas. After waiting about 20 minutes, more people start to get on the bus, taking up all the seats. You pull out your scroll to listen to some music in your earbuds while the bus starts moving. The entire trip took a little less than 2 hours, the distance between Vale and Atlas being quite short. You start to feel cold before pulling out the coat you bought before you came, already knowing of Atlas's extreme weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your classmates start to leave the airport at your teachers orders, once again boarding another bus. The bus brings you to Schnee headquarters, which you note is quite warm, hot even. You take off both your jacket and your shirt, leaving you only in a sweat shirt, and causing all the female students of your grade to start staring at you and, unknown to everyone else, a certain Ice princess was staring as well. You feel a piercing stare unlike any you had ever felt before coming from the higher area of the facility before dismissing it, believing it to only be your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Weiss POV</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must have him, he must be mine! He must only belong to me! Everything that is good belongs to me! Everything that I want belongs to me and I WANT HIM! I saw those sluts acting like they're attractive, trying to show off curves that don't exist to try to impress my blond knight. Of course, he ignored those sluts because he knew he should only look at me that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly start remembering about a certain clause in the contract to come here that I was interested in before. <i>-If the Schnee family should get interested in a student, they are allowed to take them into their house from their families without consent-</i>. I immediately knew that father could take my beautiful blond knight into our house, to be a slave, pet, or perhaps a lover for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Back to Second POV</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly shiver, even though it's super hot inside the facility. You started to notice an arguably pretty white themed girl following the group around, and you assume it's Weiss Schnee, heiress of the Schnee company, due to her easily noticeable traits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Suddenly, an \"attack\" on the Schnee family ends up with you being kidnapped. (Staged attack to kidnap you)<br>\r\nB: Suddenly, a real attack on the Schnee family by the White Fang ends with you being kidnapped (Yandere Blake Belladona)<br>\r\nC: You are kidnapped quietly while you got lost from the group, leaving no commotion whatsoever</span></div></div>",

Knowing though you cant land a beauty like that even if you tried, you've had to resort to some underhanded tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat mixture you mentioned before is actually a love potion, designed to make her fall in love with the first person she sees.

She was in her classic red dress, her long whit hair dropping over her and carrying a small basket. She was beyond gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Hi Mirajane. Nice seeing you today\u201d You say trying to act nice and cool. Mirajane not being the kind of girl to ignore someone walked closer to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to see you too\u201d She said in her usually cheery self. \u201cYou look quite fresh today\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush at the compliment as you try not to make it too awkward. \u201cUh thanks, just trying to put on a good look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, i must say its working\u201d She said as you almost melted from the compliment. \u201cAnyway, I'm going to just buy some Yognive Apples is that alright\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, can you do me a favour first\u201d You ask her as she looks your way, ears open as you grab the cup with the love potion. \u201cIve been thinking about extending my branch and make fruit shakes. However i don't know how good they are so-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want me to be the first one to taste them?\u201d She asked as you nod. \u201cWell i would love to\u201d She said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre... are you serious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, it would be my honour.\u201d She put the basket on your desk and reached for the cup, bringing it up to her nose as she sniffs it. \u201cHmmm. Smells good, whats in it exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh... thats a secret\u201d You say figuring it would be better to not tell her. Then to your absolute delight she took a small sip of the potion. She brings it away from her plush lips as she savours the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Mirajane... how was it?\u201d You ask with the stupidest smile on your face. She opens her eyes to reply, however stop when she sees you. You cheer in your brain as you recognise that look. Its the look you give her all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirajane then gave you a loving smile before saying. \u201cIt was really good, really good\u201d</span></div></div>",

Eventually, everything went black for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, your vision was blurry and you heard a cute voice said, \"Ara! You're awake! I was worried you'd be in a coma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision cleared very quickly. You saw you were lying on a bed in a dorm room, decorated with a few stuffed animals, pictures, a computer, dressers, a tv, and a fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to sit up, but you quickly learned that handcuffs were around your wrists and the bed's headboard. Looking down, you saw that shackles were around your ankles.You also saw you were in your undershirt and some underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made it scarier was that you knew you wore boxers this morning, but now you were wearing briefs. Briefs that had a bat-motif. On the undershirt was written, 'Moka's' and it was written in a heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, please-\" You began as you looked at the girl sitting besides the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moka. My name is Moka, Akashiya, But you can call me, Moka-chan, if possible, Y/N,\" The Pink-haired vampire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Moka said her full name, you swore you heard a faint echo from an older woman's voice say, 'Akasha Bloodriver'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... How do you know my name... Moka-chan?\" You asked, fearing for your life and freedom. \"And can you free me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I checked your wallet for any medical information, silly,\" Moka answered with a giggle. \"And I can't free you. Not until I know you won't run away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can scream, get a dorm mother to free me,\" You replied as calmly as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dorm mother in a Youkai Academy? You risk getting killed, eaten, or enslaved. One of the dorm mothers is a sexual maneater who likes boys like you and another will eat you for trespassing,\" Moka said as she stood up and began to take off her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moka-chan, what are you doing?\" You asked, barely holding back fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was told that boys like to sniff girl's panties, so I'm getting mine ready for you. It might calm you down,\" Moka answered as she gave you a cute-yet-confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moka-chan, you're... scaring me, Please free me and I won't tell anyone,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're being mean! I'm not scary, I'm cute and beautiful! Just ask any of our classmates, once you're a good boyfriend!\" Moka replied with puffed cheeks. \"I ought to punish you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to scream, but Moka was lightning quick with her response. She put her rolled-up panties in your mouth and somehow found some tape to tape up your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There... Now you can't call for help,\" Moka said with a giggle. \"As for classes, I went and talked with the headmaster. I don't know what happened. I kinda blacked out during the meeting, but I'm now in charge of you!\"</span></div></div>",

I too, am in love with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... How are you your mother?\" You asked, feeling even more fearful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Outer Moka's personality is based on my own. Not only that, but I can see and hear anything she does. Like her and Inner Moka, I feel in love with you,\" Akasha cooed as she straddled you. Only the briefs on you separated your dick and Moka's pussy. \"And that love and the Rosario seal allows me to take control of my daughter's body... at least until I can make my way to Youkai academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where...

He's here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran to the door and waited for the knock. When it occurred, she opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Roll.

Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you enjoyed the hug and how oddly soft Roll's body was, you said, \"You're welcome, but I have to go back and help out my parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...\" Roll sadly uttered as she let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling guilty, you said,\" But I get off at 5, so we can do something then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Roll uttered with a happy skip as she picked up the package of food.

Roll recorded the sight and saved it in a folder that she only knew the password to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe met you once, during her first shopping trip and gained a crush when you treated her like a normal human, even after you were told she was a robot. Over time, that feeling grew and grew... to the point where she hacked a few security systems in a few places to keep an eye on you. She actually had a shrine dedicated to you some distance away in a cottage she made when she knew no one was keeping on eye on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took the package of food and began to put away the food in the cupboards, she said to herself, \"Now to plan our date... I'm sure it was a date. I mean, he called me a cute girl! In fact, I'm sure he's now my boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile turned quite fake as she said, \"And if I'm not, I'll convince him by any means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen 5:00 came around...</span></div></div>",

Then under her breath, she whispered, \"And the sooner we get you away from all those sluts who want my man, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" You asked, having not heard exactly what Roll had uttered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, 'The sooner we get away from the city, the better' I kinda see why Dr. Light lives away from the city,\" Roll answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" you muttered as the jet bike reached the forest outside of the city. \"So where is that spot you mentioned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll reach it in a few minutes!\" Roll answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged a little, as waiting meant being able to hold onto Roll's hot body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she landed outside of a log cabin, one where the roof was decorated with various branches and leaves. You asked, \"Who owns that cabin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I do, since I built it,\" Roll answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver of fear went down your spine, but you decided to ignore it. Roll got off the jetbike and headed to the cabin, saying, \"I'll go get a picnic blanket and a few other things. Can you get the picnic basket and my energy container?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you answered as you got off the jetbike and began to search the containers at the back of the jetbike. You were able to find the things Roll had asked you to find. As you took them out, you muttered, \"Man, this jetbike can hold so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back!\" Roll said in a cheerful tone. She quickly set up the blanket, as well as a few odd devices. When she saw you looking at them, she said, \"They're some sonar devices. If they detect anything dangerous, we'll know to run inside and wait or get on my jetbike and run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal was rather delicious... In fact, she seemed to know exactly how prepare food to your specifications. You looked at her, smiled, and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe  sipped her energy tank and blushed. However the way she was sitting seemed to suggest that she was staring at you the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the shiver of fear went down your spine. You ignored it like before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finished eating, you asked, \"That was a great meal, Roll. You're a great cook!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks! I normally don't do girly things like cook, but doing it for you made it less embarrassing,\" Roll replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now that we have some time alone, I guess we can talk,\" You muttered, feeling a bit sleepy. You passed it off as the fact you worked really hard for the past few days and barely got a chance to rest. \"So is there movies you're into?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Martial arts movies and any action movies!\" Roll began. She began to go into detail over some of the latest movies she watched. The more she spoke, the more you began to feel like you were about to pass out. When Roll noticed that you were almost ready to pass out, she gestured to her lap and said, \"Feel free to rest your head there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded before you crawled over to Roll and rested your head on her soft thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you passed out, Roll's smile turned a bit evil as she said, \"Part one, completed. Commencing Part two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, when you woke up...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up in an unfamiliar indoor setting. At first you feared the worst. Then you remembered the events from earlier. Roll, the picnic, the cabin far out in the woods. Judging by the wooden walls and furniture this was likely her cabin. Sure enough you heard Roll\u2019s voice talking in the next room. You couldn\u2019t make out all of it but you heard her saying something about research on the effects of some chemicals on the local flora. The talking went on for another few minutes. You would have gotten up, but your body felt oddly stiff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the talking stopped and the door to your room opened. In walked an especially cheerful looking Roll. \u201cWell look whose finally up. Morning sleepyhead?\u201d She said in a singsong tone. Wait morning. \u201cShit! What time is it? Oh god if I\u2019m late my dad will kill me!\u201d You start to panic as you slowly fight through the stiffness to get your arms working. Roll giggled as she sat down next to you placing a hand on your chest. \u201cOh you don\u2019t need to worry about that anymore.\u201d She said cryptically. \u201cWhat do you mean? My dad said-\u201c Roll covered your mouth with a shhh. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is your parents aren\u2019t really expecting you to return home. As far as they or anyone is concerned, this is your home.\u201d You have her a look that was partconfused and part afraid. Was this girl nuts or something? \u201cI can see you don\u2019t quite understand. Unsurprisingly since your family was told to keep you in the dark.\u201d You get that familiar chill once more. \u201cKeep me in the dark about what?\u201d Roll grinned. \u201cWell I more or less bought you from them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened and your heart rate spiked as you started taking lout heavy breaths. \u201cYou can\u2019t... they would never...\u201d you could only stutter out a few fragments but it was enough for Roll to get the point. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, the wording on the contract and the transaction papers were a teensy bit misleading. They assumed they were accepting the money and in Return you would be taking part in some top secret scientific research on something of a permanent basis.\u201d You just stared in disbelief as Roll pulled out the form. You couldn\u2019t believe what she was saying, but there it all was. The terms, your parents signatures, proof of money sent and received, and the dates which you noticed were dated almost half a year ago. They actually signed your life away to be this robot girl\u2019s property, albeit unaware of some of the details. \u201cAnd thanks to a tiny line I snuck in right here...\u201d Roll pointed to a throwaway line on the 4th page. \u201cYou are legally mine as far as custody goes.\u201d You just stared mouth agape. Unable to form words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to run. Run as far away from here as possible. But you couldn\u2019t gather the strength to even get up. \u201cOh right the nanites are still active. Sorry about that. They\u2019re just a little safety precaution just in case you get any silly ideas like running from the cabin.\u201d She said this all so casually as she hugs you lovingly. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, you\u2019re going to love your life with me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus Christ this girl really is loco. And you are trapped and completely at her mercy. No access to the outside world. </span></div></div>",

Of course the entire deck was stacked against you making this thought seem like an impossibility. Still you weren\u2019t going to just lay back and take this... even though the nanotechnology she somehow got into your body was making it extremely difficult to do anything else. You had to fight. You had to resist her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roll imagined her future life with you, fondly thinking of all the fun she\u2019ll have, you struggled and strained to get your body moving. Much to Roll\u2019s surprise you managed to fight through it enough to slap her hand away. Clearly her new boytoy has a lot of fight in him. She grinned as she thought about the applications of such a trait. Though you did use it in an act of defiance. Though she was willing to mark that as not thinking straight in the shock from the big news, boyfriend or no, Roll was not going to tolerate such behavior from you. She had considered using the nanites to adjust your brain chemistry to make sure you\u2019d immediately fall in love with her, but that simply didn\u2019t feel right to her. And besides that, she knew that all she needed was her feminine charms to get to you... one way or another. Either she would win you over with her charms and affection... or break you in the process, whichever came first. In Roll\u2019s mind there wasn\u2019t a real between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at you, you saw the face that was less angry and more disappointed. You soon felt movement returning to your limbs, but before you could take advantage of this freedom, Roll had you pinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Since you hit her, Roll returns the favor. Gently for her, not so much for you comming from a super strong robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Roll uses technology to shrink you. Adding more fun possibilities and hopefully killing all thoughts of resisting or escaping from her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Roll disciplines you in some other way<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 4: She decides to let you off with a warning</span></div></div>",

While I do love everything about you, I do want you to accept my love. So I'll let you off with a warning this time,\" Roll said, enjoying your touch. \"I mean, if you wanna get rough in the future, I don't mind... I can get rough right back, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she stopped and glared at you as she said, \"Just as long as you don't EVER. Reject. My. Feelings. For. You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes darted at the multipurpose garnet on her left arm, filled with so many countless gadgets. When you met her and she had told you about them, you thought and told she had potential to be a better hero than her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that gadget arm was terrifying. All those inventions, once cool, now were threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth went into a snarl, getting your attention.

Now... what shall we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took the hand off her face and pressed it against her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... soft... both your behind and boobs are soft,\" You uttered without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll blushed and giggled, \"Heh heh heh!

Getting the parts to make my vagina will be a bit tough, though. But it will be worth it!\" Roll cheerfully said. Squeezing your hand further into her bosom and grinding her behind into your crotch, she said, \"And judging by what I feel, you think it's worth it, too!\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n'Damn hormones and reactions,' </i>You thought. \"Y-yeah. Roll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what do with you now?\" Roll asked with a slight leer.</span></div></div>",

Once more, you enjoyed her soft boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you knew you had to escape and let Dr. Light know that Roll turned deranged and hostile. If only there was a word that let others know that a robot went crazy and was now willing to harm humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to bide your time. Roll would be screening all your actions. Perhaps out of suspicion, perhaps out of love, or perhaps to create some creepy love collage of you in a closet? Who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what now?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll spend a few months out here, enjoying our love. I\u2019ll go out and get food and drinks for you,\u201d Roll answered as she stared lovingly in your eyes.  \"We'll do have to do some scientific work, if only to strengthen the top secret scientific research claim. Won't be hard, as I've spent more time as Dr. Light's assistant more than Mega, even though he does want to be an assistant more than a super hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen can we both go out, if only to show others how much we love each other?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...In a few months.

You felt a pussy, a human pussy. \u201dWhile I was disguised as a bartender, I knocked out a variety of attractive human women, so I could study their vaginas and then make a perfect one for me to have for your enjoyment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Oh god, she\u2019s a date rapist,\u2019 </i>You thought. Fear filled you, but you hid it with a smiling mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll still have to make a few final adjustments to it, as I don\u2019t want to get overloaded on pleasure and shut down from it. But if you want, we can try it out,\u201d Roll explained. \u201cAnd before I forget, I even gave myself an anus, if you ever want to have some backdoor fun with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d you replied. \u201cSo\u2026 can I move now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll sat up and stared at you, looking a bit disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep in mind that I <i>have </i>to move around. Otherwise, I\u2019ll get bed sores, muscle atrophy, and I do need to\u2026\u201d You trailed off, thinking of words that a robot like Roll would understand. \u201cExcrete waste matter? Not only that, but you won\u2019t always be here all the time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll pondered your words for nearly a minute before she tapped her wrist gadget a few times. All of a sudden, you could move. As you stared at your wriggling fingers, Roll said, \u201cYou do have a good point, but you\u2019ll have limited range from the cabin. You\u2019ll feel less and less movement as you near the range limit. Leave the range and no more movement until you get brought back inside..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what will be the range?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but that\u2019s classified,\u201d Roll cooed before she kissed you on the lips.</span></div></div>",

I'm willing to share if you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And  since when am I not ready for anything involving you?\" Kneesocks cooed as she sat down. She nervously asked, \"Do you think he'll accept us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter? We can make him ours,\" Scanty answered. She then looked forward and barked, \"Fastener! Take us to a human named Y/N!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have any plans to make him ours?\" Kneesocks asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and here's what it is,\" Scanty said before she whispered in Kneesocks's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeocks's smile grew bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relaxing in a park after a long day. A number of your fellow students still bragged about having sex with Panty Anarchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so special about Panty? All she's done is proven that she's a slut,\" you muttered as you leaned back and closed your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I completely agree with your accurate assessment,\" A cute voice cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do too, sister,\" A second voice cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs were pulled away from each other before two attractive girls sat down on your legs, pinning you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized them as the two who brought order to Daten City High... as well as the daughters of the mayor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May...

We instead offered a great deal of money to your parents to let us adopt you into our family like a younger brother.

Do you have any jurisdiction to do that?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cConsidering how much presence we have in your city, I suggest you choose your words carefully next time,\u201d the Colonel warned you.<br>\r\n\u201cB..But I'm no soldier!\u201d you pleaded, \u201cI dont have any military training! Heck, I hardly ever fought the other kids back in school!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cActually, your services will not be used for combat,\u201d the Colonel assures you, \u201cyou will be primarily tasked to assist this region's head Navigational Overseer, Iris. I take it youre well acquainted with her, yes?\u201d Iris? Oh yeah, that cute brunette she-bot you lent a hand to a couple of times during your volunteer work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, I met her a few times,\u201d you answer.<br>\r\n\u201cWell she's been telling me a lot about you,\u201d he tells you, \u201can awful lot actually. In fact, she's created a separate database dedicated to you at the base.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNevermind that!\u201d he immediately changes the subject, \u201ceffective immediately, your duties and tasks will be to serve and assist her to the best of your abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait a minute! This is way too sudden!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of sudden, suddenLY a group of reploids come out of nowhere and start putting ribbons around you! Actually ribbons! They wrapped you in ribbons! Awfully tight ribbons! You were being binded in ribbons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFear not, Mr. [Y/N]. For youre in no safer hands than with my sister!\u201d The Colonel says while more ribbons are wrapped around you. \u201cIs the collar working?\u201d he asks one of the reploids.<br>\r\nA reploid in a labcoat presses a button and the red light on your collar stops blinking and flashes brightly!<br>\r\n\u201cFully armed and functional, sir!\u201d answered the labcoat!<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?! What is this gonna do?!\u201d you question.<br>\r\n\u201cYou neednt worry about it,\u201d answered the Colonel, \u201cjust concentrate on taking good care of my sister\u2026 or you'll NEED to worry about it! Which reminds me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pinned a big tag on that collar which red in big fancy letters: 'TO MY BELOVED SISTER! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, IRIS! Love, your Brother\u2026 courtesy of Repliforce'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHE FU-OOMPH!\u201d youre immediately gagged with a Repliforce-branded bandana. Not soon after, a couple of soldiers haul over a huge gift box. Big enough for someone your size to fit in.<br>\r\nYou know that, cuz they crammed you in it! You screamed and hollered mumbled garbage as they closed the box tight and wrapped a few more ribbons around it for show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing a bit of unintelligible chatter from outside your box prison, the box began to move. They were literally carrying you off somewhere. Danged if you knew where, but if you had to wager a guess, most likely to be presented to the Birthday girl!<br>\r\nThis is ridiculous! They didnt just draft you against your will, theyre treating you like somebody's birthday present! Who gave them the right to treat you this way?! Youre a human being, damnit! Someone needs to report this to the Maverick Hunters! ...Of course, that's provided they'll even let you go long enough to reach the Maverick Hunters at this rate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to get out of here. Fortunately, they didnt confiscate the switch-blade in your pocket. You could probably reach it and cut through the ribbons and the cardboard. It'd be risky, but it's the best shot you have at the moment.<br>\r\nOf course, that's provided that collar youre wearing doesnt put a stop to that in some way. Youre not sure what it does. For all you know it could track your location\u2026 or it could self-destruct if you go outside it's specific boundaries!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it's better to just wait it out and talk to Iris when you see her. Surely, she'll be understanding and see what kind of a lunatic her brother's been acting like doing this to you!<br>\r\n...By the way, didnt he just say she's got an entire database of you?</span></div></div>",

You thought it sounded familiar and asked her what it was, but she kept avoiding the question. For all you knew, it was probably a wedding song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What's this?\" Iris asked as you heard her walk towards you. \"Oh... Brother. I wonder what you got me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she untied the box and tore down one of the walls, Iris gasped and covered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you (Y/N)!

She said, \"Just separate them into two piles. Ones you think I should approve and ones you think I should reject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for a bit, you looked over reports.

How did she manage to sneak up on you like that?! She's a reploid in ultra heavy armor but you didnt so much as her the clanking of her metal boots!<br>\r\nWell, nevermind that! Youre busted! Your first day on the job and your commanding officer just caught you violating security protocols!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to hide the fear in your eyes as you turned to face Iris who despite inadvertently intimidating a lot more than she intended, was looking at you with just a simple questionable expression.<br>\r\n\"Oh... um... I was...\" you quickly come up with a good lie,\"I was trying to call my dad. I just wanted to let him what happened to me, didnt wanna worry him, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... but I thought your father died during the Four Kings' War in the Levant over a decade and a half ago,\" HOW THE HELL DID SHE KNOW THAoh right she's got an entire database dedicated to yoWHY DOES SHE HAVE AN ENTIRE DATABASE DEDICATED TO YOU? \"I believe he jumped in front of a live grenade to save his platoon if I remember reading the local news article correctly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being shaken up AND having bad memories reemerge, you were quick to recover.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I meant my old neighbor, Mr. Hochrin. ...He was kinda looking after me after my father's passing, so I guess I got used to calling him dad.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh. Walter Hochrin? The man who owned the music shop 'Sha-Wing' before it was closed down to be used as a Repliforce recruiting office.\" Again, the database. And it still irked you, remembering how that metal milita forcefully shut down Mr. Hochrin's business... but by then, he was considering retiring anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry [Y/N], but the Repliforce communications link is tightly restricted,\" she scolds you, \"youre not allowed to use it to make personal calls. Not even I can use it to contact my brother unless it's strictly for security purposes!\" Well, you managed to talk your way out of a very bad situation. Too bad you wont be able to call the Hunters any time soon. For the time being, youre stuck. And alone. In a world of robots. With this robot who might know more about you than you do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, ma'am,\" you sighed apologetically, though with a little authentic depression in your voice, \"I wont do that again.\"<br>\r\nIris was not done with you. She could detect something was up with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tilted her head which nested an expression of curiosity.<br>\r\n\"Is... something the matter, [Y/N]?\" she asked you.<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \"No, it's nothing. I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n\"No youre not,\" her suspicions grew as she leaned over to you, \"I can detect very stressed emotional readings emitting from you. What is wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted an answer and was not willing to budge until she got it. It's not like you could just flat out tell her that you dont feel cool being drafted against your will by robots and being made to serve one that knows TMI about YOU! But something told you that you couldnt flat out give her a bullshit answer, because she might see right through it.<br>\r\nPerhaps it would be best to give her a partial truth. Something you'd think someone like her would understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" you swallowed, \"to tell the truth, ma'am...\" You got up out of your seat and looked her in the eye, \"I've been feeling very lonely lately.\"<br>\r\n\"Lonely?\" Iris's interests sparked.<br>\r\n\"I mean, ever since more and more of your... of Repliforce's military cruised into my town, quite a bit of neighbors have moved away (or disappeared) and I've been seeing less and less... fellow humans around lately.\"<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n\"In fact, it's been a few weeks since I've seen another human being around where I live. Seriously, all my neighbors are now robots. And now I've been drafted into an army full of robots. I feel like I'm half the planet away from home.\"<br>\r\nYour robot commanding officer just stared silently throughout your entire rant. You couldnt tell if she was offended by your statement, cuz her facial expression was unreadable. Still, thinking twice about you said, you felt a little bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, ma'am,\" you bowed your head in apology, \"I dont mean any offense by it. It's... just an experience I'm not very used to.\u201d Surprisingly, you felt quite a bit better getting that off your chest. As if a huge nasty weight just got lifted off your back. Could THAT be the real problem you were having?! Were you really just upset with being lonely instead of being kidnapped?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, the butterflies in your belly flew right out of it and you didnt feel quite as nervous of Iris's blank yet attentive stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I understand,\u201d she finally responded, \u201cit must be difficult being away from your own kind for a while.\u201d More like your own kind being away from you, but nonetheless. \u201cIt's true that us reploids are quite a bit different from you. In quite a lot of ways, it'd take several hours to list the many differences. However, despite us being more machine than organic, we do share a few similarities. We both communicate to each other eloquently, speak the same language, we can engage in the same past times and activities as you. We have emotional impulses that make us happy, sad, angry, frightened, and hundreds of other emotional responses like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris stepped a bit closer and continued, \u201cAnd of course, just like you humans, us reploids have families. Although I cannot recollect any history regarding my 'biological' parents, I at least have my brother\u2026 who is incredibly important to me. Just like how Mr. Hochrin is important to you\u2026 despite not being your biological father.\u201d Aw shoot. She's got a point. Reploids actually having families, let along family bonds, was a major trait that they have in common with humans. Now bearing children on the other hand\u2026 well, you heard from hearsay that some have particular 'upgrades', but it's still just hearsay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before your mind could drift on that anomaly, Iris grabbed your hand and held it gently. Hm. It felt very soft and warm\u2026 like actual human skin instead of cold hard metal! Just the touch of her hand alone reminded you of her hug earlier. Honestly, you were surprised her breasts her soft and cushiony just like a human's! You were expecting those things to be hard as steel and nearly poking your eyes out! Heh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry, you'll fit in with us,\u201d she assures you with a wink, \u201cit's not like any of the others can tell youre a filthy fleshbag, anyways.\u201d Her words combined with her touch really soothed your woes. It really took your mind off the database and whatever this damn thing her brother put around your neck is! Maybe. Just maybe. It wont be so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a new boost of confidence, you return Iris's smile and give your commanding officer the proper salute.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, ma'am! I'll do my best to serve you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'll do your best to ASSIST me,\u201d she corrects you, \u201cplease dont think of me as your boss.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nodded, \u201cYes ma...I mean Iris.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, Iris put her hands behind her back and peeked at your work.<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which, having you finished doing the task that I assigned you?\u201d Oh right, the whole report piling... er...

It wasnt even difficult because about 99% of the reports in the stack were something you personally approved of. All but 2 papers were on the approval list!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris stared blankly at the insanely large stack of reports you deemed worthy of her approval.<br>\r\n\"Um... THIS whole pile is what you believe I should approve?\" she seemed a bit suspicious at first which was understandable.<br>\r\nBut you nodded fully assured of yourself, \"Absolutely ma-\" Iris pointed at you with her eyebrows raised, \"I mean Iris! These are all reform proposals and requests for federal funding that I personally think my city is in desperate need of. I honestly think they'll help it heal and recover back to it's former glory before the whole Maverick outbreak. We need all the help we can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw determination in your eyes and her CPU believed it was enough to warrant considering your opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reploid superior nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well [Y/N],\" she walked back over to her desk, \"let's have a look at them, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when the fucking evaluation began. It was an evaluation that hinted that this was gonna be a LOOOOOOOOOOONG conscription service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris looked over the first proposal.<br>\r\n\"Request for four million dollars of federal funding to build a memorial monument?\"<br>\r\n\"To honor those who died in the Four Kings' War,\" you added, remembering your father's service (and Iris's whole database, \"they never got properly honored for their service. Some of them didnt even get a proper burial. I'm sure their friends and families would really appreciate the sentiment.\"<br>\r\n\"They truly do deserve such admiration,\" Iris admits, \"from what I researched, it was described as 'Hell Split Wide Open' for a reason.\" She tapped the paper against her desk, \"However, Repliforce has already arranged plans to include a special exhibit dedicated to the war in the Repliforce-Approved National History Museum over in City Square. So this monument is not needed.\"<br>\r\n\"Still... I think the townsfolk here would appreciate it....\"<br>\r\n\"They will appreciate the many sights, stories, names, scenes, and Repliforce memorial souvenirs our History Museum will provide them when they attend,\" Wow. WOW. To say that with such a straight face. You have no words! \"I'm sorry, [Y/N], but this funding request will have to be denied. I'm putting this into my denial pile.\" And so she put it in her denial pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Bzzzzzz*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by her 'denial pile', she means her bin with the shredder. Ouch.<br>\r\n\"Next, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...sure...\" you hand her the next one, \"a request to fund more public transportation.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh! Repliforce is the process of building a high-speed bullet train system for your city. It should be completed by the end of the year.\"<br>\r\n\"I dont think a lot of us can wait that long. After the whole car-hacking debacle during the Outbreak, very few people even have a car anymore. We need more buses to get around.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that's out of the question. Far too many state-approved buses have failed Repliforce's hack-proof tests and the ones that do are outside of our budget. But not to worry. I read that walking more is good for a human's health and carpooling is good for the environment, not to mention very socially friendly. So this will have to go into my denial pile as well.\"<br>\r\n*Bzzzzz* Into the denial pile it goes.<br>\r\n\"Next, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... a request for funding to build more public schools.\"<br>\r\n\"Repliforce has already provided those.\" Right. THEIR approved schools.<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you needed to rephrase that, \"more like schools... uh... run and taught by US... OUR teachers and staff.\"<br>\r\n\"Unnecessary,\" she immediately rejects the idea, \"Repliforce approved teachers are highly skilled and highly educated that have graduated with highest honors at other Repliforce-approved schools! Yours truly, included,\" she pats her chest with pride, \"So for the good of your kind's future generations, this request will be going in my denial pile.\" *Bzzzzz* \"Next, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errm... a proposal to reopen and restore the mega mall... that Repliforce is currently using as a base of operations,\" you hand her the paper and she doesnt take long to read it.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but our glorious leader has already arranged plans for that place,\" she states, \"but not to worry. Repliforce is currently building a colossal mega mall completely filled with Repliforce-approved stores, merchandise vendors, kiosks, and food courts to serve your every need! It's sure to be our finest civilian commercial complex yet!\"<br>\r\n\"Great...\" you smile nervously as you watch that paper go through the denial bin and come out a million denied shreds.<br>\r\n\"Next, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went on from there.<br>\r\n\"A proposal to rebuild the Diamond Gate Bridge.\"<br>\r\n\"Repliforce has already built a bridge. It doesnt need another.\"<br>\r\n\"But it has a very strict security checkpoint every 500 feet. It takes nearly four hours to finally finish crossing it!\"<br>\r\n\"Repliforce Rule #759: Safety Always Comes Before Convenience. *Bzzzz* Next, please.\"<br>\r\n\"A request for funding to repave downtown's cracked and destructed streets.\"<br>\r\n\"There is currently a shortage of available construction equipment and asphalt material due to it being used for other specific purposes. As soon as those purposes are fulfilled, we will look into street paving.\" *Bzzzz* \"Next, please.\"<br>\r\n\"A proposal to negotiate an agreement and timeline to withdraw Repliforce forces-\"<br>\r\n*BZZZZZZZZZ*<br>\r\n\"Next, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes and a total of ZERO requests and proposals have met Iris's approval and been spared from the shredder. Each and every one rejected and shredded. More public housing? Repliforce already has those. *Bzzz*. More forest reserves? The reploidal replicas suffice. *Bzzz*. Lifting the 'temporary' restrictions on meat exports? Repliforce's Department of Agriculture knows what's best. *Bzzz*<br>\r\n\u201cUh...Iris? There was another proposal behind that one you just shredded.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Well I'm sure it wasnt important.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was involving Repliforce prison reform.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said. Wasnt important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more papers were shredded, the lower your morale sunk. Despite Iris being awful cute and awful warming, she seemed outrageously faithful to her employers. Maybe you cant comprehend such behavior because you cant think like a machine create solely to serve said company that built it. Still, it made you so incredibly uneasy. Your woes were starting to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like the longest 20 minutes of your life, Iris had finally finished her evaluation. You can probably guess how many requests and proposals were accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! We've got all that done in half the time it normally takes doing it by myself!\u201d your reploid superior beams with a bit of glee, \u201cbrother was right. Tasks get done far quicker with an assistant.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cG...reat...\u201d you say, still reeling from the blow to the belly of your morale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris then looked over to the clock.<br>\r\n\u201cWe've finished so much earlier than expected, I still have a few hours of free time left before my scheduled meeting with a representative of the Maverick Hunters.\u201d The 'MH' works quickly get your attention. However, any and all ideas involving them would have to be put on the back burner for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince we have a lot of time to spare, how about I show you around?\u201d she offered, \u201cwe've provided a plethora of entertainment ideal for tourism!\u201d She sounded like she was advertising Repliforce to you! \u201cThe Repliforce Megaplex just opened up and it's currently playing a few really amazing state-approved foreign movies. I can reserve us a private screening with the really comfy seats!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUm...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOr if you'd like...\u201d Iris added, \u201c...we can go on a brief nature walk to clear our heads\u2026 at one of our artificial forest reserves. Sure, the trees and wildlife are animatronic, but theyre very convincing replicas, you'll hardly even notice the difference... other than the animals being 100% safe for human contact, of course!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you felt the soft warm grasp of her surprisingly realistic hand grasp yours. Tight, but slightly soothing. Shaking off the brief moment of ease, you answer...</span></div></div>",

After a few moments, she said, \"Let me leave a message and then we'll be off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she typed away. Typed for longer than a simple message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit later, the two of you stepped off the Repliforce civilian bus. Iris happily sighed as she hugged your arm and placed her head on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk was pretty nice. As she said, there was artificial trees and animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't like how every once in while the animals paused to look at you. Too many tales of zoos, parks, and the like where Robots went maverick and killed people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the animal were aiming any weapons, claws or anything harmful at you. They just stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad you known she had programmed the animals to take footage of you, you would have been calmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, maybe not. You might've found that scarier than animals attacking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Several Repliforce workers showed up at your apartment and Iris's, packed up all the stuff, and brought it to a large apartment. One robot worker made sure to place a box in the center of the living room that was labeled '[Y/N]'s 'pornography'. All according to Iris's orders.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of walking, Irs asked, \"I really enjoyed this walk. I almost hope that this would never end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there's your meeting with the Maverick Hunters...\" you said, hoping she'd let go of your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris took her head off your shoulder as she said, \"Yes, we should be getting back, so I can prepare for the meeting. Heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. Just that I bet a hunter I kind of know might be disappointed that I now have my eyes on someone else. I just find it funny for some reason,\" Iris replied as she brought you to the bus stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay...\" you replied, wondering if you would need to keep an eye out for Maverick hunters in the future. \"So what will I do in the mean time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait for me in my office. The meeting will be a short one, only two or three hours long,\" Iris answered as you both stepped onto the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you waited in her office, you looked around. You looked at a few pictures on her desk. One was of her and her brother. Two were of you and seemed innocent, but they were ones of you taken without your knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her terminal and pondered if you should call for help.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In walked a young blonde girl in the blue and white nurse outfit/armor and matching nurse's cap/helmet with big green eyes that brought to you two separate and conflicting inquiries. One is that she too is not human, she's a reploid just like all the others... leaving you feeling a little more lonesome. Two is that you recognize this particular reploid. You recall her seeing her pop up several times during your volunteering jobs. She was there assisting the emergency medical staff, treating the wounded and the ill, as well as comforting the uh... soon-to-be widows, widowers, and orphans. It wasnt a task you had the emotional willpower to fulfill, so for someone like her to be routinely accomplish such a task with such a cheerful tone deserves admiration!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Cinnamon,\" you greeted her while attempting to hide the uneasiness from your facade. It was the least you could do for someone as strong-willed as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, Mr. [Y/N],\" she smiled and bowed, \"I'm sorry if I disturbed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you didnt disturb me at all,\" you were already disturbed long before she walked in, \"what do you need?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm here to administer your routine health checkup,\" Cinnamon answers, \"Repliforce requires all staff to receive their health examination to ensure Maverick virus prevention.\" She had you up until that last part.<br>\r\n\"...Maverick virus prevention?\" you squinted your eyes, \"even me?\"<br>\r\n\"Especially you,\" she assures you, \"though there's no existing report of any humans infected as of yet, the Maverick virus strains have been mutating over time and Professor Isoc theorizes that it's only a matter of time before it affects human immune systems as well.\" Add that to the ever-growing list of oddities that wont help you sleep at night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, ok, sure thing,\" youre awfully quick to comply, \"the last thing I want is to become a Maverick. Uh, no offense?\"<br>\r\n\"Why would I be offended?\"<br>\r\n\"Nevermind. Sorry, it's just an expression that sounded better in my head.\" Luckily for you, Cinnamon paid your rude, out of line choice of wording no mind whatsoever. Instead, she happily focused all her energy on your checkup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe checkup itself wasnt that uncomfortable, either. Her chest doubled as a tool organizer which she'd pop open to pull out a random tool for testing, then take notes. She pulled out a tongue depressor, put it in your mouth then took a note. She pulled out a thermometer, put it in your mouth, took a note. She pulled out a stethoscope, slipped it under your shirt and felt your heartbeat (her hands were awful cold by the way), then took a note. She checked your ear temperature, took a note, tested your reflexes, took a note,  tested your blood pressure, took a note, nothing really out of the ordinary outside of the fact that it was a smiling fembot that's administering all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll it all, the checkup wasnt so bad. <br>\r\n...That is until THAT part of the checkup came. You know the one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Mr. [Y/N]. Would you please turn your head to the side?\u201d Cinnamon wasted no time whatsoever to reach for your pants!<br>\r\nYou quickly backed away in surprise\u2026 and out of fear where those ice cold titanium steel hands are gonna be!<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 i\u2026 is t-this really\u2026 appropriate?\u201d you cringe nervously, \u201cI-I-I mean\u2026 well, that part of a human's body is incredibly\u2026 sensitive\u2026 and well\u2026 reploids naturally have super strong grips!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlease dont be nervous. Having the necessary gentle grip to administer proper hernia examinations are requirements for nurse units,\u201d Cinnamon assures you, \u201cjust relax and this will all be over really quick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and swallowed hard, \u201cO-o-ok.\u201d Hoping for the absolute best, you unzip and pull down your pants and allow the reploid nurse slip her awful cold hand in your boxes and you try your best to think happy thoughts as you felt the icy cold grip surround your extra-sensitive man-pouch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow please cough.\u201d<br>\r\n*Cough* You coughed.<br>\r\n\u201cA little harder this time.\u201d<br>\r\n*Cough!* you cough harder.<br>\r\n\u201cOne more time. Cough really hard for me.\u201d<br>\r\n*COUGH!*<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief when her super-strong titanium steel hand leaves your boxers! You pray she doesnt plan on administering a prostate exam next!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinnamon scribbles another note. \u201cAlright, now to check on that collar of yours.\u201d The collar?! That thing the Colonel had put around your neck?! The one that he wouldnt tell you what it did\u2026 but hinted that it wouldnt be good for you if you didnt take good care of his sister?! THAT collar?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse pulled a remote out from her chest container and pushed a few buttons. Your collar immediately lit up and made several beeps and buzzing noises. Your curiosity sparked, but you dare not try anything funny as she removed a plate covering and inspected the wiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d she hummed as she observed, \u201cno signs of any faulty circuity or short fusing. That's good. No trace of any warranty tampering, that's for sure. Oh wow, I havent seen a battery with THAT many milliamps in one of these before! I bet I could charge my laptop with this thing if I tweak it a little!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 the collar's in good shape?\u201d you randomly blurt out.<br>\r\n\u201cSo far,\u201d she comments, \u201cI still dont understand why such a thing is placed on Repliforce faculty.\u201d Spark goes your curiosity.<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUsually these particular collars are reserved for higher leveled prison or asylum inmates released to the public on parole.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat exactly are they supposed to do?\u201d you finally ask the million dollar question.<br>\r\n\u201cSpecifically, these collars keep the parolees within their designated state-approved territory. Theyre not only trackable via satellite surveillance, but theyre also programmed to recognize specific areas and boundaries that the wearer can and cannot cross.\u201d Interesting. Ooph, but interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what happens if they go over the boundaries?\u201d you gots to know, \u201cthey get shocked or something?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo. It'll give off an alarm that'll alert any and all nearby Repliforce personnel that youre breaking parole.\u201d Oh. \u201cHowever it IS programmed to discharge high voltage if it detects unapproved tampering.\u201d OUCH! \u201cSo unless you feel the urge to be fried crispy, I wouldnt recommend trying to take it off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. Why in the world would these tin cans feel the need to put one of THESE on you?! What's next? Are they gonna break your ankles so you dont try to run away like in that one movie starring that heavyset woman Nicholas Cage punched in the face in that other movie?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... would it be safe to take a bath in this thing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Cinnamon answers, \"the casing is 100% completely waterproof. Even if youre caught in a monsoon, this collar will not short-circuit.\u201d Youre really starting to regret going down this line of conversation. But at least you finally got answers to some nagging questions from the beginning. However, more question brew: What are the restricted boundaries the Colonel and his cronies set for you? Where can you go or not go? Why did they feel the need to put a parole collar on you to begin with? How do you get the stupid parole collar off without being electrocuted to death?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd those were only a FEW of the many, MANY questions brewing in your mind ever since the consciption began. Sadly, those will have to wait for another time. Until then, you can at least get one particular question answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, does that include the checkup?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost,\" Cinnamon answers, \"I just have a brief line of questioning I need you to answer that I need to assess and evaluate before I can conclude the examination.\" Oh goodie. A pop quiz. \"I'm gonna ask you a variety of questions and I need you to answer them as truthfully as possible, ok? Dont be afraid to be as brutally honest as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" you comply with the questionnaire. It sounded easy, but you were sure it wasnt.<br>\r\nAnd you were right because of what this series of questions related to!<br>\r\nSpeaking of questions, here's one: What were the questions she asked you related to?</span></div></div>",

Cinnamon's line of questions felt very unorthodox and way too personal, that if you believe your kind's military used it in their recruit interviewing, they'd be sued back to the dark ages!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your options were limited. You had no choice but to answer them. Truthfully, cuz for all you know, Cinnamon had a lie-detector built into her CPU and is transmitted directly to the higher ups. Especially one particular higher up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First question,\" she reads off the questionnaire, \"describe your marital status. Married, Single and Divorced, or Single and Never Married?\"<br>\r\n\"Single and Never Married,\" you answered. She took a note.<br>\r\n\"If your answer is 'Single and Never Married', are you currently in a relationship with anyone? Yes or No?\"<br>\r\n\"No,\" you answered. She took another note.<br>\r\n\"If your answer is 'No', is there someone you are currently interested in having a relationship with anyone? If Yes, please give his/her name.\" That's WAY too personal.<br>\r\nBut you answer \"No.\" But that wasnt specific enough.<br>\r\n\" 'No' as in you dont currently have someone youre interested in or 'No' as in you DO have someone youre interested in, but refuse to give his/her name?\"<br>\r\n\"No as in there isnt currently someone.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Cinnamon scribbles a few more notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got worse from there.<br>\r\n\"Ok, these next questions are very important,\" Cinnamon explains, \"please listen very carefully and do not hesitate to ask me to repeat them or reword them if you dont understand a question clearly.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" you answer nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First questions,\" she reads, \"which of the following describes you? Straight, Homosexual, Bisexual, or Other?\" Other? \"If the answer is 'Other' please describe.\"<br>\r\n\"Straight,\" thankfully it was an easy question. OFFENSIVE, but easy.<br>\r\n\"Ok then,\" Cinnamon's tone lights up a little as she jots down a note, \"next question: what part of a female's body would you consider gives you the most sexual stimulus? A female's chest or a female's hips?\" GOOD LORD ALMIGHTY!<br>\r\n\"Is that seriously part of the questionnaire?\" you question.<br>\r\n\"Yes it is,\" she answers with no hesitance, \"Chest or Hips?\"<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath as your face went red, \"...Hips.\" A man of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she takes a slightly long note, \"next question: which of the following would you consider to be an ideal girlfriend? Human, Reploid, or Other? If the answer is 'Other' please describe.\" The bloody hell kind of question is that?!<br>\r\n\"Other,\" you answer, \"I dont think it really matters if she's a human or reploid.\"<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" she comments as she jots down notes, \"next question: would you consider having a relationship with a co-worker? Yes or No?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... that would depend on how well we-\"<br>\r\n\"That's not one of the choices,\" she interrupts, \"the choices are yes or no.\"<br>\r\nYou sigh hard, \"Yes.... I guess?\"<br>\r\n\"Nice,\" she remarks before jotting down a note, \"please pay close attention to this next question: In the unlikely event that you and your co-worker were trapped in a tight dangerous confined space with no hope of escape or being rescued, would you consider making love to your co-worker before you and her inevitably die? Yes or No?\" This is getting ridiculous. But whatever! Fine!<br>\r\nYou shrug your arms, \"I guess... if SHE'S up for it too... yes, probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh she wasnt done.<br>\r\n\"How often would you say you relief personal stress via self-stimulation on an average week?\"<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes, \"I'm sorry, I dont understand the question.\"<br>\r\n\"Allow me to rephrase it,\" Cinnamon quickly rephrased it, \"how often do you masturbate per week?\"<br>\r\nKeeping a straight face, you politely ask, \"Can I please skip that question?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, all these questions are mandatory according to strict Repliforce guidelines,\" Cinnamon explains, \"if you need more time to properly answer, feel free to take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didnt need more time. You had an answer.<br>\r\nYou lower your head and answer, \"3 to 4 times a week, I guess...\" Tsk. Liar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" Cinnamon's 'hm' sounded a little more interested than it shouldve been! \"Next question: If you were offered, would you be interested in routine assistance with self-stimulation from a third party?\"<br>\r\n\"NO THANK YOU,\" seriously, who wrote this crap?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, we're down to the final question,\" she states. FINALLY.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you groan with irritation.<br>\r\n\"Is the ability to produce future offspring important to you? Yes or No?\" WOW. That's a pretty head scratching question right there. Not to mention, it's something you gotta take into account while youre your commanding officer's boyfriend...<br>\r\nYou take a few breathes, having a difficult time coming up with an answer, \"Well... at the moment... hm. That's a tough question to answer.\"<br>\r\n\"Feel free to take your time,\" she insists.<br>\r\nYou glance around, bite your lip, inhale and exhale, and at the very end, youre sure there was only one answer, \"...To be frank, I probably would like to have children eventually. I gotta say the answer's yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinnamon doesnt respond. She just takes notes. She takes a lot of notes actually. She writes for almost a whole minute and you just sit there and wait patiently for her to finish. Penny for her thoughts, but you got a feeling you dont wanna know what she's thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. That concludes the examination,\" Cinnamon FINALLY ends this bizarre episode, \"thank you so much, Mr. [Y/N] for your patience and compliance.\"<br>\r\n\"N...no problem,\" it was hard to say that with a straight face. The blonde reploid nurse extends her hand and you willingly shake it, taking note of the cold, rather stiff mechanical grip. Quite unlike Iris's warm gentle humanlike grip. You'll assume that her chest isnt similar to Iris's, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should return to my post. Here is my card,\" she hands you a business card. An 'Isoc Pharmaceuticals (a Repliforce partner)'s business card with her name, company address, and phone number on it, \"if you had any questions or concerns, or if you simply feel the need to talk, feel free to call me. Use the phone number on the back if it's after hours.\" Her PERSONAL phone number was written on the back of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you again for your cooperation,\" Cinnamon bowed, \"I hope to see you again soon!\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you bowed back, \"bye Cinnamon.\" With that, the perky professional (but slightly disturing) nurse left the office. You sighed hard after finally getting some well earned peace and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnusual, but at least you had SOME answers. It didnt make your forced conscription any easier to manage, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh... all this drama is making you tired. You were nearly worn out. Maybe a little nap will ease your stress. Feeling that was the case, you lean back in your chair and close your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...For about as long as a SECOND cuz something interrupted that nap before it could even start! What was the interruption?</span></div></div>",

The town had been attacked by Pirates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you worked to help repair, you saw a beautiful sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA purple-haired woman, dressed in a red Genie's outfit... and from what you heard, she was a half-genie who was the town's Genie Guardian that fought off the Pirates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you decided on staying, wanting to be with Shantae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying a bouquet of flowers and a few boxes of Bentos ( you heard they were her favorite), you headed to her home, which was the town's lighthouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knocked and she answered, saying, \"Hello. May I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I came to give you these, since you are a hero and I wanted to give you a reward... \" You said as you offered the flowers and Bento. \"I know you probably got a lot of rewards and gifts for being a great Genie Guardian and being so attractive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she accepted the flowers and Bento, Shantae quietly said, \"Actually, you're the first to give me any gifts and the first to tell me that I'm attractive without being a bad guy or Rottytops...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" You uttered, not sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd ask you if you wanted a date with me, but since you are leaving with that construction team-\" Shantae began, sadly looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Today was my last job with them. I'm currently unemployed,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShantae looked at you with an odd look. Like she was surprised and pleased to hear what you had said, but also... hungry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. Well... That's good,\" Shantae said in an oddly calm tone. \"Do you need a place to stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be nice. I have my things in a caravan,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll clear a room and you can move in!\" Shantae retorted as she put the gifts on a stand besides the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Shantae!\" You happily replied before Shantae hugged your face into her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the pleasure's all mine...\" Shantae said. Inwardly, she thought, 'The first man to be genuinely interested in me and not a bad guy? all mine... all mine...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Shantae let you go, You went to get your caravan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fists curled as she muttered, \"No one else will have him, unless I deem it.

She cooed, \"You were so awesome, defeating those monsters...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as awesome as you,\" You replied. When she glared at a woman who tired to give you the bedroom eyes, you recalled how Shantae crushed the Lamia and said, \"You're the only one for me, Shantae.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flirt...\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she and you ordered your meals, the two of you ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that your favorite kind of meal?\" Shantae asked, as you had ordered pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one that I've learned to like, as it tends to be easy to make across the land,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make it if you want,\" Shantae replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to,\" you replied. \"But do you want to do anything after this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, We could explore the area behind the Lighthouse.

Why am I tied up?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Risky Boots doesn't kidnap you.

She picked up a banana and an apple. \"Now, which one do you want to eat first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The apple, I guess,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour half-genie captor put the apple on a plate and took out a knife.

With a heartwarming smile, she began to feed you the slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to anger her, you ate the offered slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for a show,\" Shantae said as she unpeeled the banaa. She then practically gave the Banana a blowjob. She licked and kissed it all over before thrusting it in and out of her mouth. When she held the Banana in her mouth, she moaned for several moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, Shantae offered the saliva-covered Banana to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I'm good,\" You replied, shaking your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting the banana back down, Shantae looked at your crotch and giggled at how erect you were. \"I can see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShantae smiled as she stood up and...</span></div></div>",

See him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Shantae asked. all traces of Embarrassment vanished, replaced by jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly because I wanna see the construction worker who stole the heart of my best friend,\" RottyTops answered. \"I'm a little worried that she might be in over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>'Her over her head? I'm in over my head.' </i>You thought.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but let me warn him a bit about you. I doubt he's seen a Zombie before,\" Shantae said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Shantae!\" RottyTops cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShantae quickly reappeared by you and whispered, \"Listen, Y/N. Don't say anything or do anything that makes RottyTops think we're not in love!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. Shantae let out a sigh of relief before she began trying to undo your restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShantae stopped when she heard a whistle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My oh my! you are just full of surprises, Shantae!\" Rottytops cooed as she walked into view. \"Tying up a man, right in your basement? I think there's more of me in you than you think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rottytops, I know what it looks-\" Shantae began. She stopped when RottyTops sat on the bed, right next to your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your reputation might take a hit if word gets out, Shantae. So let me have some time alone with him. I promise I won't gnaw on anything,\" RottyTops cooed as she put her hand on your dick and began to give you a handjob. \"I'll even promise that his virginity will still be untouched... unless you already took it, that is.

Even after the Ink and Paint Club shut down, I still get... work, depending on how you see cameos and artwork,\" Jessica muttered. \"And after I did my best to clear his name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do wish I could help you like how you wanted, but all I can do is provide an ear for your troubles and to be here every day,\" You said as you cleaned the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit unnerved when she stared at you with surprise. More-so when she stayed silent until you left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Jessica did research on you, finding out every bit of detail about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Jessica wore a purple two-piece bikini that seemed like it was straining to stay on her. She gave you a smile that gave you a boner. She seemed... revived somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, you got a date with a human girl and even went out with her! Thanks to the money you got from your job, you could go to actual restaurants with her over the next few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica kept dressing in various erotic outfits whenever you worked. she even had moments where you accidentally bumped into either her boobs or butt. There was even a time where you and her fell over with her on top. You swore she was about to kiss you. She only stopped when you said you had a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for the next day after that last incident, your girlfriend to dump you, right in front of everyone at your school. She even spread rumors that made girls laugh at you when you passed by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you went to your part-time job, Jessica was curious at why you were so sad. So you told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you did, Jessica thought, '<i>So I bribed the right girl. She played my new lover like a fiddle like I told her, thus putting a wedge between him and human girls. Now to make him mine...'</i></span></div></div>",

Work became a drag. Paperwork soon became something that felt like a Sisyphean effort. Shizune's happiness felt like it was mocking Tsunade's loneliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that last thought, Tsunade realized that she might be wanting to get back in a relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, to prevent them from dying like Dan, Tsunade would prevent them from leaving the village, and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she looked around for a bit and found someone to her dating specifications. Under a Transformation Ninjutsu, she dated them for a few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe claimed it was for information gathering, but soon, she spent more time with the person. For a time, she was willing to give up both sake and the Hokage position to stay with them... until she realized that that would put her under their protection and control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade decided that she wanted to be in control. That the person needed her protection more than she needed theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo her next action was to work out and design a secret high-level order that prevented the male from ever leaving the village, claiming they were necessary to keep the Hokage's mental state stable.  She shared the order with a few people, who did things that could better convince the rest of the village to obey the order when the order would be revealed to the village. The fact that a couple of people were killed to better convince some of the clan heads was of little consequences to Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was to have some very trusted sealmakers to design a seal that would allow her to fill the sealed one with either pleasure or pain at her choice. Then on one of her disguised dates, she secretly slapped the seal on her loved one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the moment where she called for her loved one to a meeting, with a few clan heads to be the witnesses.

With each new book, Hana liked you more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Hana liked you enough that she agreed to Tsunade's plan to kill your family to keep you in the village. She, Anko, and Tsume all performed the nefarious deed and covered their tracks.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch...

Lucky me, there\u2019s a rock hard dick, just oozing with jizz!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head a little, making Tsunade giggle. She then impaled herself on you.

You listened to her about her day, you cheered her on, and didn\u2019t ask her out on a date. The combination of which she needed from one person The fact you also were rich and from a famous family helped out too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accidentally leered at Sakura and Mebuki\u2019s asses when they were bending over to take a closer look at something in the marketplace. Mebuki Haruno saw you look via a well-placed mirror. The experience made Mebuki feel desirable. As you apologized, All Mebuki thought was about getting her daughter to put you through the Heavenly Haruno Hindquarters experience, just to make you want to marry into the Haruno family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshino Nara caught the last one and wanted to punish you for being a pervert. However, when she saw you were a polite youngster who was quite spirited and loved Konoha, she wanted to make sure you grew up correctly. The fact you weren\u2019t lazy probably was a big influence in her becoming overly focused on you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno was scouting you to see why Sakura was interested. You gifted her some rare plant seeds because your mom liked the flowers Ino\u2019s family owned. There also was the comparative nature that her relationship with Sakura miht have some influence of why she became a Yandere towards you. Perhaps she and Sakura are trying to be the most yandere towards you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is the Lord we\u2019re protecting\u2026\u201d Yoshino said with a smirk. \u201cWe best make sure the power doesn\u2019t go to his head and make him a pervert like Jiraiya\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps we continue Lady Tsunade\u2019s plan by drowning him in pleasure\u2026\u201d Mebuki replied. She looked at her daughter, began to rub her own rear, and asked, \u201cSakura, care to help me give Lord Y/N the Heavenly Haruno Hindquarters special?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip, Sakura muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 It might be fun\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTcha! Sakura is going to compete with me to win Lord Y/N\u2019s heart! Either I win, she wins, or we draw and become his lovers!\u201d Ino cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Well, Lord Y/N is around the age of Sakura and Ino\u2026\u201d Tsunade commented quietly. \"So them and possibly Tenten marrying Lord Y/N might not be seen as odd, but I don't know...

A lot had gone on in the past few years, the Goddesses returned to GameIndustry, CPU candidates were born, all that stuff (Basically peaceful time after the game Candidates were Introduced). You were one of the few NPC's that actually had a unique body and face, and you were considered handsome by many of the people around you. You had even gotten a few off hand compliments from Goddesses visiting Planeptune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough recently, you had gotten the feeling that someone was following you. You tried to report it to the police and they ignored you. You tried to catch the person following you, but that didn't work either. You had started to get so paranoid that you didn't leave your house without your top tier sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, as you were heading to work at the Basilicom, the home of Purple Heart and Purple Sister, A beautiful girl walked up to you seductively, although it was a common occurance, you had never met someone so beautiful. Your face gained a sudden blush, and you sprinted away, knowing that getting caught in that trap would only lead to trouble.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen you stopped sprinting, you felt the presence of the stalker. You pretended not to notice, but managed to turn around fast enough to where you caught a glimpse of the stalker out of the corner of your eye. All you managed to see was the color purple, but that was the only hint you had ever gotten to the stalkers identity, so you considered it a win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your guard up the rest of the way, but the stalker never came back, or at least you couldn't feel them come back. You entered the Basilicom at record speeds, mostly due to the sprint from before. Your fellow employee's raised an eyebrow at your sweaty state, but decided that it was better to ignore it. You walked into the elevator and pulled out a key, before pushing into it's appropriate slot and bringing you up to the top of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, NPC's wouldn't be allowed near the top of the tower, but you were given special permission from the Goddess herself, Purple Heart or, as she preferred for you to call her, Neptune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened one day when you were working your boring job in a cubicle among the many floors when Purple Heart in her human form skipped into the room. The atmosphere had tightened as everyone moved to make themselves look busy and competent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were typing, you noticed Purple Heart walk in between cubicles, checking on everyone's work, before she stopped at your desk, a blush prominent on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, buckaroo? What's your name?\" Purple Heart asked in a cheery voice, although you could sense some other emotion besides happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Y/N, just a regular worker here\" You replied, giving the most tame response as to try not to draw attention to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well buddy, you aren't a regular worker anymore!\" Purple Heart exclaimed, confusing literally everyone on the floor. \"I want you to be my personal attendant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but why, my Lady? I'm just a regular person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want you to be my personal attendant! Is there something wrong with that? You'll work the same hours but you'll earn more money, and the work is much less boring than office work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm honored my lady, I would be glad to accept\" As you spoke those words, you saw Purple Hearts eye's light up in glee, before she jumped and encircled her legs and arms around your chest. She was quite a bit smaller then you in her human form, so it didn't take much effort to hold her up, but the major issue was two things. One, literally everyone on the floor was glaring at you, and two, your brain had literally been on the verge of shutting down due to the feeling of the Goddesses \"peaks\" on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurple Heart stayed attached, leaving everyone in an awkward silence, before you decided to break that silence. \"Lady Purple Heart? Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Purple Heart squeeze harder, before replying to you \"Nope, you call me Neptune now, I won't accept anything else!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood even more dumbfounded then before. Very rarely did the Goddesses allow mortals to call them by their normal name alone, and that was almost always because that person was a close friend of theirs. You heard Purple He... Neptune call up to you from her perch on your chest. \"Carry me to my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou responded back \"How do I get there Lady Neptune?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeptune responded back the directions, and you walked awkwardly out of the office, ignoring all the glares send at you by jealous   co-workers. Neptune dropped from her perch on your chest when you entered the elevator in order to insert a key, before she circled around you and jumped on your shoulders, her natural strength giving her more than enough momentum to jump that high. You felt Neptunes thighs squeeze against the sides of your head, leaving you to blush and slam your mouth shut the rest of the way up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your second day, and considering it was near the end of your hours when Neptune brought you up, you left without seeing any other occupants of the upper levels of the basilicom. When the Elevator door opened at last, you saw....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Purple Sister, preparing to leave to do some missions.<br>\r\nB: Histoire, the Oracle of Planeptune<br>\r\nC: No one, leaving you to travel to Neptunes Room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the elevator slid open you expected to at least see one person nearby. You were confused as to why the entire area looked completely uninhabited until you remember what Neptune had told you yesterday before you left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had said that her sister leaves really early in the morning for quests and that the Oracle Histoire would be asleep at those early hours. That was actually part of the reason she wanted you to come at 5 in the fucking morning. Like, you weren't gonna say no because this was a job with amazing benefits and pay but still, 5 in the morning is horrendous. Thankfully, you had gone to sleep early to actually have energy to keep up with the hyperactive goddess because based on the 2 hours you knew her personally, she was extremely hyperactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked through the hall and stood in front of a door with a plaque above it reading Neptune. Granted, you didn't need this plaque to find her room as she had led you to it before, she didn't let you in though, saying 'I gotta change stuff in my room before you come in!' and then kicking you out of the Basilicom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The door opened by itself, spurred on by the sensor beside the plaque. You are instantly greeted with an abundance of purple. Past the purple you saw a bunch of TV's, all of them bigger then you had ever seen a TV be. Beside them were a bunch of Consoles hooked up and beanbag chairs. There was also a regular table in the corner with a bunch of normal chairs, probably for more serious meetings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a Purple Queen sized bed, fitting for the current occupant of said bed. Neptune was currently curled up and sleeping in the large bed. The shocking thing, however, was that there was a second bed right next to hers. You tried to justify it by saying it was for other people but everyone else who lived in the Basilicom has their own room. You pushed the question to the back of your mind and approached the sleeping Goddess, covered by the soft-looking blankets that were, just like the rest of the room, purple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you approached her bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Neptune grabs your arm in her sleep and, with her far superior strength pulls you in and then hugs you like a doll. <br>\r\nB: You were able to successfully wake up Neptune, who then explained that the extra bed was indeed for you as an \"added benifit\"<br>\r\nC: Nepgear opens the door and assumes the worst when she sees a man approaching her sleeping sister. She takes you down and ties you up. She sees your face and your struggling and suddenly awakens as a closet dominatrix. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nami groggily opened her eyes, confused as to what had actually happened to her. A very brief check made it obvious that she was tied tightly to a chair in some unknown location with a creepy black-haired man staring at her excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it! A kidnapping! She shouldn\u2019t have gone shopping all on her own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmph!\u201d Her instinctive scream for help made the navigator painfully aware of the thick cloth that was currently cramped inside her mouth. And from the feeling of it, a big strap of tape was sealing her lips together as well. Bloody great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou finally woke up, Cat Burglar Nami, that is wonderful\u201d her captor started amused. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be nearly as much fun twisting your mind while you are unconscious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmph! Mmmh Mmmh Mph!\u201d Nami protested angrily behind her gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver since I first laid eyes on your wanted poster, I knew that I had to have you. And now, after all this time of planning and tracking, I finally got you right where I want you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man slowly walked over to her, rubbing his gloved hands together in excitement. Everything about him basically screamed \u201ccrazy stalker\u201d. And based on his words she was his main target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ate a very interesting Devil Fruit\u201d her captor explained with a sick grin all over his face. \u201cWith only one touch of my hand I can make people completely and utterly obsessed with whatever they are looking at in that moment. A ship, an apple, a book, another person, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is. I can make them desire it more than anything else, I can make them go crazy and destroy everything in their path in order to obtain and keep the item they saw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami used his monologue to struggle against her bonds, but the rope work was really good. That guy definitely knew what he was doing and she didn\u2019t like it one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am wearing these gloves to prevent any accidental use of my powers. After all, I like to be in full control at all times.\u201d With exaggerated movements the kidnapper slowly pulled off one of the gloves and waved his bare hand in front of her face. \u201cI am making you mine, Cat Burglar Nami. One touch and you will be totally obsessed with me, I will become your new purpose in life, your one and only. All your struggles will be gone in an instant, replaced by the burning desire to stay with me forever. Can you already see it? Because I definitely can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer captor erupted into an insane laughter, truly scaring the tied up pirate girl by now. Nami was convinced that he was not bluffing. She had enough experience to know how crazy Devil Fruit powers could be and that a single touch of his hand was most likely enough to rewrite her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut every Devil Fruit had a weakness. That guy just said it himself. She would be obsessed with whatever she was looking at in that moment. So what if she looked at nothing? It was worth a try and there were not really many other options left. Taking a deep breath to calm herself down, she closed her eyes completely, allowing the darkness to take over her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her newfound confidence was quickly shattered as she heard the man speak to her again. \u201cIt is no use, my dear. My powers affect you even while your eyes are closed. In that case you simply get obsessed with the first thing you see after reopening them. And trust me on this one, I will make sure that it is me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. So she somehow had to keep her eyes closed until someone would miraculously show up to rescue her. Not very likely. But it couldn\u2019t end like that. She was a proud member of the Strawhat Pirates, there was no way she was going down so easily. Not without a proper fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning up all her strength, Nami renewed her struggles against the bonds, making the chair shake a bit in the process. Maybe it was because abandoning her vision had sharpened her other senses, but she was suddenly hit with the realization that one of the chair legs was shorter than the other ones by a tiny amount. That was all the opening she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStruggle all you want, in just a few more seconds you will be all mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami ignored the creep, totally focused on shaking the chair as much as she can. It took her a few more attempts, but right before he could touch her she managed to create enough force to make the chair fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hitting the floor with an acceptable loud crash. Sadly, neither her bonds nor the chair itself took any significant damage from the fall. But that would not stop her from even more struggling. As long as she kept her eyes closed, there was still a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami could basically feel how her crazy captor slowly leaned over her, clearly enjoying her helplessness. \u201cGame over, my precious Cat Burglar\u201d he hissed into her ear right before his hand touched her upper arm, infecting her with his unique possession powers. Damn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Is someone there?\u201d a new voice suddenly reached her ears, filling the navigator with hope. The voice clearly came from further away, but it looked like someone somehow took notice of her crash and came to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d the kidnapper grunted in annoyance. She could hear hasty movements as well as two ripping sounds right before something sticky was pressed upon her closed eyes. It didn\u2019t take a genius to realize that this creep had just taped her eyelids shut to prevent her from opening her eyes without his consent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust give me another minute, I have to take care of some unwanted guest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami knew that this was her prime opportunity to try and free herself, but for some reason she was too curious to see how things would play out, so she put a stop to her futile attempts and instead listened closely to what was about to happen with the newcomer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone there? I know I heard something\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInsolent brat! I will make you regret peeking around!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighting noise was loud but also over quickly. Whoever won didn\u2019t had any trouble taking out his opponent. After what felt like an eternity of silence to the tied up Stawhat member a quite weak \u201cHow\u2026 Who\u2026 are you\u2026?\u201d from her captor\u00b4s voice finally released the tension. The newcomer had won. She was about to get saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief flooded trough her entire body. It appeared like a fairy tale, the hero showing up just in the nick of time to save the damsel in distress from the crazy bad guy. Only that this right now was reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u00b4t believe it\u2026\u201d her saviour announced right after she heard him step into the room. \u201cGood thing I trusted my gut and came here. Hold still, I am going to cut you free this instance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever that guy was, he followed up his words with actions, and before Nami realized it the ropes were falling off and she could properly move her body again. In gentleman style he then helped her sitting up before carefully peeling off the tape from both her lips and eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened here? Are you all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitting the cloth out of her mouth, Nami instinctively turned towards her saviour as she opened her eyes for the first time since she was affected by that particular Devil Fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, thank you very much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rescued Strawhat navigator realized what she was doing, it was already far too late. The image of her saviour burned itself deep into her mind, together with a massive desire to be with him, to keep him, to crush anything and everything that would dare to stand between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongratulations! Nami is now officially your Yandere!</span></div></div>",

You finally arrived at Duel Academy, the prestigious school for what was without a doubt the most important and influential card game to ever exist. Somehow you even managed to end up in the best of the three dorms, Obelisk Blue. It was a dream coming true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver your enormous excitement to be on the island and prove to everyone that you would be the next King of Games, you actually managed to miss the end of Chancellor Sheppard\u00b4s welcoming speech and quickly found yourself lost straight on day one. What a start...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you need some help to get to our dorm? I can lead you there if you want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to see a tall and beautiful girl with long blonde hair and hazel eyes. Her white and blue uniform clearly intentified her as an Obelisk student. Well, seems like your situation was a blessing in disguise as it would allow you to get to know one of cute females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, that would be very nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed her lead as the two of you started a small innocent conversation. For some reason she was very interested in who you are and what playstyle you prefer. You answered honestly and asked several questions on your own, not knowing that Alexis already knew everything about you from the very beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she first laid eyes on you during the examination duels, Alexis knew that she had to have you, so she gathered as much information as possible about your life. She prepared a dozen plans on how to quickly capture your heart at the start of the new semester, but never thought such a golden opportunity would present itself on the very first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlexis, are you sure we are going the right way?\u201d you asked concerned as she led you deeper and deeper into the woods. You got too distracted by the conversation to notice it sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually want to convince myself first that you truly belong into Obelisk Blue\u201d she replied and before you realized it, the charming blonde had suddenly turned around and activated her Duel Disk. \u201cLet us have a duel to decide your worth. If you win I will not only lead you to our dorm, but agree to become your permanent guide and girlfriend. But if you lose you have to fulfill any request I have for the rest of the semester. Deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was ridiculous. Why would you ever agree to such crazy terms? Oh right, the dueling credo to never back down from a challenge. You didn\u2019t want to break that on the first day at Duel Academy, did you? Well, here goes nothing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right Alexis, I will teach you not to underestimate me.

And I know exactly which one I want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA malicious grin spread across her cute face as she searched for the very special card that she put into her deck specifically for this duel. She didn\u2019t even know such a card existed or why someone would feel the need to create it in the first place, but that didn\u2019t matter right now. She managed to get her hands on this very unique spell and now she was going to use it to get her guy. He had no idea what was about to hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBehold! I activate the field spell <i>Yandere Girl\u00b4s Paradise</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Alexis placed the card into her Duel Disk, a pink mist started to spread all across the surrounding area, creating a dome around them that trapped both duelists inside of it. Slowly but surely pictures formed on these new encircling mist walls, all of them showing you in different private situations as if they were taken from a stalker girl. Did those pics really exist or was it just an illusion from the card? Either way, it was creepy as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis marvellous field spell increases the ATK of all female monsters on the field by 500 points as well as making them unaffected by opposing monster effects\u201d Alexis explained blissfully as her current warrior lady received a small power boost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Etoile Cyber 1700 ATK</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course my field spell also has some other tricks available, but I don\u2019t want to spoil all the surprises. No worries, you will find out in due time. For now, I set these two cards face down and end my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, this duel just turned a lot tougher than you thought it would. If you play too carelessly, that mysterious field spell you have never heard of before could easily destroy you. On the other side, the quicker you finish Alexis off, the less opportunities she has to abuse it\u00b4s powers. Was it worth the risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly forming a plan based on the opening hand, you started your first move.</span></div></div>",

Most didn't think she could become a super saiyan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose comments stopped the moment she became a Super Saiyan... and then entered the Legendary Super Saiyan state before attacking her former bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Saiyans listened when she taught.. or tried to. Shyness doesn't vanish in one day, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Y/N, and never mocked Kale. You listened intently and did as she explained, briefly becoming a Super Saiyan. You make sure to shower her with complements, making her blush and look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when a girl complemented you, Kale's shy expression was replaced by a glare, one that said, 'I will kill you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Caulifla saw you could become a Super Saiyan, she decided to test you in a spar with only Kale watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spar was... interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to actually fight, but you kept tripping. Your kept winding up either groping Caulifla's ass or boobs, or wound up with your head in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt best, you were never hit by Caulifla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you got up from Caulifla for the tenth time, she said with a grin, \"Interesting fightning style. What do you call it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhn, I just learned how to throw a punch,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-ho! A fresh canvas! Mind if Kale and I take you under our wings?\" Caulifla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I'd love to call you and Kale Senseis!\" You happily exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Kale, Caulifla asked, \"Kale! Want this guy as a student?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKale was surprised for a moment before pure glee came over his face and cheered, \"Yes! Yes! Yes, Caulifla!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaulifla looked at you and said, \"So, just tell your parents and we'll get started on your training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... live alone. My parents died,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Caulifla uttered with surprise before grinning, \"Even better...We'll move in with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You asked with enough glee to have stars appear in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaulifla put an arm around you and said, \"Sure! It'll be an experience you'll never regret!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Caulifla rubbed her boobs against you, she released you. You said,\"I'll go clean my home up right away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you left, Caulifla looked at Kale and said, \"Let's make him ours, Kale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As in... our mate?\" Kale nervously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Student, mate, husband, whatever. He needs to be ours, no one else's,\" Caulifla said with a serious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKale returned the serious look and nodded.</span></div></div>",

Things like robbing the bank, blowing up a train that transports Eridium, and fighting the sheriff of the town. So, y'know, nothing new to a badass Vault Hunter such as yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupposedly the Sheriff was, once upon a time, a Vault Hunter that helped bring Handsome Jack into power. She's also, apparently, Jack's girlfriend. Killing her won't bring you and the Crimson Raiders any closer to putting Jack in the dirt, but hey - it'll be a good fight either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Brick wants you to scope out the town's bank. Best get to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Meanwhile, in northern Lynchwood</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha... what a productive day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boots kicked up on the old hardwood desk, Nisha is relaxing after a long day of introducing some lawbreakers to the Lynchwood gallows. All the confidence in the world didn't matter when you have a noose wrapped around your neck, and Nisha was fond of watching people draw their last breath. The dark-skinned gunslinger has her wide-brimmed hat resting on her face to keep Pandora's sun from irritating her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trio of knocks on Nisha's office door disturbs her brief moment of solace. She lets out a soft growl, instinctively reaching for the digistruct holster strapped to her right hip. Bandits wouldn't just casually knock on her door, and the only person brave and/or stupid enough to do so would be her deputy, Winger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hat properly on her head, Nisha calls out, \"Better not be wasting my time, Winger! What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinger enters, and Nisha can tell the deputy is nervous. Good. He knows his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got word a Vault Hunter j-just arrived, ma'am - he's s-shootin' up Main Street as w-we speak!\" Deputy Winger stutters out, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else but Nisha's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-skinned gunslinger quirks an inquisitive eyebrow, then turns her gaze to the CCTV monitor on her desk. Sure enough, some merc - one with rugged facial features, she noted offhandedly - is gunning down bandits like there's no tomorrow. No doubt he's allied with the anti-Hyperion resistance. Aside from the Eridium train, nothing of value to Hyperion is in Lynchwood... so why would a lone Vault Hunter start shooting up her town?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Ooooh, I know <b>why</b> he's out here trying to get my attention,'</i> Nisha muses to herself with a grin, thoughts turning sinister and possessive. <i>'He obviously needs a woman who's loyal, unlike those <b>sluts</b> in Sanctuary.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how should Nisha go about making you hers?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The duel for the Regional Championship was about to come to a close. With less than a thousand life-points remaining on both sides, your 2400 Attack point Jinzo alone facing down your opponent Ali's Great Beast Angra Mainyu with his 2800 Attack points, you were running out of exits. Your trump card, Dark Magician, had already taken a swan dive early and your hand is full of spell cards that woulda came in real handy for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something deep down was telling you not to give up. Something deep down was telling you to wipe that prideful smirk off Ali's face. Despite losing your best cards, that spark of hope and willpower was still fighting strong. You didnt know what card you had left that could save you, but you put your faith in that spark (or as some refer to as 'The Heart of The Cards') and draw your next card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...WHAT?!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed down in disbelief at the card you just drawn. The Dark Magician Girl. A really really good card to pull right now. However, there's a slight issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dont own a Dark Magician Girl. You NEVER owned a Dark Magician Girl! None of your backup decks contained Dark Magician Girls let alone the customized one you brought to the championship! How did this one end up in your deck? Did somebody sneak it in? Is it against the rules to have an undisclosed card you dont even own slipped into your deck during the competition? You dont know whether you should feel more worried that you found a card you dont own in your deck or that you broke a rule having a card you dont own in your deck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother, what is taking so long?!\u201d Ali goaded you from the other side of the ring, \u201churry up, already! Are you ready to surrender and admit defeat or do you wish to provide Angra Mainyu with another sacrifice?\u201d<br>\r\nYou decide to question this anomaly later and get back to the duel.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Ali,\u201d you regain your confidence, \u201cI was just briefly stunned by the sheer beauty of the monster I'm about to summon to finish this duel!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBring him then!\u201d Ali demanded with pride, \u201che'll just be another stepping stone on my path of glorious conquest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not a 'him', Ali!\u201d you stated, \u201cI sacrifice my Jinzo to summon the Dark Magician Girl!\u201d<br>\r\nThe image of Jinzo on the VR grid vanishes and it's place appeared a glowing occultish seal as a feminine figure emerged from it. A blonde-haired woman in blue armor with a seal broach in the middle, wearing a blue Dark Magician helmet and a pink skirt, and brandishing a scepter capable of casting dark magic to destroy her enemies! She spun around and you nearly lost yourself in the twinkle in her sparkling emerald green eyes before snapping out of it just in time to plan your attack. The useless spell cards in your hand just became detrimental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, she certainly is a beauty, brother,\u201d Ali laughs, \u201cbut she still pales in comparison to a Great Beast!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, I aint done yet, 'brother'!\u201d you slap a spell card on the field, \u201cI activate Magician's Scepter. This gives DMG an extra 500 Attack Point boost and raises her level to 7. Combined that with the 300 AP boost with my Dark Magician in the graveyard and both our monsters are evenly matched\u2026 that is until I activate this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli's arrogant grin disappeared as soon as he saw you activate the trap Resonance of Power. Thanks to DMG now being level 7, she gains an extra 800 AP boost!<br>\r\n\u201cThat puts her at 3600 attack points. You know what that means, Ali? Show him what it means, Dark Magician Girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong surge of dark magical power enveloped her scepter and aimed it toward the great beast.<br>\r\n\u201cNOOOOO!!!\u201d Ali shouted in horror as his Angra Mainyu was caught in the explosion, leaving absolutely nothing behind in the smoke\u2026 and taking his remaining 800 life points with it! When the smoke finally cleared, the only things left in front of you in that ring were the Dark Magician Girl and the defeated Ali who had dropped to the floor lowering his head in utter shame. Geez, you didnt think he'd take losing THIS bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWINNER AND THIS YEAR'S REGIONAL CHAMPION: [Y/N]!\u201d<br>\r\nThe crowd went wild for you. It was a proud day for you. All your hard work and training had finally paid off. You never felt so proud of yourself your whole life! Who cares if you won with a card you dont technically own and was mysteriously slipped into your deck? YOU WON!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as you were beginning to savor your epic victory, something incredibly unusual happened. The Dark Magician Girl on the VR grid actually turned around and smiled at you. Then she clapped along with the audience for you! None of the duel monsters on the VR grid have EVER done something like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked with your jaw dropping in disbelief just before her image disappears.<br>\r\n\u201cD-D-DID YOU JUST SEE THAT?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSee what?\u201d Ali groaned as he walked off with his head hung low, \u201cmy dreams of restoring the Great Persian Empire dashed to pieces? Yes, brother. I saw it clear as day...\u201d What is his problem?!<br>\r\nWhatever it was, it wasnt as big as yours. The cheers from the audience seemed drowned out as you stared at your new Dark Magician Girl Card\u2026 who youre pretty sure wasnt winking in her portrait earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite winning the championship, the anomaly bugged you all the way back to your hotel room. You couldnt sleep in preparation for the celebratory party tomorrow cuz of all the newbound stressed you developed. You spent hours sitting at a desk reviewing your decks, trying to remember when you ever picked up a DMG, but no such luck. No recollection whatsoever. Just looking at the card was making you uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Duel Monster developers never made a winking Dark Magician Girl card as far as you know. Yet it's not fake, cuz the VR-grid wouldve detected counterfeits. Maybe it's a super rare card that was unreleased to the public? Even so, how did you manage to get your hands on it? Are you inadvertently breaking any laws just having it with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh...\u201d you moan in frustration, \u201cthis is hopeless. I gotta go to bed.\u201d You'll just have to ponder the magical mystery tomorrow. So after putting your decks away, brushing your teeth, and changing into your pjs, you shut off the light, hop into bed and close your eyes, too tired to even bother pulling the covers over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...As a shadowy figure pulls the covers over you.</span></div></div>",

Just talking to a male in the series is fine, but I don't want any Males to start stabbing everyone because they love you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">EDIT: GUYS ARE FINE ONLY  IF THEY'RE TRAPS</font> (Characters like Gasper from DxD are fine and dandy, but still no regular guys)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond Rule: You are a boy that has been raised in that world, what exactly you are is up to you, maybe a Nekoshou in the world of DxD or Garp's other son in One Piece. You could even make yourself one of the male characters in that universe, maybe even during the plot of the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird Rule: Multiple yandere is fine, but I'd prefer that the story not have torture scenes, etc. Maybe a couple of girls kidnapping you, drugging you, maybe even buying you from your parents if they're rich enough in the series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourth rule: I don't want choice chapters other than the picking of the girl. Which means Minimum of 300 words or your chapter will be deleted. I will inform you of this and maybe if I like how the chapter is, I'll edit it to be extended to the word limit, no trying to squeeze around this rule, I will be watching you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifth Rule: Use proper grammar and spelling. I will edit if the grammar issues aren't terrible, but I will delete chapters that talk like this<br>\r\n(Omgyour eadth rules UpToTiSi point ggoodo joobobo) That hurt me to write btw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSixth Rule: You may move onto other females, as long as they share the same fandom. I don't want Sakura from Naruto appearing in Highschool DxD. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeventh Rule: Have fun uploading and follow all the other rules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmail me if you need any clarification for a rule or need to check if your chapter is good enough by the rules of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill add more rules later if need be, make sure to re-read rules every time you enter a chapter in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story can include characters from cartoons, regular TV shows, anime or real life.
