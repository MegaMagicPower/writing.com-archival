Eliwood started smiling \"so maybe it was just a new spell that back-fired without her knowing...that's a relief!\" Eliwood started to walk out of his hiding place to think of ways to contact her when he heard her say, \"Huh? is that a bug?!\".  \"Oh shit!\" he dived back under the bed just as her purple boot stomped where he just was. \"Okay, that was not my greatest idea ever\" from up above Nino was scanning the room for the \"bug\". \"Where'd it go? i don't want Eliwood to come back to a bug in his room\". Eliwood saw her start moving again looking around the room the the \"bug\" that she just tried to stomp. \"Maybe i should just stay under the bed...no don't think that way Eliwood come on now! You have to find a way to contact her, cause obviously staying hidden is not the best option\" Eliwood decided his best options were to either climb up the bed to be closer to eye level with her or try the stupid way to wave his arms like mad and scream for her attention, but hey stupid ways may be stupid but they have a chance to work, right?</span></div></div>",

He has just narrowly avoided death from her foot and was now about to run out and try to get her attention. \"Maybe shell recognize me this time...or she'll just stomp me out of existence...you know this is sounding like a worse plan every second...oh well!\" Eliwood charged out from under the bed and started waving his arms like mad and screaming things like \"Nino!\" \"Down here!\" and \"Dont squish me!!\" but none of them seemed to reach her ears...well atlest from Eliwood perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino's POV ~<br>\r\nNino was still searching around for the bug when she thought she heard tiny screams \"Hmm what's that?\" she wondered as she looked around. Then she looked down and saw the bug standing there looking like it was trying to get her attention. \"So you saved me the trouble to look for you little buggie\". She walked over towards the bug and saw it running away. She just stepped forward a few steps and stomped the bug. She stomped a few more times just to be sure then deciding it was dead, left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliwood's POV ~<br>\r\nEliwood figured it was no use. Nino wouldn't hear he tiny screams and even if she did hear him she'd probably try to stomp him again. As soon as Eliwood was about to turn around he saw her look directly at him. \"She must have heard me!\" but then her heard her say \"So you saved me the trouble to look for you little buggie\". \"Oh i must have won an award for my stupid ideas by now\" Eliwood said as he started running at top speed away from her. After a little bit he felt he was making progress when he saw a shadow loom above him. He looked up and saw her boot heading towards him at an alarming rate. Eliwood tried to get away but the boot stomped right on him. He immediately noticed the stench, these were the same boots she wore all day so obviously they would but, the smell seemed intensified at his current size, Then came the other stomps. He saw the boot go down 2 more times before she finally stopped. Eliwood was coughing out blood at this point. \"How the hell am i not dead yet...\" Soon he would regret his body clinging on to life as she started to move out of the room.</span></div></div>",

The motion of her foot going up and down over and over again was sickening and every time her foot hit the ground Eliwood experienced a new level of the word PAIN. By the time she left the room he could feel the life draining from his body and he coulda sworn he heard some bones crack. \"Goddammit why won't i just die!\" Eliwood pleaded to die quickly so the pain would end but death just wouldnt come. Then she sprinted out of the castle. As this new motion brought more pain Eliwood threw up from motion sickness a few times. \"Must T-Try t-t-t-o get free\" he couldnt manage a single sentence without either studdering or coughing up blood. Eventually he seemed to just be a spot on the bottom of her boot until eventually she stopped moving. \"Is....Is it over?\" he noticed she was moving around but couldnt see what she was doing then he heard her say \"Ill set up camp here....it's still a little ways back to my house but im sure i can make it\" As Eliwood heard that he ounce again filled with hope of being found or atlest finding a way to contact her. Eventually she threw her boots off inside her tent and went to sleep. When Eliwood pried himself from her shoe he thought to himself \"Okay, i'm surprisingly less hurt then i thought....well i can atlest move without much pain so i must be still be in one piece\" Eliwood started walking towards the bed Nino was sleeping in but the pain in his legs suddenly flared and he fell down. \"Dammit i will not die after ive gotten so far!\" his will seemed to be the only thing pushing him forward. The pain is his legs got worse but he endured all the way to her sleeping body. \"Finally now i just need to get her attention without almost killing myself this time\". Eliwood ran towards her face, the easiest way he could contact her, but when he got there he was amazed by just how big it looked and he couldnt help but admiring her beauty since it seemed magnified. But he pushed those thoughts aside now then he decided he could either climb up her fact to her ear and get her attention that way OR he could try to find a safe place on her body to rest</span></div></div>",

He knew there would always complaints but he tried to have as few as possible, Especially since the rebuilding of Renais had taken this long to reclaim it's formy glory he wanted to make it greater than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his horse rode along the road he would notice the villagers would carry about their daily lives. Women would be watching children as they ran around with smiles on their faces, and the men would be plowing in their fields and if they noticed Ephraim they would wave and say things like \"How are you today king?\" or \"Look, it's King Ephraim!\" which he enjoyed rather well because it showed how far happiness had come in Renais.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just finished making his rounds when Ephraim saw something strange,he saw a strange light in a house which he hopped off his horse to investigate. <br>\r\n\"This light...Is somebody practicing magic here?\"  he thought to himself as he approached the door to the house.As Ephraim stepped towards the door, he heard the grass crunch from behind him.  Feeling the prescence of someone behind him. \"Who's there?\" he said in alarm as he spun around with his spear ready....but he saw no one. \"....Must've just been hearing things...\" then Ephraim felt a strange sensation. \"Ugh...I don't feel too well all of a sudden\" he decided to cast aside the light and began to walk back to his horse when he got hit in the back of the head with something hard and passed out. He awoke later to find himself in a strange room. He took this time to survey the surroundings. He appeared to be in a home, there was a kitchen in front of him some stairs leading to 3 seperate rooms to his right and to his left he saw a room with a coffee table and 2 couches, behind him was the door. He noticed something else however. The whole house seemed to be gigantic! The door itself seemed to rise like a colossus and the distance from him to the kitchen seemed to be 1,000 Miles. \"I'm in a very bad position right now...\" Ephraim said to himself. Then, he heard the door knob start turning and he ran to the nearest hiding place, which happened to be a closet he noticed was by the door.

Still working towards their own goals, they follow the future heroes of the continent to get the Sacred Stones and save the world from the Prince in Despair, Lyon.  Tonight is a night that followed after the gruelling battle for Renais' castle, though the castle has been taken back, the main army slept in their tents...ready for departure in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a celebration and promise towards the Rogue of Carcino, Tethys set up her tent to be very cozy, yet inviting.  As Tethys was lighting one of her scented candles, Rennac walked in.  He lightly pushes the curtain to let himself in and carefully closes it after he enters.  \"This is quite a night you've chosen to fulfill your promise, my fair dancer.  Are you ready to invigorate me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTethys turned to him and winked seductively, \"You insult me.  A dancer of Jehanna always keeps her word.~\"   As she steps onto a rug in the center of the tent, she signals Rennac to have a seat.  \"Please, enjoy the drink next to you that I've prepared and relax...\"  She begins to dance and a mysterious music plays from nowhere.  Rennac watches in a state of ecstasy, paying attention to Tethys's features.  Her large soft breasts, her equally large and soft butt, her rosy red lips concealed by a veil, even her small delicate feet.   The excitement he experiences does leave him a bit thirsty.  He reaches for the prepared drink next to him and drinks from it.  He continues to watch and begins to feel dizzy.  In an echoing voice Tethys says to her viewer \"You've chosen to drink I see.~   Very good.  Now I will make sure that you'll get the reward you truly deserve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRennac slowly tries to stay awake. \"This...This drink...what did you--\"  Without another word, Rennac passes out.  Tethys walks up to him and kisses him on the forehead.  \"I hope you enjoy your reward, handsome.~\"  From outside the tent, a young female's voice is heard.  \"So, have you gotten what you desire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTethys turns to the curtain where the voice comes from.  \"Yes, everything went according to plan, you truly are the prodigy you claim to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLute walks into the tent.  \"And you expected otherwise?  I AM the best you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTethys giggles and nods her head.  \"Indeed you are.  Now...about this perv.~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may,\" Lute answers, \"I have an idea of the kind of 'Reward' he deserves...but it won't be death, we still need him in our future missions\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So be it.  Just make sure he learns not to harass me for my dances again...\"  With this, Tethys walks off.  Lute's shadow looms over him as she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Rennac awakens, but covered by a cloth of some sort.  They feel very light and seem to have a little bow on it.  He crawls out of the cloth to see that he's sleeping in a large pair of panties...outside he realizes that everything is large.  He hears someone coming and he hides back inside the panties.  Who's tent is he stuck in?  Who's panties are these?</span></div></div>",

Are you implying I'm old?\" Tharja hissed and Robin raised his hands defensively. \"No quite the opposite, I may not remember much but I'm only seventeen.\" \"Seventeen?\" \"Yeah why do you think I'm so short and young looking?\" \"Genetics?\" \"Well that's part of the reason but I guess I can take advantage of spending time with a sexy giantess, so what do you want to do?\" Robin asked with a little bit of confidence</span></div></div>",

Tharja asked, curious as to whether to bring her tiny love to them or not (probably not) ''I don't know, father just asked me in passing to find him, and I assumed you'd know where he is as usual. Apparently not'' Lucina then turned and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What's her problem?'' Robin asks as he peeks out of Tharja's cleavage ''Beats me, maybe she has a crush on you. Or maybe she just hates our kids'' Tharja answers, before her eyes bulge and she turns beet red ''Sorry about that, that was blunt and forward even for me'' ''It's okay Tharja, I know what you mean Lucina's from the future so she knows us from the future, such as any kids we eventually have. It might also explain why she always looked at me weird, she didn't know I was normal sized at anytime as I was probably this size in the future'' Tharja blinks in surprise ''You mean you want to stay this size?'' ''Honestly I kind of do, at first it was rather intimidating, particularly how huge you are, but I'm starting to get used to it, particularly those soft breasts of yours I feel so safe snuggling up to them'' Tharja grins ''Oh you're such a sweet talker, no wonder I'm keeping you forever'' Robin smiled and nuzzled her chest happily, both moan as Tharja squeezes her breasts around his tiny body . ''So what you want to do little cutie?'' Tharja asks as she sits on her bed, Robin is silent for a few minutes while he thinks about his options before answering...</span></div></div>",

Tharja laughed ''Well I was thinking boyfriend but if you prefer plaything...'' ''No, boyfriend is fine, great actually'' Robin stuttered as his face turned bright red. Robin was surprised, he was sure when Tharja shrunk him it was to be her little pleasure toy, something to be hidden away until she felt the need before being crushed against her huge tits, soft rear or even in... Robin blushed harder and tries to burrow himself further into her cleavage... but to think she wants him as a boyfriend, him timid little Robin, the boy with no past, it makes his heart soar that such a beautiful woman could desire him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Tharja?'' ''Yes love'' ''Seeing as you've claimed me as your boyfriend, can I give you a kiss?'' Robin's answer came in the form of a squee, as Tharja's overjoyed he's come around so quickly (she was sure she needed another day and more boob squishing before he was actually participating) and plucked him from her cleavage and brought him up to her face. ''Well here I am lover'' she singsonged with a smile, Robin smiling too as he stepped close enough to her mouth to put a hand on each side before kissing her pouty lips. Tharja held herself still, letting her little man have his fun until she felt him lick her upper lip, after which she internally smirked and parted her lips just as she jostled Robin so he fell 'into' her mouth, shutting it behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was happily losing himself in the pleasure of kissing the goddess before him, Tharja tasting like a treat he would want forever when the 'wall' in front of him gave way and he plopped into dark and wet. ''Tharja!'' Robin yelled before he found himself being bounced around rather violently, her tongue flipping him from one side of her mouth to the other like some hard candy she'd stolen from Gaius. Once she was a little less crazy about it Robin actually started to enjoy it, covered in her saliva and being swirled around inside her mouth. The only slight problem was that her mouth was filling up as she wasn't swallowing, which in of itself was a good thing as Robin didn't want to find out if he was digestible or not yet (Spoiler: he would be just fine). Once the 'water' level rose beyond what he could swim in he began to yell for help, hoping Tharja would here him over her own near orgasmic moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja was in heaven, Robin had such a sweet taste with the slight tang that usually filled the air around magic users, the perfect taste in the dark mage's opinion. She was moaned and groaned as he was swirled around in her mouth, enjoying the feeling of him against her tongue and the roof of her mouth, until she heard him calling to be let out. She pouted but also thought back to what Robin intially thought was her reason for shrinking him: if he was her plaything she'd have no reason to care, in fact she could use this moment to remind him he still exists because he's hers and she decides his fate from now on. Hell she could just swallow him, remind him of just who owns him by making him spend the night in her belly, her hands subconsciously rubbing her flat stomach. But no, that wasn't her reason, she shrunk him because she loved him and wanted him to be hers, she didn't want him to be hurt, Grima be damned she used the potion that made the target invulnerable just to be sure, not just because of all the things she'd like to do to him that under normal circumstances would probably kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight frown, Tharja tilts her head down and spits Robin out, the tactician falling and bouncing slightly when he reached the ground. When his vision returns he notices he's between Tharja's pale feet, the woman herself standing directly over him with her hands on her hips, grinning cheekily as she licks her lips of what remains of Robin's flavour ''Oh dearie, you feel so good, I'm never letting you go, ever'' Tharja moans, her long fingers ghosting over her breasts</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a week since Robin had been shrunk and him &amp; Tharja had gotten together, during that time they had found a couple of people from Lucina's time, including Nowi's daughter who was nothing like her, and Sully's daughter who was Lucina's best friend and exactly like her mother minus being able to ride a horse. The sheer scale worried Tharja as she worried about her own future kids (Lucina admitted that Robin was right, she hadn't known he had originally been normal size, and that she was wrong in that Falchion's wielder did get on well with their kids, she just didn't like her and Robin's sister for being Grimleal. Good news, Robin found out he has a sister) were they like her or Robin? Did they get along in the future? Were they as messed up as she was? (In a word, kinda)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were passing by a field that unbeknownst to them was frequented by kidnappers and slavers when they heard screaming and explosions ''Everyone move!'' Chrom yells and they Shepherds do as asked, Tharja like the other magic users sticking to the middle of the group (as in behind the guys with big shields but in front of the archers) as they entered the fray... to find one person picking off all these bad people with what looked to be quite an old, poor quality bow. All they could make out was that she was a busty female, the purple hood obscuring the top of her head. They did notice though that the braces on her wrists glowed before each shot, Tharja practically tasting the magic they were pumping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>''You people irritate me, NOW YOU DIE!''</b> the hooded archer smirked with pointed teeth as ash/smoke condensed into an arrow and she fired it, striking a Berserker and causing the body to incinerate. Tharja was shocked and awed to see such powerful magic, especially as it looked to be used quite casually, this one was defiantly theirs. The woman had taken down 3 fliers in the time it took Tharja to get to her, not that any of the others in their group were going to approach her (Cowards). Luckily the rest of the enemies were staying away from her too, giving them some space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hello'' Tharja greeted trying not to sound as worried as she felt. The archer's head tilted silently in her direction at a speed that should've caused an audible crack, then stared as though judging her soul. Apparently she somehow passed (or she noticed Robin hidden in her cleavage as per usual) as she smiled and pushed back her hood revealing her large dark eyes and shock of white hair (yep definitely Robin's kid). ''Hello mother'' she returned then twitched as though uncomfortable ''Mom's here?'' Tharja heard the squeak, it couldn't be but it was, there was a little black haired boy nestled in her daughter's massive cleavage ''Hi mom, nice to see you safe and sound, is dad around? Or is he somewhere safe due to his size?'' Tharja blushed slightly and pointed to her breasts, ideally wondering why it was taking Robin so long... opps. ''One moment please'' Tharja actually held up one long finger before sticking her hands into her outfit to save Robin from being trapped between her bra and her under boob. ''And here we are, daddy all safe and sound. Robin meet your kids'' Tharja put her hands out so the 2 of them could see Robin and her could see them ''I think they have a better system going'' Robin joked ''well we should I've been doing this since I first got tits'' the woman rolled her eyes, barely reacting when the boy slapped her breast and told her to be nice ''Tell Lilith to stay out of this'' he hissed, peaking both parents interest. ''Lilith?'' Robin asks ''Morgan named the darkness inside me, she sometimes comes out and he's the only one safe from her'' Noire answers, looking at the floor as she shuffles her feet ''And Morgan is the name of the little boy nestled in your cleavage'' Tharja stated, not need to get an answer ''Are we going to get your name as well, your actual name?'' her white haired daughter actually smirked ''Noire mother, Noire Necrophage'' she seemed to enjoy the look of surprise and almost horror on her mother's face. She then burst out laughing ''Oh Grima that was brilliant, don't worry mother I've never actually used that name, daddy practically disowned himself the last time he met grandfather'' ''Oh thank Grima, please don't scare me like that again'' Tharja scolded, her free hand over her heart ''What's wrong love?'' Robin asked worried ''Nothing dear, just a name from Plegia that shouldn't be messed with'' Tharja answered, not telling him it was the name given to those with Grima's blood in their veins, people with near limitless power  who because of this, were sot after either to worship or to kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Later</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So it's just the 2 of you?'' Tharja asked on the way back to camp ''No, there's one more, my little sister, the middle child, Morrigan'' ''Oh'' ''She's a dark mage like you mother, she wants to make you proud like Morgan wants to make dad proud'' ''and you?'' Noire blushes ''I want to be known as more than Gri.... your and father's daughter'' she answered, hoping Tharja didn't notice her slip, now was not the time to deviate from the plan, especially not without Morrigan around. Tharja was confused but shrugged ''You're the eldest kid, you're the one who'll set records the other 2 will have to try match or top. You don't have to be so hard on yourself'' Noire nods and hugs her, surprising them both ''Thank you mother, you have no idea how much that meant to me'' Tharja blushes but returns the hug. When they release ''So, where will Morgan be staying?'' ''Well he usually stays in my cleavage at night, but if you'd prefer to take him...'' ''No, it's fine, besides it'll give us another day at least to get used to this'' Tharja waved her off knowing she was going to offer to go alone, something she knew would probably hurt the girl, in a similar way not being around Robin hurts her ''Goodnight mother'' ''Goodnight Noire'' Tharja said removing Morgan from between her breasts (he had been having some private time with Robin, like how Noire and Tharja were having out here) and returning him to her ''I know I don't need to tell you to keep him safe but humour me. Keep your brother safe'' Noire grins and nods, before letting Morgan crawl between her breasts.<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Robin asked nervously, clinging to his daughter's shirt fearfully as usually he'd be a safe passenger between Tharja's breasts and while the two are about the same size (Noire possibly even a little bigger) her being his daughter made things awkward ''Papa, dad, Robin whatever you want me to call you, don't panic. I've had a younger tiny between my boobs before'' Noire smiled as she tried to reassure him, which had the opposite effect ''How many people have seen these?'' which surprisingly caused Noire to laugh ''Just Morgan, I was actually referring to the fact that I'm older than you'' Robin blinked and tried to form words, but all he could produce was ''What?'' ''Yeah, I'm nearly 19 and I know you were/are 17 when you and Mother got together and had me'' she grins and Robin groans and blushes; he knew that expression Tharja used it all the time, she knew his thoughts on older women and damn she was nearly identical to her mother, the white hair the only thing that was his. He clung to that thought as he buried his face in her throat ''You still didn't answer my question'' he said trying to steer the conversation back from crazy town, as well as praying Morrigan wasn't like this ''Well I like to practice my skills, research new ways to utilize my magic and <b>I'd like to keep Morgan smothered between my massive tits but the little scamp has to eat sometimes</b>'' she answered, Robin noting the hardened edge in her voice as she neared the end. ''Noire?'' he called, shuffling to her shoulder so the woman could look at him; it was the he noticed blackness forming and  growing from the edge of her eyes, as well as her finger nails lengthening into talon like claws (basically her magic is causing there to be a physical distinction between Noire and Lilith being the dominant personality). ''Hey kid? Robin called, then he noticed where she was looking, Tharja &amp; Morgan were standing over with Lucina and the girl was gushing over the kid... oh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry papa'' Noire says which confused Robin until he was picked off her shoulder and very skilfully flung directly into Tharja's cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Tharja &amp; Morgan</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So what do you want to do kid?'' ''I want to be the best tactician, even better than dad'' Morgan answered, Tharja laughing slightly as she pets his head ''Well if that's what you want I hope you succeed'' she said. ''Morgan!'' Tharja looks up as she sees Lucina running towards her, a wide grin after seeing the black haired tactician nestled in her cleavage ''Hey Luci, um mom can I?'' Morgan raises his hand in a symbol for getting out which she does, removing him from her breasts and placing him on her shoulder. Well until Lucina grabs him and kisses his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh my precious little shota'' Lucina gushed rubbing Morgan against her cheek, until he was ripped away from her.

Morgan yelled from his sister's other hand, though the girl seemed to ignore him ''Come on Noire make her stop'' Noire's head tilted to the side as though curious before releasing her grip. Morgan was brought up to her face staring into those black eyes with deep purple iris <b>''You will stay with me'' </b>she hissed and lowered him up to his neck in her cleavage <b>''I think it's time for some fun'' </b>she smirked and placed a hand on each tit, squeezing them together before rubbing them up and down, eyes rolled back in their sockets as she feels Morgan being squished between her breasts. ''Stop it you'll hurt him'' Lucina yells and Noire blinks, releasing her hold and letting all of them hear Morgan's giggling ''Don't worry Luci, Noire and Lilith would never hurt me'' Morgan tried to comfort his friend but Lilith wasn't exactly making it easy <b>''If I  could grow to giant size you would be the first person I killed, you'd be nothing but a bloody smear on my massive tits. Run along girly, the only reason I've not already killed you is because Morgan seems to like you and I don't like it when he's unhappy'' </b>she sneers at the woman who makes a break from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith smiles before beginning to moan rather erotically, which continues for a few minutes before she nearly falls to her knees if not for Tharja grabbing her. Blinking tiredly Tharja notices her much brighter eyes and gentler smile as she gets up, once again squeezing her breasts together but this time to get Morgan to pop up like a diglett ''Thanks for the reset brother'' she grins and kisses him, his entire head finding it's way into her mouth. ''Can someone explain what just happened?'' Robin asked, having been found and removed from Tharja's cleavage by the woman during Lilith's attempt to traumatise Lucina ''Morgan found there to be several points on my body that would be able to get Lilith to become distracted enough for me to take back control from her and beat her back into her box'' Noire explained, now rubbing Morgan's head who was purring like a cat. ''I have no words'' Robin says with wide eyes ''And all these pressure points are on your boobs?'' ''No, just some of the pleasure ones, pain points are found at the base of my ribs on my back but Morgan doesn't like to use those as they hurt me and Lilith and he doesn't like his sisters being in pain?'' ''He sees you as his sisters?'' ''No, he sees Lilith as a part of me, I meant myself and Morrigan when I said sisters'' ''Oh''<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

A girl who isn't in the family goes near Morgan.\" Noire admits blushing at the last part. \"So she's like me with you.\" Tharja said teasing her husband. \"So what are we supposed to do besides stand around like idiots if Lilith comes out?\" Robin asked ignoring the comment from his wife. \"Hm I guess you could drag me off and throw me in a room alone with Morgan as he is 100% garunteed to survive Lilith. \"Why is that?\" Tharja asked curious. \"Well Lilith is a bit obsessed with Morgan as he doesn't really freak out when she comes out, also I guess Morgan is just to darn cute for Lilith to hurt him as well she is really protective of him. But I don't blame her for being obsessed with Morgan, he's just so cute and wonderful, he knows how to please me, he has such soft skin, oh is just the perfect little boy and if I wasn't his sister I'd probably want to **** his small little body.\" Noire then blushed at what she just said while she was going on about her brother. \"Please tell me Morgan didn't hear that.\" Noire asked to her wide eyed father and grinning mother. \"Huh, did I fall asleep again? Sorry it's just so comfortable and warm down here I just couldn't keep my eyes open.\" Morgan apologized. \"Oh thank goodness.\" Noire said wiping her brow. \"Thank goodness what sis?\" Morgan asked. \"Uh don't worry about, oh I realized you didn't get enough time with mom since Lucina appeared, so bye!\" Noire said quickly grabbing her father and dropping her brother into her mother's cleavage and noire quickly ran out. \"What just happened?\" Morgan asked. \"Don't worry about baby, just cuddle up to momma.\" Tharja said grinning.</span></div></div>",

''Well she's definitely takes after me'' ''and Aunt V'' Morrigan adds with a smirk ''Who?'' ''Dad's sister, she's the one who assisted you in training me in dark magic, especially as V said dad had problems with dark magic since his amnesia'' Robin nodded in understanding ''Note to self: find sister and years later leave middle child's magical training to wife and sister'' ''Pretty much'' Noire and Morrigan nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Back in camp</u> (If anyone's wondering Morgan slept through the reunion and is now spending time with Robin and Tharja)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Morrigan!''

''We don't interfere, if they succeed we can enjoy it like the rest of them, but if they fail, well at least you'll  be able to use that training, heir of the world'' Morrigan smirked, her blood red eyes sparkling and Noire rolled her eyes ''Har, har Morgana, but just remember, I'm still in charge of this'' she hissed, eyes flashing purple ''Crystal clear, Silence''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens next?</span></div></div>",

Morgan breathed in and out it was now one of those few moments he had alone to practice. Morgan quickly raised his hand in the air causing several lightning bolts to strike around him in a perfect circle, he then used wind magic to propel himself in the air, then turned around and extended his palm using arcfire to quickly bring him back down to earth. \"The grand finale.\" Morgan said and he focused all of his dark magic within him, which wasn't that much and fired a ball of dark magic diagonally with his right hand then swiftly brought down his left causing a lighting bolt to go through it creating dark lighting and causing a black shockwave to appear once it hit the ground. Since Morgan lacked capability of using dark magic on its own he would combine it with regular magic, healthy, not really, powerful, definitely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid nice moves.\" \"Sans! What did I tell you about sneaking up on me like that? Anyway how's it going with the other Morgan?\" Sans was the same size as Morgan when he visits as to level to the playing field. \"Oh it's going great, it was easy to get to his timeline but to bring him here will take a while as it takes lots of power for being to go into another timeline within their own universe which is why we have the dimensional drill, anyway he's bringing judgment, sever, and his worlds falchion with him. But why do we need him again?\" Sans asked. \"Well this Morgan has both Grima and Naga's blood which will allow him to preform the awakening to get exalted falchion then he could combine it with sever and judgement to form the legendary true falchion, then once we get to Grima we have that Morgan use the three orbs to go into grandmaster of death form (Morgan still looks the same he just has O.P godlike powers.) then with the power of grandmaster of death and true falchion the final blow will be powerful enough to destroy Grima in every timeline including in the timelines that haven't even been created yet.\" Morgan explained. \"You know kid that destroying a being in every timeline even if it isn't a major one could have some drastic effects, and with this being in particular being Grima I can't imagine what would happen.\" Sans said. \"Don't worry about it, besides its only going to take away grim as blood in anyone who has it, besides its worth it infinite life's will be saved, and we won't have to suffer anymore.\" Morgan said. \"Okay I'm going back to check on how far the drill has gone.\" Sans said, \"Also are you sure you don't want to take up another name, some people do it in plans like these.\" Sans said. \"No I'm proud of my name, although...\" Morgan paused for a second. \"Probaly once the other Morgan gets here you can call me <b>Calibri</b> to avoid confusions then call me Morgan once the other guy goes back to his world.\" Morgan said. \"Okay I'm off.\" Sans said and he left. Morgan's parents and sisters came back into the tent. \"Sorry we left you alone baby, we finished what we needed to do so all five of us can do some family bonding.\" Tharja said picking up her son. \"YAY!\" Morgan said cheerfully, his cheerfulness was real, Morgan was a naturally a cheerful and optimistic boy but knew when to dile it down when it came to his plan; <b>Operation Genocide</b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

''So what did you want to discuss with me?'' Robin asked as he paced Lucina's desk, the future exalt watching him closely as she removed a small dagger from her armour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina stabbed the knife into the table pinning Robin to it by his coat ''Lucina what the Hell?'' Robin yelled ''This needs to be done, you are the reason Chrom is dead and the world is destroyed, therefore you must be killed for the greater good'' Lucina answered drawing parallel Falchion ''I know the magic used on you makes you pretty durable, but Falchion is a blade forged by Naga herself so your miniscule curse is nothing to it'' she raises the sword above her head, ready to strike ''This is how it must.. .AHH!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina screamed as 2 arrows hit her, the one to her right making her drop Falchion, while the other pinned her left hand to the table. Gritting her teeth she manages to hold back just enough pain to be functional... until she feels the burning sensation to the back of her neck (As well as the smell of burning, which is expected when you shove a red hot arrow through hair). ''You try to hurt father again, our leader or not I will send an arrow through that obnoxiously thick, Ylsian skull of yours and take control of the time travel party'' Noire hissed from just behind her, mildly amused when she sees Lucina's pained twitching. Lucina knew she had no control over her spasms of the pain, Noire's black arrows had a ring of decay curse built in, she was feeling her flesh within a 3 inch radius of the arrow being eaten away by Noire's dark magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>''What's going on here?'' </b>Both Lucina and Noire groan when they hear the shrill yell of Cynthia as she spies them from the open tent flap, her yells also drawing others, namely Morrigan (&amp; Morgan), Tharja, Sumia and Chrom. ''Step away from my sister'' the wannabe hero demands, Noire snorts in amusement as well as disbelief that the Pegasus knight believes she's threatened by her. ''You try anything and you'll bleed out quicker than it would take for you to realise you've been injured ''Morrigan hissed, doing a much better job of intimidating as mother and daughter took a few steps away from the dark mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Let's try this again'' Tharja began, having unpinned her husband and slid him into the safety of her bosom ''Lucina here thought it was a bright idea to kill father, which among other things would cause irreparable damage to the timeline due to almost all of us here being wiped from existence'' ''But wouldn't altering the timeline do that anyway?'' Sumia asked, like most confused by time travel and it's many rules ''We're protected from most paradox consequences, such as if Lucina was to touch her younger self she wouldn't explode. But nothing can protect you from the time shock of never existing in the first place'' Noire answered, having the most knowledge as the one to suggest time travel in the first place (Lucina liked to claim Naga did it, but Noire and a few others saw Naga as simply an annoying, overgrown magical battery). ''Lucina!'' Chrom and Sumia scolded, finding their anger now they weren't busy being very confused ''You should know Robin has my complete trust'' ''But he is the avatar of Grima, and besides didn't you see what Validar was able to make him do? He stole the Fire Emblem, he could just as easily be made kill you'' Lucina yelled, trying to get her point across as quickly as they could both so this could be over and also so she could get her hands fixed before the rot becomes permanent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No Lucina, we're not bound by fate, we can make a difference or else there was no point in you traveling through time to try change the past'' Lucina winced knowing how badly she's disappointed her one role model ''Noire, pull back a little'' the white haired girl raised an eyebrow ''I don't want Lucina to die just because she won't look me in the eye'' Tharja hissed, Morrigan rolled her eyes but pulled the elder girl away. Lucina then had her head tilted to stare into the witch's dark eyes ''Listen here Lucina, if you ever try this again I won't kill you quickly, despite all the anger held within her Noire didn't want Morgan to be sad so would've killed you quickly and relatively painlessly. I on the other hand will make you suffer for days before actually killing you'' Lucina paled as she could see in her eyes that the Plegian was serious ''Are we clear?'' nod ''Good'' Tharja smiled and slapped Lucina's cheeks, before sheparding her daughters out of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sadly for him he ran out of people run around and he was soon scooped up brought to a familiar face. \"Looks I win again baby bro.\" It was Morgan's older sister Lucina who stood at a whopping 100 feet tall. Now you might be thinking how in the freaking world could these two be related? Well you see Robin, Lucina and Morgan's mother, is plegian and plegian women are born giant the more powerful they are the bigger, now don't get me wrong age and genetics still calculate height with Robin being 125 feet tall. \"Darn it, I thought going through crowds would make you slow down allowing me to win, but nope you win again, like always.\" Morgan pouted playfully. \"Cmon little bro, let's get to our tent.\" Lucina said walking their tent which was big enough to fit Lucina (since plegia has giant women they make giant everything.) Now Morgan and Lucina did things toghether like normal siblings, they hung out, played games, got into trouble but they did things normal siblings didn't do such as sleep toghether (not in a sexual way) and Lucina would sometimes keep Morgan inside her stomach because plegian women are physically incapable of digesting loved ones. Also Lucina liked to tease Morgan with their height difference, speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucina, can I please come out now?\" Morgan asked from the inside of his sister's stomach. \"I don't know, can you?\" Lucina asked playfully and Morgan sighed \"okay may I come out?\" \"Nope!\" Lucina said cheerfully patting her stomach. \"You feel great in there.\" \"Cmon Luce, remember the rule mom made, if you eat  me and I'm not willing you can only keep me in here for a total of a half hour unless if I say I want to stay longer or if it's bed time and it's been 45 minutes and it's only 4 in the afternoon.\" Morgan complained. Luckily for Morgan their mother and father walked in (with Chrom standing on his wife's shoulder). \"Lucina let out your brother right now or your grounded.\" Chrom threatened and Lucina just smirked. \"Ground me from what? If you take away falchion I could still easily fight (falchion was able to change to fit Lucina because of it being a magic weapon) and if you prevent me from fighting it just gives me more free time.\" Chrom looked defeated and said \"I swear ever since we found Morgan Lucina has been acting a lot more sassy.\" Luckily Robin had a secret weapon. \"If you don't spit out you brother you'll be grounded from Morgan.\" Lucina's eyes widened. \"You can't do that, where would Morgan even sleep?\" \"With me, and if you don't spit out Morgan right now I'll give you the Heimlich and you won't be able to go near, talk to or even look at Morgan.\" Lucina's eyes widened and she gagged and spat out Morgan onto her bed. After Morgan got wiped off Robin said. \"Morgan can you be a dear and go into town and go buy some food we seem to be running low.\" \"Sure mom.\" Morgan then went off to go get the wagon used to pull food. Lucina was going to follow but Robin cut her off. \" You can't go into town with your size Luci, but just closely follow behind and only allow yourself to be know if Morgan is in danger okay?\" Lucina nodded in understanding and followed rather stealthily for a hundred foot tall woman.

A little runt pulling a ton of food around, surely you aren't gonna eat it all yourself.\" An older boy said walking up with four boys. \"Of course, not the food is for my mother and everyone else at camp.\" The ten year old boy said cheerfully. \"Wow with that much food that means that you have a lot of people at camp, or..\" The leader of the older boys said smirking. \"Your mom is obese\". \"Yah no wonder why he's so scrawny and runty cuz his ma keeps all the food away.\" One of the older boys said laughing and Morgan frowned. \"My moms not fat, she just has a really big appetite, now excuse me so I can get back to camp.\" Morgan said calmly walking past the group until he was pushed back. \"Surely your little camp doesn't need all this food and your mom can lose some pounds so allow us to lighten your load.\" The leader said reaching for a banana but Morgan slapped his hand away. \"I payed for this food, and make all the fat jokes you want but my mother is infinitely times prettier than all of your moms combined.\" Morgan said frowning and he was then shoved to the ground. \"Are implying that our moms are ugly?\" One of the other boys said. \"No I'm just saying my mom is much, much, much, much, much, much more prettier than your moms.\" Morgan said. \"Oh you little runt you gonna regret your words.\" The leader said and all the boys started kicking Morgan as he was lying on the ground. \"HEY!\" The boys looked up and saw a 100 foot tall blue haired woman looking down at them. \"How dare, you think you boys can just walk up and insult and attack my little brother like that?\" Lucina said scowling. \"Wait your his sister?\" The leader asked weakly. \"Yep and you know what happens to people who mess with my baby brother?\" Lucina asked. \"They go very far away.\" Lucina said slowly and she picked up all the boys who were attacking Morgan and threw them as far as she could. \"I'm sorry!\" The leader said as he went flying out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They didn't break anything right Morgan?\" Lucina asked worried. \"No, they insulted mother and kicked me a lot.\" Morgan said lying on the ground. \"Thanks for saving me Lucina.\" Morgan said. \"Well it's my job as an older sister to protect you, now come lets get back to camp.\" Lucina said gently sliding her ten year old brother into her cleavage. She grabbed the food wagon and slowly walked back to camp as not too her her brother or drop any food.</span></div></div>",

The white bang in her face told her all she needed to know; it was Noire (if anyone's wondering how you sneak up on a giantess, it's simply by being stealthier) ''We're back!'' Noire squealed happily, before letting go of the bluenette and Lucina sighed, the 3 dark mages had been in Plegia to ensure the Grimleal were behaving and not trying to resurrect the 600 foot Grima (again) ''Great, and you're here because'' ''Well after dealing with the boys...'' even Lucina smirked at the comment, due to the size difference males were usually referred to as boys by Plegian women, mostly affectionately or jokingly ''...mom and Aunt Versa said we should come and see you all, and look I managed to get the magic down right. Please let me show you, please, please,please'' Noire was a dark mage like both her parents (Hi Henry... bye Henry) the reason anyone thought she was a sniper was due to how she used her magic; the energy was released as a beam that pierced it's target, rather than an energy ball that exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina rolled her eyes as Morgan popped out of her cleavage ''Come on Luci I want to see Noire's new trick'' Morgan pouted up at her, his slightly bruised face making his puppy dog pout stronger (as in he's literally a kicked puppy) ''Fine show us what you've done'' ''Yay!'' both Morgan and Noire cheered, the latter hugging Lucina again, pressing her larger frame and breasts against the royal siblings. Noire then stepped away giving her 110 ft form some space before extending her index finger above their heads. A deep crimson magic began to gather at the tip, forming a ball of magical energy that she then released producing a beam of fire magic about the size of Morgan in diameter. ''Grima's bouncy tits, Noire you could've hit us'' Noire just shrugged ''No I couldn't, I aimed up'' Noire despite her usually meek nature did on occasion like to bring up the fact she was taller when she had any good opportunities, sometimes just because it irritated Lucina. ''So now you're finished trying to kill us, can we just go home with the food?'' ''Okay!'' Noire chirped and linked arms with the bluenette who shrugged her off and walked off with the food.</span></div></div>",

SO I MAY CRUSHING THEIR PITIFUL BODIES UNDER MY FEET OR I CAN REDUCE THEM TO MERE FOOD FOR MY STOMCH!\" Noire shouted her ballistic side appearing and while Morgan cowered in Lucina's cleavage Lucina herself smirked. \"Oh I just threw them far, far away.\" \"Okay that's good.\" Noire said going back to normal, then her eyes lit up. \"Wait this is the perfect time to show off a new skill I learned while I was gone.\" \"What is it?\" Lucina asked. \"Well you know how we're incapable of digesting loved ones?\" Noire asked and Lucina nodded happily remembering all the times she kept Morgan all snuggled up in her stomach. \"Well I learned to make it so that when a loved one is inside my stomach I could have the acids heal the person like a healing staff but more cozy.\" Noire said with a grin. \"Okay sure you could try this out.\" Lucina said and Noire squealed and plucked Morgan from Lucina's cleavage. Noire placed Morgan in her mouth and started swishing him around and moaning. \"Oh how I've missed your delicious taste Morgan, so nice and sweet just like your personality.\" Noire than swallowed the boy and patted her stomach when she felt Morgan land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weee! Oof.\" Morgan said as fell. \"Hi Morgan how's it going.\" A familiar voice said. \"Henry? Is that you? What are you doing in here? How are you here without noire knowing? Why are you in here?\" Morgan asked. \"Up its me Henry, you friendly neoghborhood dark Mage. Anyway I got here because I snuck into Noire's sandwich when she got here. Im here because I'm escaping Tharja, because the longer she goes without making love the rougher she is when she gets back to doing it.\" \"Also the reason why noire doesn't know I'm here is because of MAGIC!\" Henry explained doing jazz hands when he said magic. \"Ooh, Noire's new trick is working, sure it isn't bloody and violent but it's still neat.\" Henry said noticing that Morgan's wounds are healing. \"Wow your right ,well, I better get to work.\" Morgan said and he started rubbing Noire's stomach walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh yes Morgan's rubbing my stomach walls, Lucina I'm jealous your little brother has hands like an angel, he makes a amazing masseure, I wish I had a little brother that I could cuddle up and eat.\" Noire said pouting and then started moaning in pleasure again. \"Yeah I know Morgan's amazing,  maybe when we get back  you could ask her for a brother or two or twenty.\" Lucina said joking (Tharja only recently has give birth to little noire). \"Yeah that would be amazing twenty little boys rubbing my body all for myself maybe I could bring that up to mom.\" Noire said continuing rubbing her stomach. (Fun fact it's impossible for a male plegian to have a younger sister because there is some genetic trait where once a female plegian gives birth to a male child they are incapable of having any female children  afterwards luckily the percentage of a female plegian's first child to be female is 90% while the possibility of the first child be male is 10%)</span></div></div>",

The duo headed towards the tents set up for the Plegians where the giantesses would definitely be. ''We're back'' Lucina called as she entered the tent ''... he can't just disappear, I have needs too'' ''And we're going again'' Noire meeped, both girls getting the tail end of Tharja/Aversa/Robin's conversation and very glad it was only that ''Oh hey girls'' Robin greeted, hugging first her daughter then her best friend's kid. ''You got the food, but where's Morgan?'' Noire blushed ''There were some assholes who hurt Morgan, so Noire is using her newest trick to heal him inside her stomach'' Lucina answered ''Oh. Well will he be coming out anytime soon?'' Robin asked, absentmindedly petting Noire's flat stomach. Noire shrugged ''I don't see why not, this was the first time I did it properly'' she answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoire sticks her long fingers down her throat, gagging slightly before coughing up Morgan..... and Henry. ''Papa?'' Noire blinked once she'd wiped the tears from her eyes ''you little baka'' Tharja angrily growled ''hiding from me inside our daughter'' ''Um hi dearie, what I miss?'' Henry asked trying not to look her in the eye ''You didn't miss anything, see you guys later We'll be back in a few hours'' Tharja waved to the girls as a pale Henry was carried out of the tent. ''Let's not talk about that'' Aversa stated, everyone nodded quickly in agreement. ''Come on Morgan, we need to get you cleaned off'' Robin said picking him up and carrying him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Mom, that tickles'' Morgan peeped as Robin sudded him up, and cleaned him off, making sure Noire's stomach juices were washed off. ''Sorry baby, don't worry we're nearly done'' Robin giggled as she towelled him off, before sliding him into her cleavage ''Time to see how the others are doing'' she said and returned to the others. ''Morgan you're back'' Lucina yelled as she plucked him from Robin and cuddled him against her bosom. ''Hey no fair, you can't hog him all to yourself'' Noire complained, sliding over to Lucina, squishing Morgan between both busty girls. ''Oh remember when we used to fight over boys like that?'' Aversa giggled while Robin just looked at her with raised eyebrows ''Oh wait that was a flat chested girl, still she was cute for a Ylssian'' Robin rolled her eyes before separating the girls and reaching for her son, except Aversa grabbed him first and dropped him in her mouth. ''AVERSA!'' Robin growled ''What?'' Aversa mumbled around Morgan who was still being bounced around her mouth ''Drop him, now'' Robin ordered like a dog hand extended. Aversa frowned before spitting him out... down Robin's shirt, the white haired grandmaster nearly spasming as the now very slimy boy slid through her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually everyone managed to calm down and agree to behave themselves (as Tharja's... busy that means Aversa took the longest to agree to that) Robin set Morgan on her desk ''Now I know you all want to play with Morgan but remember while as a Plegian he's more durable than normal boys you should still be careful. Also on a more general note you need to learn how to share, so we'll all be spending time with Morgan together'' she smiled, Morgan &amp; Noire cheered, Aversa smirked and Lucina frowned for a moment before forcing a smile onto her face (Robin didn't notice)<br>\r\nSo what now?</span></div></div>",

They covered their eyes and counted while Morgan smiled to himself already knowing where to hide. Now with growing up with several plegian women Morgan was the best climber in the army, and the most popular with plegian women. Morgan rushed over to the leg of the bed climbed up it and crawled under the mattress as far as he could. Due to Morgan's bloodline Morgan was more durable than the average plegian, sure he could suffer from cuts and stab wounds but blunt trauma wouldn't break his bones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was the time to reflect on his life. When Morgan traveled to past he only remembered six people besides himself: his parents, his sister, His aunt Aversa, Noire and her mother. Morgan eventually befriended some of the people he forgot about. As well he could remember the first time he was eaten by the women who loved, except for his mother who ate him a little bit after he was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Lucina it was Robin teaching her ability to safely consumed loved ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral years ago<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to what to what!?\" \" I said eat him\" \"Listen mom I'm not gonna eat him, do you want Morgan to die?\" \"Listen Lucina, us plegian women have the ability to eat the ones we love without having them perish, now eat your brother or your grounded.\" \"Heh fine.\" Lucina sighed and looked down at the three year old Morgan who seemed unfazed at what was happening actually jumping around waiting to get eaten. Lucina lifted him up and plopped the bluenette into her mouth and a wave of pleasure overwhelmed the 14 year old Lucina. Morgan tasted like candy but better, she swirled her tongue over Morgan who seemed to be giggling. About a minute later Lucina swallowed and patted her stomach satisfied. \"You see?\" Robin asked with a smug look on her face. \"Okay you were right mother, he does feel wonderful in there.  Lucina was rubbing her gut and felt Morgan rubbing the inside of her stomach walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan finished his memory and listened to the others. \"Man where could that kid be?\" Aversa asked \"Maybe he's here!\" Lucina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut is she right?</span></div></div>",

IT IS CENTURY'S BATH TIME AND I CANNOT FIND THE BABY SOAP! DID YOU LEAVE IT AT THE HOT SPRIINGS YOU TOOK CENTURY TOO LAST WEEK?\" \"Oh crud!

Lucina then quirks her eyebrow it was too delicious and Lucina noticed that the Popsicle was bigger than normal.

It's flippin hot out here and the Popsicle is so cold.\" Morgan said and Lucina laughed. \"You are right, okay you can stay.\" \"Yay!\" Morgan cheered and Lucina placed the Popsicle with Morgan clinging to it back into her mouth. \"I have good news everyone.\" Chrom said as he and Robin walked into the room. \"The pools now open so we're going.\" Lucina took the Popsicle out of her mouth (with Morgan still inside her mouth) and said \"that's great news\" \"YAY!\" Morgan said popping his upper body out of Lucina's mouth. \"AHH!

''...and she rose up and I was on her breast'' ''Oh baby'' Robin soothed, sitting him on her own large chest ''Was there any problem?'' ''It was just embarrassing'' Morgan blushed even brighter ''Oh baby don't worry it's okay, if there had been any problems Noire would've said something, or probably been blushing either brighter'' she answered, pointing over to the snow haired girl splashing Lucina with a wide grin. ''Oh, okay then'' Morgan nodded in understanding ''Going to get back into the pool kiddo?'' ''Yes mom'' Morgan nodded, the bounced into the pool using her breast as a springboard.

Sometime after Robin and Lucina made some castles Morgan asked. \"Is there anything I can do to help?\" Morgan asked. \"Thanks but no thanks sweetie me and Luci are doing fine on our own.\" Robin said smiling at her miniscule son. \"Once again I'm useless\" Morgan said and Lucina picked him up and dangled him above her mouth. \"Useless little boys do have one use; they make a great appetizer.\" Lucina said playfully. You see Morgan suffered a lot from low self confidence and self esteem so much Robin and Lucina came up with a plan. Every time Morgan said something negative about himself Lucina or Robin would have him say three good things about himself or he gets eaten and have a mountain of food crush him (Morgan was immune to digestion and actually enjoyed getting eaten so if he does get eaten for saying something negative he gets crushed with a bunch of food that gets eaten so it makes it uncomfortable). \"I think after this I'll probably eat a gallon or two of ice cream.\" Lucina said while slowly lowering Morgan into her mouth. \"Better hurry up Morgan or you'll get frostbite.\" Robin warned and Morgan quickly said three good things about himself. \"I'm cute, I give good massages and everyone is happy when their near me.\" Morgan said and Lucina placed Morgan on top of one of the sand castles. \"There now hold down the castle while your sister and I get ice cream for all of us.\" Robin said and she Lucina walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUMAN! I Am READY FOR OUR DUEL I BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE HAD PROPER TIME TO PREPARE YOURSELF.\" Six inch tall papyrus said coming out of the ocean. \"Cmon why can't you leave me alone?\" Morgan asked. \"BECAUSE FOR IT'S FOR THE SAKE OF MY PRIDE! NOW DODGE THIS!\" Papyrus said before summoning a flurry of bones towards Morgan who jumped backwards off the castle and landed behind it. \"MOM, LUCI! The scary guy is back.\" Morgan cried and luckily someone came. \"So you think that once my baby brother is alone you can just come along and try and hurt him?\" Lucina asked. \"WELL YOU SEE THIS HUMAN HAS THE TITLE OF MOST AMAZING PERSON IN THE UNIVERSE, SO I. THE GREAT PAPYRUS, PLANNED ON DEFEATING HIM AND TAKING THE TITLE FOR MYSELF!\" Papyrus explained. \"Even if that is true that is not a valid excuse, and you know what happens to people who try to hurt my Morgan?\" Lucina asked. \"They meet falchion.\" Lucina said and she grabbed falchion from her beach chair, grabbed papyrus threw him up in the air and swung falchion like a baseball bat sending papyrus flying. \"DARN YOU HUMAN, I WILL BE BACK EVENTUALLY!\" Papyrus said as he was flying through the air. \"Where's mom Luci?\" Morgan asked as Lucina picked up her brother. \"Oh she sent me back here in case if something bad happened, mother's intuition I guess?\" Lucina said.</span></div></div>",

Anyway I'm going now and don't make sure to kill anyone, bye.\" Robin said giving a kiss on the cheek to Lucina and aversa and giving a really big kiss to Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay whether we like it or not we're stuck toghether so we probably need to find something for us to do that we can agree on.\" Aversa said. \"I know what we can do.\" Morgan said. \"And what's that?\" Lucina asked</span></div></div>",

I can not tell you how many times ill be reading a good stories and ill get a chapter with like 1 sentence that doesnt lead into other choices or anything so please make chapters decently lengthed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule 2: No gay stuff. I just dont like it it's as simple as that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule 3: Try not to kill off the character too early, but remember that even though they're video game characters they can't survive everything<br>\r\n<br>\r\nother then that go crazy i guess </td>",
