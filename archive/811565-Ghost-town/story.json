You run down the stairs to the livingroom. \"Mom! Why didn't anybody wake m- you stop when you realize the room is empty. You check the kitchen. There are no signs of morning activity. The coffee in the coffee maker has already gone cold. there are no breakfast plates in the sink. Mayby everyone slept late. You check your parent's room. The bed is perfectly made as if it wasn't slept in last night. You rush outside to see if the car is still in the driveway. It  seems strangely quiet. At first you don't understand why, but then you realize that there are no cars on the street. how can this be? It's the middle of the day and there is no traffic. You see no neighbors working on their lawns, no joggers, no parents walking with children, nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town is empty what are you going to do?</span></div></div>",

You had never been much of a runner - that was your sister. She was the one who had gotten all of the awards for track and cross-country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally shake your head. No. This wasn't the time to think about this. You only had the time to focus on one thing - running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see an alleyway materialize up ahead. You feel relief flooding through you, as you know this alleway. You frequented it so many times, you knew every nook and cranny...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And every hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dash into the alleyway, and before they enter the alleyway and can see where you go, you walk through a brick wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so it would seem to others. But the ivy covering the wall hid something that nobody but select few people in your small town knows of - a hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeeze through the narrow passageway and walk down it until you reach a large room somewhere inside the building. The thing was, there were no doors or windows inside it. So you were safe - you felt sure that the people pursuing you did not know of this passageway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin wondering, however, who those people were and WHERE everyone in your town had gone, you noticed something you had not before. There were five other people in the room. You had not noticed them before, caught up in your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" You wince when your voice comes out shakily. You hate it when you sound weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we supposed to know?\" a fellow 17-year-old asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare at him as you see who it is. It's your worst enemy, Phoenix Black. Even though it was dark out, you could just make out his black hair. And, besides, you'd recognize his voice anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Phoenix,\" a girl's voice says. \"We don't need any fighting. Not at a time like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaps. It's Electra Night, your best friend and, unfortunately, Phoenix's twin sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Electra!\" you exclaim, grinning. \"I'm so glad you're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, December, you know I'd never leave you,\" she says, and you can here the grin in her voice. \"You'd die without me. And, besides, who'd be able to plot evil schemes to get you and Phoenix together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan. You cannot believe she would still pursue her crazy idea that you and Phoenix should be together when something like this is happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else is here?\" you ask, in an effort to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genesis,\" a small girl's voice speaks out, and you grin delightedly. You're glad that Electra and Phoenix 4-year-old sister made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gabriel,\" another voice, one your age, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh. Of course. Electra's boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, and London Ice,\" a girl who sounded like she was in her twenty's said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know London, but only by name and reputation. You know everybody in this town. It's impossible not to, with the town being so small. London just moved there about a year ago from who-knew-where. She wouldn't tell anybody. She never talked much, and was basically a mystery. She didn't fit in with the town, and so the town didn't like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn't really know whether you liked her or not. You hadn't even met her until now. You would withhold your judgement until you did know her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do now?\" you ask the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Electra answers. \"But I really want to know where everyone went. They can't be all gone. We have to find as many people as we can and bring them here. This is the only safe place in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure if this is the best idea. What if you encountered the people chasing you again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you know you do have to find whoever you can. Your family could be out there somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip, undecided. What should you do?</span></div></div>",

If there's anything movies have taught you, it's don't trust strange men in uniforms. Or suits. Or just strange men in general. The men do not talk as they straighten out the living room. This is very weird. You really want to know what's going on, but it looks like you're not going to learn anything from them. All of a sudden, you hear a phone ringing. The oldest looking guy takes out a mobile phone. It's one of those really old-fashioned-size-of-a-brick ones. What a loser. You admire your tiny little phone in your pocket. You even have a funky cover for it. You're so delighted with your phone you almost forget to listen to his conversation.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" he answers. \"No, we did not find him. There are eight left on this street. Okay, we'll be back soon.\" He hung up, and turned to the other two weirdos. \"Hurry up\". They immediately moved faster, and were soon out of your way. You heard their brisk footsteps moving down the street. <br>\r\nOkay, eight left sounded like there were eight people still around. And you were willing to bet that one of them was Aaron Valentine, the guy that lived in this house, and your arch nemesis. It would figure that everyone else in the world would disappear except him. And what do you know, you were right, he suddenly appeared before you.<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you doing in my house?\" he said gruffly. He looked like shit. But then, he always looked like shit to you.<br>\r\n\"I was looking for some signs of life. In case you haven't noticed, it's like Apocalypse Now around here. Sadly, I've had no luck here either. No human lifeforms reported found.\"<br>\r\n\"Haha, very funny\", he said moodily. \"Did you see those freaks in uniform?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, what is going on?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I don't know\", he said. \"All I know is that I woke up and I went to the stop of my stairs and there were these three strange dudes in my house, so I hid in my closet until they left.\"<br>\r\n\"What would you have done if they'd opened your closet?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know\", Aaron replied. \"I don't even know why I hid, to be honest. Just a feeling I got I suppose.\"<br>\r\n\"Me too\". Ugh. You did not want to share any of the same feelings with this jerk. <br>\r\n\"So you're telling me that everyone has disappeared except you and me? Great\". He sounded as overjoyed as you felt. <br>\r\n\"Well, the three men said there were eight people on this street not found. So there must be more. I think we should look for them and try to figure out what to do, or even what happened.\"<br>\r\nAaron gave you a withering look. \"I don't think so. I want to find out if my friend's are okay. I'm heading over to Greg's house right away.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't you think we should stay where we know there are people?\" You could feel your blood pressure rising. Why did you have to deal with this asshole today?<br>\r\n\"You can, but I sure as hell am not.\"<br>\r\n\"And you expect me to just follow you?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't expect anything of you. But I don't think I'm ready to go it alone just yet.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not going to Greg's house with you.\"<br>\r\n\"And I'm not wasting my time looking for people that I don't even care about.\"</span></div></div>",

You rang the front doorbell. A few minutes later Ben, or was it Tim( Even knowing them as long as you have you can't always tell the difference) answered the door. He still looked groggy like you woke him up. \"sup mayn\" he said,\"You can come in, but I'm not to sure about your dog,\" he said looking at Aaron. \"Bite me\"  Aaron shot back. \"Nah, I wouldn't want to get rabies,\" Ben/Tim/ whoever said.\"Say man\" Ben/Tim said,\"Do you know what all those black vans were doing driving up and down our street this morning? They woke me up and I couldn't get back to sleep until about eight.\" You both look at him stunned. \"When was this?\" \"About 5 this morning I think, funny thing is my clock came unplugged when they drove by my house. I still don't understand why. Ben slept through the whole thing.\" You looked at his house. It was still in the same messy state it had always been in.\"None of them pulled up to your house?\" you asked. \"Nah, they stopped at every other house, but they drove right by ours as if it wasn't here.\" You told him what you knew about the men in black, and how you and Aaron avoided them. You told him about how your whole house was empty and cleaned exept for your room. It was as if they didn't see it. \"What's so special about your room?\" Tim(hah I knew it was Tim!) asked.\"I don't know. I've been trying to figure that out myself.\" You decide to wake Ben up and go to Julie's. When you get there you knock, but noone answers the door. You open it anyways(hey this is a state of emergency) The livingroom has been cleaned spotless, and everything is streightened out.  \"Uh oh we're too late.\" you say, but then you hear the sound of footsteps upstairs. \"Who's there?\" Julie says. \"It's just us.\" you say,\"but something weird is going on.\" Julie comes down still in her night gown. She looks like she just woke up too. You explain what's happened so far. \"How could this be possible?\" she asks\" How should we know?\" Aaron gripes. \"Where do we go next?\" Tim asks. \"We have to get Greg.\" Aaron says.\"But I called his house and those guys were there.\" you say\"They were at my house, your house, and Julie's house, and we weren't caught.</span></div></div>",
