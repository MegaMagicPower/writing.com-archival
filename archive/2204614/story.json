You can obviously roam around once you begin, but the beginning needs to have begun first! Don\u2019t think about it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcana High! <br>\r\nNot everyone who comes to Monster City has had the chance to get a quality education, thankfully there\u2019s Arcana High! Any monster of any age can attend! (How convenient for this story\u2019s 18 and up only rule.) What do you mean this sounds like Monster Prom? Do you want to get sent to the Room of No Return? Then shut up and study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCryptids Inc. HQ!<br>\r\nIn any city, there\u2019s always at least one corporate empire that owns pretty much everything. In Monster City, that\u2019s Cryptids Inc.! What do they do? No-one knows! Many young monsters with bright, promising futures have resigned to working Cryptids Inc. forever after having their spirits crushed and their souls stolen! Oh, also, be careful not to get chewed up by the boss (I know what I said)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonster Mall!<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do with the money you make working your job at Cryptids Inc.? Why, you spend it at Monster Mall (a subsidiary of Cryptids Inc.), of course! It\u2019s absolutely teaming with mall rats, and monsters who spend all their time there! Ah, so many goods and services, so little time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wilds!<br>\r\nSome monsters just can\u2019t handle the pressures on modern life\u2026 and that\u2019s totally cool, because they can go live in the Wilds! Hunt your own food! Sleep in a swamp! Live your best life as a feral beast, you funky little monster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s not all! Look around, there\u2019s always something new to explore in Monster City, U.S.A.!</span></div></div>",

Unwilling to let his team down, he rose from the grave through the power of team spirit so he could lead them to victory in the playoffs. When everyone saw his twisted, undead form, he was chased off by both teams, the crowds, and the police, straight into Monster City! Coach Quach saw Rob running for miles through the city, and offered him a place on the many sports teams at Arcana High! With nowhere to go and a half-rotted brain unequipped for surviving on his own, he graciously accepted. Miraculously, even with green skin, milky white dead eyes, brain in his short messy black hair, and only most of his strong jaw, Rob is still very good looking.<br>\r\n\u2022Naturally good intentioned and helpful, unfortunately the problem-solving part of his brain has a chunk of turf lodged in it, naturally hampering both.<br>\r\n\u2022The critical part of his brain is also damaged, making him very gullible and willing to follow orders.<br>\r\n\u2022Surprisingly still able to understand abstract concepts and appreciate even the finest art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake \u2014 Shadow Monster, they, 6\u2019, weightless, ageless, Junior<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is Blake. They are simply an amalgamation of pure darkness; the lingering omnipresent fear of death manifest; a veil of shadow no light can penetrate; a void of nothingness in the shape of a lanky, rather dapper young man. If Being simply an absence of light given tangible form, they lack facial features and is incapable of speech, so instead they communicate through gesturing, shapeshifting, and manipulating their environment. They\u2019re not very good at it, which with their lack of nerve is how they got roped into being a high schooler despite being as ancient and all-knowing as darkness itself. The only thing more powerful than the omnipotence of darkness is peer pressure and social anxiety! <br>\r\n\u2022Awkward AF. Even if they could talk, they wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to their crush\u2026<br>\r\n\u2022Will do the homework of anyone that promises not to beat them up.<br>\r\n\u2022Seriously, they\u2019re so smart, just very inexperienced at being a singular self-aware entity.</span></div></div>",

If anyone in your life starts telling you that shit, punch them in the throat before they can finish. Seriously, what\u2019s so great about it? The waking up early? The constant social pressure to conform? The stress of studying subjects that are of no use in everyday life? Why don\u2019t they teach something useful, like how to do taxes? Why won\u2019t anyone tell Blake how to do taxes?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shoved their head into their locker and screamed. Not really, though; since they lacked a mouth screaming wasn\u2019t possible. Being made of nothingness made making any sound at all rather difficult, but it helps, damnit! Taking a deep breath (again, not really) Blake did their best to calm down. They were already half way through their forced education; just four more semesters until freedom. That was nothing compared to the countless eons Blake had existed. Still, the last two years felt like an eternity of awkward encounters, unfortunate accidents and embarrassing pranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018At least\u2026\u2019 Blake thought to themself as they pulled their head out of the locker, \u2018there\u2019s no way this can get any worse\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA green scaly hand with fingered tipped with razor sharp talons painted a deep purple slammed onto the locker next to Blake\u2019s. \u201cWhat\u2019sssss up, nerd?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh, no, it got worse!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stiffened up as they were faced with the leader of the Gorgons, a clique of vicious serpentine cheerleaders with snakes for hair. These three sisters practically ran the school. You know the types, the real mean girls you see in all those movies about high school that you never thought existed in real life. Well, they do! So far Blake had done a decent job of staying out of their way, slinking off into the shadows whenever the trio sauntered near. So much for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you going to sssssay anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Medi? I don\u2019t think they can, like, talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! I know they can\u2019t fucking talk, Euri! Can\u2019t you tell I\u2019m trying to mess with them?! Gawds!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese three \u2014 Medusa, Euryale, and Stheno \u2014 well, frankly Blake just couldn\u2019t tell them apart. Not reptilians in general, mind you, just these three. Their personalities, sense of fashion, voices, manner of speech, and physical appearances were all perfectly identical. How Medusa managed to set herself apart as the leader when they were all so interchangeable was a complete mystery. Wait, the leader <i>was</i> Medusa, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, whatever, it doesn\u2019t even matter!\u201d Medusa(?) barked at her sisters before turning her piercing gaze back at Blake. \u201cI heard you\u2019re really fucking sssssmart, ssssso from now on, you\u2019re going to be doing all our homework for us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then suddenly Blake had a stack of homework thrust upon them. Heavy enough to demand the use of both arms, the comedically tall stack of textbooks and worksheets was high enough that it forced Blake to tilt their head to see over it. \u2018What the actual hell\u2026?!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re a few months behind.\u201d Said the Gorgon who, through process of elimination, Blake assumed was Stheno. \u201cSo, you better get to work, or we\u2019ll totally turn you into stone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Blake had time to protest having all this extra work on them (not that they would, even if they verbally could) the three Gorgons were already strutting away on their long ssseslender legs. With little other option, Blake once again resigned themself to their fate. Better to simply accept the soul crushing task than be turned into a statue the Gorgon\u2019s would no doubt use as a dress up doll\u2026 wait, they couldn\u2019t turn them to stone! There was nothing <i>to</i> turn to stone!</span></div></div>",

Spotting a breakthrough among dozens in the past five hour, she broke into a toothy, wide smile, adjusting the thick goggles she wore to match her scuzzy lab coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I knew it! Genius, you're a genius!\" Nikki Tesla announced to no one in particular. \"It's all so simple, and yet those rubes never saw it! They called me mad! MAD!\" She cackled madly as a pair of vampires gave her a fearful glance as they glided by and picked up the pace. \"I will show them! I will show them all! THEY WILL RUE THE DAY THEY DARED TO DEFY NICOLE ISABELLA MARIE PENELOPE EVANGELINE ROWENA TESLA!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped onto the table and laughed with pure manic glee, nearly dancing for joy before immediately jumping back into her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bored now,\" she said aloud, returning to her stack of papers with a frown. She started exploring some of her chemical ideas when someone nearby cleared their throat. She looked over her shoulder into the disapproving bandaged glare of Ms. Patrick. \"Do not disturb my circles!\" Nikki yelped, throwing her body over top of the papers. The teacher rolled her eyes, recognizing the historical reference and wondering if this particular student knew what happened to the last person to make that request. Judging from her usual history marks, most likely not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to come over here every time you show up?\" Ms. Patrick said sternly. \"This isn't the place for that sort of behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it, my inept shortsighted FOOL of a roommate kicked me out!\" Nikki grumbled, still draped over the table and her notes like a place-mat. \"To say nothing of the ignoramuses inhabiting the library and the computer labs. Shortsighted FOOLS who don't appreciate my genius!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or the fires?\" Ms. Patrick added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is a few burns of varying degrees compared to the glory of SCIENCE!!!\" Nikki punctuated the last word by leaping onto the table again in triumph, only to be dragged down again by the teacher. Ms. Patrick, bless her immortal soul, was the absolute last nonliving being in this school who had just a sliver of patience to spare for this girl. Everyone sympathized with her because of her rejection by other humans and there was no question that she was brilliant, but damn it if she just wasn't so difficult to control. There were students who could warp reality and make geometry non-euclidean on a bad day and even they were less of a hassle to deal with then her. And frankly, this mummy was at the end of her rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that is enough!\" Ms Patrick declared. \"My office, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>clack clack clack clack clack</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho ho, Isaac you devil. How ingenious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki giggled with delight as she sat in front of Ms. Patrick's desk, playing with the Newton's cradle and watching the balls swing back and forth. Poking them to make them go faster or slower in between picking them up two or three at a time, she didn't even acknowledge Ms. Patrick as she returned with a paper in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I hate to do this to you but-\" Ms. Patrick started, but stopped when she saw what Nikki was up to. She reached over and stopped the toy, making Nikki visibly upset. \"I hate to take this step, Miss Tesla, but you leave me no choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Nikki recognized the paper by its distinctive pink hue, and the color immediately drained from her face. \"Is that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Expulsion papers,\" Ms. Patrick confirmed. \"I have enough documentation to dismiss you right here and right now several times over, you know. Disruptive behavior, low GPA, attendance issues, to say nothing of the numerous counts of property damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki tried to protest, to rant in her defense, but her words choked in her throat. \"Puh...please...\" she managed to squeak out, feeling like she was about to be kicked out of her house all over again. Tears were starting to leak from underneath her goggles; lifting the lenses to wipe them away revealed her bright blue and inquisitive eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but you've made it apparent that you have no respect for our institution or for your continuing education,\" Miss Patrick went on, expertly putting up a front of indifference. It honestly hurt her as much as it hurt Nikki to see her like this, but the cold shoulder was needed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...I do care about this place, and I like it here...I'll study my butt off and pass all my classes, honest, I will! Do you want me to beg? I'll beg, on my hands and knees!\" She leapt out of the chair and bonked her head on the end of the desk in her zeal, rattling the contents and sending the Newton's cradle into motion again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Control yourself, Miss Tesla!\" the teacher demanded. Sniffling, Nikki obeyed, getting back up and twiddling her thumbs in shame. \"Very well, if you are serious about this, then I will allow you to stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Miss Patrick!\" Nikki declared. \"How could I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...on one condition...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on!\" Nikki pleaded with the stony-faced gargoyle at the booth. \"I need to join a club, otherwise I'm going to be expelled!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And exactly how is that my problem?\" the gargoyle snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki clasped her hands together in desperation. \"Pleaaaase! This is literally the only thing I'm interested in! I won't blow up the meeting room again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dice. You're banned from the Science Club for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes no sense! Half of you are already dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gargoyle crossed his arms and said nothing, indicating the conversation was over. Endlessly annoyed, Nikki stomped away, cursing the fool of a gargoyle with every inch of spite she had left in her until it was all replaced with fear. She needed to find something to join by the end of the day, something, anything, and every club even mildly connected to science with a recruitment table set up today was turning her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were clubs in the back however, somewhat popular and somewhat immunized from her usual antics because of her utter lack of interest, that may be of use. Alas, her options had all but dried up at this point, and they were all she had left. Taking a deep breath, she took a painful step towards the nearest recruitment table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd...like to join, please,\" she said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cute naga behind the table looked surprised, though not fearful. Giving an encouraging smile, she pushed a sign in sheet forward for her to sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're interested then?\" she said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes...\" Nikki said through gritted teeth as she dotted her i's on the form. \"It's...out of my comfort zone, but it seems...ffffun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're certainly glad to have you!\" the naga grinned, standing up on her thick tail and offering her a handshake, which Nikki stiffly accepted. \"My name's Mohini, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki,\" Nikki announced bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you!\" Mohini said, handing her an information form. \"We have our first meeting tomorrow, welcome to...\"</span></div></div>",

Games were for children, pointless diversions that awarded a button push with a burst of endorphins. What self-respecting woman of science would stoop to such a low as to play those things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about the expulsion paper on Ms. Patrick's desk, Nikki guessed that self-respecting woman of science was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh...fools....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was particularly lead-footed the next day as she headed to the club location, hands deep in her pockets as she scowled at the floor. Unlike most clubs which had a classroom, the gaming club took over the student lounge on the South side of campus for a few hours a day, so it wasn't too hard for Nikki to get to, and when she did...well, it wasn't all that impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sizeable amount of students milling about the lounge. Some crowded around small televisions and the big flatscreen on the wall to play video games, others huddled around board games of varying degrees of complexity. In the back of the room, a demon-kid sat behind a cardboard screen, regaling a story of some kind to a handful of other students clutching sheets of paper and sacks full of dice. Nothing particularly stuck out, though Nikki did spot the swaying tail of Mohini, digging through a card that seemed to carry the club's board games. She almost went over to see if there was anything remotely interesting in the cart when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD, YOU GUYS SUCK ASS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki and half the club turned to look at the commotion surrounding the large screen near the center of the lounge, broadcasting the word FAILURE in bright red lettering. The shouter seemed to be a surly looking vampire with fangs bared in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you kept charging in to get kills without us,\" a zombie-like student on his right insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you would have waited for us, you wouldn't have kept feeding the enemy team and cost us the game,\" a translucent girl on the left pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you guys, you're just ass at this game. Stick to fucking iron, dipshits!\" With that, the vampire chucked his controller at the ground and transformed into a bat, flying past Nikki's shoulder as the controller landed at her feet. Picking it up with a thumb and forefinger, Nikki trotted over to the group of students trying to play the game and looking miserable in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your controller back,\" Nikki said, dropping the controller into a werewolf's lap before realizing something. \"Hey, if that needs fixing I can do something with it, make sure it responds to your game here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf, looking confused, picked up the controller and tested a few buttons out. \"Uh, no I think it's working fine. Got us back to the character select and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll take your word for it then...\" Nikki huffed, looking at the screen with marked disinterest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to play with us?\" the ghost girl asked kindly. \"We need a fourth player for Fists And Fighters Online.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki hemmed and hawed, her mind going back and forth between how much she really didn't like video games and how much she didn't want to get kicked out of the club. Eventually the latter won out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Nikki announced, plopping down next to the werewolf. Picking up the game case sitting on the shelf underneath the flat-screen, she took out the manual and started flicking through the book. \"How do you play this game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not too complicated, it's a bit like deathmatch but we lead little minions to destroy an enemy base in the meantime,\" the ghost girl explained. \"You press this button to move around, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I got it,\" Nikki announced, cutting her off and tossing the manual away. \"Who should I play? Any scientists in this game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's Trixie the Mad, but she's like super hard to play,\" the zombie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works for me,\" Nikki stated, still in a deadpan tone, holding her controller at the ready. \"Let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarily, the other three began the match countdown while Nikki glowered at the screen. Deciding to force herself through this unpleasantness, she tried to look at this like a particularly difficult science experiment, intending to solve it. The four player avatars, Nikki's being a tiny pig-tail sporting scientist who periodical broke into maniacal laughter, spawned in a forested area at the head of a band of goons wielding spears and shields, marching along into the distance. Immediately, shots bounced off the zombie's player character, a burly looking guy made of metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they have Jeraz, he's so broken...\" the ghost girl sighed. \"Well, just brace for it I guess, and...hey, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki instead charged forward, her character in game brandishing a potion as she dodged left and right, counting off the shots and the timing of the bursts, calculating the perfect angle when the shooter reloaded. Then, at the right moment, Nikki threw down a potion and a magical wall sprung up, bouncing the bullets back just as enemy spearmen came into view, mowing down a slew of them in one shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah!\" the ghost girl said, awestruck. \"I didn't know you could do that with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple geometry, any monkey with a slide ruler could pull it off,\" Nikki announced. \"Here, your character's shield bash can do the same thing, if you time it correctly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It CAN?\" the werewolf said incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it can, haven't you read the manual? If you did then you'd know your bloodlust can temporarily buff the spearmen too, if you stand close enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the game went along much like that, with Nikki coldly informing her teammates of all sorts of neat little tricks they could pull off, all the while leading the charge by throwing bombs and potion canisters around like confetti. Maybe it was because Nikki tried to put some semblance of mathematics and science into the equation, but midway through the match, she did get a tingle in the back of her head, the same sort of tingle she got from a particularly exciting discovery. It wasn't long before the enemy base was in sight; boosted by her teammate's bloodlust, Nikki's character quaffed a potion and transformed into a raging monster, smashing through the frontline to let her teammates pick off the weak assassin characters taking cover in the back. With the ghost girl's shield bash bouncing bullets into the last few enemy spears, the enemy base collapsed into tinder, and a cheerful voice announced VICTORY to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud noise made Nikki dive under the table before she realized what it was; cheering. Unbeknownst to her, a huge crowd had gathered behind her to watch the match, suitably impressed by her performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was my best match ever!\" the werewolf exclaimed happily. \"Hey, who are you anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Nikki Tesla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you!\" the zombie said cheerily. \"Hope you stick around for a while, you were great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...thanks?\" Nikki tried to extract herself from the situation, feeling deeply confused by the whole affair, until she backed into something cool and scaly. \"Gah! Oh, it's you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMohini grinned, blushing slightly as she smoothed out her shirt. \"Sorry, I was just...wow, that was great! Was that your first time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was,\" Nikki shrugged. \"Not too difficult, really. Just needs an application of common sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE tell me you're asking her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki turned to see a selachian girl storming towards her, practically bouncing on the balls of her feet when she finally skidded to a stop. The human was suitably taken aback by this sharkey-looking girl, tall and muscular with battleship-gray skin,  gray eyes, and a long thin shark tail exiting out the back of her shorts, all of it gray, with some white thrown in for good measure. It was no wonder she seemed to prefer neon colors according to her clothes and the streak in her long brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was about to!\" Mohini insisted, squirming on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Mo, you'd better!\" The shark girl was joined by a skinny-looking demon, a tiefling as some humans liked to call them, horns curled like a rams on top of his black hair, solid amber eyes standing out sharply against his red skin, which in turn clashed horribly with his ratty jeans and plaid shirt. \"Seriously, I've never seen a Trixie player that good before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Nikki demanded. \"And who are you people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're TRYING to be the Fists And Fighters Online E-Sport Team for Monster High,\" the demon guy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we need a player four!\" the shark girl concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-only if you're interested!\" Mohini said, blushing like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was rather taken aback at this offer, not being entirely sure what that even meant. An E-sports team? Isn't that like, a competitive thing? Not really her cup of tea, but thinking back to that game, and the rush of emotion it gave her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that was NOT something a woman of SCIENCE would do! Never in a million years would she debase herself as to play...ugh!...video games! And she opened her mouth to say as much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...just as Miss Patrick walked up to the four of them, like something straight out of Nikki's worst nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news, Mohini,\" the mummy said. \"I've spoken to the principle, and he's agreed to let you establish the team for this game if you can find a fourth player!\" Miss Patrick then looked over at Nikki, trapped like a deer in headlights. \"Oh, are you their fourth, Miss Tesla? That's very kind of you to offer, and I'm sure that it would look good on your record, hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe super-genius scientist forced a smile on her face, feeling like she'd rather be swallowing every chemical in her lab kit right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...where do I sign up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's note: Leaving two free choices in case someone wants to do something with gaming club that doesn't involve this long intro)</span></div></div>",

Despite looking and like a vicious predator of the ocean, Kahiau, though she preferred to be called Kay, was about as dangerous as a teddy bear. Sure she was built as hell with the strong muscles of a seasoned swimmer, but the shark girl mostly used those arms of hers to give out big hugs more then anything else. Not exactly something Nikki was fond of, admittedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we doing with the trial runs?\" Mohini asked as she slithered up behind the pair occupying the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too bad...I am getting a good grasp on the fundamentals, as it were,\" Nikki reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wonderful!\" the nagi said, the end of her tail wagging happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep telling her she has a knack for finding the good players,\" Kay explained. \"There's you and Luke obviously, but I don't think you were here when Vindani and Jenna were in this team. Those two were legends at this game, they could run over anyone without even blinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to them?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Mohini said, stumbling over her words slightly. \"It's...complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not,\" Kay said sharply \"Those two treated you like dirt, no shame in admitting that.\" Watching Kay's sudden sharpness at the idea of someone mistreating her friend was almost as much of a shock as her kindness. Note to self, the shark girl's a teddy bear, just don't mess with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they're gone now, at least,\" Mohini muttered to herself. \"And besides, Luke's a solid tank player, put that with Nikki on assault and we'll be solid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were the tank,\" Nikki asked the shark girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, support!\" Kay confirmed cheerfully. \"And Mo's the assassin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki raised an eyebrow, somewhat amused that the one on this team who would be racking up kills and sneaking around was the quiet and bookish nagi with the librarian eyeglasses. Suppose it fit better then the hulking shark girl playing the squishy healing type, at least. Snakes and what have you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey gals...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting the classroom door behind him, Luke shuffled up to the group on the couch. The tiefling was quite enigmatic, very Hot Topic-looking with his goatlike demon horns and charcoal skin with the blood red eyes. Effortlessly chill, he almost seemed too cool to hang out with the shy nagi and the boisterous shark, and yet here he was. Nikki didn't have an opinion on him just yet, but his chill attitude was enough that she at least felt comfortable near the guy. Of course one look at his face right now and you could tell he wasn't quite his usual chill self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you have unfortunate news,\" Nikki pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up? Did the principle give us the green light?\" Mohini asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....technically, yes,\" Luke said warily. \"But he seemed to waffle over whether or not it was worth the expenses, something to do with efficiency of school funding, I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, does he want us to do a bikini car wash? Cause I can absolutely do a bikini car wash,\" Kay spouted out, causing Mohini to blush and Nikki to smirk at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's set up an exhibition match against another school. Some west coast school, can't remember the name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that all we have to do?\" Nikki asked, but the other two girls looked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-the game got popular out west, Nikki,\" Mohini explained. \"The school teams there are pretty solid, and if we have to play against them...well, it's an uphill battle. Maybe with enough prep time we can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two other girls in the room dropped their jaws to the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A MONTH?\" Kay shouted. \"Is he trying to make us lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be shocked,\" Luke admitted. \"He didn't seem all that enthused about the idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we supposed to get up to the level of a west coaster with a new player in one month?!?\" Mohini fretted. \"No offense, Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken, I am with you on this. The fool is clearly trying to sabotage us!\" Nikki jumped onto the sofa. \"And are we going to let them defeat us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no?\" Mohini said, somewhat taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not,\" Luke muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELL NO!\" Kay shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we are going to work our butts off and then kick their butts so hard that they fall off so we can use them ourselves!\" Nikki shouted in triumph. \"I have totally lost track of this metaphor, THAT IS HOW FOCUSED I AM ON WINNING THIS MATCH AND MAKING THIS TEAM A REALITY!\" <i>And keeping me in a club to prevent me from getting expelled,</i> Nikki thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are we waiting for?\" Kay said, tossing Luke and Mohini a pair of controllers. \"Time to get training ladies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time like the present I guess,\" Mohini said, squeezing in between Nikki and Kay while Luke sat on Nikki's opposite side, settling down into what was to be a long and hard month of training for the first big game of the year for this ragtag team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Nikki and the Fists And Fighters team train hard, relying on copious amounts of snack food to get them through their training sessions, so by the time the game day arrives, the gang isn't quite as svelte as they once were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Nikki, wanting to help the team in her own unique way, remembers a certain compound she created that could make for great gamer fuel, keeping her and her teammates focused and working at peak efficiency. Sure it has that one little side effect, but it's not like they'll be doing a lot of physical activity anyway, right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Let it never be said Nikki was lax in her commitments. She always put a hundred and ten...no...TWO hundred percent into everything she did! Granted that was only when it was tangentially related to the pursuit of glorious SCIENCE, but her current goal of working herself to the bone on the Fists and Fighters team had little to do with the sciences, so...progress?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all seriousness, she absolutely gave a damn about this dumb little video game contest more then most things, even if it was entirely for selfish reasons. Keeping it afloat was her top priority if she wanted to stay enrolled her, so that's exactly what she tried to do. When she wasn't playing the game, she was looking up strategy guides, watching tutorials, running over battle-plans in her head, even digging into the lore to try and squeeze as much information as she could out of the series. It even got so far as to incorporate into her schoolwork, as the very confused math teacher found out when an algebra problem involving apples and oranges turned into spearmen and health potions on Nikki's paper. Every waking moment, every idle second, she was laser-focused on this one task, as her laboratory equipment sat nearly unused in her dorm. Fists of Fighters team. She had to stay on the Fists of Fighters team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be honest, do you think I'm losing my nerve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva, the Satyress that was her long-suffering roommate glanced up from her laptop from her perch in the bed on the other side of the room. \"You talking to me or the bird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's eye twitched as she turned back to the confused pigeon plucked out of the open window, held firmly in her grip. \"Yes, I see her too Squit,\" she said to the bird. \"Don't worry, we'll get you back to Pesto and Bobby after my stay at the academy is secure.\" Tired of this, the pigeon pecked at her thumb, causing her to release her grip with a sharp yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SQUIT NO!\" Nikki shouted, clambering after the bird as it flew out the window. \"I need you! The team needs you! AMERICA NEEDS YOOOOOOOOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I cannot believe I'm missing you blowing up the dorm right now,\" Eva grumbled, snapping her laptop shut. \"You need help, Nikki. The Fisting Fighters dweebs are making you even worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fists and Fighters, thou plebian!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Eva got to her feet and packed up her bag. \"I'm going to the library. Please detox, I have a big test tomorrow and I can't sleep if you're manhandling the pigeons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the big game is TOMORROW!\" Nikki pleaded. \"And I'm woefully underprepared! Everyone is! What if I take a less optimal path and it costs us 0.3 more seconds to arrive at the frontlines? What if Luke's cooldowns are sluggish due to the slight connection difference and our teamwork together is sub-optimal? What if Mohini is a microsecond late on her fire control and causes a breakdown in concentration as our teamwork collapses like uranium going through a fission reaction? THESE ARE SERIOUS CONSIDERATIONS!!!\" Nikki blinked and took a deep breath before realizing that Eva had in fact left well before her rant began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right though, with the game tomorrow, mere excellence would not do. Sure the team played so well that even the self-conscious Mohini was confident, but she could settle for mere excellence. No, in order for this to work, Nikki needed perfection. She needed the one thing that she knew that could push them towards gaming perfection like no other. She needed...the Fuel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically diving across the room, Nikki rummaged through her equipment in a manic fervor, preparing to recreate the Fuel. It was a recipe she knew by heart, a brilliant concoction that bestowed energy, helped with concentration and reflexes, even helped to cure minor ailments. If it weren't for that one itty bitty side effect, it could have caused a sensation, but alas it sat forgotten in the collection of failed inventions and creations that Nikki collected en masse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Connection goes live in five minutes,\" Ms. Patrick announced. \"Make sure your team is prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big day, at last. As a simple exhibition, there wasn't a grand stadium or live performance for this matchup; the highly skilled West Coast team merely connected to a game with the Monster High team and played, simple best of 3 game with a teacher to supervise. That didn't make it any less stressful for the four students. Outside of Luke who always looked perpetually cool, Mohini was practically a nervous wreck, her hair messy and her eyes sore and just barely bloodshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barely got any sleep last night,\" she explained. \"So nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we got this guys!\" Kay the shark girl said, her voice cracking slightly as she tried to keep an optimistic outlook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, we will have them!\" Nikki announced, by far the worst looking of the group. Twitchy and pale, the others wondered if she stayed up all night practicing as her hands shook dangerously. \"How about something special before we get started, hm?\" Acting casually, Nikki reached down into her backpack and pulled out a pitcher and four plastic cups, pouring a flowing purple liquid into each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Refreshments?\" Luke questioned, running his finger around the rim of one glass like he was trying to make a tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Energy drink, something my...family passed down from generation to generation,\" Nikki lied readily. \"Just a little bit of a kick before the match starts.\" Nikki quaffed her own drink to prove her point, and the effects were immediate; a warmth spread from her throat to her stomach, all through her body to the tips of her fingers and toes. Her small aches, pains, and twitches subsided as she began to feel re-energized and rejuvenated by the strange brew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope there's not anything I should be concerned about in that stuff,\" Ms. Patrick said coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing at all, just natural extracts and juices all throughout! No booze or anything like that!\" Nikki said brightly. Luke, seeing the change in his teammate, grabbed his own cup, only betraying his feelings on the drink by the sharp uptick of his brow in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...not bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, really? Gimme some!\" Kay snatched a cup and drank it all in one gulp, exhaling with a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's like...liquid electricity or something!\" Kay exclaimed. \"I feel like I could run twenty miles before the game starts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready, thirty seconds...\" Miss Patrick warned the students. Mohini stared at the drink in front of her, in turn feeling the stares of her friends on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Mo, try it. I feel like we're going to win just by tasting the stuff!\" Kay insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten seconds...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMohini took the cup in her hand, still staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Mo,\" Nikki said, putting on her best and brightest smile. \"Let's clean their clock!\" The scientist watched in delight as Mohini drank down her helping of the Fuel, her eyes widening in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" she sighed. \"It's....its....!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time!\" Miss Patrick announced. \"Controllers in hand, get ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one fluid motion, the whole team reached down to pick up their controllers, eyes focused intently on the screen, planning out strategies and battle plans. This was going to work, Nikki thought to herself in between her own planning. We're the perfect Fist and Fighters team, and we are going to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A: WIN! Our heroes clobber the West Coast team and earn their status as an official FoF team!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B: Tie? It's a dead heat all the way through, and there will need to be a rematch next week. More training!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption C: Ugh...I don't feel so good. Is the Fuel having an unexpected reaction?</span></div></div>",

WE'RE A FUCKING TEAM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two most rambunctious members of the team double-hi-fived one another, continuing to jump up and down on the sofa out of manic delight. Mohini had her hands clasped over her mouth, tears of happiness filling her eyes, while Luke simply smiled and nodded appreciatively, too cool to partake in theatrical emotions apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the principle can't object to your team now,\" Miss Patrick said over the din, writing a few details down on her notepad. \"Congratulations. I'll talk to Coach Quach about getting your team officially registered.\" The poor nagi was so happy that she got down from the sofa and slithered over to the mummy to give her a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank yooooooou!\" she wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, you're welcome,\" Miss Patrick responded. \"I always believed you four could do it.\" The teacher shot a knowing look at Nikki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gotta go celebrate or something! Go nuts!\" Kay said. \"I know a great eatery down by the mall, best burgers and fries in town!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could go for some tacos,\" Luke said, licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a Chinese place right down there too, isn't there?\" Mohini wondered allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't go wrong with pizza!\" Nikki argued, partially to keep up appearances and partially because she knew the Fuel was taking hold of her. It was a wonderful substance really, one sampling and you'd be blessed with more energy then you knew what to do with. You barely would even need to sleep. Only downside was that sudden craving sensation, and combined with the substance messing with their metabolism...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh well, what's done was done, Nikki reasoned. The Fuel was there, and it would be wreaking its effects on them, not even wearing off when-</span></div></div>",

It was still morning  and none of the students had yet arrived.<br>\r\nLottie put her bag and teaching material down on her desk and turned to look at the still empty classroom. She walked where seats were, holding a basket in one hand and the list of students in one of the other hands she had. She counted the students who were supposed to be attending today and for every one she pulled out a cupcake from her basket and placed it on one of the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had become a bit of an tradition for her, as she managed to almost always arrive in her classroom before any class started. Making sure she put the cupcakes on the front seats so the students would be as close as possible, because every one knows that sitting at the back of the class severely lowers the amount you learn.<br>\r\nAfter having placed a cupcakes for those who should be attending, Lottie turned to look at the clock and realized the class would start soon. She then power walked herself back to the front of the class and placed the, still not empty, basket behind her desk, then she quickly made her way to the door to let students in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 students made their way into the classroom. There were supposed to be more but for some monster waking up before 8:00 am was impossible, like actually physically impossible.The students piled into the room, some still after weeks of taking this class not sure about why there were sweets for them. But no-one questioned it, most likely because they didn't want to upset the humanoid spider, who happily smiled at them when they entered the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow do we continue this story on this path or should we have a different starting point.<br>\r\n1.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once the students had settled down and some of the late arrivals had come in, Lottie started her class.<br>\r\nToday's topic was poems and poets, which isn't necessarily the most interesting thing to be taught in the morning, but still Lottie went in with full energy. In fact she was the only one showing any energy, partly because her interest in teaching and partly because she had drunk many cups of coffee last night to keep herself awake while baking all the cupcakes and other sweets. While most of the students weren't that interested in the subjects they at least enjoyed the sweets Lottie had spend hours making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce students had finally started to wake the class went into full swing. Lottie would read famous poems in almost a theatrical manor and then eagerly asked if any one else wanted to read some. Once people started taking notes Lottie would come up to the students when they had any questions. This made some uncomfortable but for some others it was great whenever Lottie would bend over to point something out in someones notes. None of the students really wanted to participate, apart from few, but Lottie still did her best to get the students involved with her teaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway through the class, when Lottie had finally left the poor students alone and returned to her desk, there was some chatting that could be heard.<br>\r\nA female werewolf and a male vampire <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">(an original pairing I know)</font> were talking to each-other at the back of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">So why do ya, think she's feedin' us cakes and sweets and stuff, like is she tryin' to fatten us?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cindigo\">No, I think she just wants an excuse to have snacks herself</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Yeah she's gonna snack on us after she makes us fatties, like were flies to her</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cindigo\">No she's not... just shut up</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if the two were whispering it wasn't too hard to hear them as every one else was keeping quiet whilst doing their work.<br>\r\nLottie was slightly bugged by the chatter. Not because she wanted the class to remain silent but because she didn't enjoy hearing negative things about her cooking. Even if the negative thing isn't about the taste but instead about the motive behind the food, she still felt a little hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><i>I'm not doing this to just feed myself, with sweets or students. Pfft. I'm not that kinda of a monster. I do this purely to reward and inspire my students. By rewarding them for good work with sweets I'll have them opening up and fully participating in no time.</i></span><br>\r\nLottie spoke to herself inside her head, to reassure that she had a good reason to bake, besides just from the enjoyment of it.<br>\r\nTo her credit the sweets actually had helped to get some student to do more then just sleep through the class. Though the majority still didn't pay that much attention so rewarding them was difficult. That's why Lottie had started to give every one a treat at the start of the class. I mean wouldn't it be just plain mean if you gave others sweets while others didn't get any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the students did eat the goods Lottie handed out and the one's who didn't at least gave them to those who did. One of the students who actually put effort to study in this class was a gorgon, who was the stereotypical nerd. And thanks to her efforts and knowledge she earned a lot of sweets during the classes, and it definitely had started to show as she had started to put on some weight. Both the gorgon and Lottie were oblivious to the weight gain, well at least for now.<br>\r\nThere were also examples of students who didn't get to enjoy the sweets. One of these students was a 7th dimensional abnormality, who well didn't have a mouth or a need for food. Lottie just hoped that they appreciated the sentiment but wasn't sure as the abnormality also didn't communicate. <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">(Don't ask what a non communicating abnormality is doing in English class)</font>.<br>\r\nOne other student who didn't always get to eat the sweets was a ghost girl. Now you might think she couldn't enjoy the food because ghosts can't digest things, but that's just a false rumor. They totally can digest food but its just very slow, which has lead to people grabbing the food through her body before it disappears. Now who is willing to eat cupcakes covered in ectoplasm is a question that will be left unanswered for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class went on as normal, with Lottie being much more interested in the subject then her students were. Some sweets were handed out as rewards and there was some more whispering. Peoples choices in topics varied from the sweets to where did miss Dectus produce her web from. The amount of people who actually learned something from today's class was low, but no-one minded the boring class with snacks when the other morning class would have been PE being taught by a head in jar.<br>\r\nThe class finally ended on game of Kahoot <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">(yes, Kahoot is being used in education even in a school for monsters)</font>, which finally got more then just a few people to participate in something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the students left the class, Lottie took a moment to relax as the many cups of coffee were finally starting to wear off. She then started to pack her bag and turned towards the door to her classroom, where she noticed someone standing, seemingly waiting for her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Normally when a teacher had wanted to talk to Lottie, it ended up with other teacher criticizing Lottie for handing out treats or she would get some inconvenient task that the other teachers were too busy to do. Still being the newest teacher in Arcana High Lottie didn't think much of this, but still didn't enjoy being treated less competent just for being young. But this seemed different.<br>\r\nThe teacher, who was waiting for her out side the classroom, was Jyula Nyxisha, a Nagi <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">(Nagi being the female form of a Naga)</font> who taught math at the school.<br>\r\nJyula was around her late 20's. She had straight long black hair and had classes. She was about 12 ft long, of which 9 ft was her dark green tail. Her usual posture had her at just below 6 ft tall. When counting her tail she weighed about 384 lbs. Now that might sound a lot, but her human half only weighed 96 lbs, so if she would have had legs instead of a tail she would have weighed around 160 lbs at 6 ft. Jyula was wearing a dark blazer and black skirt. <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">(Being a nagi she kinda had to wear skirts)</font>. Her scales continued up from her tail to her human half in spots, mosly on her arms and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLottie approached the nagi, who was now nervously adjusting her glasses. Hoping that this time she wouldn't have to do other's task, Lottie put on a smile and began the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Hi! Is there something I can help you with?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">No... I just wanted to ask if... well.. would you like to come to lunch with me?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Oh. I'd love to</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLottie definitely wasn't prepared for what Jyula had asked her. The unusual kindness from a coworker combined with awkward way Jyula had asked had gotten her off-guard and she had replied without thinking. Though after a moment of processing what happened, Lottie didn't feel like this would be a bad thing. This far none of the other teachers had to tried even socialize with her, well besides one of PE teacher who was well kind of an perv. It would probably be fun to get to know someone. Lottie was slightly surprised Jyula had come to talk to her. According to other teachers Jyula was very shy and didn't usually talk to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women just stood around for a moment, neither really knowing what to do now. The silence what quickly interrupted when Jyula let out a tiny screech. Lottie looked behind Jyula to see a student quickly run after they had apparently stepped on Jyula's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Are you alright? Those students never seem to behave.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Thanks. Yeah I'm fi-fine.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">So, should we go have lunch then?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a reply Jyula just smiled and nodded at Lottie, while starting to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two eventually made their way to the cafeteria where they both got an modest lunch. A few times Lottie had to use one of her extra arms to save a plate that Jyula had accidentally dropped while awkwardly slithering out of other people's way. When they had sat down at their table, to Lottie's surprise she managed to get a conversation going with the shy nagi. Well it wasn't interesting conversation, being about the school, but still it was a conversation. Eventually the conversation started to get more comfortable as Jyula no longer stumbled on her words and Lottie began feeling like she could be her usual energized self without appearing too obtrusive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">So, is there any specific reason you asked me to lunch with you?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Jyula replied with a red face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Well I just thought that, you're still the new teacher and all. And maybe you  would  like to have some one to talk and stuff. Some of the other staff are a bit, well self absorbed. And before you I was the new one and, well I would have wanted some one to talk to, and so I though I should like at least ask you...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBit surprised her new friend was able to give such an long answer, Lottie picked up her basket of sweets she had carried with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Well I appreciate the gesture. Now would you like a cupcake, for dessert?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Oh, I'd love one</span>\"  Jyula took a cupcake, almost tearing up from the nice gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Be free to have more, there's plenty more where that came from. I <i>may</i> have gone a little overboard last night.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">So you like to bake?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Bake and cook. It's a passion of mine, right behind teaching of course. Being a good cook runs kinda in the family. And well the students seem to enjoy the sweets, and it has gotten them to work a little harder too</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">You're not worried about, umm, gaining weight?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLottie was a bit put back by the idea of weight gain. She hadn't really ever thought about it. She didn't think her cooking would affect her weight. I mean she cooked more things then just sweets. But on the other hand that food wasn't that healthy either and it had been a while since Lottie had exercised. But still Lottie couldn't imagine that she could have gained or could gain weight from her cooking. Maybe, <i>mayybe</i>, she could have filled out a couple pounds but there was no chance she would ever gain more, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Not that you're fat or anything! I just...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">No, it's fine. I'm not worried, us spiderfolk have great metabolism.</span>\" Lottie stated this as if it was fact, when really she had no idea about the truth of her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Oh, really? Well I really, really like the cupcakes.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Thank you</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation continued nice and simple eventually trailing back to talking about school. During this time Lottie had a couple of her own sweets and Jyula had about 4. After short while people started to get up and leave the cafeteria, and so Lottie an Jyula also decided it would be a good time to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Hey, it was nice talking to you. Thanks for inviting me.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Yeah, thank you too. Umm... see you around?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women parted ways, going to their respective classrooms. Lottie waved at Jyula, only to see her nearly stumble over for not looking where she was heading. Nonetheless Lottie seemed very pleased with this day. She had managed to make a new friend, a shy and clumsy friend. Maybe now she would feel more like a part of the school staff, but she did still have to figure out how to get her students more interested in her teachings. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the rest of the week it became the norm that once it was lunch-break and Lottie exited her classroom Juyla would be there waiting for her. Lottie definitely enjoyed the company even if Juyla was an extreme introvert, only getting less talkative since their first lunch together. Lottie didn't mind though, she just enjoyed having company, and now she at least had someone to talk to about her ideas on how to get her students interested in her English classes. This far her classes had carried on the same, with Lottie being much more enthusiastic about the subjects than the students were. Juyla hadn't been much help to Lottie, but Lottie had managed to drop the idea of having her students perform a play. Though she might have only gotten rid of the idea when she realized she wouldn't have time for all her grand plans before summer break, plans such as building a full set and having the students learn how to sing and dance. <br>\r\nNonetheless she was still trying figure out what to do to have her class be the best English class that there was. While telling her grand ideas to Juyla, the shy nagi mostly ate in silence sometimes replying with \"<span class=\"cgreen\">yeah... sound great</span>\" or \"<span class=\"cgreen\">I'm sure.. if.. you know..</span>\" or \"<span class=\"cgreen\">could I have another cupcake?</span>\". The last being the most common. In fact Juyla had eating more and more of Lottie's baked goods and it had added a couple of pounds on her figure. But Lottie was oblivious to this as she was more focused on talking. But Juyla wasn't the only one who had been snacking more. Before having company during lunches Lottie hadn't had a reason to bring out her treats, but now that she did it had become a habit for her to also enjoy a couple of cupcakes, muffins, donuts or whatever she had made for the day. And as she focused on talking she wasn't paying attention to how many treats she was having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther teachers had become aware of Lottie's and Juyla's apparent friendship. Some had even stopped giving the newbie their extra work as they didn't think they could get away with it anymore. This far the staff had known about Lottie giving treats to her students as reward but now that they saw how much food she seemed bring with her after she and Juyla had started to eat it together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lunch-break on Friday as Lottie was telling Juyla about a book that she had given to her students to read. Both women had finished their main meals and had moved on to the donuts Lottie had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">And because of this expansive world building and the personal growth of the main character, I feel this is the perfect book to read\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">But isn't it... umm kinda  long</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Long? It's just 2000 pages. It's a perfect length for students</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">It's just that....</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuyla quickly stopped talking as she saw someone approaching their table. As Lottie realized Juyla had stopped talking she turned around to see what she was looking at. In front of her now stood a man she could recognize as another teacher. They were a tall demon dressed in very fancy suit. They had dark brown hair and reddish skin. They were about 6'4 and weight around 120 lbs. Even though Lottie was able to recognize this person as a teacher she didn't actually know who this person was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Miss Nyxisha, it appears you've managed to make a friend.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuyla just remained silence, while her face was turning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Seems you still can't open your mouth, well apart from eating.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Excuse me, but who are you?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Hmph. I am the head science teacher Percival Bazomen. Surprised that you don't know my name.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Well, I'm Lottie...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">I know who you are Miss Dectus. You're the newest member of our teaching staff. And you've gotten yourself a quite the reputation for feeding the students.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Well I just try to inspire my students, and rewarding them has worked.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Inspire. Well it seems your snake friend is very inspired to eat more.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Hey! I just....</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Juyla had started talkin Percival had already turned around and started walking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">I hope your inspirations can keep you from being terminated</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Terminated? What did he mean by that?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">You.. you don't know?  They.. the school board terminates teachers who don't perform well.. I was almost...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuyla turned silent once again but Lottie was able to gather this was a sensitive subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day continued normally, with Lottie teaching her classes. Most students still bored out of their minds while Lottie gave one of her loooong presentations. Some treats were handed out when she got to the part where she started quizzing the students. Everything went on as normal until the end of the day. Lottie's mind began trailing back on what Percival had said. Could she be terminated. Why would she? It's not like her students don't listen to her. It's not like her students grades getting lower. Oh no! That's totally the case. But she could turn things around. She had to. There was no way that Lottie Dectus would loose her teaching job, not when she hadn't been a full time teacher even for a year yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLottie had been lost in thought during the last class of the day. She had managed to get everything done but hadn't been interacting with the students much. This lead to her having leftover donuts that weren't given out. These donuts were now helping Lottie distract herself from worrying about termination as she walked out of the building. On her way to her car she spotted just the person she didn't want to see. Percival. And as Percival was walking past Lottie, he noticed Lottie's stressed expression and the donut she was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">You know stress eating is bad for you. Or are you looking for inspiration?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smug expression the demon walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last straw. Now it felt to Lottie that Percival was purposely trying to annoy her. Whether it was because she was still new or because of her use of food in her education, Lottie wasn't sure why Percival would do so, but now she wanted to show to Percival and anyone else that she wouldn't be terminated.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the arachnid arrived at her apartment, she knew what she would be doing this weekend. She was going to invent a solution to her students poor performance. No more would there be sleeping monsters in her class. No more would there be people failing. No more would she be at a risk of termination. And most importantly, no more would people like Percival think she wasn't cut out for the job.<br>\r\nBut the question was, what exactly could she do to turn things around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLottie stepped in her home and put her bag and basket of leftover sweets down. Her apartment wasn't much. It was small and cramped, but working as teacher for half a year didn't pay enough to afford better. She had a small cramped bathroom and a bedroom that could fit much more then just her bed. The kitchen and the living room were one single room, that Lottie used as her work space. Even with its problems Lottie couldn't complain about the apartment. It was cheap, within walking distance from the school and the kitchen served its purpose very well. <br>\r\nLottie went into her kitchen and got to work. She started to brew some coffee, as she was starting to get tired. Then she began on her dinner, basilisk tongue with a side of rice. And while she was doing that, she also started on making some brownies. Multitasking is easy for someone with six arms and years of cooking experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile cooking and for the rest of the night Lottie was brainstorming solutions for her problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cgrape\">What could I do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's obvious that the students aren't interested in the topics. Sad but obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't really change the subjects.. maybe I could do more performing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, that hadn't worked in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the idea of the play was probably a bad idea. Not that I there was time to even do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis far nothing I've done has worked well. But I've tried so hard.<br>\r\nI've done my best to be the perfect teacher, but still my students are failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAm I trying too hard. Am I too eccentric. No... Yes.... Maybe....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe I'm just being a good teacher for someone like me, but not for them.<br>\r\nBut what are the kids into today? Partying? Fashion? Fighting? Drugs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could get to know my students better! Then I could tailor my teaching style for them specifically!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough that could be difficult. Some them are a bit... rowdy or edgy or radioactive..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe some teachers could help me. Though, they probably still see me as a newbie.<br>\r\nSo maybe not, if I want to avoid people like Percival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, not everyone can be that bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Juyla could help me. Or not. She seems little too nervous and clumsy.<br>\r\nBut still, she is the only friend at work I have right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArrgh.. What am I to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat has worked this far...   Something right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean rewarding them with my cooking has encouraged some. I think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould I raise the rewards? Would that work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if I bake more, would that get everyone interested?..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe I could get some new ingredients and learn new recipes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill that might not work..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to come up with something if I don't want to start letting people pass, when they actually don't perform well...</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLottie had already finished her dinner when she finally got too frustrated thinking about her issue. She headed to bed, tired and annoyed.<br>\r\nLottie plopped down on her bed, spreading all her limbs on her, almost room filling, bed. As she was falling asleep she look at a framed photo on her nightstand. In the picture were her many siblings. All together there were 50 of them, spiderfolk have a lot of children. In the middle of the picture was their mother, Sarri Dectus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">Mom, don't worry. Lottie Dectus will grow up to be the best teacher ever... some way</span>, Lottie mumbled as she fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to Monster City, U.S.A.! The only safe place for monsters in a world where death has no consequences, but Humans are still awful! Monsters of all ages can get a quality education at Arcana High School! Find employment with one of the many corporate empires, like Cryptids Inc.! Stalk the mall, roam free in the Wilds, and so much more! However, Monster City isn't a perfect utopia, and unfortunately, like every other city, there are laws. Let's take a look at some now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaw #1: Monster City is for everyone! Masculine monsters, feminine monsters, and monsters with forms incomprehensible to a mortal mind! Even monstrous humans are welcome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaw #2: Death may have no consequences when you can become any kind of undead abominations, or move on to a number of afterlives, but killing important people is still illegal (there's just so much paperwork involved...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaw #3: Some philias are just too weird, even for monster! All characters participating in adult activities MUST be older than 18 and MUST be willing participants! Rape and pedophilia will get you set straight to hell! And not a fun hell with the hookers and gamblers, either! The hell where every day you face a new torment for all eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaw #4: Don't add a chapter you wouldn't be satisfied to read yourself. A weird law in universe, I know, but monsters are weird. You can't expect everything to make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaw #5: Everything must make sense. Just kidding! Internal logic is appreciated but not required. The real Law #5 is fetish regulation. After the Event of '89, weight gain is the only expansion allowed. Pregnancy, lactation, BDSM and pretty much everything other than scat, vore and gore is allowed if you give a heads up first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaw #6: This is a story about monsters, so reality has been thrown out the window, but it's still a story, so making someone a million pounds in a second, while possible, is hardly very entertaining. So don't do that... What? I JUST told you not to expect these laws to make sense in universe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's all the laws that apply to you. For now. Just like in any other city, laws can be unilaterally added, changed and removed with no warning (shut up)! Before adding a new chapter, be sure to read them again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last thing! This is my first story allowing weight gain for characters other than females! I am personally only attracted to women, but I will still endeavor to add non-female characters and chapters about non-female characters, because they're fun and interesting. However, I can't promise I will adding anything all that kinky about male characters, as that's something I'm not something I'm interested in. You are also not required to include or address anything you have no interest in,even if it was something from the previous chapter, just find a a way to let someone else do so if they desire to. This is a kinky story, but having fun with the characters we make together is another big part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, last last thing, for real. If you want to talk to me about anything, don't hesitate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinal, FINAL thing. This story is no longer a work in progress! Anyone can add to any chapter!</td>",
