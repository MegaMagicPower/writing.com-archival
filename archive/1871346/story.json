Now Dan being the over confident boy he is, begins to wonder around the store looking for revives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I think they put them. Over here,\" Dan says, running off in a random direction. Little did the boy know that the store kept all such merchandise behind the counter. Feeling lost Dan once again sent out his Haunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple ghost pokemon yawned as it appeared from its pokeball. \"Haunter this is no time to sleep, i need you help to find revives,\" Dan said angrily. Seeing his trainer was new and the fact a bit overconfident, Haunter used its telepathic power\u2019s to tell Dan that perhaps he should ask the store keeper if they have any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An excellent idea, so glad I thought of it,\" Dan said out loud, feeling rather pleased with himself. His Haunter however thought very differently. So finally with that over Dan made his way to the counter, where he was greeted by a tall man wearing a blue shirt and white apron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome to the pokemart, is there anything I can get for you?\" The man asks. Dan replies he is looking for some revives, which surprises the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well, yes we do but, a trainer has to have five gym badges on them before i can sell that item to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan was shocked, \"Five badges, I\u2019ve only just started, surely you can overlook just this once?\" Dan said with a gleam in his eye. The man didn't know what to do, he could really get into a lot of trouble for selling revives to Dan, but he also thought that Dan looked a careful trainer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now were out of money!\" Dan said angrily at his Haunter. \"(Hey there nothing we can do now except battle someone for some cash.)\" Haunter replied causully. \"Ok Haunter lets go find someone to battle and defeat in awsome battle!\" Dan yelled with fire in his eyes with Haunter waiting for him to finish unimpressed.</span></div></div>",

But Dan had no time to stop and think, he was going to have to battle day and night if he wanted to beat Red and so he carried on.

The Beedrill turns toward the noise of the yelling still angry at the two who hit him with the branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey genius i'm like 99% gas you might as well have thrown a ballon!\" Haunter yells. Dan replies calmly \"Ok I'm sorry I should'nt have thrown, also to your left.

Even though Dan isn't the greatest navigator, or planner, he was a respectable battler.  \"Haunter finish this with Shadow Ball.\" Haunter puts his hands in front of him self and charges a dark sphere, and unleashes it on the stunned Beedrill. The Beedrill flies towards tree fainting on impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that takes the pain of being lost away.\" Haunter remarks. \"Well thinking on your advise maybe we should head back, this map says we missed the Oreburgh Gym.\" Dan says looking at a map. \"Wait, YOU HAVE A MAP!\" \"Yeah mom gave it to me before we left.\" \"(Sigh) Fine, lets get going.\" Haunter turns and sees the Beedrill. \"Oh yeah what bout him.\" Dan looks at the Beedrill and decides....</span></div></div>",

Dan was happy to hear that, but all this had got them side tracked. He was never going to beat red at this rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you two, we\u2019re off to Oreburgh!\" Dan cheered running ahead.

(Note On the show most trainers seem to understand thier pokemon) The Tyrouge turns around ready for battle. Tyrouge jumps at at Beedrill ready to punch. \"Beedrill arial ace!\" Beedrill zooms at the enemy overpowering it. The Tyrouge pulls himself up and then uses Karate chop.

The impact was devestating Haunter was flung to wall of the gym cratering it, Dan calling him to check on his friend. \"Haunter you alright?!\" Haunter pulled managed to pull himself up to answer, though obviosly hurt. \"Alright meaning I can float around after flying into a wall then yeah.\" Dan began thinking of a new action Haunter was tough and would still fight if he had to, but he just hit a wall, and looks like Tyrouge may be able to beat the weakened Rampardos.

Yes! Yes! Yes!

The flower gets closer and closer until. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan that flower moving\" Haunter shouts waving it hands about like mad.

Haunter please no, not again!\" Dan said in horror as Haunter approuched him meaningly, his eyes turning red in a glare, his pody glowing. \"AAAHHHHH!\" Dan screamed as Haunter envolped him in a gas. As the gas dissapated Dan was standing in the same spot, his head and arms hanging down as if a puppet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular man, was staggering back in fear, his Glameow hiding behind him with it's ears down hissing at Dan. \"Hey kid you ok?\" The man said more in hopes of this not turning into what he thought rather then Dan's saftey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish Mortal! I was kept in that prison long enough!\" Dan said in ghostly voice that sounded like his voice in usion with Haunters, \"I will have my revenge on those who have imprisoned me! But first a little snack.\" Dan said devilishly turning to the muscular man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mans Glameow was now cligging onto it's masters head in fear, as he was now taking several steps back \" NO! NO! STAY AWAY FROM ME!\" The man yelled in terror as he broke into frentic sprint away from the possessed boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the man was out of hearing range Dan began joking with his regular voice\"OHHH your soul will be mine mortal!\" Dan laughed as the man continued to scream as he ran. \"Better then on Halloween last year eh Haunter, your getting better with those tricks almost thought I was a goner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaunter chuckled\"Oh it's nothing any ghost pokemon can do it, I just happen to good at it, but we have buisness to finish.\" Haunter said pointing to the Wind works building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right and Mr.Muscles here left these for us\" Dan said holding the keys to front door, \"So lets get going!\" Dan announced begining to march, before being stopped by Haunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on now, we don't know how many guys are in there and Beedrill is down, me and Tyrouge might not be enough, we should head back and fix him up, or if you don't want to go back we could use that revive of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan decided to.......</span></div></div>",

With that he strung into action and ran as fast as he could passing the small girl calling back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, i'll be back in two seconds!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl however didn,t know what to say back. She was confused about what she just saw. Still back with our young hero, he quickly dashes into the empty pokemon centre and stops dead just before Nurse Joy's counter. The nurse quite surpised at the entrance was about togreet him when Dan inturped her saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry no time. Pokemon. Heal...Bad guys..Windmill..please. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Nurse joy would ask why the rush? However this time she said nothing only nodding as she took Dan's pokemon and healed them in the healing machine as fast as she could. Dan impatiently began to jog on the spot wanting to go as soon as he could until finally after a few mintues Nurse joy came back with his pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go\" she said as Dan quickly grabbed them before dashing out again. He raced back to windmill once agian dashing past the girl saying, \"Dont worry i got it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrival at the entrance to the windmill couldn't be any better for as he opened the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
