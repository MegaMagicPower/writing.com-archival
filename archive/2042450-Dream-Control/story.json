Out of curiosity, you pick it up to see an Old coin inside with a piece of thread and beads strewn through the hole in its center. You thought it kinda looked like a old Ryo coin piece from Japan but you weren't too sure. Looking at the piece of paper you see writing on it, \"Coin of Dreams: Your wishes become the dreams of others!\" it read like some sorta pitch you would hear from a con artist in TV shows. After that read instructions, \"Wish for something on someone and their dreams that night will make them want to do your wish ever so slightly (repeat use for stronger effect). Just think of their name and face and make a wish! (Warning: Coin fancies himself an artist and will interpret the dream accordingly). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so stupid\", you thought to yourself but a part of you was kind of intrigued by the idea. You took the coin and decided to test it. What's the worst that could happen, am I right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to test it on...</span></div></div>",

Lauren's only saving grace is that she's attractive. If she weren't, no one would be able to put up with her. She has platinum blonde hair, a nice tan, C cup breasts, and a slim figure.

The blackboard was full of formulas, but they were so easy to understand, and she could totally hear everyone saying she was like sooooo smart. She giggled, that was totally the best class in her whole life. Someone was at her side, she really knew his name, but it was so difficult to remember, if he weren't so foggy and stuff she would totally remember. That person was looking at the blackboard, then at the things on the table, then to the blackboard again. Lauren giggled, that shadow was so dummy. She would help that shadow, after all she was the most smartest girl in the whole class. She explained him what to do, but he was so dummy, he forgot everything right after she told him, so she had to totally do everything by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her bed, Lauren smiled, she was having a happy dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had the opposite dream. You usually knew what to do, but today you hadn't understood anything, you were getting nervous, if you couldn't do anything, you would certainly fail. Suddenly, someone at your side spoke to you, that person was like a shadow, you couldn't realize who she was, neither you could understand what she was saying. The shadow took the... things on the table, you couldn't remember their names or what to do with them, and expertly used them. You realized she was doing the exercises. You were safe, everything was alright now. So you just stayed there, thanking the shadow with a radiant smile, trying to look as adorable as you could, somehow you knew that could work when you were in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your bed, you smiled, you were having a happy dream... maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up refreshed, as is you didn't care about something anymore. You couldn't point what it was, but you knew it was good to feel this way.<br>\r\nYour good mood disappeared in Chemistry class, you couldn't understand anything, fortunately and surprisingly, Lauren knew what to do, she even tried to teach you, but today wasn't your day, you couldn't understand something so simple that even Lauren understood without problem. So you just looked while she worked, the only thing you could do was smile at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were heading for your next class, everyone was talking about Lauren and how well she did in Chemistry, not the best topic for you. Fortunately, next class was Maths, and you understood everything without problem. From your desk, you could see Lauren, not paying attention and staring at the boys in class. That ditz was surely only thinking about one thing. Her Chemistry's skills were only luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were to bed still mad at Lauren and her suddenly knowledge. Without realizing, you took the coin in your hand and said \"Wish you were good at Maths too, right?\" just before felling slept.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your desk and bookcase was disorganized as all hell and covered in dust and your trash can was overflowing with snack bags and scraps of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way to the right most corner of the room which was your own little game space. While you did take care of your games, they were still very disorganized and spread out in a sporadic manner.

Your mom had been trying to get you to clean your room for while now and while there was still plenty of room for improvement that fact that you had actually took the initiative to clean was practically a time to celebrate for her. \"Wow, Bernie! Your room almost looks livable. I'm so happy!\" Her surprise was clear as her voice had gone up an octave with that remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just felt like cleaning and I ended up kinda enjoying it. You know, it was just sorta relaxing to get this outta the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is great!

Looks like I got a little lazy once my hamper was full.\" You estimated that all the dirty clothes made up about eighty percent of your entire wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom could only gave you smile with 'I told you so' written all over her face. \"Well, I wish that...</span></div></div>",

It grew to a point you couldn't bare it any longer. You felt compelled to change it. You were putting on different sets of your clothes but each outfit gave you the same feeling.

Did you want to hang out or something?\" You asked trying to test the waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like OMG, how did you know?\" She asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky guess.\" you lied. \"So what do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if we are like going to hang out, we totes have to go to the mall\", she said giddily, \"I want to check out some of the cute new clothes that came out and we can get something yummy to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou supposed that she just wanted to do what she would with her other friends, you weren't really interested in shopping but you had to get Shannon through her. \"That sounds great, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, totally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then spent the rest of the day being dragged around by Cassidy. She bought a bunch of new which were in her words 'the most cutest clothes in, like, the whole world' and went to a healthy food restaurant, you complained but, Cassidy blew you off and ordered some salads for the both of you. It was exhausting but, you felt like you were getting closer Cassidy, one final push and you could get her on your side to help you with Shannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I had a lotta fun, we should totes do this again!\" Cassidy said as you got back to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure. See ya later, Cassidy.\" You said with a little reluctance in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh-bye, Bernie!\" Cassidy giggled as she went into her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got back to your house it was already night time exhausted you took out the coin, \"I wish Cassidy was my best friend\", was all you could muster before passing out again.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nCassidy once again had another dream except this it her life for an entire year, she had gone through some great times and some horrible times but, at the end of each day she would to her room talk to her rock friend which was in the shape of Bernie's head. She talked about her troubles, her secrets and her joys to the rock at it made her feel better. The rock was truly her best friend until she woke up.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nCassidy once again to your house this time around 1 in the afternoon were she let herself and decided to talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, it is so nice to just talk with a friend, ya know?

She delicately held you by your hands as she guided you forward as you looked down you noticed that you were wearing some pink stilettos but, you found them cute on your feet and liked wearing them as you began to enjoy walking in them more and more Cassidy slowly shrunk down until she was normal size and as the two of you looked at each other and turned around you found yourself at a shoe store.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nYou woke that morning with a smile on your face. You could not remember any of the details but you did remember that you wanted to hang out with Cassidy again today and hopefully learn something useful about Shannon. It was about 10:30 in the morning as you got to Cassidy's house. When she opened the door, her face lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bernie!\" She was already dressed as well, having already finished her morning run and shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cass, I was wondering if you wanted to hang out today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of Course! Actually I wanted to go shopping at the mall again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shopping again already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I wanted to try on some shoes and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoes?\" You did not know why but trying on shoes with Cassidy sounded fun and she could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you want to try some on too?\" Her curiousity was peaked as well as ecstatic that you both wanted to go shoe shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, sure, I guess.\" You wondered why you try on some shoes with Cassidy but quickly put in the back of your brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Just let me get my purse. And then we'll go.\" Cassidy could tell it was going to be a fun day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive was quick and navigating the mall to the shoe store was quicker with Cassidy leading the way, as if she was laser targeted to the destination. You felt nervous going in and straight to the women's section with all the heels so you were playing with the coin in one hand as a form of stress relief. As Cassidy was looking at all the shoes you began to look around before a pair of shoes caught your eye. They were a pair of pink pumps with a slight platform a tall heel with a small strap with a cute pink bow affixed to the outer side of the heel. You couldn't take your eyes off it and eventually Cassidy noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bernie, you have good taste, do you want to try them on?\" Cassidy was completely serious and ecstatic to see your interest in the shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? N-no, no I...\" You were extremely embarrassed with your face turning the deepest shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy took you by the shoulders and faced with a dead serious face, \"Bernie, I didn't ask you to make fun of you but, because I can tell that you were interested in them, in my opinion I think they are perfect for you. So do you want try them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were touched by Cassidy's frankness and calmed down a little as you squeaked out a 'yes'. Cassidy then proceeded to down a pair of the pumps (making sure they would fit you) and handed the box to you. You were still pretty embarrassed but could deny the interest in the shoes. You sat down and put the coin down next to you without really thinking about it. You took off your shoes and socks and then proceeded to put the pumps on slowly. You had never worn anything like this before but once you put them on a small smile came across your face looking at how cute they looked on your feet as you felt a conflicting feeling of confusion, embarrassment and Joy from wearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cassidy was sitting next to you the whole time, who had absentmindedly picked up the coin as she looked at how happy you were wearing the shoes. She was so focused on this moment for you she had made another wish on you without even realizing it. The wish being...</span></div></div>",

You could not refuse the pinky promise but, you did not pose for her. She then proceeded to buy the shoes for you and even some white nylons just in case you wanted something with the pumps and a pair of black stillettos for herself. When you got home you could not believe you gotten such a girly pair of foot wear but none the less you had. The days events were so intense for you that immediately went to bed.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nYou had a dream were you had diary that you wrote all your secrets in as you close the diary the name 'Cassidy' was displayed in giant pink and purple cursive handwriting. You felt you could write anything in there safely, free from the judgement of the boys and girls around you.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nYou wake up from the dream much more relaxed than the day before but you needed to see Cassidy as soon as possible you even decided not to bring the coin and decided to bring the pumps and nylons with you as you wanted to talk about them.

I feel so conflicted about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what, Bernie?\" She could already tell what he meant but asked anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About the shoes, I feel like I shouldn't like them but, but...\" You couldn't find the words.

I am a guy!\" You were getting frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? If you like them, then you like them. Being a guy doesn't make it a bad thing. If you want to do it then you should do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she manage to convince Bernie?</span></div></div>",

You feel embarrassed about about getting girly shoes, but you also feel happy about them, but you're afraid someone will find them and make fun of you for it.  You just feel so confused, and you wish someone would come help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then notice Cassidy enter the room, though she looks different.  She looks like Michelle did at 16, with long wavy brown hair and your families gray-blue eyes.  But Cassidy seems warmer than Michelle, more friendly.  You never felt like you could talk to or just hang out with Michelle and be friends, but Cassidy gives that aura.  She walks over to you and hugs you close, and you immediately feel at ease as your previous confusion and apprehension just vanished without a trace.  A smile came to your face as Cassidy sat you down on the bed and started talking to you about shoes and style and women's footwear.  You didn't really notice what she was saying, but it didn't matter.  It felt like you finally had a big sister you could look up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke at about 9:14, feeling very refreshed and energized.  You didn't really remember your dreams from last night, but you knew they were pleasant.  And now you were looking forward to another day hanging out with your new friend Cassidy.  No, she was more than a friend.  You realized she was more like an older sister to you than just another friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is that weird?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, I've always wanted to be someone's big sister!\" Cassidy replies, thrilled to be able to finally have a student to teach in the ways of teenage girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day is a blur, but you enjoy every second of it.  First Cassidy takes you back to the massive clothing store you visited yesterday.  You spent hours in there trying out different outfits.  Initially you were hesitant to try on any more girl's clothes, and you never really got past shoes.  But you really did hang on every word Cassidy said, learning everything she knew about fashion and putting outfits together.  Eventually you went to eat lunch at the mall food court.  You were planning on getting something from the pizza place, but Cassidy suggested that you both eat at the low-calorie deli.  Cassidy always watched her figure, and while you wouldn't normally go to the deli you just felt that her advice was inherently trustworthy.  After lunch the two of you visit Cassidy's favorite salon.  You didn't figure much would happen here since Cassidy was only setting up an appointment for tomorrow, but she suggested that you both get appointments at the same time and once again you found yourself following her suggestion and you agreed to an afternoon appointment at the salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you both went to your respective homes, and you quietly carried two bags up to your room.  Cassidy had insisted on buying you more shoes, one pair of knee-high boots and one pair of sandals.  You didn't mind the girls shoes, Cassidy recommended them after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the day came to a close, and you were happy to have spent it with your \"big sister\" Cassidy. </span></div></div>",

This time, however, you were looking forward trying on some clothes this time. \"Hey Cassidy, can you help me try on some clothes?\" You request innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" she says as she takes you by the hand and eagerly whisks you away with her to collect a variety of clothes. She started with clothes that went well with your boots, so she selected a couple of form fitting jeans and picked numerous blouses and tank tops. She shoved you into the changing room and said, \"Okay, Try these on. See what you like, get a feel for how to combo your outfit and when you've tried on everything, pick the one you like best. I'm going to get something real quick!\" After she finished she happily skipped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outfits were easy enough to put on, you liked the form fitting cuts of the clothes and you tended to lean more heavily toward the blouses than the tank tops. After a while of trying out the combinations, you settled on a pair of light blue jeans and a lavender blouse. As you you left the changing stall to see if Cassidy had returned, you found her standing in front of you stall with another pile of clothes and a shoe box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!\" she squealed as she presented the shoe box to you, it was was a pair of black mary janes in your size. \"I got you these.

So what did you settle one?\" You showed her your selection and the two of sorted them into the 'buy' and 'not buy' piles and then you moved on to the next pile of clothes, which heavily features dresses, skirt, shorts and lingerie. You were delighted Cassidy had brought you so much to try on. Of course, when trying these on you had to ask Cassidy to help you put them on.

You vaguely recalled concerns about it being to girly, but now you realize that that's exactly why you were looking forward to it.  You had no idea that such girly and feminine activities as shopping and beauty appointments were so much fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Liza!\" Cassidy greeted the stylist.  \"I'll have my usual, and give my friend here the works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to let Cassidy arrange your styling, she knew everything about this sort of thing.  Liza raised an eyebrow to Cassidy and the two quickly whispered to each other.  You didn't really pay that much attention, you were too excited to get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dropping off your clothing purchases in the salon's lockers, Liza led you over to a sink where she began washing your hair.  You'd had your hair cut before of course, but never had it felt this nice.  Liza's scrubbing and massaging of your scalp made you feel slightly out of it, and you barely noticed as you were led over to one of the main chairs.  You could here Liza and Cassidy discussing something as Liza spread something into your hair.  You caught a few words here and there like \"stimulates growth\" and \"female customers\" but you didn't worry about it too much.  Big sister Cassidy was taking care of things.  Liza added some other product on your hair which smelled like citrus and made your hair feel much more bouncy and voluminous, even at its short length.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza then took you over to the nail station and gave you a manicure.  Your nails were short and rather rough, and most of the procedure was Liza filling them into nice, soft curves.  You remember Liza suggesting you grow them out and you really weren't sure why you weren't already doing that.  The though of long, beautiful nails was so appealing, you committed then and there to letting your nails grow long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour appointment didn't last long since Liza could only do so much with your short hair and nails.  Cassidy said she wanted to bring you back in a couple days after they'd had a chance to grow and you eagerly accepted.  Cassidy then showed you a selection of different lotions, moisturizers, and exfoliating gels available at this small skin-care store the mall had.  She purchased a few items for you and instructed you on their use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both went home after that, since the mall closed early that day.  Unfortunately you had school tomorrow as well so you couldn't just hang out at the mall all day.  Despite that, you really enjoyed yourself today.

You were planning on making friends with Cassidy so you could get to know Shannon better, but you'd lost sight of that in the last few days.  Not that you minded, you loved spending your days at the mall with your honorary sister, but you still had a major crush on Shannon.  Then you realized the solution:  you and Cassidy had become close friends by bonding over shopping and other girly activities.  If Shannon were to join you two, she would grow close to you as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Shannon wants to come and have fun with Cassidy and I at the mall next time we go.\" you say aloud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, you put the coin away and go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon wasn't sure how she got here.  She didn't usually go to the mall, but this didn't even look like the mall she remembered.  Everything here looked so fun and energetic.  Was the mall always this fun?  Looking around, she saw her friend Cassidy and a boy she kind of recognized having fun and enjoying themselves everywhere she looked.  And she could hear them calling out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come join us Shannon!  The mall is so much fun, you'll love it Shannon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like they might be right, and Shannon ran to join her friends in their fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark, and everything was new and strange.

That wasn't a girl's name, you couldn't be named Bernie.  You listened a little closer to the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brittany.  Our daughter Brittany.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany, that was much better.  A girly name for a girly girl.  You looked over to the side of the room and saw your big sister Cassidy standing over there.  She looked so happy to have a younger sister, and you could tell she was eager to teach you everything about being a girl.  You couldn't wait to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon woke up later than usual, after a very nice night of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should go to the mall after school today.  Maybe I'll call Cassidy and see if she wants to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke with a start, as you alarm signaled it was time to get up.  You looked around your room with dissatisfaction; it was too messy and really just too... boyish.  You decided that your room needed a major overhaul to be suited for a girl like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, girl?  You must still be sleepy, thinking something like that.  Still, you wouldn't mind being a girl.  And your room still needed renovations, and a feminine style was exactly what you had in mind.  Maybe you could buy some stuff for it when you went to the mall this afternoon.    </span></div></div>",

Piece by piece Cassidy took off her clothes, though she never got naked somehow, and put them on you, you were delighted to wear her bra, and her panties, then her dress over them, you looked over and saw that the two of you matched and it made you very happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke that morning with a smile on your face. You could not remember any of the details but you did remember that you wanted to hang out with Cassidy again today and hopefully learn something useful about Shannon. It was about 10:30 in the morning as you got to Cassidy's house. When she opened the door, her face lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bernie!\" She was already dressed, in a beautiful skirt and top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cass, I was wondering if you wanted to hang out today?\" you asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of Course! Actually I wanted to go shopping at the mall again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shopping again already?\" though something about the idea intrigued you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I wanted to try on some new clothes for the new season...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That actually sounds like fun\" You did not know why but trying on clothes sounded legitimately interesting, and she could tell you were being honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you want to try some on too?\" Her curiousity was peaked as well as ecstatic that you both wanted to go shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, sure, I guess.\" You wondered why the idea of clothes shopping with Cassidy seemed so fun, but quickly put in the back of your brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Just let me get my purse. And then we'll go.\" Cassidy could tell it was going to be a fun day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive was quick and navigating the mall to the store was quicker with Cassidy leading the way, as if she was laser targeted to the destination. You felt nervous going in and straight to the women's section with all the dresses and skirts, and girly tops<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you were playing with the coin in one hand as a form of stress relief. As Cassidy was looking at a rack of dresses you began to look around before a pair of cute dress caught your eye. it was flared, and greyish-purple with sequins. You showed it to Cassidy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow That is super cute, you have good taste. She goes to try it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, you feel an odd jealousy at that moment, and even more so when Cassidy shows it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/bebe/rbb-257740-ivn-i1?\" target=\"_blank\">http://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/bebe/rbb...</a>$Thumbnail4Across$<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looks great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have good taste, do you want to try It on?\" Cassidy was completely serious and ecstatic to see your taste and style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? N-no, no I...\" You were extremely embarrassed with your face turning the deepest shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy took you by the shoulders and faced with a dead serious face, \"Bernie, I didn't ask you to make fun of you but, because I can tell that you were interested in it, more so than most guys would be, in my opinion I think You would look great in it. So do you want try it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were touched by Cassidy's frankness and calmed down a little as you squeaked out a 'yes'. You'd never wanted to wear girl's clothes before, so why did you say Yes? But you couldn't deny She was right, you did want to wear it. Cassidy then proceeded change out of it, and hand it to you on a hangar. You were still pretty embarrassed but could deny the interest in the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like some help getting it on, it takes some finesse to get a some dresses on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, if you would.\" You reply blushing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you entered the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down and put the coin down next to you without really thinking about it. You took off your shoes, then your pants and your shirt. You stood there in just your boxers blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy helped you step into the dress, and zipped it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou deflated a bit when you saw you're reflection, You loved the dress but Cassidy looked better in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe'll need to get you some new underwear to really pull it off. Wait here.\" Cassidy said dashing out of the dressing room and returning minutets later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's a padded bra, some padded panties, and a waist cincher, with these you'll look better than me in that dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it. Trust me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy helps you out of the dress, has you change into the panties, puts the bra on you and wraps the waist cincher around, tightening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try the dress on and are delighted, your dress hugs your created curves and you love how it looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never worn anything like this before but once you had it on a small smile came across your face looking at how cute you looked in this outfit, you felt a conflicting feeling of confusion, embarrassment and Joy from wearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cassidy was sitting next to you, watching you primp in front of the mirror, She picked up the coin absentmindedly as she looked at how happy you were with your new outfit. She was so focused on this moment for you she had made another wish on you without even realizing it. The wish being...</span></div></div>",

In Cassidy's dream she was hanging out with Shannon and other friends at the mall, where they where all trying on clothes and talking about the latest episode of <i>Keeping up with the Kardashians</i>, but for some reason, all the clothes she tried on, felt prickly and irrating, and all the clothes that were there looked ugly. Also Shannon and the other girls kept talking about the Kardashians, but Cassidy hadn't seen the episode, soon enough Shannon and her other friends just excluded her from the conversation, and to be honest, the show was talked about in such a gross way that Cassidy became so fed up with the conversation that she didn't want to watch the show anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen out of the corner of her eye she spotted Bernie at the video game store, and he looked to be having fun playing a game in there. Being fed up, Cassidy told Shannon that she was not having fun and that Shannon should act more like the best friend she was, and make the trip more fun for all of them. Shannon, to Cassidy\u2019s surprise, told her to walk away and that she was dragging the rest of the group down. She couldn\u2019t believe her best friend did that, but she just left the store and looked for Bernies friendly face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she went into the Video game store, Bernie was there and welcomed her with open arms and a hug, which she needed right now. Then she asked what Bernie was doing there and he said that he was playing a demo of a video game coming out next month. He then asked her to play, to which Cassidy was hesitant. But the controller in her hands felt natural, so she tried it out while talking to Bernie. To Cassidy\u2019s surprise, she found it really fun, there was a competitive side to her that she didn\u2019t know she had and it started to come out. After the game Cassidy and Bernie walked to the food court together, and she just felt she could be so honest with him, and he was always warm and receptive. At the end of the conversation she asked Bernie a question, \u201chey do you think me and Shannon are still going to be best friends after this?\u201d to which Bernie responded, \u201cHey sometimes people outgrow each other, and if your feeling that way with Shannon, that sucks, but remember I\u2019m always here for you and you can always count on me\u201d .To that Cassidy smiled and hugged Bernie, lucky she could find a friend like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy woke Sunday morning with a text from Shannon,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey do you want to go shopping today with me, we can get that dress you wanted, otherwise I\u2019m stuck at home for the day\u201d<br>\r\nCassidy thought about what she wanted to do, normally she\u2019d love to go shopping with her friend, but now she wanted to see how Bernie would be as a shopping partner.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m just too busy today, but we\u2019ll go to the mall some other time\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she texted Bernie, thinking about how crazy she was wanting to go shopping with him instead of Shannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey can I come over then we can go to the mall, I want to see how good of shopping partners we are.\u201d<br>\r\nto that Bernie responded with an \u201cok just come over anytime you want\u201d.<br>\r\nAfter that Cassidy got dressed after a half an hour and walked next door and went up stairs to Bernies room, where Bernie greeted her, when she saw Bernie, something in the back of her mind told her to hug him, to which she gave in. She initiated the hug and the hug felt so warm and comforting that it was hard to let go. After which Bernie need to take a trip to the bathroom before he left, but left his online computer game running. When Bernie was in the bathroom, Cassidy watched the computer monitor, almost mesmerized by it with herself thinking, \u201cwow that looks kinda fun, I bet I could be the best at that game\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Bernie came back to his room the two went to the mall, Where Cassidy had her eye on a cute outfit for awhile that she was finally going to buy. But when she got there, she tried on the dress and she felt itchy, which never happened before the previous time she that outfit on. Cassidy then searched around the mall for an outfit that would work, but she kept picking out mismatching outfits. Then Cassidy looked at shoes, and again she couldn\u2019t find a pair she liked. What was more weird is that usually she was really into shopping, but now it seemed more like a hassle and a lot more boring than she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time, Bernie just kept sitting down and played a really cool looking game on his phone, while Cassidy shopped. Cassidy really appreciated Bernie patience with her and glad he didn\u2019t make her feel judgmental at all for taking up his time. To be honest, during shopping Cassidy wished she was the one playing the game (it looked really fun to her). After Cassidy was done looking, she decided not to buy anything (yet) for her fathers company event coming next Sunday.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was done she asked Bernie, if he wanted to go anywhere. Bernie then stated that he wanted to check out the video game store to see if they had any good deals on video games. On her way there Cassidy got more excited, she really wanted to see what Bernie was into, and when they got to the store Cassidy was not disappointed. Instead of Bernie just checking out the video games while Cassidy looked on, she actively participated in Bernies looking around. She asked Bernie what video games he had and what you do in them, and to be honest, all the video games sounded cool and interesting to her. So much so that to visitors of the store, it looked like Cassidy was big into video games and that Bernie was just a casual player. At the end of the search, Cassidy and Bernie played each other in a demo of a video game, and even though Cassidy lost, it was the most fun she had all day (the game was just full of excitement, every move she made was important, and the controller felt liked it belonged in her hand).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she went back to Bernies and played all his video games, learning how to play them, and she had such a blast learning. (she was worried that Bernie would think she\u2019s weird, but Bernie had been so friendly and kind that she could trust him with being herself). She had such a blast that the annoying texts about fashion she got from her friends she just left ignored, it was so out of character for that Shannon ended up calling for her to make sure she was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Cassidy tried to watch Keeping up with the Kardashians, (She was the biggest fan of the show out of all of her friends) but she found the show so annoying that she texted Bernie what he was watching which he replied Aliens, and when she turned it on she was hooked and texted Bernie through the whole movie, loving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Cassidy went to bed happy, thinking of all the fun her and Bernie had. Bernie, meanwhile went to bed looking at the Dream Coin, curious as to how it worked. He was glad he was now becoming best friends with Cassidy, but confused on how it worked (I mean why would Cassidy now hate fashion, and love video games, did the coin change her personality so that they could become best friends? there was just so many questions now). Bernie decided he would wait a week before touching the coin again to see the effects of the coin for a week.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Week later<br>\r\nThe week that passed was a weird one for Cassidy, every night she kept having weird dreams. Like one dream was that she was sent to an all girl boarding school with a mean teacher, who stressed that girls should focus on doing girl things like shopping or fashion, and just do what other girls do. Another one was Cassidy in the future becoming a professional gamer, while Shannon texted her how great it being a stay at home housewife with a boring life (Cassidy couldn't imagine anyone having fun in that kind of life). But the Dreams all ended the same, with Bernie being right by her side, always helping her out (her loudest fan as she won a gaming championship, or helping her escape from that awful school) and trying to make her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy non Dream week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Monday in Science, after listening to her other friends talk about Chloe Kardashin, (which now sounded like nails on a chalk board), She told the group she was going to be Bernie\u2019s partner, in order to save face (in front of her group which consisted of the cheerleaders) she said that she might have a crush on him and she was going to find out whether he was a keeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that speech, she spent with less and less with her Cheer crowed and more and more with Bernie. For instance, Cassidy usually was at a cheer leaders house after cheer practice 4 out of 5 days on school days, but this week she only spent one day with the Cheer crowed and that was on Wednesday their annual mall day where the girls just looked at clothes together and had fun. But on that Wednesday Cassidy was determined to get something to wear for her dad\u2019s big company event on Sunday, but when it came to shopping Cassidy was just so bored and unmotivated that she texted Bernie what to do (He told her that if she didn\u2019t like anything don\u2019t buy anything and they could go this weekend).  What was worse was that she was the fashion expert in her group, so when the other girls came to her, she had to act happy and try to help them out, even though she lost her fashion touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool wise, Monday, Tuesday Wednesday Cassidy ate lunch with her cheer friends, but just found that her interest didn\u2019t align with the cheer group, so now Cassidy felt left out. So on Thursday and Friday, she ate with Bernie (using the double excuse of being project partners, and potential romantic leads). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter School wise Cassidy still went to cheer practice, but during that time she thought about video games and Sci-Fi films and couldn\u2019t wait to see Bernie, and after cheer practice she would go see Bernie at his house and just have fun by talking video games and movies with him. During the weeknights (except Wednesday) Cassidy played video games and got progressively better. When she was playing, Bernie would ask her questions about how her life was and how she was feeling, and if there was any gossip amongst the cheer leaders. Cassidy just felt great that she had someone to talk to about this, and she was really happy that Bernie took interest in her life. As the week went on Cassidy tried to find extra time to spend with Bernie (she thought about quitting the cheer team), she ultimately decided to save time to not changing in the school shower and wearing her cheer uniform to Bernies (which happened on Thursday and Friday)<br>\r\n. At the end of the week, Cassidy began thinking of shifting her group of friends to Bernie, cause when she was with him, she was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernie\u2019s week<br>\r\nBernie\u2019s week was weird, First Cassidy became his science partner (which he liked), but then Cassidy went full on best friends with him by texting and snapchats him (Cassidy loved it when he replied). Also of note was Cassidy\u2019s wanting to spend more time with him, texting Bernie that the cheer girls bore her with all the fashion and reality tv talk, that she just needed to relax with a friend. Cassidy spent 4 out 5 nights with Bernie (Bernie convinced her to go to the mall with her friends and by the text message she sent back to Bernie, he could tell she was not having a good time). During those night Cassidy would play video games with him or watch movies, and each night she would come over she became a little bit better at video games, and a little bit more interested in Sci-Fi, while complaining more and more about Fashion shopping (which Bernie never thought he would hear coming out of her mouth).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that time, Bernie did some psychological tests on her. He made her reveal all the gossip going on in the cheer team, had her reveal all of Shannon\u2019s secrets she held. Bernie also made her reveal all of Cassidy\u2019s darkest secrets. On Wednesday night Bernie really tested their friendship, after the mall trip, Bernie meet Cassidy for 5 minutes (before her curfew ended) and he planted the seed that they should see each other as much as possible over the next two days. The trial turned out to be a success when Cassidy thought about quitting the cheer team to spend more with Bernie (Bernie didn\u2019t want her to quit, because he was going after Shannon) which resulted in eating lunch together and Cassidy wearing her cheer uniform to Bernies to save time.<br>\r\nOn Thursday night Bernie pushed the limit even further, first he talked to her the Hola hopping was fun and had her do it in his room, next Bernie brought up the possibility of Cassidy having lumps, and he removed her top and felt her up. Even playing with her breast a little bit of wiggling it together and making a sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result of this experiment was that no matter what Bernie did, Cassidy was going to view it in the most positive light and reaffirm her friendship with him (after gossip she was glad Bernie took interest in her life, sharing secrets were now fun bonding moments between them, Hola hopping in a room was so ridiculous it was funny, and Bernie playing with her boobs really eased the mood of a scary situation). But Bernie was still really curious why she loved video games and Sci-Fi so much (that part didn\u2019t seem necessary for them to be best friends after what Bernie pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Friday, Bernie got that answer.  While Bernie was working on the science project, Cassidy was playing video games. A real bummer about being Cassidy\u2019s lab partner is that she\u2019s quite the airhead and horrible at science. After a while working on a project you noticed that Cassidy beat a hard level on a video game, to which she sighed with satisfaction. \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t see you beating that level, nice\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know, it was like really hard, by the way Burns (Bernie\u2019s new pet name), what are you doing?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m just doing the project, on how hormones effect the human brain\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know what, that probably happened to me on Sunday, I wanted to be Best Friends with you but this video game stuff seemed so boring so I made a wish that we could share more interest and boom, Hormones take action I\u2019m playing video games.\u201d<br>\r\nAt that point 15 alarm bells went off in Bernie\u2019s head, but he played it cool and did?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At that point, Bernie knew how the dream coin worked and it made sense why she developed interest similar to his. Since he knew how the coin worked now (and knew to be more careful with it), he wasn\u2019t afraid to take the next steps to test the coins power, but in order for his plan to work Bernie had to set it up right there and then. Cassidy wanted to help on the project, but she knew she wasn\u2019t good at science stuff, so he that to his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Cassidy, you ready to go shopping tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, no, that seems so boring, I\u2019d rather be here playing video games\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cAww come on Cassidy, all those years of shopping had to fill up great fashion advice\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah well it\u2019s stupid cause I don\u2019t even like to shop\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cHey curious question, if you could be the smartest student in the state, but you suffered from Fashion blindness would you take the deal\u201d<br>\r\nCassidy took a long pause, \u201cCan someone dress me and be my fashion advisor?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSince I\u2019m your best friend I get to be the one who dress you, and to sweeten the deal I\u2019ll have the best fashion sense in the state and you enjoy it when I dress you and shop with you\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve won me over with the shopping with you part\u201d.<br>\r\nBernie looked back at his paper (acting) and said \u201cRight now I wish that wish came true to help with this project\u201d<br>\r\nCassidy, distracted by her video game said \u201cYeah I wished that too\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the seeds planted, Bernie took it easy for the rest of the night. and once Cassidy left Bernie set his plan into motion and took out the dream coin out of the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst he made sure that Cassidy felt responsible for her personality changes, making her believe she ran into a genie last weekend that would grant her 3 wishes, but she wouldn\u2019t know a genie contacted her until after she made all 3 wishes (Bernie also wished that she wouldn\u2019t suspect Bernie of being behind this).<br>\r\nBernie made the 3 wishes be<br>\r\n(either that she wanted Bernie to be her best friend or the perfect boyfriend (she wouldn\u2019t know which))<br>\r\n(wish she and Bernie had similar interest)<br>\r\n(For her to become smart, but permanently fashion blind).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Bernie added that Cassidy could get angry at him(instead of the creepy always best case scenario to whatever he takes), but after 5 hours makes it easier to forgive each other. Also he made sure that she couldn\u2019t get mad at him until after that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he made sure that Cassidy would hate her role of dumb blonde, (including cheer leader part) but feel forced to fit into that role so no one feels suspicious of her. Bernie also made it that without him around she would slip her cover more easily. As the last condition, Bernie made sure Cassidy felt compelled to make sure Bernie and her were boyfriend and girlfriend, not for romantic reasons, but to make sure she didn\u2019t blow her cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the people around Bernie, He made sure his family didn\u2019t find it odd that he was able to date Cassidy, next he made sure Cassidy\u2019s parents would be comfortable with him being alone in Cassidy bedroom and them chill dating their daughter. Next Bernie (after much debate) made a wish that Shannon of not only to be suspicious of Cassidy, but also jealous that Cassidy gets to date him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Also obviously Bernie wished himself fashion smart with the coin and Cassidy a genius and the smartest student in the state).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bernie fell asleep he dreamed he was a fashion expert on a reality tv show, and throughout the show Bernie judged all kind of dresses and outfits, and noticed things down to the finer things that could make or break an outfit. At the end of the show he felt that he significantly helped fashion designer make beautiful outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cassidy fell asleep, She dreamt she was on stage being judged against other smart people, she thought she was going to embarrass herself up there, but when the judges asked questions, she found them so simple, even algebra was just math, and biology was simple, it was just easy memorization which she had. She remembered winning with Bernie right there in the crowd supporting her. Due to the win she next went on a game show, where she went on a game show and she spun a big wheel with the name of clothing items on it, and if she landed on a name she had to quickly get dressed in the item, she found the randomness so fun, she didn\u2019t even care what she put on. Finally, at the end of the game show,  the host turned into a Genie stated that her three wishes were up, and no he was gone from her life, and deep down Cassidy recognized the Genie and realized what the Genie was saying was true. With that the Genie puffed into smoke and Cassidy woke up in her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernie woke up to the sound of his phone going off, with the call coming from Cassidy. Bernie picked up and heard Cassidy \u201cHey umm, Bernie, please don\u2019t get made, can you just come over, Umm I need to see you as soon as possible, while my parents are still out\u201d. While on the phone, Bernie realized that the coin did it\u2019s job, as he started to appreciate clothes in his dresser  in ways he never did before.<br>\r\nWhen Bernie walked next door he received a text to just enter Cassidy\u2019s room. When he did it was a slight to behold. There was Cassidy in a corset, a dress, then a tee shit overtop with her wearing sweatpants that said \u201cJuicy\u201d on the butt, while wearing socks and crocs with her hair flipped over to one side of her head.<br>\r\n\u201cHey can I talk to you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy woke up with a clear mind, and felt great for the first time in awhile. She went to her backpack and started doing her math homework, which she found so easy that homework that would usually take 30 minutes and left her confused. After she was done her parents told her that she was going to the market and was wondering if she would like to come. She said sure and she just had to get dressed. After that she looked at her closet and absolute confusion came over her. Then she started thinking how she should look in public, she wanted to look nice, so a croissant and a dress were classy, but she also wanted to look relaxed so sweatpants it was, Then she wanted to look a bit rebellious so she moved her hair over to one side. Then she just wanted comfort so she took out the crocs in the back of her closet and put them on with socks. It was at that moment Cassidy remembered her dream, and realized what happened. She remembered the dream and a pit started to form in her stomach realizing the what happened. Cassidy then looked on youtube for fashion tips, but the tips just went in and out. She just couldn\u2019t realize what she was doing wrong. After that, she told her parents she wasn\u2019t feeling well and called Bernie to help out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bernie was there he asked what she was wearing to which she said she was trying to get dressed for the market, but failed spectacularly. At that moment Bernie asked her why she didn\u2019t just wear black leggings, and nice white teeshirt and and good sweeter with her washed hair just flowing down to give her a cute, but nice look. To that Bernie acted dumb and asked \u201cHey how did I know that?\u201d to that Bernie and Cassidy headed to the mall, on the way Cassidy explained the genie in her dream and how she thinks sub courteously the genie was granting her wishes and the dreams were a manifesto of those dreams. Bernie also lied and said he had weird dreams of him and Cassidy, becoming good friends. At the mall Bernie wanted to see how far the dream came true, so he left Cassidy at the mall and she shopped for 30 minutes, and she absolutely hated it, then after the 30 minutes Bernie joined in and Bernie knew the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of the fashion scene so for Cassidy\u2019s dinner the next day, Bernie picked out an outfit for her father\u2019s company meeting. During the checkout the casher was totaling up the on the outfit order and Cassidy also was doing the math in her head, and before the total was rang Cassidy out loud said the total price plus tax before the machine was done. Which she was proud of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back, Bernie talked to her about her new brains. He told her not to show off her brain too much as her raise in IQ would be suspicious, and that she had to act dumb in order not to raise suspicion to which she reluctantly agreed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Bernie and Cassidy do next?</span></div></div>",

The Dream only starts when they are asleep, obviously.<br>\r\n1. Only people touching the coin can make a wish.<br>\r\n2. People can not be given two separate wishes at once. (Wish--&gt;Dream--&gt;New wish)<br>\r\n3. The dream does NOT make major affects after one dream. The effects are small and bigger effects must be caused by making the same wish again the next day. Physical changes are also really small and don't start happening until after a large amount of the same type of dream has occurred for that person.<br>\r\n4. The dreams do not wear off or get stronger unless another dream has been sent to that person.<br>\r\n5. The Coin targets whoever you specify but, it interprets your request anyway it wants and makes a dream to reflect your desires.<br>\r\n6. People don't have to literally become what they are in their dreams, it is just a visual representation of the user's request.<br>\r\n7.
