But as he was putting on his jeans he felt two soft objects rise up against his back. <br>\r\n\"Good mourning Minato-kun, did you sleep well?\" A female voiced asked from behind as Minato immediatly turned red. He turned his head to the side to see none other than his alcohol addicted Sekirei, Kazehana, and it looks like she was already drunk. <br>\r\n\"Kazehana-san, your already drunk...so early?\" Minato asked as he felt a buldge in his pants probabl caused from the two soft objects pressed up against his pants. He tried to escape but Kazehana's inhuman strength proved to be to much.<br>\r\n\"Minato-kun, your not running away are you? Are you scarred that your going to lack?\" She asked nibbling his ear softly causing him to become more aroused.<br>\r\nSuddenly the two of them were engoulfed in ten gallons of water, causing both to snap back to reality. Minato's erection had quickly dissapeared cuasing Kazehana to lose her sex drive. And in the brief moment of weakness Minato escaped Kazehana's grasp and quickly crawled to the end of the room. <br>\r\n\"You perverted woman! How dare you touch my Husband!\" A blonde haired beauty yelled from the doorway. <br>\r\n\"And good mourning to you aswell Tsukiumi, how was you sleep?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't try and change the subject! You were about to have sex with MY husband!\" Tsukiumi walked over to Minato and bent over making the two eye levels meet. \"And you, you were aroused by her, weren't you!?\"<br>\r\n\"Tsukimi-chan, no I wasnt I swear!\" Minato said waving his hands back and forth with a slight blush on his face.<br>\r\n\"You were, I can tell when you lie!\" Tsukiumi yelled as she grabbed ahold of Minato's collar and raised him up into the air.<br>\r\n\"Minato is not actually your husband, just cus you say so doesnt mean its true.\" Kazehana interrupted as she brushed some hair out of her eyes.<br>\r\n\"How dare you question our undying love for each other, tell her Minato!\" Tsukiumi said looking back at her 'beloved'.Minato started to sweat in fear. <br>\r\n\"well, Tsukiumi, we need to have an actuall wedding you see...\"<br>\r\n\"MINATO!!!! TELL THIS PERVERTED WITCH THAT YOU AND ME ARE-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBANG, BANG, BANG, BANG<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Violence is no tolerated at my Inn...\" Miya said as she held her famouse whacking spoun, and at the same time both Tsukiumi and Kazehana had large bumps on their heads.<br>\r\n\"Sorry land lady...\" Both Sekiei grunted as they left the room. Minato took a large sigh of relief and looked at Miya. <br>\r\n\"Thank you Miya, I dont know what I would've done if you hadnt shown up.\"<br>\r\n\"No problem Minato, just remember I'm always here to help.\" Miya said as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato walked down stairs only to be greated by Matsu holding a box of junk and gadgets. She smiled at the sight of Minato and immediatly abandoned her box to tackle hug the man. <br>\r\n\"Minato, good mourning!\" She saidmaking sure her large breasts were brushing upagainst his chest.<br>\r\n\"And good mourning to you Matsu, although I'm suprised to see you out of your room.\"<br>\r\n\"Well you see I was just throwing out some old stuff.\" She exclaimed pointing to the box behind her.<br>\r\n\"What is in that box any way?\" Minato asked now curoius of its secrets.<br>\r\n\"Just some old inventions I never found use for.\" She said shrugging but then like a brick it hit her. \"Oh my god I forgot the other boxes, Minato no time to talk!\" She rushed past him and back upstairs. Minato looked back at the box and curiousity got the better of him. He walked over to the cardboard box and opened it up. After digging through some useless junk he finally found a ray gun like toy that intrested him.He looked on the side to see some words etched into it saying 'Shrink ray-number34-final product.'<br>\r\n\"A shrink ray? Why would Matsu invent this?\" Minato asked himself. But unknown to our hero the gun was actually being held backwards by our poor minato. His finger slipped as he was hit by a blue ray of light. He watched as the world around him grew larger and larger until he finally stopped at a pre designated height of 5 cenimeters. \"Wha!? It works it really works!?\" Then it hit him. \"OH CRAP IT WORKS! IT ACTUALLY SHRUNK ME!!!\" He looked at his surroundings. \"Aw man, I think I'm actually smaller then  Ku-chans pinky toe...\" But before Minato could even think of doing something else he felt the ground shake as he turned around to see Matsu walking back in. <br>\r\n\"Opps forgot this!\" She said putting the shrink ray back in the box and walking out of the room not hearing Minato's pleas for help. He tried to run after her but there was no way he could catch up to the goddess. He gave up hope as she turned the corner. He looked down and began to think of a way out of this. But once again his thoughts were interrupted as he felt the earthquakes again. He turned to see two impossibly large feet followed by equally large legs. It was none other than...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tsukiumi stormed into the room while mumbling horrible things about Kazehana and the other Sekirei as she took a seat on a near by chair. She sighed as she removed her foot wear letting her feet get some air. She wiggled her toes letting out the horrid stentch that now threated Minato's life. \"I wish that there was some way that Minato could be only mine, the ability to just pluck him off the ground and stash him in my pocket.\" She sighed. \"A girl can dream, a girl can dream.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TSUKIUM-CHANI!!!!\" Minato yelled for the thousanth time. It was no use, she was far to large to hear the bug. \"Tsukiumi-chan, I need you ...\" He muttered to himself but not before being hit by Tsukiumi's foot odor. \"To put those boots back on.\" Minato said being a smartass by completeing his prevoius sentence. However unknown to Minato and Tsukiumi, when an ashikabi is in desprate need of his Sekirei, the Sekirei is hit with something related to an alarm in their heads.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Tsukiumi said to herself after being hit with the 'alarm'. She was forced to search the ground and finally she saw him. \"What the?\" Tsukiumi stood up to her full height and striking a menacing stance over the bug sized Minato.

It was a terrifying sight, but Minato trusts in his Sekirei. Perhaps a bit too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskiumi lifted her stockinged foot above Minato, and quickly forced it downward. Seeing this, Minato jumped to side. The titanic foot barely missed him, and the shockwave knocked him a meter away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, bug, but your life ends here.\" She walked over to the bug, who was now running away from her, and prepared to stomp again. But this time, she was quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato ran for all his worth away from Tsukuimi. She would be the end of him! He took a second to look behind him, but then a massive weight hit him. All he could see was black, all he could feel was the floor and cloth, and all he could smell was Tsukiumi's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed down upon his body hard, until it felt like it was about to break.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tsukiumi was intruiged by the bug's precense, usually Miya kept the Inn spotless. After thinking about it, this was the punniest bug she has ever seen, a large ant could probably over power this speck in an instant. \"It's so insignificent....crushing it would be a waste of my time. But what bug could be so small? How could its species survive being such a pathetic height? Couldn't hurt to check...' Tsukiumi thought to herself as she began to lower herself down to get a closer look at the bug. As she drew closer, the bug started to aquire human charactristics, develping a head, arms, and leg, but she shook it off and told herself it was nothing more than a bug. Minato couldn't believe it, was his luck finally turning around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of bug are you?\" Tsukiumi's defeaning voice belowed still keeping its feminine sound. The moment those words processed into Minato's head his hopes shattered like a widow hit with a brick. Minato quickly snapped out of it when his shadow was engulfed by a far larger one. He looked upwards to see a giant hand that could've been mistaken for god's if not for its female traits. Minato was whisked off the ground and was now on the endless plain that was Tsukiumi's index fingernail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsukiumi-chan! It's me, Minato, I'm not a bug!\" He yelled at the top of his lounges to the blue eyed goddess. He tried jumping around while flaing his arms about, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure are a jumpy little bug arent ya?\" Tsukiumi said slightly amused by Minato's efforts to contact her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She still thinks I'm a bug..\" Minato said to himself as he slumped over then falling on his butt, but not before feeling something in his back pocket. He reached back and pulled out a black marker. His hopes were restored as he now had a plan to contact the water goddess. He un capped the black marker and started to get to work. Tsukiumi was puzzld as Minato ran across her fingernail leaving behind a black residue. Soon he was finished and now it was up to Tsukiumi to figure out the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats this? Tsukiumi...I...am...not...a ...bug...its me...Minato.....<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">MINATO!?!?!?!</font>\" She yelled finally putting the pieces together and nearly threatining Minato's life by almost knocking him off from her sudden outburst. She realized this and calmed down immediatly but soon that calm face was traded in for an enraged face. \"Minato....\" She said with a hint of anger in her voice and a twicthing eye to add effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Tsukiumi-chan, I can explain!\" Minato said now cowering in fear before the giantess that held him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine you have 1 minute, go!\" She belowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You see after that little fuss over me between you and Kazehana-san, I came downstairs to get some breakfast. Then I bumped into Matsu who was carrying a box of her old inventions. I was curoius of its contents when she left and found a shrink ray, but it turns out when I was holding it, I was holding it backwards. Then I accidently pulled the trigger and I shrunk. \" Minato hastily exclaimed, and since Tsukiumi was focused on him she could hear him clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, 38 seconds, thats alot faster than usually Minato...\" Tsukiumi said a little bit concerned. \"Are you afraid that I'm going to hurt you in such a weakened state?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ya. It's kind of scary not being bigger than a pinky toe.\" Minato said a little bit relieved that there was no harm coming his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minato, how dare you think that I would even think of hurting my beloved husband. Understand that you are my husband ashikabi and I am you sekrei wife. I would make sure no harm befalls upon you.\" Tsukiumi sent him a heart soothing smile and began to gently pet him on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great now all we have to do is find Matsu and end this nightmare!\" Minato said to his protective Sekirei. Tsukiumi was about to nod in agreement but words from the past floated through her head...' the ability to just pluck him off the ground and stash him in my pocket...' Soon Tsukiumi was dreaming of keeping Minato to herself all hours of the day. Dreams of Minato giving her foot massages that felt incredible due to his perfect size. Would she truely give up this one chance at keeping the man she loved all to herself and away from her competetors? Minato looked up at Tsukiumi who seemed to be in some sort of trance. \"Tsukiumi-chan? are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally snapped out of her day dream. \"Minato, I...</span></div></div>",

But don't worry, thats why I'm here to ensure your safety. I am your sekirei and your wife, so you my little husband can live without fear of anything.\" Tsukiumi exclaimed with an honorable smile knowing that there was no way that Minato could ref-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, thats a good one Tsukiumi! Now let's get back to the others and find out how to get me back to normal size!\" Minato said smiling up at her. Tsukiumi's smile dissapeared. 'How dare he,' Tsukiumi thought, \"how dare he think I'm joking!' Tsukiumi had to show that she was in charge, so she used the oldest method of control....fear. Tsukiumi raised her fist high into the air only to bring it down upon the tables edge taking out a large piece of wood. Minato had just barely out run the destruction displayed before him. \"Tsukiumi!? W-what are you doing!?\" Minato said looking back up at her with fear coursing through his microscopic veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm joking? Do you really think I'm joking!?\" Tsukiumi said bringing her face down and almost blowing away Minato with the force of her breath escaping her mouth. \"You know, I thought you would be thankfull that I am willing to protect you every second of the day in such a state. I was going to give you certain privleges, let you keep some freedom. But I just realized that my speck of a husband is in desprate need of his wife's help. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsukiumi, please don't do this. Look lets just calm down and...Tsukiumi why is your hand get-\" Minato was engulfed by the soft feeling skin that was apart of Tsukiumi's hand. He was being held in her fist, and judging from the constant feeling of going up and down she was probably walking somewhere. \"Tsukiumi, stop this right now! what has gotten into you?\" Minato's plea's went unanswered and Tsukiumi ignoored them focussing on where she was going. He decided it was probably best to just wait this out so he walked over to the most comfterble looking spot in her fist and layed down. It was suprrisingly calming, and the walking was comparible to rocking back and forth feeling that he hasn't felt in a long time. Soon he was buying a ticket onto the dream land express...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">MINATO WAKE UP!!!!</font>\" Tsukiumi's voice canceled out anyother sound around him, and he swore he could have felt the earth shake. He looked up as soon as his vision unblurred to see Tsukiumi unforgiving face starring down at him making him feel even smaller. \"Minato, I've decided the proper 'punishment' for your prevoius actions.And they are grueling and humiliating That is...if you say your sorry... and not just a simple I'm sorry I want it to be...Tsukiumi, my goddess wife I am sorry for even objecting your idea's, also will do what ever you please and I will obey all your rules.\" Tsukiumi folded her arms waiting for her apology. .....She looked back down at him. \"Well Minato? did you say it? I might have mishe-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying it..\" Minato declared in defiance. Tsukiumi couldn't believe this, still as defiant as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minato, you must be so small that not even my hearing can understand you...say that again...\" Tsukiumi dared getting closer to Minato so that her nose was touching his body and her eyes were looming over him. \"Well, what are you waiting for? say it again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato wasn't so sure about himself anymore. Tsukiumi was so large and up this close made him realize how large she really was. \"Tsukiumi...</span></div></div>",

I know I can count on you!' He replyed having bought the lie and now felt safe on the finger nail of his most protective Sekirei. How ever his words pierced Tsukiumi like a couple of arrows. 'Why does he have to be so sweet!?' She thought mentally kicking herself for lieing to him. She turned around and started to walk to her room making sure to dodge any Inn residents. \"Tsukiumi-chan, you know for a second back there I thought you were going to keep me for yourself. I can't believe I thought of you in such a way.\" And another arrow in Tsukiumi's heart. Soon both were in her room and she laid him gently onto the foot of her bed. \"Tsukiumi-chan when do you think everyone is going to get back home?\" Minato asked watching Tsukiumi  getting on her knees to stare down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sure that they will be back any moment.\" Tsukiumi lied again, the guilt killing her from the inside. Then her eye's opened wide with a brilliant idea. \"Now Minato its time we talked about some husbandly duties that you have been neglecting.

It must have been desprate to come inside the Inn if it could not find food anywhere else. And being such a small height must have life very difficult for such a being. \"Bug!\" She addressed Minato as she lowered herself to one knee and glared down at him. \"I am going to give you a chance to live a fear free life. No longer will you go hungry, live in fear of larger predators, or have sleepless nights in fear of what might befall you! I, Tsukiumi sekirei number 09, will be your new owner and protector!\" Before Minato could do anything else he was soon in the palm of Tsukiumi's hand and was rising upwards towards her face. Once he was directly infront of her face, Minato quickly realized how truely small he was. Her eye lashes were comparable to trees, and he didnt want to even think about her hair. She smiled gently down at him. \"So weak, so defencless, so small, and so cute. Just like my dear Minato.\" Her words were like bullets being shot through Minato's pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato sighed, there was no hope. He was simply to small, and being branded as bug proved that. \"Tsukiumi! Its me Minato!\" He yelled one last time, even though he knew it would go unanswered. Tsukiumi merely closed her fingers around him and rose back up. He was being thrashed around in the fist, hitting walls of skin and on come occations, Tsukiumi's thumbnail. But soon Tsukiumi's fist unravled, the light blinding Minato as he looked up at Tsukiumi. The sun transforming her figure into a godly silhouette. She truely was a goddess from his prospective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Left.\" She simply said. Minato scratched his head and looked to his left, life sparked in him as he just barely dodged an on coming finger. He picked himself back up and was breathing heavily. \"Right.\" This time knowing what she had in store, he turned to his right to see the finger coming back around. He stepped out of the way this time due to the fact he know what was coming and had an idea of what to do. \"Jump.\" This one almost caught Minato off by suprise but his insticts kicked in and he jumped as high as he could. But his efforts were in vein as Tsukiumi's finger was simply to large for him to jump over. He hit the ground landing on his butt. \"Up\" Minato's neck snapped upwards to see her finger now coming straight down upon him. He jumped to his right and dodged the harbinger of death that was his Sekirei's finger. \"Good, you can understand me!' Tsukiumi exclaimed now dawning a rarely seen smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato was out of breath and was struggling to get back up on his feet. If he was a Sekirei of a star athelet it would have been a piece of cake for him to dodge those fingers. But he was just an ordinary human, nothing special about him going on here, nothing intresting to point out, just a normal pathetic human being. \"Tsukiumi, your....going to...kill me...\" He weakly said, even though he knew she wouldn't hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsukiumi,\" Miya said from down the hall stoping Tsukiumi from doing anything further, \"I hope your not talking to an unwanted vistor....\" She said walking towards her room. Tsukiumi mentally screamed as she heard the footsteps getting louder and louder. 'No, I can't believe I forgot that Miya has a no pets rule at the Inn! Especialy bugs! But.' She looked down at her new bug and imagined that in its place was Minato (little did she know he atcually was...). In her imagination the little Minato was yelling up to her, 'Tsukiumi my goddess wife, please dont let her find me!' Tsukiumi snapped out of it and smiled. 'Its obvoius, all I have to do is put him in my pocket....' She picked Minato up and looked down. 'Gah! I dont have any pockets!' She thought no searching for an alternative. She looked down at her body and sighed, there was no option....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please forgive me for what I am about to do my little bug....\" She said down to Minato as he felt himself moving to an unknown location. \"Tsukiumi, what are you talking about?' Minato seemed to asked himself. Soon he was given his answer as he was being held over...</span></div></div>",

She wiggled her foot around inside her shoe until she found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha!\" Kazehana brightened immediately when she figured out the problem: one of her insoles was missing and walking around without it was making her foot ache. Her excitement faded quickly once she remembered that she didn't have a replacement. She pouted for a moment until a solution came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mina-toe,\" she asked, giggling at the pet name she had assigned him. \"Since I'm your sekirei, you're duty-bound to help me if I'm ever in distress, right?\" she asked in a sly and sultry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught completely off guard by the sudden question, Minato took the bait. \"Um, yeah I suppose I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" Kazehana exclaimed with a bounce and a clap of her hands. This motion caused Kazehana's ample breasts to jiggle in a fashion that Minato couldn't help but be mesmerized by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need?\" he asked absentmindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kazehana explained, \"one of my insoles is missing and I need you to replace it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Minato replied, still transfixed by her jiggling chest,\" I'll make sure to put it on the list for the next time we go shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but that would take forever. I can't wait that long. I need <i>you</i> to replace it.\" Kazehana lifted a foot and gently kicked off her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato still wasn't catching on, and the thunderous crash of the heel landing next to him was far too jarring to not distract him further. Before he knew it, he was face to toe with the colossal foot of his most mature and alluring sekirei. Kazehana wiggled her toes in Minato's direction, sending the sweet scent that radiated from her feet washing over him. Minato couldn't help but be surprised by the pleasant aroma. Though he supposed he hadn't spent much time sniffing the feet of his sekirei, he would never have expected anyone's toes to smell so intoxicating. He took a step forward, hypnotized by the slightly sweaty toes that continued to wiggle at him invitingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been steadily showing me the strong kind of man you are ever since we kissed,\" the wind commanding goddess went on. \"I'm sure the weight of a little thing like me will be easy to support,\" she giggled playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato was right up next to Kazehana's toes now, still oblivious her plan. At least until the massive toes reached out and grabbed him, catching him in a soft and fragrant embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you'll be moving into a new space here in Maison Izumo, I think you should get to know your new roommates,\" Kazehana teased, relishing the sight of her minuscule ashikabi's head poking out from between her big and second toes. \"I'm sure you'll be developing a very close relationship soon,\" she teased, as she slowly lifted her foot, along with her captured ashikabi, off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato was very confused. The grip that held him firm wasn't uncomfortable, but he still had no idea what was going on. He started to catch on to his giant sekirei's intentions when he realized he was hovering over the open top of her discarded shoe, but her toes suddenly released him before he could protest. The fall was a short one. He landed on the soft, moist sole of the heel and tumbled down into the toe section out of sight. Dazed and dizzy, Minato didn't quite register when the light entering the shoe disappeared. He looked up and was horrified to see the interior of the shoe being filled with Kazehana's aromatic foot, her toes wiggling with anticipation as they slowly approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazehana wait!\" was all he could scream before the humongous sole overtook him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muffled cry was inaudible to Kazehana as she giggled high above her imprisoned ashikabi. She slid her foot all the way into her heel, the futile struggles of her ashikabi sending waves of pleasure through her as he unintentionally massaged away the ache she intended him to relieve. Thoughtfully she gyrated her foot around the tight enclosure of her shoe, dragging Minato across the sole until she felt he was in the perfect position to replace her missing insole. Then, with a light stomp, the wind goddess set her new insole into place. A smile of contentment crept across her face as she relished the sensations of pleasure and power that rushed through her, knowing the man she lusted after was helpless underneath her dainty foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato could barely move. His entire existence had become a sandwich between two varieties of moist sole. He was coated in aromatic sweat. It was soaking into his clothes, and he felt like it would only be a matter of time before he would smell like Kazehana's feet forever. <i>Which wouldn't be the worst thing ever</i>, he thought to himself. All things considered, his predicament was somehow pleasant. He felt no pain, and he was far from dead as he might of expected to be after getting stepped on like this. The mountain of sweet foot flesh currently dominating him was soft, somehow comfortable to be pressed against, and gave off a calming warmth. He'd never considered himself to be into feet, but considering how lovely Kazehana's were, especially while they dwarfed him in size, he was warming up to the idea. He took a breath, a gulp of humid air making it to his mouth between small wrinkles in the soft sole pressed against his whole body. He found the smell of his captors feet to be intoxicating and overwhelming even when he wasn't breathing through his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could survive, and even be comfortable here, but he couldn't do much else. What would Kazehana do now?</span></div></div>",

They will be womndering where I am! And when they find out...\" Minato said hopping that Matsu hadn't thought of it. She laughed once more and poked him gently in the gorin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mina-toe, you really underestimate me. I thought about them already. How I dealt with that problem, you needn't know...\" Matsu picked up her ashikabi and held him in the palm of her hand. \"Now Mina-toe, when we get back to my room we're gunna start experimenting...\" She said as she soon was infront of her secret opening to her room. \"are you ready Mina-toe?

Before Minato could protest, she had already dropped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long fall from Minato's perspective. He watched a mischievous grin form on the titanic face of his sekirei as he fell away from it. His landing was soft but disorienting. He bounced a little bit and then rolled down a huge pliable slope. He tried to steady himself but efforts to slow his decent slipped right off the smooth surface beneath him. Rolling into another surface finally brought him to a stop and he became wedged between it and the incline he'd just descended. Minato knew where he was. He lay on his back, slightly embedded in Matsu's cleavage, staring dizzily at her face high above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsu giggled at the thought of what she was about to do to her minuscule ashikabi. She looked down at him, his tiny body splayed out across her cleavage as he struggled to find purchase on the boulders she called breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a <i>lot</i> for you to see, Mina-toe,\" Matsu chuckled, raising a finger over him, \"so I think we'll have you dive right in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devilish grin spread from cheek to cheek of Matsu's soft features as a gentle press of her finger forced the minuscule ashikabi deep within her cleavage. He was immediately swallowed by the plush orbs, disappearing from sight completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try not to get lost in there,\" Matsu teased, taking a moment to press her breasts together, further smashing her helpless captive between the two mountains of flesh. The rush of power was intoxicating, and Matsu could barely contain her excitement as she shut the door to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato could hardly breath let alone move. Deep between his sekirei's breasts it was warm and soft, and he could faintly hear Matsu's heart beating. Being smushed by a gigantic pair of boobs was far from the most unpleasant feeling Minato had ever felt, but he couldn't help but feel nervous over what else Matsu could have in store for him. Not to mention Miya would kill both of them if she found them like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we're alone, there are so many experiments we can run...,\" Matsu pondered, not even sure if Minato could hear her from way down in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Matsu want to try first?</span></div></div>",

She simply was not a battle/physical type and lacked one\u2019s hand eye coordination.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThis meant that when Matsu tried to save Minato, her fingers had hit his small body, but did not catch him. Instead her fingers broke his fall and flipped him so he was no longer falling head first.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhile this had saved his life. It had in exchange been a very painful experience for the small ashikabi.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nVERY VERY PAINFUL.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n--------------------------------------     --------------------------------------    ------------------ ------<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMinato was jolted awake when he hit the floor. His vision was swimming as he tried to focus but was unable to. He vaguely saw Matsu looking down at him, eyes wide in horror. <i>\u2018I wonder why she looks worried? Wasn\u2019t she\u2026 (A film of darkness starts to appear in Minato\u2019s vision)\u2026going to eat\u2026 (His eyes go dark and he can\u2019t hear Matsu anymore)\u2026me?\u2019</i> <br>\r\n--------------------------------------------    -----------------------------------------------    -----------<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn Matsu \u2019s room<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMatsu was currently working on a few of her projects, trying to get her mind off of Minato. Her ashikabi-sama was currently in a quickly put together bed, which was on a table that had been brought in to make sure that no one stepped on him. Tsukiumi, Kazehana, Musubi and young Kusano had all been starring at Minato since they realized what had happened to their ashikabi.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe other residents of Izumo House had all heard Matsu\u2019s scream. Further more all of Minato\u2019s Sekirei had felt that their ashikabi was in trouble. Which lead to Matsu having to explain what happened while trying to pick up Minato without hurting him further. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThat had been nearly four hours ago.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMatsu was not worried about Minato\u2019s health; she had already done some tests, with some of her old inventions she had made when she had made the shrink ray. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNow she wished she never made the damn thing. Minato, the man who made her heart race, the man who made her happy just by being in the same room as her\u2026the man she loved more the life itself\u2026was hurt.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBecause she had jokingly teased him\u2026and in his fear\u2026thought that she had been serious.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter she made sure Minato would live and that he was comfortable, \u2018At least I hope he is comfortable.\u2019 She had cried to herself for an hour. She only stopped because Miya had comforted her and asked if there was a way to return Minato to normal.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe shrink ray\u2019s growth function was the only thing that did not work well when used on humans, why it was like that she did not know. At best she could make it so that Minato came up to their ankles.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhich may or may not be better then being bigger then their toes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNow she was trying to find a way to return him to his normal size as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only because of her work, and Miya, that Minato\u2019s other sekirei did not kill her in some horrible torture of pain and suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsu shook her head. She had to focus damn it!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe fastest way would to assimilate his body and mind into one of his sekirei, more then likely her, and basically have Minato become a sekirei. A very difficult process but, with the proper preparation it should be possible.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe problems with this are the fact that Minato-sama would have to live as a female, for the rest of his life and that it would lead to the mental death of whatever sekirei was chosen as the sekirei's mind would be suppressed by his own.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHowever that was a plan of last resort. Matsu was sure that Minato would much rather have his body be brought back to it's normal size then turn into a female, and kill one of his sekirei. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSo Matsu found herself trying to find a way to return Minato-sama to his normal size.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato wakes up to see all of his sekirei watching him. Has a panic attack at the sight. (Sekirei think that it is cute)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato wakes up at night, and sees the sleeping forms of his Sekirei. He does not know what to do as he is slightly scared of what they might do to him, but at the same time wants to trust them. After all, he had woken up unharmed after all.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kusano, there's a little problem with 'operation doll retrieval'... You see, I'm just too small to move the thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Minato, you said that you'd help me get my dolly back!\" Kusano said with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will Ku, but I need you to help me with it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I already told you that I can't reach it!

You just wait here, and I'll be right back with the string!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusano then ran off to get string for her plan.

Why doesn't anything work for me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Ku! It'll be alright! We just need to think of a better plan is all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sniff* But what can we do, Minato?

Kneeling down next to Minato by the fridge, Kusano placed the pot on the ground and tipped it onto its side. She then focused her powers to make a single vine grow out from the pot and wrap around her doll. She then retracted the vine and claimed her doll. While it was coated in a week's worth of dust, Kusano was overjoyed to finally have it back.

She carefully despenced Minato onto the center of her palm. \"Now, Matsu said she would have a growing thing by tomorrow so its up to you to take care of little Minato!' She said waving before closing the door and leaving the two. Kusano looked back down at Minato with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry Minato, I'll take good care of you!\" She said reassuring him of his safety.</span></div></div>",

She had heard the conversation earlier, and she wasn't happy about it. Why was Minato being trusted to Kusano and not her?! She glared at the young girl and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hand him over, Kusano! <i>I</i> am Minato's wife! That means that <i>I</i> should be the one to take care of him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusano quickly pulled Minato incredibly close to her and held him protectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Minato is mine! Musubi and Matsu trusted me to take care of him, and I won't let you take him away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her hands on her hips and staring down at the much shorter sekirei, Tsukiumi smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think that you can stop me? I will no allow you to keep MY husband away from me! I'll take him from you even if I have to fight you for him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began forming a pair of water orbs in her hands. Kusano quickly ran over and grabbed the potted plant from her bedside table. She then balanced it on her head to prepare for battle. Her usual cute and cheerful face was now very serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine Tsukiumi! If I have to fight you to protect my Minato, then I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukiumi didn't even respond. She simply threw the balls of water at Kusano in an attempt to strike her down quickly. Kusano easily dodged out of the way and produced a multitude of vines from the pot on her head. She skillfully manipulated the vines to restrain Tsukiumi's arms. Lifting the blond beauty into the air by her wrists, Kusano then wrapped vines around her legs as well. Tsukiumi began to struggle furiously to escape her bindings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?! Release me this instant, you insolent child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I won't let you take Minato!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusano then sent out several of the vines to wrap around Tsukiumi's waist. Using the vines around Tsukiumi's wrists, Kusano pulled her opponent's arms down to her sides and began to wrap her entire body into a cocoon of vines. Tsukiumi was now held in helplessly in the air, completely engulfed in vines, with only her head visible. Tsukiumi struggled even harder to escape her restraints, but it was producing no results thus far. Kusano lowered her captive down to face level and slapped her across the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you! You little brat! Let me go right now, or else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you leave me and Minato alone now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-never! You don't have any right to keep my husband from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusano turned her back to the restrained sekirei and placed her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I'm just not gonna let you out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusano then looked back around and stuck her tongue out at Tsukiumi before turning away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you disrespectful little... I'll teach you what happens to those who insult me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukiumi then began struggling with more effort than ever before. This time, however, her attempts weren't so fruitless. She was slowly managing to push the vines off of her, and was confident that she could get out of the cocoon easily if she just continued with this amount effort. If she could escape from Kusano's trap, then she was certain that she could liberate Minato from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So is going Musubi going to make tricky bug go away!\"  She raised her gloved fist and held it high above Minato's miniscule form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Musubi-chan! I'm not trying to trick you, its really me Minato!\" He said in one last ditch effort to try and convince her. But she was done listening, because why should a goddess like her waste time argueing with a tricky bug? Minato's heart stopped beating and he had entered fight or flight mode, well just flight. He barely managed to jump out of the way dodging Musubi's harbringer of death that was her fist. \"Musubi-chan, stop its me Minato!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusubi's glare did not stop as she raised her fist once more. \"Musubi might have had some mercy on you, but not anymore bug!\" Minato couldn't believe Musubi could even get this mean, but he really couldn't believe that she was this mad over a bug! Minato was cut short as the area he was standing in was becoming darker. He looked up to see that god like fist coming down on him once again. It was too close, there was no way he could dodge this one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">BOOM!!!!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha Musubi knew tiny bug was no match for her!\" Musubi declared in short sighted victory. But then she felt the smallest of movements between the opening of her ring finger and pinky. She lowered her face down closer to inspect the feeling. After a couple seconds of scanning her skin she found him, crawling out from between her fingers and jumping down to the floor. \"Musubi is impressed little bug,\" Minato noticed that once again that the sun was blocked, \"but its time for Musubi's ultimate bug crushing technique! <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">D</font>ouble <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">D</font>emolish!\" Minato spun around to see two very large and round objects decending upoun him. Musubi was planning on crushing Minato with her cleavage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Musubi-chan No-\" Was all Minato had to say before the two planets crushed him.</span></div></div>",
