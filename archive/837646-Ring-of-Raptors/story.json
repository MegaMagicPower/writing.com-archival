The human explorers were surprised to find what appeared to be living, breathing dinosaurs already there, quite different to the slow lumbering monsters they were believed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese dinosaurs seemed to have near-human intelligence after a few were captured and tested...  and some even showed intellectual capacaty greater than humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive years have passed, and it is April the second, 2219 by the Terran calander.  Disgusted by the machines of the mammalians, the dinosaurs have agreed that the time to drive them out has come.  Though still fighting amongst each other, several factions have risen...  The fight for survival is on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what faction do you fight for?</span></div></div>",
