Her mother Cassandra had finished washing the dishes, and was now watching a soap opera. Rebecca's younger sister Kim was watching alongside her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bec, some device came in the post this morning\", her mother called.<br>\r\n\"Oh cool, who's it from?\" asked Bec.<br>\r\n\"No return address. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBec quickly went up to her room to find a small package on her pillow. Mum must have put it there, she thought. She read a card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have access to technology far advanced of humanity, and believe you would be deserving of this device. You have no need to worry about this device falling into the wrong hands, as it is pre-programmed so that only you can use it. Use it wisely, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBec opened the package to find what looked like an iPod touch. Except the buttons below read \"Warp\", \"Reset\", \"Analyse\" and \"Lock\". There was a manual that came with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This device is similar to our Universal Reality Warper, except it is tuned to individual people, meaning that you can alter any individual in many different ways. They, and everyone else around them (except for you) will accept the changes as if reality had always been that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo change an individual, simply choose a mode, then a setting. Aim at the subject and press Warp. Some settings will require the personal details of the subject, in which case, the Analyse button should be pressed first. If you find it difficult to aim at the subject, press Lock to freeze time. Pressing Warp will unfreeze time and alter the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce altered, the subject will have always been like that, and all evidence of their existence (such as photographs and videos) will prove so. Their mind will be modified to believe that they had always been that way. People around them will be equally accepting of the change, even if it is unusual or taboo in normal reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reset button will turn everybody back to normal. Neither they nor people around them (except for you) will retain any memory of the changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBec was skeptical, but at the same time, was willing to try out the device. Her family was there, and her friend Sarah was coming over later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to try it out on...</span></div></div>",

Maybe a promotional piece of junk for a movie or something. Her first instinct was to chuck it in the garbage and get back to homework. That instinct quickly was quelled by the slight hope of something new, brought through to her from the part of her that was still a child in a teenage body. Maybe, just a one-in-a-million chance maybe, the device was real. Certainly couldn't hurt to try, could it? She studied the device once more, a pout of doubt still on her face, then examined the manual once again. Point at something, WARP button does whatever you want it to do, right? And on a raygun-like device, no less. \"Sounds like something from a bad sci-fi fanfic,\" she murmured. Pausing only briefly to let out a sigh that she still believed in stuff like this, she stood in the middle of her room, set the WARP setting to Clone and the subsettings to &lt;default&gt;. She closed her eyes, pointed the device at her arm, and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened in a flash- a popping sound, a numb yet painful feeling like a hair being pulled off of numb skin, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Reb! Mind getting out of the way? The show's about to come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca couldn't believe her eyes when she opened them. Right in front of her, on a bed similar to her own, a woman who looked exactly like her, from her long brown hair, to her lime green tank top, to her white shorts and relatively thin physique, was painting her toenails and looking at her with a slightly annoyed face she recognized all too well. \"Hello? I said move, brain surgeon.\" Rebecca snapped to- a sitcom was playing on the area right behind her. She moved out of the way shyly, watching her double with wide eyes. The clone stopped watching TV to eye Rebecca warily. \"You okay, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fine.... um... who are you?\" The clone stared. \"Me? What are you talking about? It's Becky, your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca took ten seconds just to process this simple statement. Sister. She had a third sister. She slowly shifted her gaze to the small 14\" television at the foot of her bed. \"Since when did we have this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky burst out laughing, suddenly. \"Beautiful, isn't it? I can't believe we have it either, sometimes. I gotta hand it to you, pooling our funds and merging our rooms so we could buy the television was an awesome idea. Teamwork RULES!\" She said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca watched the TV for a short while with a numb brain, then looked back at the device in her hands.  \"It works\" floated through her mind.</span></div></div>",

She cleared her mind, pointed the device at her \"sister\", Becky, and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother popping sound, and suddenly Becky's bed was a bunk-bed, with Becky on the bottom and another clone on the top. \"That was unexpected\" thought Rebeccca. The new clone groaned. \"Could you two turn the volume down a little, work today was awful.\" She grumbled with a pillow over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca pulled the trigger again, and yelped as her own bed became a bunk-bed as well. \"Oh, shutup, Bethany, it's your own fault for choosing a soccer camp job for little kids as a spring job,\" she heard over her head jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty, be nice, she does more than you ever do at that ice-cream shop,\" Becky called out in defense. Betty snorted. \"Look who's talking! An assistant librarian who does nothing but check out and shelve books for a couple of hours on the weekend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca pulled the trigger one more time. A fourth clone appeared in a small but squashy-looking armchair, situated at the base of the Becky/Bethany bunkbed. \"Girls, shut it! Show's about to start!\" \"Oh, right! Thanks, Brittany,\" Betty said. There was a rocking motion as she dropped off the bed and sat next to Becky on hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca couldn't believe it. Four clones of herself sitting together, watching a rerun of Frasier, with a fourth just overhead asleep- and all of them exactly the same size, shape, dress, and personality, from what she could tell. She sat through the re-run, mind abuzz, until the commercial break. She got ready to exit at that point to see where Brittany's bed was, but before she could, she was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Rebecca, what's that thing you got in the mail do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap.</span></div></div>",

Let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky and Brittany stood up as Betty kept her pinned. Becky inspected it first, \"Huh?

Rebecca watched as she now had three bunk beds in her room, a fifth clone of herself appearing beside Becky. Rebecca braced for it. \"Huh, didn't do anything.\" The original looked up, confused. But not as confused as Becky, as she inspected the device from all ends. Did she not see another clone appear? Was she the only one that could see the changes? Her thoughts were interrupted as she felt the beam hit her again and again. Her newly cloned sister had the device now and was blasting it at Rebecca. \"Bella!\" Becky complained, \"If you wanted to see it you could have asked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" Bella spoke, \"Wanted to try it for myself.\" Rebecca watched as she was blasted at least four more times. She watched as her room expanded and two more bunk beds appeared, along with four other clones. This was getting slightly ridiculous in her case, wondering when this would stop. \"Why were you so silent about this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca had to give them an answer that would allow her to have the device without these clones knowing what it could do. \"Its....\" she started, \"Its, well...I kind of...got interested into...sci-fi stuff.\" Immediately the other \"sisters\" all went \"OooOooh\" like little kids. Rebecca was confused, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what you little nerd\" Britanny joked as Betty let her up. \"You and your little boyfriend finally got together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca blushed madly. Sure she was friends with this one guy, and he was cute, but she never asked him! And he's not her boyfriend. \"H-He's not m-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four newly cloned sisters all playfully jumped on her. \"We know you Rebecca. We're identical, so we know how you think.\" \"Yeah sis! You man catcher!\" The four all playfully pushed Rebecca, and Rebecca couldn't help but laugh at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard their mom, \"Brianna, Bebe, Riley, Tracey! You four get down here! You're late for your appointments!\" The four that were roughhousing Rebecca ran off, telling Rebecca what their names were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella handed Rebecca the device back, \"If you just wanted to keep it, just say so. We may be identical and share everything, but that doesn't mean we HAVE to share everything.\" The others apologized as Rebecca merely nodded to them. She loved having these \"Sisters\" with her; her real life sisters were too young to understand and the other was kind of mean. Maybe she should keep things like this.</span></div></div>",

Penis: 0 inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding she didn't want to make herself a hermaphrodite, she looked at some other settings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca had always been a bit jealous of girls at school with large breasts and butts, and long hair--try as she might, her hair just didn't look that great once she grew it past her shoulders.

The second thing she noticed was that she was still standing up--sure, her breasts were huge, but she had expected the combined weight of her butt and hair to pull her down on to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting: even though I remember how I was before, I know how to stand up straight in this form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning her hands over her new parts, she found that her breasts and butt were soft to the touch, and her hair silky smooth right to the ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through her closet, she found that all her clothes had changed to accommodate her new figure, and looking through her diary, she found a lot of entries in which she talked about how much she was growing, and how her parents were complaining (when they thought she couldn't hear them) about all the money they had to spend on clothes for her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rebecca was not one for half measures. Sometimes her parents said she didn't know the meaning of \"overdo\" or \"excess\". Getting this device did not help matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized first that while her memories weren't changing, her diary was, which would give her a good look at how things had happened in the new reality each of her changes created. Thinking it would take too long to read through the thing each time she made a change, she looked through the \"Superpowers\" menu, looking for something specific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found it: \"Speed-reading\". Selecting it, another note popped up: \"Allows subject to read any amount of text in seconds. When combined with X-ray VIsion, subject can read anything in seconds simply by glancing at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that this, too, would save time, she selected X-ray Vision as well, pointed the device at herself, and hit Warp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, she found that she knew how to use her new powers, even though she couldn't remember having them. Glancing at her diary, she noticed things she hadn't before: new stuff, about how she had to fake poring over books in class even though she'd read them almost as soon as she got them, and old stuff, about how while she liked her figure, other girls teased her about it. Seeing that, Rebecca was somewhat glad she didn't get the new memories. She knew how far some of those girls' \"teasing\" went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back on her experience with her clones, she realized that while having autonomous clones wasn't such a great idea, more of her could bring in more money than fewer. Again looking through the Superpowers menu, she noticed one that would allow her to make copies of herself that remained under her control, and she could manifest them wherever she wanted, wearing whatever her original body was wearing. Selecting it, she pointed the device at herself again and hit Warp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer room changed again. There was now a large TV on one wall, and what looked like a very good computer on another. Her diary also changed: it was thicker now, and had a lot of entries about all the various jobs she was holding down.  It did, however, enthuse about how she only had to eat and sleep for one--apparently everything that was done to her body (but not her clothing) happened instantaneously to all her bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain looking around her room, she found a work schedule. Thankfully none of her jobs started for another hour. Looking again at her diary, she confirmed her suspicions: she would put on her clothes for a job, copy herself to about a block or two nearby, then put on the next uniform, and repeat until all her clones were at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCopying herself to stand in front of her, she was immediately struck by how strange it was: there she was, right in front of herself, looking at herself look at herself from two different pairs of eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with what amounted to a living \"mirror\", she sat down on her bed and made more changes. Having always wanted to tower over her classmates, she went to the Size setting and made her height 7'9\". Her diary now discussed how she could be the star of the basketball team if it weren't for her huge breasts and butt making it difficult for her to play effectively. She also decided to give herself many more superpowers, all in the name of testing how far she could push this apparently-miraculous machine: flight, infinite strength (why be limited?), infinite speed, invincibility, teleportation (self and others, of course), telepathy (passive and projective), telekinesis, invisibility, super-senses, super-intelligence, and noticed one that looked strange: \"self-sustaining life force\". Reading the note on the last one, it said that the subject would not have to perform any tasks normally associated to living, such as eating, breathing, or sleeping, and could do things like remain alive in a total vacuum or underwater or in other such harsh environments for as long as desired. Selecting it as well, she wondered if she'd have any doctorates on her wall after hitting Warp. Again pointing the device at herself, she hit Warp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she noticed was that she felt--in both her bodies--amazing. Her muscles and mind felt supercharged. She teleported her scissors into her hand and attempted to cut herself. Feeling nothing, her vision told her that the blade was completely dull. She was also picking up thoughts: her parents,  thinking how nice it was that their second daughter was so helpful around the house; her older sister, thinking how unfair it was that she was only now applying for college while her younger sister had multiple doctorates already (and how unfair it was that her parents were insisting she do so, though Rebecca didn't understand why); her younger sister, thinking how cool it was to fly around with her older sister; even her friend Sarah, thinking how great it was to be friends with her, but jealous that Rebecca got all the attention and that she couldn't even rate as a sidekick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking for her diary, she instead found a huge stack of them. Reading them at a glance, she found out that she had received her first doctorate at 14 and hadn't slowed down since. Her discoveries were nothing short of groundbreaking and she'd heard rumours that she might become the youngest Nobel Prize winner in history. She apparently had a very public profile: she was a scientist, successful entrepreneur with a net worth already in the tens of millions, and a superhero revered by many. Just recently she had prevented the assassination of a high-profile senator and rescued two hundred people from a sinking cruise ship in the mid-Pacific simultaneously, but hardly a day went by when she wasn't to be found in multiple places in the papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also noticed that her room was far more spacious: she had used a fair deal of the money from her businesses to buy a huge house for her family, and staffed it herself. Indeed, she could see through the eyes of ten of her preparing a meagre supper: only three courses for twenty guests, apparently small by her standards. She was also keeping the gardens perfect, helping Kim with her homework, fixing one of the family's ten Rolls-Royces (and driving her father and his friends to the country club in another one), staffing her various corporate offices, guiding a plane with no working engines safely to ground, terraforming Mars... all in all, feeling thousands of bodies all doing different things at once was overwhelming for her, but once again, she just <i>knew</i> how to do them all. None of her other bodies had so much as skipped a beat, it seemed. She also understood why Lauren felt having to go to college was unfair: her sister was, it seemed to her, willing to provide for her for the rest of her life, so why should she ever have to do anything for herself? (And besides, Rebecca caught Lauren thinking to herself, it was just so unfair that her sister's genes should be so great while hers left her plain and normal. How many mutations does it take to give someone all that Rebecca had?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering about her clothes--shouldn't friction burn them off?--she noted that one of her first discoveries had been a chemical that made anything completely resistant to heat, which was why she hadn't seen any burning-building-rescues or forest fires in her diary. She had made the chemical freely available to all, and it was now ubiquitous, and otherwise completely inert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly deciding to put off using the device on herself any more--for now--Rebecca, knowing her mind would keep all her other bodies doing what they were doing, figured she might as well have some fun. She decided she wanted to try pranking people (which had come into her head as soon as she saw just how many superpowers she could give herself, and which she apparently already did, though not at the moment), but she also wanted to make her friend Sarah into a proper sidekick.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wasn't expecting the device to work, but as much as she wanted to undo this, she couldn't delete her new sister. She smiled as she just sat back and went through the settings. \"Hey sis, what's that?\" Becky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing\" she spoke. \"Just some weird thing. Thick someone sent this here by mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we send it back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Becky was taken back by her sister's sudden answer. Rebecca calmed herself, \"I mean no...sorry. I'll take care of it.\" Becky just gave her a gentle nod, returning to watching the television and trying not to restart her sister's strange sudden behavior. Rebecca mentally sighed; avoiding a close call. She needed to make sure to keep what this device could do all to herself. She turned to find a good place for her new device, but then tripped on a discarded shirt. She dropped the device onto the floor. The impact was enough to activate it, then it fired. The beam hit Becky, much to Rebecca's shock. She grabbed the device and stopped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa sis are you alright?\" Rebecca looked up, shocked once she saw her sister. Becky was still 100% identical, but now she had four arms on her body! Rebecca stood up and gave her a nod. \"Sorry about the shirt\" she spoke, \"But you know how hard it is to store my shirts.\" Rebecca once again silently nodded as her eyes drifted down. She was again surprised at seeing the shirt; which had four long sleeves instead of two. Rebecca needed a quiet place to think, so she went to the bathroom and locked the door. She sighed looking at the device. It seems that it was still set on Clone, but the additional setting was set on \"Body Part.\" That explained the double arms. What to do next?</span></div></div>",

Rebecca quickly crossed the street and peered in one of the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His constant slights, comparing Rebecca against some fantasy ideal. Her self-esteem had slumped, that she wasn't as fit... wasn't as sexy... wasn't as curvy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd tried to explain how those criticisms hurt.
