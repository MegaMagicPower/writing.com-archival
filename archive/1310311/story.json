In the show it was established that there were other Rovers too, such as the Space Rovers. So don't feel like it's limited to just those chosen here.<br>\r\nHowever, on that same note, I'd like the directions here to be mainly about the characters listed. It doesn't have to be about them all the time, but most of the time the focus should be on the character of the thread. SO if you pick Colleen, it can have Hunter inflating as well, but the focus should be on Colleen mostly.<br>\r\nAs I said in the intro, you can add new Rovers not featured in the show if you want, but keep in mind, this is not some place to use a private character. because once they're in the story, they're free game to whoever  adds the next chapter.<br>\r\nAlso, feel free to  do the fattening/inflation/whatever with the Rovers as cano-sapians (anthro) or in natural dog form. Either way is ok.<br>\r\nAnd one last thing, if you don't know enough about the Rovers, there are plenty of sites out there that can give the information you need, but this site should give you the basics: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Rovers\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Rovers...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo enough of the crud and lets start.

Colleen got a pie in the face while walking in the hallway, which was tame compare to the stuff that happened to the others. Muzzle had been released from his restraints, but in his overfed state, he wouldn't have been able to attack anyone anyway. Exile's work out machine made him so muscular, that he couldn't even move for a while. Hunter knew that he was bound to be next sooner or later - he suspected who it was, but what fun would it be to not catch him in the act - and when he was mysteriously sent on some mission to a warehouse, he had his suspicions confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter opened the warehouse and found himself greeted by darkness. Despite the windows he saw outside, it was as black as the inside of his eyelids and when he walked in, the door slammed shut and stayed locked. He relayed on his sense of smell to guide him throught the building. There was a familiar scent nearby, one he couldn't exactly identify because of some other odor in the air, but Hunter smirked as he continued onward. The prankster was here and he was so going to get caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stopped and paused to sniff the air, but before he could do anything, someone whacked the back of his head and he found himself knocked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up there was light and when he began gouging his surroundings...</span></div></div>",

He felt his stomach start to swell, as well as his rump, and other parts of his body. His face became rounder and a double chin began to form. His once impressive muscular frame became hidden in an increasingly growing layer of fat. Suddenly, a small light flickered on, and the prankster was revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Blitz. \"Ha, got you there, Hunter! How you like my ultra-fattening peppermint milkshake machine? I saved this prank just for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, now at least 400 lbs, tried to yell, but the milkshake prevented him from doing so. His suit suddenly ripped, unleashing a tidal wave of flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitz looked over to the machine. \"Will you believe it? The machine's set to 'low'. Hm...should I turn it up all the way, or just let you go right now?\"</span></div></div>",

His gut touched the floor, and half-covered his legs, which were thicker than an elephant's legs. His rump was coming out from all sides of his chair, bushing against his multiple back rolls. His arms were coated with doughy flab hanging off, and his fingers were as big as sausages. His cheeks looked as if he had a pillow in his mouth, and he had at least four thick chins, which pressed against his moobs, that were the sizes of watermelon slices. His girth became too much as the chair he was sitting on finally cracked, and he fell to the ground with a loud THUD, jiggling like a giant pile of jello. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was at least 1,000 lbs. He tried to move, but his massive gut and thick legs rendered him immobile. He was even losing mobility in his arms, which were being absorbed in flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitz just watched in awe as his friend was slowly becoming a blob.

Hunter's stomach now stretched to over five feet in front of him, and was nearly sevn feet wide. Blitz didn't want anything bad to happen to Hunter, but he had to admit to himself that he liked what he was seeing. <br>\r\n  Hunter squirmed and tried to move, making muffled pleas. Blitz looked at him, and grinned. \"Well buddy, I see you think the prank's gone far enough. I on the other hand, kind of like you this way. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll come to enjoy it eventually. It must be thrilling to be an immobile blob!!\" With that, he began laughing and guffawing almost manaically.<br>\r\n  All the while, Hunter was actually starting to lose some vision, as his now beachball sized cheeks were blocking some of his vision. He tried to move his arms again, but he couldn't. He could actually feel the fat on his arms overcome his hands, effectively making them vestigial. From what he could tell, his legs were entirely hidden beneath his gut, his feet going the way of his arms as the flab overflowed onto the floor. His back had begun to expand as his gut, his backrolls rested on top of his mammoth ass.(literally, his ass looked almost the size of a small elephant. From the cold sliding feeling under his stomach, he knew that his gut had to have spread out nearly ten feet in front of him at this point, and to be honest, he...</span></div></div>",

He was probably 2,000 pounds and still growing, was completely helpless, couldn't move at all, couldn't see past his oversized cheeks, but was loving it. As an amorphous blob, the slightest movement forced every ounce of fat bulging and hanging off his body jiggle. Hunter couldn't explain it, but every time he moved, it was the greatest feeling he'd ever felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the machine stopped pumping shake into his maw and the hose retracted over his massive frame, leaving a trail of the green liquid. Suddenly, he felt a struggling movement at the front of his belly, as if someone heavy was trying to climb it. Hunter moaned, as it felt wonderful to be basically be a mountain. Suddenly, his bloated cheeks were pushed away by Blitz, who looked like he was at least 400 pounds. His once rock-hard chiseled frame was replaced by a double chin, a thick neck, rolls of fat, jiggling arms, thick legs, bloated ass, and a gut hanging past his waste. He was holding two hoses in his hands and sinking into the top of Hunter's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you, you're a whale!\" he laughed. \"Watching you fatten up made me want to sacrifice my perfect figure for one like yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooogh...Blitz...BUUUURRRAAAAP!!\" Hunter moaned and belched. His incredible girth effected his speaking and thoughts as well, making him sloblike<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitz shoved the hose in his mouth, shoved the other in Hunter's and hit a switch on a remote. The liquid began pouring in their mouths. Hunter began becoming even more massive, but Blitz surged. The doberman started to gain so much girth that he was forced onto his ass and into immobility. His tail was wagging as he enjoyed his expansion. His gut expanded a few feet in front of him as his belly developed a second roll beneath it. His fat rolls forced his arms up, which were slowly becoming encased in doughy, hanging flab. His legs were slowly being covered by his belly and various fat rolls, and his almost unrecognizable fat hindpaws were being sucked in. His rump was rapidly growing outwards. His moobs were like beachballs, and his fat face and rolls were beginning to droop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly... </span></div></div>",

Well yeah, but that wasn't what I was going to say. Sure we're fat, but we also have SOME muscle left on us\" Hunter said looking back in the mirror lifting his ball belly and letting it drop back down. Hunter loved all the weight that Blitz's little \"milkshake\" prank put on him, not being able to move, all the layers of thick fat sticking to his body; just the thought sent shivers through his body. But after the strict diet and work out plan that Colleen put him and Blitz on, the weight started to melt off. The more weight he lost the worst he felt; but he remembered what he loved to do other then being immobilized, and that was saving people. How was he expected to save the human race as a 1,000 pound whale? So with his new size, the thought finally popped into his head, why can't he help people AND enjoy a hefty waist? <br>\r\n              Blitz flexed his arm and wasn't impressed by the blubber that was being compressed together, although he did notice that all those years of training did slightly show, so he guessed Hunter was somehow right. \"And your point is?\" he said with no expression. Before Hunter could answer, Blitz rocked back and forth in his chair to get enough momentum to get up on his own feet. <br>\r\n              \"Call me crazy but check this\" he waddled over to Blitz, his whole body shaking with excitement, sending shock waves through the floor.\"Have you ever heard of Sumo Wrestling?\" he said, tail wagging, barely. Blitz placed his hand over his face and looked at Hunter in the eyes.<br>\r\n              \" If you are talking about those diaper wearing fat guys who wrestle each other then yes\" hoping to end this conversation quickly. Exile had made a large pot of stew the other day and the leftovers had Blitz's name all over it. Exile didn't mind Hunter's and Blitz's weight gain at all, he liked seeing his friends happy. In fact, he and Shags have been making special dishes for them to help with their \"growth\", Colleen wasn't pleased with that, but if the extra pounds is what his friends wanted then he pledged to help them. <br>\r\n              \"Yes! So you know them?\" Hunter answered with joy.<br>\r\n              \"Yes...\" Blitz said confused<br>\r\n               \"And you still want to be a Road Rover right?\"<br>\r\n              \" Yeah...\"<br>\r\n               \"And we're not in the greatest physical condition.\" <br>\r\n               Blitz looked down at his massive gut that was barely covered in a white t-shirt with potato chip crumbs all over it, he tried to suck in his belly but it plopped back out when he had to breath \"go on\" he said trying to pull down his shirt. <br>\r\n               \"So I had a great idea where you and I can still be heroes and maintain a perfectly happy fat life style.\" This got Blitz's attention. \"So I decided that you and I should be...\" pausing for dramatic effect, Hunter placed his fist on his mouth a cleared his throat \"Super Sumo Heroes!\" he said with his giant arms out like he was presenting something on top of his head. Blitz thought the idea over, being a Road Rover AND being able to keep his body the way it is sounded tempting. <br>\r\n                \"I'm not wearing those diapers though\" he said, although he was fat, there was no way that he was going to patrol the world half naked. <br>\r\n                \"Don't worry about that, I asked Shags to make us new suits that were extremely flexible, but they are kind of revealing...\" Hunter finished the sentence softer than he started. <br>\r\n                 \"What!?\" Blitz said, the offer sounded tempting but not if he had to wear anything that even resembled what those guys in those sumo matches wore.<br>\r\n                 \"Oh don't be like that Blitz, I tried them on already and they're really comfortable, it's better than having your stomach being squished in all that armor\" Hunter said clasping his pudgy hands together \"what do you say?\"<br>\r\n                 Blitz just stood there for a couple of minutes, thinking over the offer, sure the uniform wasn't something he was happy about, but the \"eat whatever you want\" life style was to good of an offer to pass up \"deal\" he said. Hunter let out a howl of happiness and jumped in the air. When he landed back on the ground the floor shook uncontrollably causing all the vases that were on the shelves to bust on the floor, the shock even made Blitz stumble. \"Woops\" Hunter said \"forgot about the gut\" he said slapping his stomach. <br>\r\n                 \"Did you guys feel that earthquake? I know your big in the middle, but you must have felt that\" Exile said walking in the room. Hunter than thought of a great idea.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n               <br>\r\n               <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The threat of being a fat pig wasn't a concern if he were to agree. The offer was tempting, plus Colleen and Shags had been sent off on a special mission in Cuba, they wouldn't make a return until a couple of months. \"Ok\" he said laughing, \"but I think I will have to buy bigger underwear if I am going to get as big as you two guys\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, until you get some bigger clothes you can borrow some of mine\" Hunter said while digging in his pocket; he pulled out a small vile filled with thick liquid. \"I saved some of that special milkshake, don't ask why, but this should speed up your belly process\" he said handing the vile over to Exile. He popped the cork off the top but Hunter stopped him before drinking, \"you can't drink it now, if you did your clothes would blow right off you! Put this on\" Hunter took the large robe that Blitz was wearing and handed it to Exile.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry Blitz\" Hunter shrugged, \"drink up buddy\"<br>\r\nExile put on the robe that was plenty of sizes to big for his frame and drank the milkshake. \"Tastes like peppermint\" he said.<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Hunter asked.<br>\r\n\"Fine, a little hungry though\" he said, at first Hunter and Blitz had thought that the milkshake had lost it's affect, but there minds suddenly changed when Exile placed his hand on his stomach. \"A little bubbly too\" he didn't say anything else when a belch burst through his mouth. Hunter and Blitz stepped back when they started to hear gurgling sounds from Exile's stomach.<br>\r\n\"You ok Exile?\" Hunter said concerned.<br>\r\n\"A little bloated\" Exile said a bit oddly, he sounded like he was in pain, for every grunt was a belch that followed right after. Soon enough his furry gut started to extend outward, his legs and arms began to inflate with fat. <br>\r\n\"Woh\" he said trying to tighten his robe. No use, his gut was already sagging over his waist, and his strong face structure started to swell and soften up. With his tail plumped up with the rest of his body the transformation was complete.<br>\r\n\"Exile, you're huge!\" Hunter shouted with joy, he waddled over to Exile and slapped him a few times in the belly, \"how does it feel to be big?\"<br>\r\n\"Exile smiled and said \"good\" his voice deeper than before. The fat over his body sent a jolt of joy through him and he embraced Hunter in a hug, both there guts smashing and squishing into each other. Hunter returned the hug as Blitz walked away slowly, everyone knows what happens when you squeeze a fat guy's belly too hard.<br>\r\nPFFFFFFFFFFFFT a trumpet of gas pushed through Exile and Hunter's rears.<br>\r\nBlitz wafted his hand \"now that we got over our little farting session, let's see that uniform you were talking about\"<br>\r\nHunter left his little gas heaven and said \"oh yeah, I'll go put one on\" he left the room.<br>\r\nBlitz tried to shrug off the smell of fart in the room but his nostrils wouldn't allow it, with every waft of smell he loved every second of it. If he wasn't worried about his reputation he would have had a little hug with Exile as well. He didn't want to be the weird boy in the group that enjoyed the smell of fart.<br>\r\nBefore he could think anymore, Hunter hopped in the room, once again sending an earthquake through the city probably. His uniform looked like a typical sumo diaper that had the Road Rovers logo on it.<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Hunter said showing off in sexy poses, whatever sexy poses a fat guy can do that is.<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\" Exile said huffing out of breath as he walked over to Hunter.<br>\r\n\"Don't push yourself big guy, you can't walk as fast as you used to now\" Hunter smiled patting Exile's soft gut \"don't want an injured teammate before our first mission\". \"What do you think Blitz?\" Hunted asked.<br>\r\nWhat did he really think of them? He loved them! He could easily see himself in that gear for the rest of his life. But instead of expressing how he really felt he just shrugged his shoulders \"not as bad I thought they would be\". <br>\r\n\"Great! Now, I already started researching for our first mission\" Hunter started but was interrupted by Exile's gurgling stomach. Hunter and Exile both laughed \"or we could get a quick bite to eat first, you guys can make the call\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was shown from the base of their flabby bodies, as their hormones having been affected greatly by the rousal from the chemicls in the substance they were consuming was causing their cocks and balls to swell to massive sizes as they watched the fmale before them start to sexually strip out of her armor and begin to walk over to their positions starting at where Blitz was and as she reached her team mate, she suddenly grew a stern look as she turned her expression towards the Doberman!  Fearing that he had made her mad with the prank of throwing a pie in her face, but then her expression was shown to the blob form of Hunter and she then pointed too him and said,\"Well it looks like you two have been getting pretty big in here,\" she slowly stuck her pointed finger into Hunters blubbery belly, \"and also,\" she added with a hint of lust in her tone as she started to straddle Blitz's expanding shaft as it finally breached the flab it was being covered by and rose to a height of 7 feet in the air while having a width of 4 feet wide!   And then Colleen continued her speech saying to both Hunter and Blitz:,\" and the best thing about this is that I'm gonna make you lovely, \"little\" balls of fat grow even bigger and as a bonus I think I'll see if gaining weight for my body will make me grow bigger for both of you to enjoy me as well\" Collen stated as she went to the machine, hooked a tube and funnel and as she inserted it into her mouth both Hunter and Blitz saw through their heavily fattened eyes that she was already growing fat fast!

As Colleen kept on growing, Hunter looked at her super swelled up breasts and her enlarged ass and began hungering for something other than food as he got an erection from just watching. Colleen saw Hunter's erected shaft and she immediately knew what went through his mind and decided to give him what he wanted since she wanted the same thing from him for a long time. Colleen gestured Hunter to come closer and get some, a gesture which he couldn't resist and started to struggle until he got to her. Once he got within her reach Colleen knew he would need some assistance, so she grabbed Hunter's cock and helped him put it in her pussy and she put one of her breasts up to his lips and the real fun finally began when Hunter began breastfeeding while pushing his shaft in and out of her. As Hunter bucked his hips back and forth, his fat was wiggling all over and an aroused Colleen had her fat wiggling all over as well. The orgasm was building up and Hunter bucked his hips harder all while expanding from Colleen's breast milk, Colleen could feel the veins on his cock pulsing and immediately knew what was about to happen as Hunter stopped the breastfeeding and let out a loud moan as a sign that he was about to let it out. Hunter let out an earth shattering orgasm as a strong spray of seed came out of Hunter and entered Colleen which made her expand as it occurred.

Hunter's ears twitched every time the windshield wipers screeched to and from their nest. Weren't these ones brand new? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff the brakes, onto the gas. Past the intersection by Bobmart, then take a right. Stop again. Where do I go now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard hesitated for a moment and looked to his GPS. Down a mile or two, then another right. He nodded to himself, only for red lights to illuminate the rain drops on the road. A gasp caught in his throat. He slammed on the brakes and punched his car horn. The car in front of him came to a complete stop, then turned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idiot didn't even use his blinkers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drove onward and pondered this new address. It mocked him from a crumpled piece of paper tossed to the passenger's seat. The scratchy handwriting only just legible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't talk much, need help, come to 3205 Wintersby Ave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stray hand reached to his face and scratched the scruff on his cheek. No sane person up and left over strange letters in the mail. Life in the city might drive you to it though. Any excuse to duck out and run to suburbia was enough for him. Even if the old neighborhoods became faint shadows of the past, colored only by wistful nostalgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoky smells of a family BBQ. Kids might play in the front yard, dousing each other with the watering-hose. Even the family dog might be tugging his master by the leash, searching for new and exciting smells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you would see anything like that those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis car passed by dilapidated homes, a few windows cracked. Some boarded up entirely. Weeds and tall grass overran yards. Vines ensnared rusted chain link fences in their snake-like grasp. Not a place to hang around for long. House 3205 looked no different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder clapped in the sky and the rain came down in heavier torrents the moment he parked his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't have predicted this.\" He mumbled <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slipped out of his car and jogged through the rain. The moment he reached the front door he pounded it with his fist and bent over his knees to catch his breath. Water soaked his back while he listened for someone to answer the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked open, the shadow of a face could be seen through the small crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sent me a letter, something about needing help?\" Richard said over the roar of the rain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name?\" Said the person behind the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You wrote it on the envelope though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard Spritz.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your <i>old</i> name.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the law, that isn't my name anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's around to hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, it's Hunter. Now can I come inside?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door whipped open to reveal a anthropomorphic husky. A bright smile lit up his face. Richard, or Hunter rather paused in his tracks and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet another unexpected twist, yes?\" Said the husky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Exile can't believe it's really you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in now, before eary people decide to report us.\" Exile said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter did as he was told while the door shut behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you mean nosy right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I say that? You smell with your nose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged and nodded. Same old Exile. Time changed him very little. Not that he could say the same of himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the deal with my name out there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A precaution. I feared they got you too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precautions? They? Exile you're starting to sound like one of those conspiracy nuts on TV.\" Said Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky glared a little and folded his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone is rounding up former Rovers and...doing things to them. I found Blitz by accident the other day. I barely even recognized him! Weird boy always used to be so stressed about his looks, and to see him the way I did. Oh it was weird.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter tilted his head and took a seat on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said to him 'Blitz, you look like you need to lay off the doggy biscuits' and he goes crazy. He said not to make fun of his glandular problem or something. Then he goes on about how he doesn't even know who Blitz is! That I had the wrong cano-sapien.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't even recognize you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even a smallish bit.\" Said Exile. \"So I decided to find the old Rovers myself, before something else happened. Colleen and Muzzle, they are at The Master's old lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any news on Shag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I don't even know if he could read my letter.\" Said Exile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea that someone was out there hunting the Rovers made Hunter want to shrink into himself. Maybe Parvo did it? No way, he's dead. Son of Parvo, Parvo's apprentice, the groomer? Who could do it? And why now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to name check you Hunter, because when I saw you walk up to the door, I thought they got you too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blushed. The weight of his own figure became quite apparent. A self conscious hand reached towards his middle and rested upon a...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

When he tried to do so, he realized he had a muzzle on his face, and when he jerked it around, there was a tube hanging on the end of it. He was still in his Road Rovers uniform, but that was the least of his worries when he heard a whirring sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttached to the tube's end was a vat of... something. It simply had a label on it that said \"RRS1.\" He could see a flowing of white liquid start streaming out of it and toward his mouth. Struggling a bit, the dog tried to keep his mouth closed, but the muzzle would block his nose when he did so, so in lieu of passing out he finally opened his mouth and started drinking. The mixture tasted like vanilla and strawberry, a taste the golden retriever wasn't accustomed to, and he happily kept drinking as the flow of the liquid quickened a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter closed his eyes and allowed himself a moment of respite during his capture, which ended when he started feeling full a few minutes later.

Once in the bathroom she turned to face the mirror, regretting what she forced herself to see immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColleen have never been a 'morning dog' by any means but recently things just seemed to get worse. Due to the onset of age the face that stared back at Colleen was a bit of a fright. She wasn't really <i>old</i> old, but she had that distinct look of 'middle age' that was enhanced by baggy eyes, faint wrinkles on her cheeks, and a bit of 'sag' in places she didn't want to think about. Most went away after her morning routine to perk herself up, but it was the initial scare of seeing all that along with her unruly bed head of fur that made the female wince every morning when she looked in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling open the cabinet she got out the usual necessities and proceeded through her automatic actions as she brushed her teeth, combed her fur, applied a moderate dose of anti-flea and tick powder (it was impolite to scratch in public after all), and made herself ready. Once done Colleen still had bleary somewhat bloodshot eyes, but the other effects were less noticeable at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she returned to her room to dress, Colleen sighed, she knew getting older was a part of life, but it still frustrated her to know a few more years and missions might not be possible, a decade or two and she wouldn't even be able to show her routines to students, she'd be stuck behind a desk teaching 'theory'. Not to mention her chances of winning the clueless Hunter over were slipping away day by day. Cano-sapians might have aged at near human levels, but it was small consolation. Getting older might have been a thing she could stand if she could find someway to undo the unpleasant side effects of her looks deteriorating at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Colleen slipped on her boots and buckled her belt, she gave one last check in the mirror. With a final sigh she stepped out the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SURPRISE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was Colleens fast thinking or her aging reflexes that saved Hunter from getting a boot to the stomach was something best left a mystery. The fact of the matter was Colleen stood there in shock as confetti thrown by the golden Labrador rained down over both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all this then?\" Colleen blinked as she looked around, both Exile and Blitz stood nearby looking pleasantly smug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, how you say, big surprise,\" Exile smiled in his typical thick Russian accent, \"Comrade Hunter has quite the treat in store.\" The blue and white furred huskie Colleen had long known looked just as strong as ever, though these days Exile was sporting a touch more of a paunch than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey come on Exile,\" Hunter chuckled gently bumping his fist on the huskies shoulder playfully, \"We agreed I'd get to tell her.\" The leader of the Rovers was looking as good as ever. Though if one were to look very closely, Hunters fur was starting to gray just slightly around his temples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't see why you get to,\" Blitz remarked, rolling his eyes, \"I should be the one to tell her.\" The dobermans thick German accent rolled off his tong with the usual arrogance Colleen had come to expect. While still as physically fit as ever, Blitz was also showing his age with a few more wrinkles around his eyes and cheeks, though he was far too vane to ever really 'show' them, preferring to cover such things with a dab of makeup on his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are...?\" Colleen had to hide a smirk as Blitz face-palmed at her continued running gag of forgetting his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I get to tell her because I'm the one who bought the tickets,\" hunter replied with a note of finality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickets?\" Colleen asked curiously, \"Tickets for what? Come on, tell me Hunty-wunty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golden chuckled again and brandished the printed stubs of paper for Colleen, \"Here you go. Round trip tickets for a two month long stay at the latest tropical resort, Paradise Island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" Colleen gaped, \"You mean that place that's opening up on an exclusive south seas island this week? The one that's been in the newspapers for almost a year promising a vacation of ones dreams?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one,\" Hunter smiled, \"I've been saving up all year for you. Trust me Colleen, you've earned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Hunter, this is so sweat of you,\" she smiled taking the tickets, \"But I'd hate to leave you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry,\" Hunter nodded, \"We'll be joining you, but just for the last couple weeks or so. So you get six weeks on your own to have fun and then we'll join you for two more so we can all have fun together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw Hunter,\" Colleen smiled and then looked at the tickets in surprise, \"These are for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Hunter smiled, \"Better get packing. Don't worry, we'll handle your classes while you're away. You go and have fun. We'll join you before long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColleen couldn't help it and gave Hunter a quick kiss on the cheek, \"Thank you boys.\" She smiled as Hunter blushed and turned back around into her room to being the difficult decision of what exactly to pack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, does Colleen make it to the island safely or does something else happen to her?</span></div></div>",

The sound of waves... the salty smell on the breeze...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0These were the first things that came to Colleens mind as she lay on her back clawing her way out of the deep blackness that only unconsciousness could bring. An attempt to move left her gasping in pain as bruises and muscle aches resounded through her whole body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething had happened. Something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>The crash of thunder... the flash of lightning... the smell of smoke...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Mayday!

The memories were coming back. A tropical storm had sprung up in their path, rather than go around the pilot had assumed it wasn't a threat, but it had worsened as they approached, and developed into a full-on typhoon by the time they were in the thick of things. One of the engines was struck, the plane went down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was with some reluctance Colleen tried to open her eyes again, the bright light still threatening to blind her. Moving her hand to shield her eyes felt like lifting a ten ton weight. Still she slowly did so and peaked out at her surroundings. Slowly the image of a pristine white beach came into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was marred only by pieces of wreckage from the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Again Colleen gasped and tried to move. The pilot! She'd almost forgotten. She was a Rover she had to find him and save him if she could. Standing proved difficult as every inch of her body ached and her left leg probably had a fracture. Still she forced herself up to look at the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It wasn't good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From what could be seen of the crushed trees and scattered wreckage the plane had almost missed the island entirely. She could see the path carved through the forest where it had come down, snapping trees  and carving a deep furrow through the soil and sand. Bits of the plane were scattered all over, but the majority was gone. Given the way the trees had been flung they'd started to come down on the island, which meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Colleen turned towards the ocean and felt a sinking feeling in her stomach. She'd been lucky, the plane had crashed and she'd been thrown from the wreck, but the pilot and plane had continued on, plowing nose first into the sea. No doubt the plane was lying at the bottom of the ocean right now. And given how much of the furrow had been washed away by the tide and the clear skies overhead, even if she'd been in any condition to make a dive there'd be almost no chance of finding anyone alive down there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All Colleen could do was mutter a quick but solemn prayer to the pilot and give thanks for her own survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Of course another problem immediately became evident. With the plane swallowed by the sea she had no radio to call for help, and unless a message got out in time it would be a while before the crash sight was located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well as long as I don't find a boat marked the S.S.Minnow or find the bones of someone in a red shirt and white hat I should be ok,\" Colleen tried to joke to keep her spirits up but really the whole thing was more than a little sobering. \"Well if there's one thing all those survival training classes have taught me, it's the first thing to do is build a fire. Ok technically it's not to panic and make a signal, but I think I'm beyond panicking and the wreckage, though scattered, is fairly visible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fortunately there were the smoldering remains of part of the jet engine nearby, and though it had long since stopped and was mostly drained of furl, a small fire still burned in the corner of it which she was able to used to light some branches and build a bonfire on the beach. If she was going to survive until rescue it was a start at least. But already something felt strange about the island. Something she couldn't quite pin down right off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption One: She's not alone, there's a rustling in the bushes. Strange anthro creatures are natives of the island and believe she is a goddess descended from the heavens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption Two: Something smells funny about the burning branches and sand. They don't seem right. A sniff and a taste reveals the sand is pure sugar and the branches are beef jerky. Everything on the island appears to be made out of food of some form or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption Three: Something completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But she decided to get rid of that though by joking to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I sure did like the movie Cast Away, but maybe this is a little too far.\" Of course that wasn't a great joke. She always had a dark sense of humor so maybe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many emo kids does-\" She was stopped by the sound of rustling in the in a bush. She wanted to be smart and walk away, but she checked, in case it was the pilot or something. Luckily her pocket knife didn't fall out of her jeans while she was being washed up to shore, so she pulled it out just in case the thing in the bushes was a feral predator or something. When she peaked through the bushes, she only saw a feral red fox, sleeping, nothing major. When she turned back around, there were five anthropomorphic wolves surrounding her, pointing their spears at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the wolves spoke \"Anata wa 3ttsu no sentakushi ga arimasu. Izure ni seyo, anata wa watashitachi to issho ni shizuka ni kite, dare mo kizutsukemasen. Matawa B, anata wa watashitachi ga anata o ika seru y\u014d ni tanomu koto ga dekimasu.

Sad part is, she doesn't speak it, she only knew, because she knows that \"or\" means \"matawa\". So she tried to ask if any of them miraculousy spoke English. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, dae any of thou speak pommy, because I don't know Japanese?\" She asked in her British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolves looked at each other in confusion, until one of the wolves spoke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kanojo wa eigo ga dekiru ka d\u014d ka tazunemashita.

We've got a small situation down here.\" A crackling explosion came over the intercom, \"Actually make that a large problem. One of our expariments has gone nuts and we need someone to get down here and stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a minute later Colleen arrived at the lab and promptly had to duck as a large blast of energy short over her head. In the center of the room a large laser cannon type device was spinning crazily, firing randomly in any direction it could spin. Ducking behind a nearby table, Colleen found the tech she's spoken to, Roger, a Whippet canine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that thing?\" Colleen asked as she tried to make sense of the machines spasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suffice it to say, it's a device that radiates a new type of energy we recently discovered,\" Roger replied, \"As you can see, we needed someone with your agility to get past it and pull the plug.\" Roger indicated the far side of the machine where a large black plud lead from the machine to a wall outlet. \"Please just pull it if you can, that machine is the result of almost a decade of research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get your pocket protector in a pinch,\" Coleen smiled, \"I can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColleen watched the machines movements for a moment and noted how fast it took to discharge and it's rotation speed. While the shots seemed random, there was a shifting pattern she was able to descern. After getting it down, Colleen lept from behind the desk, spinning through the air, and landing in a temporarily safe spot. From there the dance of danger was on as she spun, twisted and dove through the beams towards the plug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she reached it and pulled as hard as she could, but it took a moment longer than anticipated and right as the plug came free, the final discharge from the gun caught Colleen full in the backside and she feel to the ground, a wisp of smoke curling from her prone body while inside her something began to change.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately it was to much for our machine to handle and it went berserk.The fact that colleen was hit most likely means that she has obtained that power.\" <br>\r\nHunter who had been Quiet this whole time finally said \"So what'll happen to Colleen then will she be all right?\" <br>\r\n<i>He's worried about me.

She could turn the entire base into pudding and we might always think it had been like that.\"<br>\r\nColleen looked up at the whippet scientist in surprise, \"Do you really think I could do something like that?\"<br>\r\n\"Again it's hard to say.

Her other hand was going through the same thing and judging from the numbness in her feet, they were too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to crawl to the doctors who were approaching her and felt even more weirded out as her paws simply slipped out of her shoes. It was when the changes reached her knees and the became unable to crawl that she began to panic. For some reason she just couldn't talk, not even gasps of panic left her mouth as she tried to extend an arm to the scientists that was limp up to the elbow. By not the softening had reached her pelvis and she shuddered as her spine began to melt, causing her torso to sag inwards on itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the changes finally consumed her torso and moved up her neck, she felt the changes seem to reshape her features slightly. Part of her wished she had a mirror and most was glad she didn't. Her skull softened and her muzzle sagged slightly with no bones in it. She swirled her tongue in her mouth and felt her teeth were still there, but they'd all gone soft, like cartilage more than bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay there, a boneless sack, her eyes the only thing she could move as she wordlessly pleaded to the scientists to help her.

It wasn't much but her once concave and trim middle had rounded out into a convex dome that nearly reached as far as her hard nipples. She drummed her fingers on it in shock, hearing a hollow noise like a actual drum as it reverberated under her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she'd noticed it too Colleen couldn't help watch as, her eyes widening, it seemed to gradually inch bigger. She started to hyperventilate but quickly clamped down on it when her belly jumped out another two inches in the process. Hastily she finished rinsing herself off and stepped out of the shower. By then her stomach had grown to the size of a basketball and so when she reached for a towel it bounced against the sink and gave her a chill as her wet fur brushed the cold metal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFur was definitely a disadvantage when it came to drying. She tried to shake herself first as she usually did, but once more her belly got in the way and she was nearly thrown off balance. Defaulting to just the towel took longer so by the time she was reasonably dry her belly had swelled to a beach-ball in size and now it wasn't just her belly either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Colleen looked in the mirror she saw her hips looked wider and her breasts a little fully. Even her upper arms were swollen faintly. She need to get help and fast, but there was a problem. Well, several actually. First, already she was bigger than any of her clothes. Nothing would fit her. Even the towels she'd used would be dubious at this point. True as a dog clothes had never mattered to her, but as a cano-sapian that was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother problem was that she couldn't call for help, at least not to the tech lab directly. She could call the other Rovers, but that meant informing them of her situation. Alternatively she could try using her bed -sheets as a toga and hurry to the lab,, but given her swelling state she wasn't sure she'd make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?</span></div></div>",

It was one of her biggest wishes that he whould join her some day in the shower.<br>\r\nLike always when she got those thoughs, she needed to release herself.<br>\r\nAnd because she still had no toy in her shower she grabbed the showerhead instead of rubbing herself and placed it between her legs letting the water flow directly on her wet pussy.<br>\r\nColleen shivered in pleasue as the water hit her most private spot and pressed her big ass agains the cold wall behind her lifting one hand to play with her boobs.<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes thinking about having hot sex with Hunter as she got more and more aroused.<br>\r\nShe pushed the showerhead harder and harder against her pussy feelling how her orgasm came closer and closer.<br>\r\nAfter 5 Minutes Colleens body started to vibrate in pleasue and her knees starting to get weak as she gritted her teeth and pushed the showerhead one more time against her pussy and pushing herself over the edge.<br>\r\nShe dropped the showerhead, thew her head back and moaned.<br>\r\n\"Oh god!\" She panted. \"That was exactly what i needed...\"<br>\r\nThen she wanted to turn around to turn the water off, but a sudden sloshing sound stopped her movement.<br>\r\n\"What in the world...?\" She asked as she looked down and discovered that her belly was inflated to the size of a big beachball. \"How did my belly...?\" She sayed as she touched her belly with her right hand and feeling the water sloshing and moving inside.<br>\r\nThen she quickly turned the water off, opened the door of the cabin, stepping out of it right in front of the lage mirror on the other wall turning to the side and looking at her new side view.<br>\r\n\"Oh my...

To share a hot naked shower with the man she had hot feeling for, she hadn't been planing on doing it with a belly that was as big as being nine months pregnant and filled with water but she could accept that. On the way there she had the hard work of taking of Hunter's clothes because he was to busy still half daydreaming while groping her enormous belly. Still it was just pajamas shirt and pants so it was quickly done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into the shower now both naked Hunter's member really started to go full erect, much to Colleen's delight. She started to stroke it gently, al while he started to gently stroke her inflated belly. It felt great for both of them as they did nothing else to each other for while and just enjoyed each others company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Hunter said in between moans. \"Colleen?\" \"Yes?\" She said looking into his eyes beautifully. \"Even thought this is just a dream and all of this is made inside my head, how did you do to make your belly so big like this?\" \"Well, It was actually quite easy.\" Colleen said as she reached for the faucet to trun the water on. As she did this water started to stream down from the shower head on to both of them. She was on her way to grab the shower head and show him how she had done it when he suddenly shouted, \"STOP!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken completely by surprise by Hunter's freakout Colleen slipped a little and landed on her butt resulting in her belly shaking around like mad for a moment. Looking up at him Colleen asked \"But what's wrong Hunter?\", seeing that he had the look of panic in his face. \"I don't know much about how things works in dreams, but I know that you can <u>not</u> get the feeling of being wet in a dream!\" Hunter said very dramaticly and nevously. \"This means that this is no dream. That I'm standing here naked, in a shower, with you, also naked, and with a belly that is-is...\" More couldn't Hunter say before he fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting naked on the floor with her lover laying unconscious Colleen thought, \"Well, this ended badly.\" Knowing that this was as good as it would get Colleen got up, turned of the water, and then started drag Hunter's body back to his bed. Getting him in bed and embed him Colleen looked at him and thought, \"When he wakes up he's going to think this all was in his dreams, and the only thing he will be questioning is why he went to bed naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she took his clothes and liad them nicely on his chair before leaving. \"This have been fun but I should go back to my room and find a way to get this water out of me. I might do this thing again later when I'm all alone.\" But things would not go so easily for her. What would go wrong for Colleen?</span></div></div>",

His breath came in short pants as he neared a forest and, without hesitation, dove into the dark tree line.<br>\r\nBranches tugged at his clothes and broke against the heavy suitcase he had clutched in one hand. Yet still he ran, fear driving him faster than hisw body could handle as he felt the shadow not far behind him.<br>\r\nEventually he rested in a clearing, trying to get some sense of direction.<br>\r\nA shadow moved in the darkness.<br>\r\n\"You have one chance,\" Came the thickly accented voice from somewhere in the trees. \"Leave da briefcase and get out of here... or it will be time for much hurting.\"<br>\r\nThe figure dropped the case right away. \"I'm just the delivery boy. Don't hurt me!\"<br>\r\nAnd before anything else could be said, he took off back into the woods, perhaps towards the city. No sooner had he gone than the figure stepped from the woods into the clearing.<br>\r\nDressed in silver body armor, he was human in build, but with a canines head. In ancient times, his Doberman face might have caused others to mistake him for the Egyptian god Anubis, but this canine was as far from a deity as one might guess.<br>\r\n\"Aw, an here I was looking forward to the biting of the soft mushy parts.\" the canine sighed in his thick German accent.<br>\r\nPicking up the briefcase, Blitz smiled to himself slightly. In the past couple years he had grown from the self-centered, coward he had been.  He still jumped and acted nervous at times, but he was proud to say he no longer screamed like a little girl (though he'd never say such a thing out loud).<br>\r\nGetting down to business, he opened the briefcase and took out the documents, competitors secrets the sneak had been hired to steal. Blitz wasted no time in shredding them with his sharp claws.<br>\r\nAs he stood to try and sniff his way back to civilization though, his blood ran cold. Only the overwhelming sent of pine trees filled his nose. It was true, he'd never had the strongest nose on the teem, but he was worried that he couldn't even find one sent to lead him back to the city. Worse still, save for the suit he wore, he had nothing with him, and he'd just shredded his only means of a signal fire. Cursing his luck, Blitz sighed, \"Just like the old days.\"<br>\r\nAnd so, he started to walk...</span></div></div>",

There was so much strange junk lying around that Blitz had to be careful not to accidently set something off. The dumbells, the airpumps, the tanks, and various other objects had tiny computer panels on them. Blitz inspected a small air pump and its gagetry's and tucked it under his arm as he checked the food. Strangely enough, the food seemed to be in prime condition, despite their age. Blitz gazed at the ones in packages and found that a warning label was on them, except in a code that he couldn't read. He took note of all of this before returning to the air pump in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitz squinted at it and hesitantly began pressing buttons.

He had no idea how this was even possible - even if it was just making his muscles swell up with just air, they shouldn't have been so firm, so strong, so powerful, yet it was definitely working. Well, if it was working, he certainly wasn't going to complain about it! With that thought in mind, his eyes slid closed as he began to lose himself in the pleasure of his growth. It was a warmth running through him, like how melted chocolate ran in those advertisements on TV. Smooth, pleasing, perfect. Perfect. The word reverberated around in his mind as he suddenly realised that this feeling was as close to perfect as he was fairly sure he could get. It was almost the exact same feeling as sitting in front of the fire, snoozing peacefully. The warmth and comfort enveloped him, consumed him. It was perfect. He was... well, okay, he wasn't perfect, it'd be foolish to say such a thing, he had his flaws as did everyone, but he felt perfect at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis blissful state was abruptly shattered when his head smacked into something. He let out a yelp that, thankfully for his pride, came out closer to something resembling a growl due to how much larger his vocal cords were. The nozzle came loose from his muzzle and he quickly switched the pump off, crouching down to gently place the pump back on the ground. His muzzle curled into a displeased frown as he took a step back and raised a huge paw up to see what his head had collided with, only to let out a gasp as his jaw dropped. It was the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could only stare up at the dull brown wood planks for a few moments, completely and utterly dumbfounded. He slowly lowered his gaze, past his huge, bulging pecs, his thick 8-pack abdominals, his powerful calves to the floor. The dirt had compacted into paw prints wherever he stood, which left him reeling. How much did he weigh now if his bare paws were leaving imprints in the dirt? He shook his head and looked back up to the ceiling. \"Mein Gott...\" He whispered in awe. He cast his gaze over his towering frame again. He must have been at least 10 feet tall, given that the whole barn was about 30 feet tall and he was standing under the landing that comprised the floor of the second level.  He was huge. He looked down at his armour, openly gawking at it. There was no way it would ever fit him now, he was far too big for it! He paused suddenly, as that thought played over in his mind. He was too big for his armour. He was huge. He was huge. His eyes widened again as he looked down at his immense, hulking frame as a wide grin came over his face. He was huge and he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised a hand and gently rubbed it over his chest, shivering as he felt his short fur under his hand. He let out a quiet, breathy moan as he pressed in against his pec, feeling the muscle beneath yield until he flexed his chest with a deep, thunderous growl. He couldn't help but grin like a fool as he felt the muscle swell outwards, pushing back against his grip. He tried to press even harder, only to find that the muscle didn't even move, it was so tense and firm nothing could move it. He felt a thrill run down his spine as he did so, quickly releasing the muscle and relaxing the pose. He reached down and ran his hand over his abs, marveling over how thick they were, they really did feel like cobblestones!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe withdrew his hand, astonished at how incredible the sensation was. He clenched his hand into a fist, grinning widely with glee at how his arm tensed when he did so. He flexed his arm even harder, his grin growing even wider as he reached over with his other arm and grabbed his bicep. To his total shock and utter joy, he couldn't even wrap his hand around his own bicep! He let out a booming chuckle as he raised both arms and flexed them together, watching with glee as they both swelled outwards until they were easily the size of watermelons! He could hardly believe it, this was amazing! He dropped his gaze down to his legs as a rather delightful idea came to mind. He lowered himself onto one knee, flexing his leg as hard as he could. He suppressed a whoop of joy as his calf bulged out until it was easily the size of its namesake, then he realised that even if anyone where around, there would be no stopping him now! He was a literally a giant among men, he could easily tower over the tallest of canomutants now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere thought of being able to casually overpower a canomutant with nothing but his own physical strength sent a rush of pleasure through him, a brief high of confidence that sent his short tail wagging so furiously it made him turn to look at it with a smile. His tail had been wagging the whole time, but with the thrill running through him, it had attracted his attention. Or, more accurately, just what was below had attracted his attention. He snickered to himself as he raised his arms again and flexed them, but this time, did so with his back and his rear as well. He let out a huff of pleasure as his entire back flexed gorgeously, his powerful musculature tensing and flexing beautifully, leaving his back looking like a roadmap of solid muscle while his rear tightened to the stage where it looked as if bouncing coins off it was utterly comical. Blitz knew it was ridiculous, but in the back of his mind, he couldn't help but picture Exile ripping a bank off its foundations and throwing it at him, for it to bounce harmlessly off his backside. He let out a low moan as he shivered with unadulterated glee at the wonderful thought of being so powerful as to be able to shrug off hits like that while flexing and showing off in such a glorious manner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big Doberman suddenly let out a loud gasp as a sudden warmth filled his chest... which radiated from between his legs. He glanced down to find that his foreskin was no longer containing his length.  A lewd smile crossed his lips as he let out a breathy moan of lust as he moved his hand down and massaged his length. His tan member stiffened in his firm, powerful grasp, drawing a gasp from him as the soft pink head swelled up through his closed hand, while his other hand reached down and cupped his balls, eliciting a sigh from him, as the tan-furred flesh was massaged vigorously. He snorted in glee as he stepped back and moved into a more open space in the centre of the barn. He got down on his knees and settled back so that he was resting on his knees. With a throaty growl, he reached down again and grabbed hold of his length as he began to pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to pant hotly as he continued to pump his length, whining loudly as the rush of pleasure only continued to rise. He could feel the heat in his crotch rise to a raging inferno as his legs twitched, claws scrabbling into the dirt, leaving huge gouges. He wasn't even sure he could stop what was coming at this point. Not that he wanted to, that is. He collapsed forward, bracing himself with a muscular arm as he keeps pumping with all the strength he can muster. He can feel it rising, surging towards the inevitable climax...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like his usual climax though, back when he was only six feet tall, no, no, no. This was a climax the likes of which Blitz had never even dreamed of before. Not even when in the throes of all-consuming lust could Blitz have imagined a release as powerful or as fulfilling as the thermonuclear explosion that ripped through his body, from his ears to his toes. It was total bliss. It was the feeling of growing from 10 feet to 10 miles in seconds composed into a single sensation, multiplied by a factor of 1000. He wasn't even sure if he could howl with how overcome he was until he heard his own, thunderous howl burst forth from his lips. After a length of time Blitz couldn't even begin to consider, he slumped forward, landing on his stomach, panting deeply. He lay there for a moment, gathering his strength before he could raise his head to see the aftermath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jaw dropped as he took in the scene before him. All he could see was cum. Everywhere, everything was completely coated in what had to be at least several inches of thick, sticky white paste. It was if the barn had been sprayed with a fire hose of cum several times in a row. He gawped at the scene, jerking his gaze back down to his cock, his jaws opening and closing in shock, but he said nothing. He simply couldn't muster anything, no snappy remark, no quip, nothing. The sheer output... He could never have imagined anything remotely like this! He had to guess that he could easily fill a fuel truck with an output like that! He shook his head as he tried to come to terms with the sheer madness of his situation. It was almost completely unbelievable... He was a giant, a hulking giant of muscle and virility. He hadn't had a chance to properly test out his strength yet, the thought of which made his dick flex and drew a moan from his lips. He wasn't even sure what to do, it felt as if his strength was slowly returning, even after such an explosive release! He took in a shuddering gulp of air as he considered what to do.</span></div></div>",

However, he also knew that he couldn't leave the barn in such a state especially if someone did in fact live here. Although the anthro Doberman was pretty sure that both the farmhouse and barn hadn't been used by any human for years. But even with that knowledge he felt it was only right ot use a hose to clean both himself and the barn, just in case he decided to come back it again someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after doning some looking around the 10 foot tall dog found a hose and set it up before turning on the water to which he used to wash off the cum that was on the front part of his body. Doing so caused Blitz to keep on grinning while his muscles seemed to glisten from the water that was running down his huge muscles. He then moved it into the barn and cleaned the huge mess he had made. And once he was for certain he had gotten rid of the mess he turned off the water and put the hose back where it was. He then proceeded to look at the full body mirror that was on the wall from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing so prompted the Road Rover to give off a tooth filled grin as he flexed various muscles and remarked to himself, \"Ha, look at me, I'm huge! And I bet I'm even stronger then Snowball is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon making said comment though he looked over at the various workout machines that were there in the barn. This prompted him to walk over to the bench and lay down onto after he had put ten huge plates on each side of the bar. He then proceeded to take in a breathe of air before he placed his hands onto the bar and took it off the rack. He then grunted and procedded to lift the bar up intot he air without much trouble. In fact the amount of weight he was lifting up and down seemed to super easy to him. However, since there wasn't anymore plates to add to what he arleady had Blitz knew he'd have to make due.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that he did as he spent about thirty minutes lifting the bar up and down which caused sweat to form and slide down his huge muscles. He then put the bar back into place before he proceeded to wipe the sweat from his forward as he remarked, \"Phew, that was an okay workout. But I bet I could lift a lot more then that.\" He then proceeded to walk over and grab his armor and the air pump while he added, \"But I guess I can worry about that once I get back to HQ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doberman then proceeded to put everything into the vehicle before he got into himself. Upon doing so the anthro dog realized that the seat was a bit snug due to his increased height and muscle mass. So he pushed the seat back until he was comfy and then turned on the vehicle and drove back to the Road Rovers HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving back to said HQ though Blitz saw one of the other Rovers in the garage. And not to anthro Doberman's surprise it was in fact....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blitz narrowed his eyes as he tried to make out who it was who was in the garage. Whoever it was, it definitely wasn't Shag given that they were wearing armor, but that was all he could make out and he didn't want to risk embarrassing himself by driving straight into something because he'd been distracted. That would have completely ruined the dramatic reveal he was planning. He turned his attention back to parking, and once he was satisfied, he switched off the ignition and took another look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Snowball.\" He smirked deviously. Perfect. Exile had turned to watch as he had driven in, and he could see his completely shocked expression in wonderful detail. Judging by the dull green glow of his eyes, he had 'activated' his night-vision. Unable to keep himself from grinning madly, he reached open and pushed the door open, stepping out of the car. His grin only grew even wider when he saw Exile stagger back, bracing himself against the car. As he stood to his full height, drinking in Exile having to crane his neck back to look up at him, he realized just how cramped he had actually been in that car. Raising an arm and flexing his bicep smugly, he spoke. \"Hey there, Snowball!  Check me out!\" He smirked. As he spoke, his voice echoing around the garage, he realized how much deeper his voice was, how powerful it was, how sexy it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blitz!\" The Husky yelped. \"You... you're huge! You're massive! How did you get so big?!\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitz grinned as he knelt down and shoved a hand into the car. \"I'm so glad you asked that. It's all thanks to this little baby here!\" He proclaimed, triumphantly holding the tank aloft. It looked comparatively tiny in his hand, his thick fingers curled around its metal shell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExile gently pushed himself off the car and tentatively walked forwards, eying the tank suspiciously. \"That little thing made you big?\" He asked, his skepticism obvious. He nodded enthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja! It's incredible, isn't it? I'm so big!\" He smirked cockily. He just couldn't help it, the thrill, the rush, the power was too intense to not enjoy it so much! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExile was silent for a few long moments, as he looked over the towering Doberman who looked as if he could bench press an 18-wheeler. He slowly nodded, his voice wavering. \"Da. It is quite... impressive.\" He conceded, his jaw slightly agape. \"How... how did you... well, um, grow?\" He asked, to which Blitz moved to the tank so that he could see the valve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I did was take in a bit of the air, and I was growing bigger and stronger!\" He grinned widely, to which Exile gaped up at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you, you just breathed in random gas from a weird tank you found... where did you find this thing anyway?\" He asked in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitz grinned down at him sheepishly as he rubbed the back of his head, his bicep audibly straining his suit as he did so. It was as glorious as it was bizarre to experience. \"Okay, ja, I guess it does sound kind of weird when you say it like that. But, it had all these buttons on it, so I guessed it was some medical thing or something. I found it in a barn when I ended up lost. I thought it would calm me down!\" He explained, to which Exile shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so, you breathe a gas that makes you bigger because you got lost and stumbled on some barn? Why would you think it was medical?\" He asked, to which Blitz retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, there were all sorts of gadgetry and gizmos there, it made sense when I was looking at it!\" He reasoned. Exile blinked, furrowing his brow in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There were lots of things like that?\" He asked, prompting Blitz to nod vigorously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja! There were little computers and some workout stuff too!\" He said, to which Exile let out a breath as he paced back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blitz, I think we should go and see Professor Hubert, who knows what that could be, or what it might do to you.\" He said, a tinge of concern in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already know what it does, it makes you bigger and stronger!\" He replied excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da, but what if it does something else? This could be dangerous Blitz. Besides, we need to know what the dealio with the rest of those things you mentioned is too.\" He pointed out. Blitz bit his lip, unable to come up with a counter-argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought a hand up to his muzzle, shifting in place. \"Ah, I guess you're right. Do we go and tell him now? Do we wait? What do we do?\" He asked. Exile thought on it for a moment before reaching a decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we go now. If there is anything bad happening, the sooner we know, the better.\" Unable to find a fault in that logic, he nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go.\" He said. He was considering stepping over the car to really help emphasize his new height, but decided against it, given that Exile was standing so close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, and you should bring that tank along too. The Professor might want to test it for things.\" He suggested, to which Blitz simply looked down at him. It was such a strange thing to be looking so far down just to look your comrades in the eyes after so long of being pretty much the same height as them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm holding it in my hand, I'm not planning on letting this thing go any time soon.\" He smirked. Exile shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da, da, I meant, ah, it does not matter. Come, we should go and find Professor Hubert.\" He said, turning to the door. Blitz followed him, but quickly realized he had to slow his walk quite considerably, given that his greatly increased height also granted him a significantly longer stride. Exile practically had to jog just to keep up with him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the pair came to the door, it was only then that they realized just how tall Blitz really was now. Simply standing normally,  the door barely reached the bottom of his broad chest, his firm pectorals barely meeting the top of the frame, and given how all the rooms and doors had been made larger than most properties, it only made it all the more obvious. Exile could only stare for a few moments in dumbfounded shock before he half-babbled out a string of awed comments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't believe it! You're bigger than the doors! These things can let Shag walk about fine, and there you are! You can't even fit through the doors!\" He gasped out, staring up the titan of a Doberman with wide eyes. Blitz couldn't help but raise an arm and flex as he smirked down at him. The whole feeling of being too tall for the doors was just too wonderful to pass up the opportunity to show it off at every chance he got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja, I'm huge!\" He beamed gleefully, showing off his indestructible fangs slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Husky nodded mutely, evidently shaken by the realization. He averted his gaze for a minute before he quietly said. \"Let us go find the Professor, Da?\" Blitz nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja, sounds good. You go first. I'll need to, heh, squeeze my way through.\" He replied, obviously relishing how his new size changed the way he interacted with something as simple as a door. Exile promptly stepped through, turning to face Blitz once he was in the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitz flashed a grin at him as he crouched down, his massive frame shifting and moving with surprising grace as his armor creaked and groaned alarmingly as his powerful frame stretched against it. He reached a beefy arm through and guided his head through, taking care to avoid smacking into anything, although he couldn't keep his ears from hitting the frame, forcing them to flatten before he pulled through, his ears popping back up. He tentatively shifted himself so that his cannonball shoulders could be eased through, after which, he carefully moved his other arm through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that he realized an issue he hadn't anticipated. His snout was already nearly pressed into the opposite wall. With a sharp intake of breath through clenched teeth, he began to rotate his enormous frame as best he could, so that he was at a more diagonal angle, allowing him to slowly pull himself forwards, dragging his thick legs through. After a few moments of dragging himself forwards and deep, panting breaths that ruffled Exile's fur, he managed to haul himself into the hallway. Bringing his muscular arms under his mighty chest, he pushed himself up, breathing a sigh of relief as he realized that the halls were tall enough to accommodate him. Even if it was only just.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! There we are, now let's go find Professor Hubert, hmm?\" He suggested, unable to keep himself from grinning widely at Exile's stunned expression. Exile nodded weakly, ducking past his muscular legs to get in front of him and begin leading him down to the labs. As they began to make their way through the halls, Exile couldn't help but wonder at how strong Blitz must be now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarring Shag, he was the strongest member of the team. He could remember embracing Blitz with a bear hug and hearing every single joint in his torso crack in what was admittedly, a rather amusing manner, despite the slightly grotesque occurrence. He could lift dozens upon dozens of tons above his head without breaking a sweat when he tried and thinking about it, he realized that he wasn't actually sure what his real upper limit was. Typically, the limiting factor in using his strength was how tough the object was. He could hold a door closed if someone wanted to get through, but they could still make progress. If he pushed any harder, the door would simply bend under his touch like tissue paper. But now? Now he might have a new contender. It was... such a strange feeling. They were all incredibly strong, but he was the second strongest. For Blitz to suddenly become so huge? It was... weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head and shoved those thoughts to the back of his mind. There would be time for that later, for now he had to find Professor Hubert. Who knew what this could be doing to Blitz right now? Of course, it could be doing him no harm and even improving him in ways that he couldn't even think of at this point, but it could also be slowly damaging him and destroying his body from the inside out while everything seemed perfectly okay. He couldn't take that chance, he just couldn't. After Blitz had grown so much as a person... His thoughts trailed off as he smirked at his choice of words. It was true though, he couldn't just stand by when something could be seriously wrong. And so, off to Professor Hubert it was. As they continued through the corridors, thankfully without encountering anyone else, they came to the Laboratory, their destination clearly marked above the door with an impressively official sign above the door.</span></div></div>",

We don't want to disturb the others while they're sleeping.\" Exile protested, which caused Blitz to slightly groan out in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this he then continued ot walk down the hallway when he said, \"Fine, have it your way. But I'm going to go see how strong am I. and I promise I won't wake the others up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExile watched as his now huge comrade walked down the hallway until he reached the vehicle bay again. This peaked the husky's interest as he slowly followed behind the Doberman and looked on and let out a gasp upon seeing the other anthro dog easily lift one of the Rovers vehicles with both of his hands and over his head while in a crouching position. This gave the anthro husky a very god view of the huge anthro dog's wide and muscled back along with his short tail which was wagging like crazy above his two large, muscled, and firm butt-cheeks which caused the husky to blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his staring was quickly broken away from Blitz when he heard Professor Hubert's voice when he said, \"Ah Exile, I'm glad I found you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the anthro husky to turn around look at the approaching anthro dog as he asked, \"Oh, Professor. did you find what caused Blitz to get so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm afraid I didn't. From what I could tell there's nothing but air in there. So I plan on doing some more tests to see if that might bring me better results.\" Hubert explained, before he looked into the vehicle bay and saw what Blitz was doing. And upon doing so one of Exile's ears twitched when he heard the older dog muttered to himself, Wow, that's quite impressive strength indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this only caused the husky's eyebrow to narrow while he let out a slight growl of annoyance. This caused him to mentally gasp as he realized that he was in fact jealous of Blitz's new increase in size. But while the Professor walked away and up to Blitz to most likely tell him about his findings an idea popped into the anthro husky's head. That being that he could go into the lab and use the air pump on himself. That way he would be not only the second strongest on the team again, but maybe even the strongest Rover ever. However, he could also look for advice from one of his teammates as well. That could at least help him cool down. And so after thinking it over Exile decided to.....</span></div></div>",

However, as he slid his eyes closed and took a deep, steadying breath, he quashed the idea. He had a host of powers with his eyes - heat, freezing, night-vision. His strength was far from his only power, and far from his only asset at that; he was a brilliant mechanic. Engineering had always come naturally to him, the mathematics and physics lining up in beautiful, perfect order. The physics of his powers were something he hadn't learned much about, but Professor Hubert and the Master were much more aware of that. Besides which, an understanding of the physics of their powers were not essential to their success in the field, at least on a theoretical level. He was far more of a practically-minded individual, and he could be of tremendous help on the field because of it. He didn't need to be the strongest Rover on the team, no matter how much of a blow it was to his ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, then again, the <i>thrill</i> of such extreme strength was undeniable - the ability to perform feats of strength that those around you could not, and those that verged on the violation of physics itself were thrilling beyond description. The feel of his muscles burning as the obstacle surrendered to his sheer <i>power</i> was a feeling that always left him slightly giddy, and the feeling of an obstacle surrendering to his might <i>without</i> his muscles burning, for something to require no effort in the first place, it was a rush like no other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked, taking in a sharp breath. He froze as he was struck by the realisation that he was falling to the temptation. He clenched his teeth, shaking his head vigorously. He had to distract himself from all of this somehow. He had to think of something that could firmly keep his mind off the idea of using that tank, except nothing came to mind. Every option available to him either involved physical activity which would no doubt lead him down the path of longing for such exceptional size and strength, or wouldn't require enough of his attention to reliably keep him resisting the temptation. As much as he wanted it, his conscious mind practically screamed at him to not risk it - he had no idea of the possible consequences, and even if it did turn out to be completely harmless, he would much rather not take the risk. Of course, if it was completely harmless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head again, growling softly. He turned and slipped through the door, unwilling to stay any longer, lest his willpower give out completely. He had to think of something... or maybe... someone. Talking about his thoughts could help convince his less rational side to hold off on simply charging into the laboratory and inhaling a few litres of air right there and then. As much as he hadn't wanted to wake the others up, he needed to talk with someone about this. Considering the alternative was using the tank, it was a simple choice... or... it would have been, if the temptation wasn't there. It would be so easy to reclaim his position, or to even surpass it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran a paw over his muzzle, setting off down the hall. Obviously, Blitz was completely out of the question, given that a mere glance at him was enough to send his mind racing with all sorts of thrills and exciting thoughts. The same held true for Professor Hubert - the dog was truly brilliant, and while he was sure he could help talk him through his irrational desires, he didn't dare take the risk. The Master, again, no, he couldn't talk with him. If Professor Hubert hadn't informed him already, then he'd no doubt want to investigate the tank further, and that might involve Blitz. Shag... no, no! Given that he was the strongest... well, second strongest now, talking with him would simply be stupid, it'd be the exact same, for all intents and purposes, as talking to Blitz. So, that only left Colleen and Hunter, and given that everyone else was still sleeping, well... Colleen needed her 'beauty sleep'. Hunter it was then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't as if he didn't enjoy the Retriever mix's company. Hardly, on the contrary, he'd have to say he did enjoy Hunter's company. As... eccentric as he could be, he was a genuinely capable leader when the situation called for it, not to mention that he was also incredibly personable. Always willing to lend an ear or a paw, if you ever had a problem, Hunter would drop whatever he was doing and immediately see to helping you out. He was exactly the person he'd need in a situation like this. Setting off with newfound purpose, he made his way through the hallways towards their quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked through the smooth, steel corridors, his boots thumping rhythmically on the hard floor, he distracted himself by taking in the view on the way. He'd walked through these halls more times than he could count. Most of the time it had been for mundane reasons, simply moving from point A to point B for whatever reason he'd needed to, but sometimes it had been for much more intense reasons: Parvo had deployed Cano-mutants again; World Leaders were under threat and their own security services wanted to cover all bases; the very security of the world was under threat. While their missions were still demanding both physically and mentally, and at times, psychologically, they had mercifully become less frequent with Parvo and other major players becoming much more known to the world - with their element of surprise gone, the world could adjust and begin formulating plans of action. He brought a paw to the underside of his muzzle, rubbing it thoughtfully as he mused on that. Parvo would remain a threat until he was no longer here... as morbid as that was, on many levels. Though, maybe, just maybe, the world could be safe one day. There could be a world where the Rovers were there as an option, not as a necessity. A wistful smile crossed his muzzle at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing down the hall, his mind wandered off to their many missions over the years, and how they had changed with the world. They had been through so many trials and tribulations and so many fights, far more than he cared for. <i>He snarled furiously as he ducked beneath the St. Bernard's punch - which probably could have sent a tank flying across a six-lane highway - and rushed up with a savage uppercut. The cano-mutant let out a garbled howl of pain as it staggered back. It attempted to defend it's bulky torso with its muscular arms but he didn't do for the easy hit. The gamble paid off, and his ears were blasted by a scream of agony as its kneecap was smashed with enough force to shatter concrete. Only the enhanced anatomy of a cano-mutant saved the dog from being crippled. As its great bulk dropped with an almighty crash, he grabbed it by the shoulders - as intimidating as it would be to hold him aloft by the throat, he didn't want to kill him - and hauled him up, smashing him through the railing as if it were made of gram crackers and holding him there. His muzzle twisted into a dark scowl as the St. Bernard realised what he was being held over. Of course, he had no intent of ever dropping him into concentrated ammonia, but he didn't know that judging by the wide-eyed look of terror he was giving him. He could <b>feel</b> the moment it stopped fighting out of an attempt to get to safety, and the moment it started fighting out of pure, unadulterated panic, a primal, instinctual fear. With a snarl, he quickly threw the thing back onto the platform, where it immediately scrambled away from him, backing up against the opposite railing and cowering. He looked at it for a moment, back to the tank, and back at him again. With the message clear, he moved on. There were still people to save.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed as he pulled himself out of his memories. Their missions had changed in many ways, yet stayed the same in others. However, another thing that had changed with time was the team itself, and without doubt, certainly for the better. Hunter had grown from a ditzy, at times almost foolish goofball who had fallen into a leadership role, to a capable, rational leader. Colleen's temper had calmed with time and training, and Blitz's cockiness had matured from foolhardiness to cautious confidence. Shag was still somewhat of a coward, but he'd become a lot less bumbling. Muzzle... well, Muzzle was still a force of nature who could rip almost anything apart effortlessly. He recalled Blitz openly wondering if he had super strength or super strong teeth and claws, or both, and he'd been hard pressed to argue against that thought. He shook his head, Muzzle didn't quite count, even if he was part of the team. As he finished the list of his team mates, he realised that *he* must have changed with them... how had he changed? His brow furrowed as he considered his own changes - it was always harder to figure out how you'd changed compared to others. He supposed that since starting, he could say with a reasonable degree of certainty that he had become more world-wise. Figures of speech made more sense to him now, as did a lot of the world in general... He'd matured? He would have said that he was mature to begin with, he was an adult after all. Of course, self-reflection isn't the easiest thing in the world. The very second he'd finished saying that in his head, however, he noticed Hunter's room, pausing in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing his thoughts aside, he stepped forward, knocking gently. No reply, he knocked harder, wincing at the noise. As he raised his paw again, his ears twitched at a soft sound. Stepping back, the door opened, revealing Hunter, clad in pyjamas - much like his own, except green. \"Exile! Hey buddy, what's up?\" Hunter asked, his tone quiet but enthusiastic.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Exile rubbed the back of his neck with his right hand when he moved his gaze somewhat off to the side when he replied to the anthro golden retriever, \"Hunter, comrade, there is something I have to ask you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, no need to be nervous Exile. If have something to ask me then by all means just ask me.\" Hunter reassured his friend, to which the anthro husky felt his friend place a hand onto his right shoulder in comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the leader of the Rovers had done this Exile couldn't help but to let out a heavy sigh before he looked back at him and asked, \"Well, how would you react to an item that could um how you say, does the changing of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly do you mean, Exile?\" Huynter asked, while he tilted his head to the right in slight confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm well I know this will be sounding like the crazy talk. But comrade Blitz seemed to have found a pump that made him not only bigger, but much stronger too.\" The blue and white furred anthro dog explained as best as he oculd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSAdly though the husky saw the other buff dog let out a chuckle before he replied, \"Exile, buddy, I highly doubt there's something that could change someone like much or in that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing thsi remarked prompted Exile's eyebrows to narrow in slight annoyance as he figured the last person to question his claims would be Hunter. However, even he himself did have doubts of such a thing being real when he first saw Blitz at his bigger size when he returned to the base about or hour ago. However, the heavily muscled husky refused to let himself get too upset about this since he knew that the only way to prove to his follow Road Rover about this item was to show him what Blitz had become. And so Exile took a hold of the golden retriever's right wrist and began to run down the hallway though he did make sure that the two of them were quiet as to not disturb the other Rovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked back at Hunter when the yellow furred dog asked, \"Exile, where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to the vehicle bay so that you can see what has happened to comrade Blitz. Then perhaps you'll believe me and be able to answer to my earlier question.\" The husky commented, while the two continued to run down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd within a few minute both Rovers arrived at the large vhicle bay to which Exile mentally pointed out that the door was still opened. Which he knew meant that both Blitz and Professor Hubert must of been inside there as the older must of still been running test of the semi giant doberman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Exile made sure that both he and Hunter slowed down to just a walking pace until they reached the opened the doorway. Once there the husky then extended towards the massive doberman and looked at Hunter while he remarked, \"Here, see for yourself comrade Hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the heavily muscled husky watched as the godlen retriever looked into the room. And as he did this he was not surprised when he saw Hunter's eyes widen in pure shock while he also let out a gasp of surprise and took a step back. However, the leader of the Road Rovers quickly recovered from his shock as Exile saw him look back in his direction as he aslo cleared his throat and said, \"Well, I can see why you'd ask me the quesiton you did earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a smirk ocming on from proving to his friend that what he had said was true Exile crossed his huge arms in front of his huge pecs as he commented, \"I'm glad that you believe me comrade.\" Though the husky's confident look quickly turned to that of confusion as he saw the golden retriever's eyes were glued on the much large Blitz. Who at least by the look on his face that was what the husky assumed since he too found himself staring at his changed friend as well. And so he waved a hand in front of his friend's face and added, \"Comrade? Are you still with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh yeah, yeah, sorry about that Exile.\" Hunter let out, as he let out a light chuckle and then rubbed the back of his own neck with his left hand. Though the husky couldn't help but notice a twinkle in his friend's eyes as he continued with, \"So you wouldn't happen to know where this air pump is do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I do? Why do you want to do see it?\" Exile asked, while he tried to figure out what his friend wanted to do. But once he saw Hunter give him a nod in response to his question the husky sighed in defeat and then began to walk towards the lab while he went on with, \"Very well. Follow me comrade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of quietly walking down the hallways both Road Rovers arrived at the lab. And once both had opened hte door and walked into it Exile saw Hunter give him a confsued look as he asked, \"What, that's the air pimp that made Blitz so big? It doesn't look any different a normal air pump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I know, it is very strange. Even Professor Hubert is unsure how it actually works.\" Exile confessed, while they walked up to it. He then felt that urge to use the item to get back to his status of the strongest Rover Road again as he swallowed a lump in his throat and looked over at Hunter and kept on going, \"So what do we do now comrade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore answering the husky saw his friend cross his arms over his own impressive chest as he suggested, \"Well to be honest even though it worked on Blitz, we have n oidea if it'll work on us or not. So I think we should test it out by having......</span></div></div>",

Budapest was an awful city where Exile had been given an awful job as a watch dog for a defense contracting firm for the United States.  The language was gibberish to Exile, who realized almost immediately that Hungarian wasn't a slavic language, almost any of which Exile could understand and draw a basic meaning from.  The people in his firm, mercifully, spoke in English to one another.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Exile had been briefed by the Master about hissudden relocation from his pastoral home in Siberia before he had been shipped here to Budapest: apparently, some moron in the Department of Justice in America had forgotten to redact his name in a classified memorandum that had somehow, probably through leaking, managed to get into the hands of the American press.  And the location of his home had been leaked as well.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Exile supposed that things could have been worse.  He could have been shipped to Somalia or some other third-world nation.  The people of Budapest were a friendly and generous lot, especially with food, Exile noticed.  Exile chuckled, he wished he could have a taste of the local cuisine.  And with that happy thought, Exile noticed the cleaning lady who was frequenlty the joy of his day, Ana.  She was a stout, almost motherly figure in appearance and demeanor.  She would fuss over Exile in a way that he sincerely missed.  Although she never seemed to leave, Exile knew that at some point she must.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Exile deduced this from a small, square package Ana held in her arms.  But as Ana approached, Exile realized that Ana's package was larger than he anticipated.  And the package smelled deeply of the greasy, calorie-heavy food that had made stomach of the security guard who sat at the front desk with Alex form a generous fold when the man sat.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Officer Viktor Ferfi was a short, pale, dirty-blond-haired man with greasy skin and an ever-sweaty body.  Although his stench repelled Exile, the food that the man kept on himself was enough to draw Exile back.  The man was also nice enough; and even though he wasn't technically allowed to do so, he kept a bag of dog food and a bowl behind the desk where he sat and let Exile eat whenever and whatever he wanted, including some of the man's food.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ana had now strolled up to Viktor for some reason and had given him the box, with a chocolate cake inside.  Viktor seemed delighted, but said that he was full still from lunch.  Exile sensed that the two loved each other, given the amount of gifts the two exchanged between themselves.  Exile quickly got bored by the duo's sentimental coversations and went back to eating his food quietly.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After he had finished his food and Ana had left, Viktor refilled Exile's bowl and went back to work, occassionally eating a bite or two of his piece of cake before it was time for him to leave.  Exile finished his bowl of food just before the time Viktor usually left.  So after Viktor had refilled his bowl, Exile contentedly wagged.  But Viktor, asde from the usual pat on the head before he left, cut Exile a very liberal slice of cake and fed the dog a quarter of the cake.  When Exile devoured the piece, Viktor smiled, whispered about Exile's healthy appetite, cut Exile another small piece, and left.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Within minutes, however, Exile seemed woozy before he lay down and fell asleep.  And when he awoke\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</span></div></div>",

This was puzzling. The last thing he remembered was going to sleep with everyone else. Also, his straitjacket, the thing that restrained him from attacking others, was off, but he was bound with his limbs splayed out. In addition, he felt something pushed in his mouth, thought he couldn't immediately identify it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuzzle, alarmed and angered by this new position, struggled fruitlessly against his bonds. As he was trying to escape, the sound of a distant door opened and he froze. There were quiet footsteps, as a whispering group drew close to the dog. Muzzle tried to hear what they wer saying, but they were effectively quiet and, when they silenced themselves, another, more pronounced sound pounded against his ears and he began to feel something going into his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound was...</span></div></div>",

In this expanded universe the Rovers have grown to the point where they're a full organization. Hunter and his team are the 'Alphas' but there are many other teams that can be populated by fan made characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only request that if you add them in here, keep their powers reasonable and not go overboard, and give us nice descriptions of each character you bring in.

Still, they find time to have fun and relax, but, with what happens now, is it relaxation or the result of a mission?<br>\r\nYou decide.<br>\r\nNow, the rules: No gore, no death, no overly brutal mangling. Sex is ok, but don\u2019t dominate chapters on it. This is an inflation/expansion story. Sex of M/M or F/F is ok too, but again, don\u2019t play it up too much. Additional characters may be added to the six Rover team, but this is not a place to stick your own character in. If you create a new Rover, consider that anybody after you will be able to use them however they want. Lastly, I\u2019d like to keep humans out of the story if possible. I know \u2018The Master\u2019 is human, but as a rule of thumb, keep all humans to an absolute minimum please.<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun. :)</td>",
