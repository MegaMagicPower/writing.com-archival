We sent Jesse and Doc three months back.  They have not been heard from since.  Bonnie and Clyde went ten days ago.  There has been no word from them since they went deep.  Both teams were to report on alternate days.  We fear the worst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Director had used code words, as was SOP.  The Chaser had worked with two of the agents mentioned, and they had been very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our only possible lead is a bar on the Wharf,\" continued the Director.  \"We suspect it is used as a meeting point for the vigilantes, and we suspect the barman is in on it.  We have nothing definite, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the name of the bar?\" asked the Chaser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Brass Bass.  The barman calls himself Patrick 'Knuckles' McCain.  It is an assumed name, and we have not been able to dig up anything yet.  We suspect he's ex-IRA.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chaser nodded, and mused for a while.  \"Anything else?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said the Director.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me work this alone for a while,\" said the Chaser.  \"I will let you know if I need a partner or team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Director looked like he was going to object, and then held his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" he said, \"but you will report in every day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His mother was a South Vietnamese government official's daughter and his father, Arnold, an Army clerk who had been posted to Saigon.  Arnold's father was of Irish descent, and his mother a Mexican aristocrat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold had fallen love with Fred's mother at their very first meeting at a Christmas Eve dinner.  He had assiduously wood her, and succeeded.  They were married after a courtship of almost one year.  Fred was born in the States two years later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred was wearing a checked flannel shirt hanging loose over a pair of jeans.  He had put on his favourite cowboy boots - something that was almost a fetish with him.  He had taken off his jacket, which was hanging over the back of his chair, and as usual, he looked alert and attentive, even though his eyes were hidden behind dark glasses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you sleep wearing those shades?\" asked the Chaser by way of greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred lifted a hand, gestured to the chair in front of him and said, \"Not these.  I have got another pair for sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred was small, but he was tough.  He hid a core of steel under a ready smile that lit up his handsome face.  He wore his jet black hair down to his shoulders, tied in a pony tail at the back.  He looked at the Chaser with an eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose you wanted to meet me to discuss my shades, did you?  Why don't you order some drinks and tell me what it is all about.\"</span></div></div>",

The customers sitting near the window booths scattered rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the world\u2019s going on?\u201d Someone yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred stood up, but Chaser motioned him to sit down. \u201cWait!\u201d He ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw the barman pick up the phone and dial a number while the customers settled down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome drunken rowdiness,\u201d Chaser said slowly. \u201cThey\u2019ll soon bring inside the unruly one to hide him from the police. When they do that, I want you go after them and offer your help. Say you\u2019re a medic and give one of these to the criminal to swallow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t they understand small crimes breed bigger ones?\u201d Fred mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaser took his hand out of his pocket and placed it on the table. Fred planted his hand over Chaser\u2019s in a friendly gesture. After Chaser pulled his hand back, Fred dragged his hand slowly and put it in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou planted him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Fred whispered. \u201cThe rowdy drunk who broke the window\u2026He\u2019s your snitch!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaser nodded. \u201cWhat he swallows will be a microchip. There are five microchips in pill form in that tiny box. It will stay in his system for two days, and if we\u2019re lucky, longer. I want you trace him, follow him, and supply him with more chips until they take him to their holding point. We need to know where they are holding these law breakers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you give him the whole thing?\u201d Fred asked, adjusting his dark glasses over his nose. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be easier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Fugitive searches them every step of the way. His cover would be blown, if they found the chips on him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time the barmaid thunked two beers in front of them, two men carrying the rowdy drunk entered inside the bar, rushing their way to the backroom. Chaser didn\u2019t look at them, but he took a bottle and poured the beer into his glass. Fred stood up and went after the men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaser heard his voice faintly. \u201cLet me help. I am an EMT guy,\u201d he was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaser sipped his beer slowly, then stood up leaving a twenty on the table. One snitch might not cut it. He had to fortify this lead with others. While Fred would be covering this area, Chaser could get to the heart of the matter through other means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
