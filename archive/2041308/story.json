            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ahreed Hussein was petrified. Sitting at a stainless steel desk, an empty chair opposite was the only other furniture in the brightly lit, windowless room. He'd been instructed not to look back at the large mirror behind him. For what seemed like hours now, he could still hear his heart pounding in his chest. Frantically he continued to try and think of some possible reason for his detention. What had he done? Who had he met? Was it someone he knew? Then again it might be Facebook, Twitter, email or a stupid text message to one of his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had not seen or heard of Baba, his dad, since that brief mobile call as he was taken from school. The day had started like any other school day, except after two periods of English he went to the school library during recess to work over a difficult, homework maths equation. His greatest fear to that point was his maths teacher, Mr Bhaduri in the afternoon. Though a fellow Muslim, Mr Bhaduri did Ahreed no favours. While working away at the back row of the library desks, Ms Cook the Librarian came over and asked him to go to the Principal's office after recess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had waited outside the office for about ten minutes, he was summoned. Standing around the main desk were a man and a woman, talking to his Principal, Mr Waites. He had introduced them as Kirstin and Russell. Ahreed had noticed immediately that the man was much bigger than his Baba or his brother, Ahrou. The woman seemed young. Mr Waites had explained they were from the government and needed to speak with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had talked to him about school life at the Kings School, his scholarship and his sporting interests. Then they began to explain about leaving, taking him with them! Immediately, Ahreed was alarmed. His Principal had encouraged him to call his dad, and Baba had simply said over the phone, \"Trust me, my boy. Go with them. I will talk with you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though the car the man Russell and the woman Kirstin bundled him into was ordinary, Ahreed realised immediately that the situation was serious. Afraid of the man who was driving, he turned to the young woman sitting next to him in the back seat. \"Am I in some kind of trouble, Ms Kirstin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked out of the car window, smiling. \"Why do you think that, Ahreed?\" she asked, distantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed paused for a moment. \"Because you are taking me away.\" The sound of the traffic outside filled the silence as she looked up at the rear vision mirror. Ahreed could see her eyes meet the man's as he drove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think we are taking you?\" asked the woman, glancing back out of the passenger window. She seemed to be half ignoring Ahreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down into his lap, feeling frustrated now, as well as frightened. Every question he asked was returned by another question. \"How could I know, when you have not told me!?\" he demanded, letting the woman know he was becoming impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled again, still staring distantly out at the bustling city of Sydney passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed kept waiting for an answer. Neither the man nor the woman replied. Ahreed was afraid to ask any more questions. He looked around the car instead and noticed a sign stuck to the driver's visor. Ahreed realised it was a hire car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver Commodore drove on, Ahreed noticing its entry to the M4. He recognized Paramatta, Strathfield and then Petersham pass by as his journey continued. He so wanted to ask about the destination, but his trust in the two strangers had been exhausted by the conversation leaving the Kings School. As the car turned towards Mascot and then approached the airport, his alarm bells really started to ring. Suddenly, he blurted out, \"Where... where are you taking me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman beside him and the man driving kept ignoring him. The woman just reached into her handbag and took out a small tablet device, then started texting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't fair!\" protested Ahreed, \"You can't do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Ahreed,\" replied the woman, \"We're just going on a quick flight to Canberra.\" Ahreed sat suddenly forward, looking out at the airport surrounds as if trying to find a bearing. The woman stretched out her arm and grabbed him by the shoulder, pressing him back into the seat. \"Stay calm, Ahreed,\" she said, raising her voice slightly and placing her smartphone down on the next seat. \"It's going to be alright...there's no need to be alarmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what is this!?\" protested Ahreed. \"You can't do this to me... this is Australia.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Kirstin woman moved her hand from Ahreed's shoulder to his hand. \"Calm down, Ahreed. You will be back with your family tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed felt confused again. \"Why are you taking me to Canberra? How do I know you won't hurt me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Ahreed,\" continued Kirstin, \"This is Australia. You are an Australian. We will not hurt you. We simply need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo many thoughts were fleeting through Ahreed's mind. The most obvious question was who could he trust? He looked at Kirstin's eyes, then back down into his lap. Slowly, he asked again, \"Why are you taking me away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman tried to gain back Ahreed's eyes. \"Because we need your help, Ahreed... Australia needs your help. We have been helping you for the past few years and now we are asking you to help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed pulled his hand away from the young woman. \"How have you helped me?\" he asked, looking back up into her eyes, anger flashing across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin sat back in the back seat of the hire car and looked back out of the window. She considered her answer carefully. This young, fourteen year old boy was scared - she could see that. But it was important that she did not reveal her assignment too early. There were many secrets Ahreed would need to keep for the Australian Secret Intelligence Organisation, some of them stretching back into a history before he was born, others reaching out into the future security of Australia. <br>\r\n\"Your School,\" she began, fixing back on his expectant, deep brown eyes, \"It's a special school we sent you to with your father's permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed paused. He wondered about what the woman Kirstin had just said. \"What do you mean, my Baba gave the permission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin again thought carefully about her answer to the boy while holding his worried gaze. She did not want to reveal anything about Ahreed's father that perhaps, his father had not explained to him. But at the same time, she needed to win his trust. The government had spent a lot of money helping Ahreed, his father and the rest of Ahreed's family. This long term plan depended heavily on this conversation with Ahreed and what choices he might make in an uncertain future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin blinked. \"Ahreed, your dad has helped the Australian Government a great deal,\" she took hold of his hand again, \"And we trust your dad so much, it's difficult for me to explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed pulled his hand away and adjusted his posture in the back seat of the car, still propped on the tarmac with the plane visible in the windscreen. He did not quite understand what the woman Kirstin was saying to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down, then back up into his eyes again. \"We need to stop the killing, Ahreed... you must know what happened in Melbourne a few weeks ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Ahreed, \"I saw what happened.\" He paused again, looking back through the windscreen at the plane. \"It was evil, Miss Kirstin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied, \" It was evil. There were thirty thousand people in that stadium, Ahreed. Over a thousand are dead and nearly three thousand are sick from the gas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed looked back at the young woman's eyes. \"They were Jihadists from ISIS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes they were, Ahreed,\" continued Kirstin, \"But would you ever do such a thing like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed could feel a tear in his eyes, glancing uneasily back out at the plane through the window of the car. He blinked, and two tears ran down either side of his face. \"In the name of Allah, Miss Kirstin, in the name of the loving, the merciful, the beautiful Allah, no, I would never do something like that.\" Ahreed's gaze fixed ahead, as more tears welled in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin looked at the boy as he stared distantly ahead, both admiring and lamenting Ahreed's sentiment. So many of the terrorist fighters had probably felt this way in their youth. So deep was their love and concern for others in their hearts as children. Naturally maturing young boys emerging into manhood, they had stared ahead into a brighter future, faithfully optimistic yet blissfully naive. And yet, as time and maturity washed over them like a warm, Pacific wave on a tropical island paradise, the sting of a hidden creature in the foam had struck: poisoning, frightening, compelling them them to a tragic choice of devastation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin noticed the faint whisps of whiskers on Ahreeds upper lip. His toned, brown skin and long eyelashes, wetted (moistened) by the tears of an ancient (a timeless) dilemma. He was a beautiful kid, and since reading his file at her desk a few weeks ago she had wondered many times about his appearance. Seeing him here now in the back of the car at Sydney airport, for the first time, she realised that this was an important moment in the transition process. Kirstin knew her job, knew Ahreed's history and knew the pressure of her assignment. But now that the boy was finally in her hands, she strived to find the right words. He was just a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced up at the rear vision mirror and, seeing (her partner's) Russell's gaze, lifted her hand in a gesture to wait. Looking back at Ahreed she watched as the boy began to sob. She took hold of his hand again and squeezed gently, turning and placing her other hand on his shoulder. \"It will be okay, Ahreed. I'm sorry if we frightened you. Don't be afraid.\" She waited a moment before continuing, \"You will be back home tonight, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed looked back down into his lap, then glanced out of the side window of the car into the distant horizon of the airport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid, Ms Kirstin. I'm scared you are going to hurt me.\" The boy sobbed some more, still staring across the fields of grass and tar into the distance \"I don't understand what is happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me, Ahreed,\" pressed Kirstin suddenly, \"Look at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy slowly turned back to Kirstin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must trust us, Ahreed,\" she continued, \"We are not the enemy. This is Australia, and you are an Australian. We care about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed looked down, still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin persisted, \"You are special, Ahreed. You are a clever boy. We know you can help us, but you MUST trust us.\" She watched as the fourteen year old remained motionless, looking down into his lap as if somehow ashamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was concerned about stretching beyond her instructions and giving the boy some assurance. She was not supposed to do that right now. Her brief was to bring Ahreed to Canberra so that the experienced inductors could reveal to Ahreed the purpose of his engagement. She noted a concerned glance from Russell in the front seat, turning his head suddenly in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahreed,\" she continued, \"We must end the evil... we must stop the killing, and you can help do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed's watery eyes looked up at the young woman. His gaze lingered for several moments, then, he looked back down into his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin, still holding Ahreed's hand and her other hand on his shoulder, looked up at the man in the driver's seat. She nodded at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell opened the door of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he rose on the stairs he looked back across the airport, across Sydney. He felt unsure that he would ever see the city again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the plane there were two corridors: the woman Kirstin led Ahreed down the right hand corridor, past a wall and into a seating area. It was very comfortable. The chairs were wide and there was a table between them with drinks and food. Ahreed had only been on a plane once before and it had simply been rows and rows of seats. He had never seen a plane like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man Russell sat down opposite and Kirstin directed Ahreed to his seat, next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin sat down, watching Ahreed and then glancing up at Russell, his eyes fixed on hers in a way that was a bit disturbing for her. She knew she had already told the boy too much. Russell was her superior and he told Kirstin with his eyes that he was concerned. Kirstin trusted her instincts. She was ASIO's most qualified Middle Eastern cultural specialist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed sat back and glanced across the table in between Russell and Kirstin. He was hungry and thirsty, since leaving the King's School at such a time meant he had missed lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" gestured the woman Kirstin, \"Have something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed stretched out his arm and grabbed one of the rolls on the table between the seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin watched him, wondering about her description of events and whether or not it had impacted on the interview she knew was about to happen in Canberra. The boy needed to be ready for what he was about to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell leant back in his chair and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile, Kirstin leaned forward to Ahreed and asked, \"Are you still scared of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was drinking a bottle of orange juice, and as Kirstin spoke he pulled it away from his mouth to answer. \"I'm scared, yes, Miss Kirstin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it you are scared of, Ahreed?\" Kirstin asked, continuing to move through her required set of conversation points with Ahreed. There was a list of questions she was required to ask the boy before his arrival at ASIO Headquarters in Canberra. She was not sure if Russell was listening in, as he remained silent and motionless with his eyes closed in the seat opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed held the orange juice bottle in his hand, then answered, \"I'm scared I am in some kind of trouble, Ms Kirstin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not, Ahreed,\" replied the young ASIO agent, \"But we'll see once we get to Canberra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed put down the bottle of orange juice on the table. The plane seemed to be turning and he could feel the floor beneath him tilting. He did not understand what the woman Kirstin had just said to him. 'She hopes not', thought Ahreed, going back over her words in his mind.  What would happen to him if he has truly made some terrible mistake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The stainless steel table in front of him was also scary, for would his blood be spilled upon it? After a short time the woman Kirstin came into the room. She explained the situation to him, then the man Russell entered the room as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed listened to them both, thought about his sister in Melbourne and his brother at the Kings School in Sydney, wondering what would become of them. He agreed to the terms that ASIO offered him. In return for his help to uncover the Jihadist recruiters, he would be given free University and would be guaranteed of a good job in the government once he had completed his study. These things were everything his Baba had ever wanted for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of hours, Ahreed was transported back to the airport and flown back to Sydney.

Should he be more concerned about his brother? Or about Mr Bhaduri's concern for Ahreed?

Surely his brother would have mentioned to him on the walk to the station in the morning, if he was not catching the afternoon bus with his older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was typical of Ahreed. He did not understand his responsibilities like he should.

He did not trust the young woman. He felt he could not even trust that 'Kirstin' was her real name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone only rang once when his Baba suddenly answered, \"Ahreed? Is that you??\" Ahreed could hear tension in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Baba.. - \" Ahreed was unsure what he should say to his dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahreed, are you ok?

Why is this? I'm scared they're going to hurt me, Baba..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkram Hussein, 67, was worried about his youngest child and knew he had to explain. He'd always known ASIO was coming for Ahreed because the Australian Government had been supporting his whole family since its arrival in Sydney nine years ago.  ASIO had also alerted him of their plan to move Ahreed to a new school in this year, but Akram had expected it would be at the end of the year. He assumed the speeding up of the process was because of the Melbourne terror alert he had heard about. Everyone was on edge after the Australian Prime Minister's emergency announcement to the nation about a possible gas attack in a Melbourne sports stadium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis daughter Noora was also studying at Melbourne University while Ahreed and his older brother, Ahrou were attending the Kings School, Sydney's most prestigious secondary college. Noora was doing medicine and Akram and both of his sons, Ahreed and Ahrou were very proud of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkram could not be certain if his daughter would have done so well if not for the Australian Security Services. Because of his previous work with the Iranian Government's nuclear program, Akram and his family were welcomed as refugees, but at a cost. One of his beloved children should give back and Ahreed, even brighter than his older sister, had been chosen before the boy had started high school. He was to do two years at the Kings School, then move to Alnoori Muslim School. If successful at this next process Ahreed was facing right now, he was to become a sleeper cell embedded in the radical Muslim community by ASIO. They were especially interested in the radicalization of young teenaged boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aging engineer had already faced his own struggles in Australia. The fear of detection as an agent by others in the Muslim community, the regular moving of their home for security reasons, the loss of his beloved wife. Having no mother from four years of age, Ahreed too, had suffered. Akram explained all of this to Ahreed for what seemed like hours, though it was really only a precious few minutes. The phone call suddenly ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed frantically lifted up the phone, immediately suspicious that the ASIO people had done something to the end the call. But it was just a flat battery. Agreed had seen the woman Kirstin using the phone: she must have known the battery was almost flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Bhaduri looked across his maths class at the Kings School. Ahreed's desk was empty and he'd heard nothing about why. Slightly annerved, he continued to walk up and down the aisles as the rest of his students worked away at the test. Ahreed was a special student and Mr Bhaduri had often wondered about the boy's background, potential and the possible disturbance of losing his mother at such a young age. There could very well be the spark in that boy and the maths teacher had plans for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Hussein brothers were rare Muslims at the leading Sydney school. Bhaduri had waited some years for this type of student and soon, he would be sure of their safety. Ahrou Hussein was doing very well but the maths teacher was suspicious of the boys' origins. Their baba being a truck driver and a single parent, how on earth could the family pay such high prices for education? One of Bhaduri's Syrian friends had also noticed the peculiar name of Ahrou, not being familiar with it as a Syrian name, plus the boy's accent and speaking style. Bhaduri's friend was even more perplexed when told Ahreed's name which was, again, not familiar in Syria. Yet according the student files of the boys, they were Syrian.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still, Ahreed was confused. He was definitely in some kind of detention, controlled by Australia's secret service. He was scared, his heart pounding from the moment he left the King's School in Sydney. It was a constant stress being pressed on him. There must have been something he had done wrong. Perhaps someone he knew was connected with the sports stadium terror threat he had seen in the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed's Baba had told him many things but they simply swirled around in Ahreed's head. This room was confinement: he was a prisoner. It was true, what he had heard, that the Australian government hated Muslims, was watching them and would punish them for the sins of a few crazies. A large mirror behind him - he knew they were watching him through the mirror - a TV camera above his head looking down at him - so they could see his face - only one chair in front of him, so his interview would be 1 on 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours to Ahreed, the door of the room swung open and the young woman Kirstin came in, sitting down in the one chair without looking at Ahreed. She flipped pages in a file and read, flipped and read, looked up at Ahreed now and again, then back down and flipped, and read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she spoke, \"So you wouldn't be a part of a terrorist act in Australia because you love Allah, is that right? Ahreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed sat upright in his seat, shocked by the sudden aggression in the woman Kirstin. \"No!\" Ahreed insisted, \"I would never be a part of an evil plan to kill people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin looked back down at her notes, folding her arms on the stainless steel desk. The light directly above her created a deep shadow over her face. \"Ahreed,\" she began, pointing at a place on the page in front of her, \"I have heard that promise before, then seen the boy catch a plane to Pakistan for the sole purpose of joining ISIS less than two weeks later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed felt he was under attack. The woman definitely believed that Ahreed was involved in the stadium terror crisis. \"I know nothing about the stadiums,\" Ahreed blurted out, \"And I would NEVER hurt Australia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman kept looking down at her notes. She was not moved at all by Ahreed's passionate protest. After several moments, she finally asked, \"So who mentioned stadiums to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed's eyes flashed from one side of the table to the other, realising he had made a terrible mistake by mentioning the stadium threat. \"My Baba talked to me about this - that it would cause a lot of trouble with our community.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin looked up into the boy's deep brown eyes. \"What does your Baba have to do with the stadium bombing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed felt her eyes tear through his brain, throwing snippets of knowledge into a whirlwind of his mind. There was anger, after years of being afraid just because he was a Muslim being bullied and made fun of at school. There was anger, primal anger, because of the attack on his Baba. He KNEW that Baba was loyal to Australia. He KNEW his Baba was supporting him. There was no way Baba would ever abandon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's eyes alighted back at Kirstin's stare, firing back with certainty and faith, stating, \"My Baba would never hurt any soul. He came to Australia to be free of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want to be free, do you?\" fired back Kirstin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Australia is a free country - you cannot do this to me!\" protested Ahreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin glanced down at her notes then back up at the fiery boy's eyes, \"It's free for the right people, Ahreed. But are YOU one of the right people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!!\" Ahreed gasped out. He breathed heavily, almost panting like a dog. \"Yes I am an Australian, and I have done nothing against my country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin looked to the bottom of the sheet in front of her. That was the end of the required questions for Ahreed. It was now time for Russell to speak to the boy and complete the assignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ahreed sat back down in his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know all of this is difficult,\" the man began, \"But it will all make sense in the end.\" He kept his eyes fixed on Ahreed's as he sat down in the other chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked back into his lap, the trails of tears in his eyes still visible after Kirstin's interview. \"What do you want me for?\" asked Ahreed quietly, still looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell moved in his seat, thinking how he could connect now that the boy seemed ashamed of himself. \"Ahreed, we need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed paused for a moment, then looked up at the man Russell. \"Then why do you treat me like this?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell shuffled about again, his broad shoulders and large body leaning over the stainless steel desk. There was silence again. He waited a moment before speaking. \"I promise you, in a few hours you will be back with your Baba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I trust you?\" asked the fourteen year old boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we trust YOU,\" continued Russell, \"YOU are our main concern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was unsure. \"Why me?\" he inquired of his more friendly interrogator, persisting at looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell looked down too. It was clear the boy was not going to look in his eyes. \"Because you,\" he paused, \"Because you are not just an Australian - you are a special Australian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is how you treat someone special?\" asked Ahreed, still looking down in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will understand, Ahreed,\" persisted Russell, \"You will get a picture of things like no one else before has had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed looked up at the man Russell. His eyes were fixed on Ahreed's and it was clear the man was watching Ahreed's every movement. \"What kind of picture is that?\" the boy recounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A picture of the world, Ahreed,\" began Russell, \"A picture of the people smuggling, the human trafficking, the drug trade, the systems these people use to convince young boys like you that their world is exciting, compelling, that they must come over and fight the Jihad..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed looked down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell continued, \"Ahreed, we need boys like you who can find these people.\" But the boy kept looking down. Russell persisted, \"We need boys your age who we can trust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed suddenly looked up again at the man, Russell. \"How do you expect me to trust you?\" Ahreed asked. \"Are you hurting my Baba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell looked down and read his notes for the first time. He looked back up at Ahreed, watching him across the table. \"Because your Baba knows what we are doing and wants you to help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed looked down. The thought of his Baba caused tears again in his eyes. \"When can I talk with Baba next?\" he asked, beginning to sob again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell looked back down at his notes on the table, seeming frustrated. \"I told you, Ahreed, you will see him tonight, after our interview.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ahreed looked deeper down into his lap, determined not to say any more to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Ahreed,\" she began, looking at the boy, \"Your mother was murdered by terrorists..\" she trailed off, expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed pretended he did not hear the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must have been difficult for you, Ahreed,\" Kirstin continued, \"It must have made you angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy kept looking down, freezing his body and not moving at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin persisted with her line of questions. \"So your Baba must be angry too, is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed wavered in his chair, becoming more and more angry. He wanted to yell at the woman, Kirstin. Instead he just kept ignoring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your Baba, a mister Akram Hussein, organized the bombing in Melbourne?\" Kirstin darted at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed looked up at the woman suddenly, anger welling in his tears. His lower face shivering, he answered, \"My Baba told me those people were EVIL!\" he yelled. \"MY BABA SAID, if you ever do anything like this, Ahreed, I will forget you. My Baba said to me, this action will cause all Muslims to be treated badly in Australia, like you are treating ME NOW!\" He held the woman's stare for a moment, then looked back down, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin relaxed and turned over to the next page in her notes. \"So you don't know about your father's involvement in the terror attack at the stadium in Melbourne?\" she again looked at the boy, awaiting his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed lost control. He did not know how to listen or to speak, but started rambling, \"My Baba is a good Australian - he told me this country is good and that he came here to protect me and my brother and my sister.\" Ahreed's voice began to crackle and break as he went on, \"My Baba says the government is good, and that my sister will be a doctor one day because of this government.... but why why does this government bring me here? Why do you torture me??\" he finished, still panting, now almost hysterical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin scribbled a note or two onto the page she was reading. She paused, looked up at Ahreed, his eyes aflamed with anger, staring at her. \"You call this torture, Ahreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked away to the side. He glanced around the room, then back into his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin placed her notes down on the stainless steel desk and leant forward, pointing her pen across at Ahreed's face, \"You don't even know what torture is, young man.\" She looked back down at her notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was still panting with rage and fear. He kept looking down. He felt he was in prison, being persecuted by a government who hated Muslims like him. This woman was twisting his words, confusing him. He was afraid to say anything more, but uncontrollably blurted, \"Torture is taking me away from home - you have taken me against my will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin held the boy's gaze, and speaking quietly she said, \"No, Ahreed, I'm just doing my job. We must question you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy snapped his gaze back down into his hands, fidgeting in his lap. He could never believe that his Baba was responsible for the Melbourne terror threat. It simply was not possible to him. But he could not remember any mention of Melbourne in the news reports he had read and seen on TV.  His sister was living in Melbourne...but he could not imagine her involved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgreed could feel himself becoming more conflicted and confused. He dared not mention his sister. He thought for a moment. \"I thought the terror threat was in Sydney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin flicked back to her previous pages and read, then glanced up at Ahreed briefly and back down at her notes. \"We know your sister is living in Melbourne, Ahreed.\" She looked back up at the fourteen year old to see his reaction. His tears were dripping from his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only know what I see in the news. I thought it was about Sydney and... I know my sister.\" Ahreed began gasp, sobbing uncontrollably. He looked up at the woman and yelled, \"I KNOW SHE WOULD NOT DO SUCH A THING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin looked down at her notes again. \"Did you think you could hide her from us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was straining the catch his breath. \"I.... I just want to protect her. I know nothing about Melbourne, it, it... was not in the news!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin pressed further, \"What kind of torture are were you expecting from us, Ahreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to imagine his worst thoughts of what torture meant. He thought about beheading, the sound of a cow as the knife was dragged across its neck. He thought about being shot in a firing squad. He thought about his Baba, yelling at him with a knife in his hand. For a brief moment, he saw a vision of his mother, blood all over her dress, lying on the ground reaching out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin watched the boy's face. Ahreed was very distressed - she could see that. She waited, watching the tears run down his brown cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed looked from side to side. He shook his head, took a breath, then pointed his finger onto the stainless steel table in front of him. \"This is torture, Miss Kirstin...\" he began, \"This is pain. I do not know the answers to your questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin glanced back down at her notes acting casually, flipping the page.  But she took a deep breath, beginning to feel for the boy. \"Okay, Ahreed, but I need to know what you think we are going to do to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed paused. He looked up at the woman, Kirstin. He looked around the room again. He looked back at her. She looked young, dark hair and flashing eyes. Her face seemed hard, looking into his eyes. But there was something else. There was something behind her brown eyes and skin, a closeness he had not felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know, Miss Kirstin,\" answered Ahreed, glancing down then back up at the young woman. \"I cannot imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opened and the man, Russell entered the room. Kirstin stood up and the two gestured at their notes as Russell sat down. Kirstin closed the door, but remained at the side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are very sorry to put you through this, Ahreed,\" began Russell, \"But it was necessary for us to ask you these things before we move to the next stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed glanced between the two of them. \"What do you mean, the next stage?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your new family, Ahreed,\" continued Russell. \"We have a new Baba for you back in Sydney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was suddenly distressed again, \"But my Baba...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin interrupted Ahreed, \"Your Baba will always be there, Ahreed. We will not take him away from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell, picking up the conversation added,\"We need you to come and work for us. Your dad already works for us and we need you to become a new source of information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was calming down, but still confused. \"What information do you want from me? I know nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin spoke in reply, \"But you do, Ahreed. You know many things. Once you are trained by your teacher, you will understand many more things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is my teacher?\" the boy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Esfir, and he is from Iran, just like your Baba is...\" added Russell. \"He will guide you, but you need to pretend to be his son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was still confused. \"But my Baba, Ahrou my brother, my sister and me.... we are from Syria?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin moved over to the steel desk and leant down to Ahreed. \"Your Baba will always be your Baba, Ahreed. You will see him, talk with him, spend time with him. We will make sure of that. All of your family will be safe, but no, you did not come from Syria. You came from Iran.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Ahreed began to calm down. So much had happened today, and in a few hours it seemed like his whole life had changed. Yet somehow, he had always known deep down that he was going to be connected with the troubles of the Australian Muslims. It was as though his Baba had prepared him. He realized that the sudden departure of his sister to Melbourne, the beginning of his high school at the King's School in Sydney, all of it was connected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry, Ahreed,\" started Kirstin, \"But we had to ask you certain questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell added, \"And I was the good cop, while Kirstin had to be the bad cop, Ahreed...that's why she seemed so nasty.\" Russell gestured with his hand towards the notes on the table in front of him, \"It was the procedure we had to follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed could feel his heart slowing down. For the first time since this afternoon, he was calm again. Still, he was uncertain what all of this meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He remembered well the evacuation of Akram Hussein and his family, being a huge success for the Australians at the time. Akram had been a key engineer in the design and process of achieving nuclear capability under the recent Iranian regime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir was previously a part of the old regime's intelligence service and had defected to Australia quietly many years ago. At that time he could foresee the fall of the government in Iran and the introduction of Sharia Law. As a modern, well educated man, Esfir knew that the trends of the western world would be of little interest to the old social system restored in his homeland. Esfir realized at that time there was no point remaining in Iran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis departure left behind his wife and two beloved children, Javeed and Koosha. Even after so many years, he still didn't know their fate. He hoped deep down that one day, as part of his work for the Australian Secret Intelligence Organization, he would learn what happened to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe call on his ASIO phone message system surprised him, but also buoyed his hopes for another assignment in the Middle East. It was an advice that his new teenage son, Ahreed, was in Canberra and being prepared for activation as an anti-terrorist informer. Of course, this was not one of his real sons. It was simply the creation of a family unit, for undetected travel into the world of the human traffickers at the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir went back to his study and picked up the file on the boy. No mother, his father another operative like Esfir, the boy's brother mixed up with radicals in the community. It seemed to Esfir that ASIO had the right pick. But how would the plan work on the ground, when they were placed in Libya?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a brief call to his housekeeper. He needed a room to be prepared for the boy. It was important that Esfir establish a good relationship with the fourteen year old Ahreed, so that outsiders would not notice that the two of them were a false creation of ASIO. This was just as important in Sydney as it was in Pakistan, or Libya, or in Egypt. He hoped Ahreed's language skills were up to scratch in Arabic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these locations were possible 'drop points' for the pair, as they collected and reviewed information about the money making schemes of ISIS. His ASIO assignment for most of the current year had been about the financing of the 'Hundred Year War'. He wondered how long it would take the boy to be inducted into ASIO and sent to his house to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir had his own system of training prepared for this Ahreed boy, and he needed time to ensure the kid was ready for deployment in the Middle East. He looked down again through his notes...</span></div></div>",

The boy was a very important asset for the Australian Secret Intelligence Organisation. Esfir's phone suddenly rang again. Esfir answered immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 115 point 14, can you respond?\" asked the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Russ, \" replied Esfir, \"I can respond with diligence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" continued Russell on the end of the line, \"The boy is being airlifted directly to you immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir was confused. \"What about his induction?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some hesitation on the phone line, \"It's been given to you to look after,\" replied Russell, sounding frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a sudden change in plan, yes?\" asked Esfir, \"And how does the boy feel about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was more hesitation. \"He doesn't know yet,\" Russ replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir paused. This was a very big responsibility he was about to take on. Russell was asking him to both induct the 14 year old boy plus give him cover in the local community in Sydney. \"Alright,\" he agreed, \"But this is a lot of work - you know this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...\" continued Russ, \"We know it's a big ask, Esfir. But there's orders from above about rapid deployment of the asset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asset?\" questioned Esfir, \"He is a fourteen year old boy!\" Esfir was not really upset, but he felt he should show some concern while agreeing to the proposal. \"What about the family in Melbourne - can't they take him? There are two operatives, husband and wife to look after the child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That remains an option, one-nine.\" was the reply on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And does this child, Arghreed, look like me? You think us Muslims all look the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause on the phone. \"He has to stay in Sydney and move to the 'mozzie' school, Esfir.... we need to find leads into the Melbourne bombing threat quickly and we suspect it came from Sydney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir paused again. \"I suppose so...\" he continued, slowly, \"I will do this for our organisation, agent one-four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell, still at the Canberra headquarters of ASIO, breathed a sigh of relief. \"We'll send him directly, by chopper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir became falsely upset again: \"Why you send chopper to my house at night - the neighbours wonder who I am??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell was expecting some resistance. \"We need to get him started straight away, one-nine,\" he replied officially, \"He flies out in five days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir was shocked. Five days? How on earth could he prepare a 14 year old boy for espionage in five days? Anyway, he had already agreed to the assignment, according to the code of ASIO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell was waiting on the line. \"Esfir?\" he called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes...\" Esfir replied, \"I will take the boy tonight and begin immediately - fly out in five days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confirmed, one-one-five, one-nine.\" Russell terminated the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt ASIO in Canberra, Russell turned and looked at the boy through the mirror glass and sighed.

Soon it would be sunset. \"How long will it take to get back to Sydney in the chopper, Ms Kirstin?\" he asked through the headset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Ahreed, \" she answered, \"We're stopping on the way to meet someone important. I suppose it would take another hour or so to get to Sydney from there?\" She turned and looked at the boy, as though being sincere. Kirstin knew the boy would not be returning home that night. She knew he would feel betrayed eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dark coloured chopper descended onto the football field near to Esfir's home at the secret location, Ahreed stretched to look out of the window. He could see a man standing there on the rugby field, surrounded by Australian bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the chopper touched down on the ground, Kirstin and Russell hopped out and Ahreed followed. His hand on Ahreed's head, Russell jogged alongside the teenager as he moved out from beneath the spinning blades of the helicopter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin ran over to the man waiting on the ground, shook his hand, then turned to Ahreed with a gesture. The man came over. \"Don't try to talk!\" he yelled, the noise of the chopper still spinning and the smell of kerosene filling the air. He put his arm over Ahreed's shoulder and directed him away to the edge of the football field. The woman Kirstin and the man Russell then got back into the helicopter and within seconds, it lifted off the ground and up into the air, its flashing lights becoming smaller as it rapidly fled into the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overwhelming noise faded away and Esfir directed the boy onto a track leading into the bush. \"Everything will be alright,\" he assured the youth, \"I know your Baba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was worried about the disappearance of the chopper. How would he get home to Sydney tonight if the chopper had gone? The sun was setting and he noticed that the place he was in was very beautiful. He glanced around at the coloured sky and the graphic mountain outline in the distance. The air was now filled with the music of a thousand birds, its crisp, fresh scent making him a little dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Esfir tightened his grip around the boy's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering Esfir's house in the Australian bush, Ahreed was taken by its beauty. It was a sprawling, open-plan house with large spaces and staircases rising and descending all around him as he entered. Esfir went up to the kitchen and started the jug to make cups of tea. He glanced up and noticed the sun setting in the western sky out of the window of his mountain side house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahreed,\" he began, \"You are in a secret place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stopped in the middle of the spacious, mid-level living area. He was astounded at what he saw. There was a fire burning, but the floor was white. There were beautiful pieces of artwork hanging on the wall and a lovely, dark red leather couch stretched across the room. The white floor and the fire together seemed quite strange to Ahreed. He turned back to the man up on the higher level, but quite close to him. \"Where am I?\" he asked slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir looked down at the bubbling window of the jug as it began to boil. \"You are at home, Ahreed, you are now my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed could feel his heart start to pound inside his chest. Where was his Baba? Where was his Dad? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir could see that the boy was unsettled. \"Sit down, Ahreed, you are in my house now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy didn't move, instead looking back up at Esfir. \"What do you mean that you are my Baba?\" he asked, a tear welling up around his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Baba is safe, Ahreed, \" said Esfir quickly, \"He is waiting for you and will see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But when will I be home again??\" protested Ahreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir looked down to the floor. Slowly he said, \"You are home, now, Ahreed. You must call ME Baba now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my REAL Baba, \" called out Ahreed, crying openly, \" When will I see him again? Kirstin and Russell said he would be here!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man looked at the face of the boy and felt a pang in his heart. Such a betrayal of a young one by ASIO made his urgent task more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"It is the old way, Arghreed,\" began Esfir, slipping back to his natural accent, \"That the boy is taken from his family by an uncle, who teaches him a trade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed's sobbing slowed. His tear streamed face lingered on the eyes of Esfir. He watched as the older man looked out to the western windows of the bright, palatial living room. The reds and oranges of the sunset glimmered in his eyes. Ahreed was mesmerized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But as always, first, we pray.\" Esfir walked over to a cupboard under one of the staircases and opened its elaborately decorated panel. He unhooked two mats, closed the cupboard and placed them both carefully on the floor, aligning to the sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed felt himself slowly walking towards the mats, hearing the call to prayer ring out in his ears several seconds before Esfir turned on the actual sound of the call to prayer on the iPod dock. The perfect light streamed onto the open, paved slate floor on the other side of the room. It was as though Ahreed was stepping back in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, Arghree,\" gestured Esfir warmly, \"This is your home, and this is where we pray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter prayers Ahreed felt relieved. It seemed as if something was normal again. Esfir seemed to be talking more and more Arabic and less English as the evening went on. They talked into the night about history, religion, business and crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough heavily weighed down with the pressure of his assignment, Esfir had moments when he noticed the incredible intelligence of the boy. He also seemed a gentle soul, but this could be a devastating weakness for a new operative. There was hardening that needed to be done, yet Esfir also wondered if the deep desire for peace and to end the killing was perhaps necessary. It meant so much to Ahreed that people stop fighting and dying. It had really troubled the boy through the years, Esfir thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think of your mother often?\" asked Esfir, at a specially chosen moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I wonder about her a lot,\" replied the boy. \"I still see her face sometimes, hear different music and remember an aroma that always seemed to linger in the air when I was with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir diverted the sensitive question away and began to explain to Ahreed about the ANZACS - The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. The legend of the ANZACS was central to the military belief system of all Australians. It was important that Ahreed understood the relationship between the English and Arab cultures and its recent history. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was fascinated with the attack on Turkey in World War One. \"But the Turkish Moslems won, yes?\" he asked Esfir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not use that word, Argreed. You should say, 'muss-lim', not 'mozz-lem', and yes, the Turks did win, Ahreed. But you must understand, they were defending their home lands, their families, their cities. The Australian soldiers were only there - many of them - because they were young and seeking adventure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed thought for a moment, the odd snap of the open fire breaking the pause late in the night. \"Why would a soldier go to war, just for adventure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir was taken aback by Ahreed's thoughtful summary of the conversation. \"Because they were YOUNG, Ahreed,\" pressed Esfir, \"And that is why they follow their older brothers, their cousins and all of the other men in the town, joining the great army to fight in far away lands. They did not want to be left behind. Boys will follow men, to learn manhood. And younger boys might call them cowards if they remain and are suddenly the eldest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were not as young as me,\" mumbled Ahreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, YES,\" protested Esfir, \"Most of them were over eighteen, but some of them WERE like you, pretending to be older. In Syria there are many hundreds - maybe thousands of child soldiers, just like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what you want me for, to be a soldier?\" asked Ahreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir was confounded by the boy's insight and directness. \"No, Arghreed, not a soldier. You are now an operative, working for the Australian Government. They will keep educating you, and put money aside for you, so long as you remain loyal to your new country. And that is why you must understand how sacred the ANZAC spirit is to this people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed thought again. \"So I will become an ANZAC, or go back to school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you will spend time at a school, but you will be working for ASIO,\" replied Esfir. \"For now we use the old way for your education, the way of the old country. I become your teacher, the uncle who shows you the trade. You can never be an ANZAC, Arghreed, for they are the legends of battles past, teaching us in dreams at night when we sleep. You can only live up to their honour and make your new country proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed sank further back into the soft, leather couch in front of the fire. It was late into the night and he was very tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir stared into the flames of the fire, thinking. It was another good question the boy had asked, about going to school or going to war. ASIO had confused Esfir by stating that Ahreed was to change schools, yet he was to fly out in just a few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Esfir said, \"And the tools of the trade we must teach you to use.\"  Esfir supposed that these tools included spying on classmates, as well as shooting guns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another long pause, he continued to question Ahreed about his feelings for his mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did your father tell you what happened to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed hesitated. \"Yes, he said she got sick in the refugee camp in Syria and didn't make it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir looked down at the slate floor suddenly. \"I see, and you see too, I hope, that many horrors are hidden from the children, Arghree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying about my mother?\" replied Ahreed in Arabic, sitting forward on the couch suddenly, \"Where did she die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man quickly waved his arm back and forth in front of his shirt, \"No, no, Arghree, you are misunderstanding me: this is an ancient Arab saying, 'Many horrors are hidden from the children'. It means that children should stay children.\" Esfir was impressed the boy used Arabic to protest, but he also noticed that Ahreed's accent was a bit of a concern. One could tell it was Iranian to a trained ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy slumped back in his chair and stared straight ahead. He yawned hard. It was late and it had been a very long and scary day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ahreed had fallen asleep on a sprawling, soft leather couch in front of the fire, which was still warming the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter prayers Esfir took him to another room, downstairs under the house. Ahreed was shocked. He looked at the cabinets, glass doors and shelves. There were drawers with numbers too. Completely surrounding the boy was his worst fear of all: guns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir could see the distress on the boy's face. \"It is also the old way to know defence.\" stated Esfir. \"If a man is pointing a gun at me and you can see another gun, would you let that man shoot me, Arghree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed felt dizzy. He was confused and frightened, becoming pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are machines, Arghreed, tools of our trade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed sat down on the second bottom step, feeling slightly ill in the stomach. He looked down at the floor, then back up at the rows and rows of weapons around the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must learn,\" continued Esfir,\"How to care for them, hold them, load them, and when to use them. You must also learn when to avoid using them and pretend you know nothing about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed began to focus. Esfir diverted back into the philosophy of ISIS and the promise a one hundred year war. There was a history of weapons and their use, including why they were used. He explained to the boy about the excitement of shooting guns for some people, and the camaraderie of an army. Its strength being based on its capacity to do what needed to be done: if one soldier was defeated, another takes his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is always better to avoid using guns if possible, and not to let others know your capability. Once you can hold and use some of these guns, anyone watching from a distance will know you have been trained.You must not reveal to anyone that you are trained until absolutely necessary, Arghreed.\" Esfir grabbed an M1 from the wall and turned to Ahreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stood up slowly, walking towards Esfir. He held out his hands. As he took the weight of the metal he was shocked how heavy it was. Its cold body sent a chill up Ahree's spine. \"Is it loaded?\" he asked timidly, his legs beginning to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, Arghree, it's not loaded. I will teach you how to hold it first before we start with fake bullets.\" Esfir stepped forward and pointed to the side of the gun and began explaining to Ahreed the functions, aiming and loading mechanisms. Gradually, Ahreed tuned in, absorbing all of the technicalities of some weapons he was likely to see in coming days in the Middle East.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking down at the small, round white tablet in his hand, Ahreed considered his ISIS Commander's advice: 'This will calm you, down, Ahreed,' he had said, 'And you will fight to win the right to the glory of Islam. And if it is the Will of Allah, you shall sleep with seven virgins at sunset.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed wondered if he should take the tablet straight away because he needed calming down. Squatting on the wooden floor of the partially destroyed building in a small village near the Syrian city of Al Bukamal, near the Iraq border, Ahreed was facing his first contact with defending forces near the Iraqi city of Qa'im. In fact, it was Ahreed's first battle with ISIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the raid at the hotel in the Libyan coastal city of Al Marj several weeks earlier, Ahreed had been siphoned across the borders of Egypt and Jordan and into the south of Syria. He often wondered what had happened to Esfir. The last time Ahreed saw his new Baba, Esfir was kneeling on the ground outside the hotel with his hands on his head, a jihadist pointing a gun at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince that horrific nightmare, there was moving, moving, moving all of the time. There had been training and instruction in the principles of jihad along the way, including the bloody slaughter of about a dozen people in a tiny village somewhere between Tirbil in southern Iraq and At Tanf over the border in Syria. So far as Ahreed could comprehend, the slaughter was simply an exercise and the people who died mere 'crash-test dummies', for that is how they were described in Arabic by his ISIS leaders. Their mocking and laughter, bloodthirsty drunken talk around the fires at night, frequently kept the young recruits awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis tablet in Ahreed's hand, if it could calm him down, would be exactly what he needed. He turned to his fellow freedom fighter sharing his sleeping sack on the floor next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I take this now, or in the morning, Ahmed?\" asked Ahreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, you take it one half hour before the battle my brother, it gives you strength!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Australian boy slipped the tablet into the top pocket of his shirt. \"I thought it was to calm me down, so the commander told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhmed sat up from his bedding. \"Ahreed it will calm you down, and also make you strong. It is a special weapon of the freedom fighters that they have, but the enemy does not. When you take this, you will understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed sat and then lay down on his side of the sack, exhausted but still terrified and still afraid to sleep. What had happened to Esfir, he wondered. What would happen to him, tomorrow?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the troop continued their march the next day, Ahreed wondered about the white tablet in his top pocket. Perhaps it would kill him, or perhaps it could help him. He turned to Hakim, a twelve year old boy marching next to him. \"What does the white tablet do to me?\" asked Ahreed, in Arabic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger boy kept marching in the troop, not acknowledging Ahreed's question at first. After about ten more steps, he replied, \"It makes you stronger in battle, you will understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed didn't think much of the boy's answer. He kept on marching in step with the troop, wondering what the small white tablet in his upper shirt pocket really did. Looking up across the troop, he wondered about the group of boys he had been forced into, realising most of them were younger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You talk funny,\" continued the younger boy. He looked across at Ahreed. \"Your Arabic is strange.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed had been warned about his accent by Esfir, and he wondered if his ISIS Commander had noticed his peculiar way of talking. \"I am from Australia,\" he replied to young Hakim as they walked, \"My accent is Australian Arabic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakim was shorter than Ahreed. He had no whiskers and a deep, brown face. His eyes were dark and broken, having seen too many things to sparkle like a child's anymore. He had grown up in a war torn Syria and at a young age, watched as his father was beheaded by a jihadi leader. For reasons of sheer survival, he followed every command of his ISIS leader. His father had been a Shi'ite moslem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger boy would do or be whatever he was told without question, so now he was a Sunni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed began to feel he was meant to be on this trail. He was afraid of what was ahead, but worried about the fate of his fellow child soldiers. Most of them were so young, yet so hardened. They knew more about the trail ahead than him, but little about being children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed knew of a different world, a different life growing up in Australia. There was plenty of food, a warm bed every night, fun and friends and games and school. There were very few dangers for a child in Sydney: no fear of your home being bombed in the night, nor terror at the appearance of an aircraft in the sky. There was abundant opportunity, friendly people everywhere and a loving family. Though for Ahreed, there had always been just one thing missing, his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt a deep, protective instinct for the boys marching around him. He had been so young when his mother was lost, but he remembered her arm around him, the tight grasp of her hand and the warmth of her embrace. He felt he would never have survived without her. But these boys, they had no mother. What did they have to protect them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander suddenly raised his hand and the boys ducked down to the ground. Ahreed ducked down with them. The Commander looked over his shoulder and gestured to the troop, two young boys running out and settling at his feet, trained to obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking carefully ahead, the Commander leant over and whispered to the two boys then gestured back towards the rest of the troop. The boys - no older than eleven or twelve - then scurried back to the rest of the assembly of children and began briefing them on the Commander's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead there was a small village. Two older boys would follow the Commander forward towards the village, while the remaining troops would divide into two groups, one flanking the left side, the other the right. Hakim headed to the right while Ahreed followed his comrades to the left, keeping low as he scurried across the sand. From a rooftop up ahead in the village, there was a sudden burst of gunfire. It was a thunderstorm of noise, echoes and confusion followed by dull thuds in the ground all around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed glanced across to Hakim in the other group and watched, in slow motion, as a dull thud struck the body of Hakim. The little boy was thrown back into the air, a spatter of blood flying out over his head, then his limp body fell to the ground at the edge of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoys around Hakim scambled to take cover as the bullets continued. None of them looked back at Hakim, writhing with pain on the sand as the hot lead sizzled his chest. They just kept moving forward, towards the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed felt a pang of anger in his heart like he had never felt before. He could also feel the tension in his comrades on the left flank: they too were angry about the loss of one of their troop. He noticed some of the boys in front reaching into their pockets and slapping their face. Ahreed reached into his top pocket and fumbled for the white tablet. Feeling it and grasping it, he grabbed desperately and pulled it out, slapping it into his mouth, remembering what Hakim had told him about the white tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troop paused for about fifteen minutes. Ahreed began to feel a bit dizzy, like he was separating from his body. Then suddenly, the Commander called out in Arabic, \"Charge!\" and the boys ran out, many of them seemingly running in slow motion to Ahreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, his AK-47 cocked and his finger against the metal trigger, pounding his feet towards the main track through the village. In the corner of his eye, Ahreed noticed a face behind a fence. Ahreed turned, aimed and fired while still running.There was a thud and a splatter of blood in the distance. He didn't know or care anymore, who the face belonged to, adult or child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed felt again the same pang of anger he felt a short time ago when he saw Hakim shot. A few seconds seemed like minutes. He also felt the tears. He glanced back. Hakim was no longer moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around Ahreed were faces appearing from behind barriers: he turned to each of them and squeezed his trigger and they flew into the air and down to the ground. He kept following his troop forward. Then there was desert, no town left. He turned and looked back. He could see his Commander standing in the middle of the main street of the village. There was a gathering of his comrades. The Commander was looking directly over at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed marched back towards the middle of the village, his Commander turning back to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground, crawling in front of the Commander was a woman, shielding her toddler child. In Arabic, the Commander yelled, \"Where is the sniper??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman cried and muttered in a Kurdish dialect. The Commander glanced up and again looked directly at Ahreed's eyes, marching towards him, then looked back down at the woman and repeated, \"Where is the sniper who shot my soldier of God?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman just sobbed, the tiny child beneath her crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander turned to his troop sergeant, a boy only about 13 years old. In Arabic, the Commander ordered the boy, \"Shoot her filthy rat's arm, so she can see I must have an answer for the glory of Allah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy hesitated for a moment, glanced up at the Commander, then awkwardly lifted his heavy, AK-47 and switched it to single shot. He took aim, slowly, then shot at the arm of the infant, missing by just a fraction and sending a splatter of sand in the air. The Kurdish woman screamed and lurched further over the toddler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander stepped over and kicked the woman down to the ground, then, snatching the heavy weapon away from the young boy, methodically lifted its nozzle, aimed and fired through the child's lower arm. The baby let out an desperate scream, crying more hysterically. The Commander then kicked the frantic, crawling woman again, keeping her away from her screaming baby, its arm shot apart and dripping blood into the sand as it flapped its severed limb helplessly in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander turned to his small sergeant with an expression of disgust on his face. The boy soldier obediently took back his weapon and stepped back, standing at attention and awaiting further instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed's eyes blurred. He felt a shimmering in his legs. He kept marching towards his Commander. The Commander looked back through the troop at Ahreed's eyes in the distance and glanced down at the weapon pointing at the ground as Ahreed kept marching closer towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander unclipped his handgun from its holster, clicked its safety switch as he drew, then pointed it directly at the baby and fired. The impact pushed the tiny child back in the sand, the mother wailing in desperate agony. The Commander then turned his handgun on the mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed, still marching back to the middle of the village, misstepped slightly each time a gunshot echoed along the earthen walls of the buildings in the street. The Kurdish woman fell to the ground, instantly lifeless from the Commander's shot to her forehead. Her blood ran down a furrow in the road, mixing with her child's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed kept marching towards his Commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adult turned with his hand gun pointed straight down at the ground as Ahreed approached him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The mingled blood of the mother and child dribbled through the sand to the edge of his boot. \"Commander, the north east is clear,\" he announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander held Ahreed's gaze as the grown man's thumb restored his handgun to safety mode. Slowly, he lifted the gun and inserted back into its holster. \"Very good, Ahreed. You have excelled in your defence of the Almighty. You have risen up to the rank of a Caliphate Warrior. You are now a young lion of Allah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before dawn of the following day the troop of boy soldiers began to stir. They had eaten well from the stores of the village, while none of its adult occupants seemed to have survived. Many of the younger boys were visibly agitated and several had moved their beds closer to Ahreed by morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed awoke feeling pangs of panic. His memories of the previous day and night seemed clouded, distant and horrific. There were flashbacks to things he had seen: dying comrades, blood spattered sand, the woman and baby and, the thud of that first bullet striking Hakim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander sat quietly, alone in a smaller room near the larger area where the boys had slept. He listened for movement as he considered the training program for his young warriors, before the company was to continue on its march into the north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning lessons were always dangerous. Without the drug affecting the children, they had only their memories from the day and night before to enrage them. It was important to seal the sense of rage and power, a true sense of jihad, after the drug had worn off. The Commander's supply of the tablets was limited and the lessons of desert guerrilla warfare had to be rushed. He wondered about the leadership of the troop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed soon noticed how the younger boys had gathered their beds around him during the night. He could also see jealous eyes watching him from the older boys across the floor. Suddenly there was screaming from the next room, moving out onto the street. The boys mustered and began to move to the open doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander called his sergeant, the boy about thirteen years old named Walid, through the doorway of the boarding house where the troop had stayed overnight. \"Here is your first virgin,\" said the Commander to the boy, \"Ready and waiting for you to sow the seed of the Jihad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, his heavy, AK-47 weighing him down in front of his Commander, nodded. He obediently marched over to the Commander's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take her,\" said the Commander, gesturing towards the young girl, \"Show her the power of the Jihad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy looked over at the girl, noticing that she was not wearing the Kurdish scarf of an appointed female, realising she was not of marriage age. She seemed to the boy to be only about ten or eleven years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take her!\" demanded the Commander, \"Show her the way of the Jihadi virgins,\" he continued, \"She is only a rat of the Kurdish infidels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy hesitated, \"But most honourable, \" he spoke in Arabic, \"She is not of age and is too young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander drew his pistol from his side in an instant, pointing it straight into the young boy's face. \"Show her the way, Sergeant Walid,\" repeated the Commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill jumpy and confused by memories of the previous day and the effects of the small, white tablet, Ahreed flashed back into slow motion. As the Commander's finger twisted around the weapon and switched the safety, the moment in time became minutes to Ahreed. He recalled Esfir, the Australian bush, target practice and a long discussion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ISIS Commander squeezed the trigger of his pistol immediately. The sudden pop of the shot made the whole group of boy soldiers tense up. Walid's head splattered like a pumpkin as his thin, small body flopped onto the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drug in the tablet had mainly worn off and the troop no longer felt its effects. Most of the boy soldiers were in the age range of eleven to fifteen, and without the hallucinogenic effects of the white tablet, they were simply Muslim boys with strong feelings about protecting children, especially younger sisters and cousins. Being trapped in this ISIS training troop on the outskirts of a small village, surrounded by a desert between Iraq and Syria, had no power over such deep, Muslim values.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Australian, Ahreed was no exception. Uncertain whether his senses had fully returned, he was shocked by the sudden execution of Walid but also deeply impacted by the event. Perhaps the drug was still affecting him slightly, for what he was seeing still seemed like slow motion. He quickly tried to comprehend what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minds of every boy in the troop pounded as they watched their Commander with disdain. Walid had been a friend to most of them, especially the younger ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed grappled with his options, glancing quickly around the rest of the faces standing there. It seemed there was only one path he could choose: the best in a desperate situation. He stood up suddenly, stepped forward and announced to the Commander, \"I will sow the seed of the Jihad in the rat of Allah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the troop froze in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany eyes widened among the boys gathered outside. Some glanced nervously at Ahreed for a moment, before looking back down at the body of Walid. A couple of the boys could not help but look across at the helpless young Kurdish girl. Whispers passed between the rest inside the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander looked over at Ahreed, the boy who spoke with a strange accent. \"Then take her, and make her your first virgin, Ahreed Al Australi,\" he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed obediently marched over to the Commander, saluted, then turned and bent over, grabbing the little girl by the hair and dragging her away towards the back of the building. She screamed and cursed in Kurdish, kicking her legs and trying to swing her arms at Ahreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grown man smiled slightly, tilting his head as he watched Ahreed. Perhaps this young boy would be a good sergeant to replace Walid, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed pulled the little girl into a back room of the building, away from prying eyes. He realised what the Commander expected of him, but his Muslim upbringing would never allow him to commit such a terrible, filthy sin against this little girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also realised she would die at the hand of the Commander anyway. He avoided thinking about what the Commander might have done to her overnight. Ahreed and the other boys had slept so heavily, being exhausted from the battle and confused by that drug, they had perhaps missed her screams from the next room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also knew that those twenty or so boys would not survive unless he, Ahreed, became their sergeant, and perhaps eventually their Commander. Ahreed quickly tallied his options again. The brutal reality of the Commander's training reeled inside Ahreed's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned, looked down and then threw the young Kurdish girl against the wall in the small back room. She wailed. He looked at her, tears welling up in his eyes. Ahreed also knew that if he did not follow his Commander's direction, that he too would be executed, just like young Sergeant Walid just seconds ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed's tear-streaked face looked deep into the little girl's eyes, barely visible in the musty, dim room. Back in Australia, girls were supposed to be equal to boys, he thought. The Caliphate was a different, ancient world of war. She was now petrified and shaking, slowly sinking back down into the rubble strewn corner of the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore flashbacks suddenly bolted through Ahreed's head. He saw Hakim's face, then his boy body flying through the air, the dull thud of that bullet echoing in Ahreed's mind. He felt an overwhelming sense of protectiveness for his fellow boy soldiers. They too were merely children. They too were depending on him now, for <i>their</i> survival. Noone outside knew the moments of this room, right now. There were no prying eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed decided what he had to do with this girl, and determined one thing he could never do. This girl had lost her whole village, her mother, her father, her brothers and sisters. Outside were a dozen or more young boys depending on him for their survival too, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approached the girl and tore her dress and she screamed. He then pulled out his knife and held it above her head and she screamed again. He waved his knife around her body and she screamed, screamed, and screamed on and on each time the long blade flashed near to her. He tortured her only so long as necessary. He had to persuade the listeners outside the door of his obedience to the Commander. He needed to be sure that the Commander would trust him, rather than execute him as well as Walid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a swing of his arm, he threw his knife in the air with one hand while grabbing the little girl with his other hand. Catching the knife as it fell to his hand in a different grip, he slashed it across her throat in a single movement. In an instant, her body fell limp to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor that little girl now, the pain was over. At least, thought Ahreed, she may have died without being raped. At least not by him. He had to accept this was the best decision right now. The Commander might never know the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leant down and sopped some of her blood in his wet, sweating hand, quickly smearing it over his face to hide his tears. He then grasped her blood stained body by the arm and dragged it out of the back room into the laneway next to the building. Pausing for a moment, he then continued to the larger area out front where the Commander and his boy soldiers were waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let go of the little girl's body on the dirt in front of his Commander's feet, then stood alert, hard faced, saluting him again. \"The rat will burn in hell - GLORY BE TO ALLAH!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of murmurs and whispers swept through the group of his young comrades. The Commander looked down at the girl's half bare, beheaded body at his feet then looked up at Ahreed's eyes. \"So we have a new Sergeant for our troop!\" He declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troop broke out clapping and began chanting, \"Ahreed Al Australi! Ahreed Al Australi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed immediately saluted the Commander for a third time, then turned and marched over to his new place in front of the troop, positioning himself between them and the Commander. Some of them patted his shoulders from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was now one of the official elders of the troop, for though young, he was now next in command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander was impressed by Ahreed's leadership and skill with his weapons. And his obedience seemed beyond question. This Australian boy with the strange Arabic was now an older boy he could trust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a situation was was rare. The Commander had been suspicious of Ahreed at first because of his accent and origin, but he could see this kid was different. Few boys at his stage of manhood survived the rigorous training process of ISIS. Controlling sentimental children was not easy. The sword of fear had to be swung swiftly and fatally so often, it was a struggle to keep the troop's numbers up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be an effective, hardened fighting force, young boys needed to be sifted like grain. One day they might meet American Marines. Would they shoot at them, or raise a white flag and ask for a cigarette?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ahreed now the sergeant, the other boys were enormously heightened in their confidence. The Commander could see that they trusted and admired Ahreed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecretly, many of them trusted this Australian boy far more than they trusted their Commander. For the first time in many months, most of the boys began to believe that maybe, just maybe, they could actually survive this endless, surreal nightmare.</span></div></div>",

Besides some stones holding the edges, there were other stones in various locations on the map. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come here sergeant Ahreed Al Australi,\" he continued, squatting down at the first map. \"The sergeant must always know where to go, in case something happens to me.\" He pointed at a small stone, placed just outside the Iraqi city of Qasim. \"We are close to here.

Ahreed watched and waited as the troop's elder fidgeted in the dust on the ground with the tip of his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because,\" mumbled the Commander, \"I cannot trust them.\" The man stood up and began to pace around the smaller room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do what I tell them to do, but they do not have the perfect view of the world in Allah's eyes.\" The Commander continued to pace in a circle around the room, making Ahreed feel slightly dizzy as he watched. \"Allah trusts the lions of the Caliphate, not the survivors who pretend to support the noble banner, but would betray it, if given the power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was confused. This man was barely making sense to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Ahreed Al Australi, those young pups will flee to the master with the most food. But the food of the spirit is the World of Allah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander reached into his trouser pocket and awkwardly pulled out a small tin. He unscrewed the lid and immediately lifted the flask to his lips and threw back his head. Ahreed could tell he was drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow night,\" he continued between sips of his tin, \"We will unite with a greater fighting force. We will avenge the betrayals and occupy the city. It will continue to function - not be destroyed as we do to the villages - we will keep it going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommander Karesh continued to walk in slow circles around the small room, but he was becoming less steady on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what the infidels do not understand, Ahreed Al Australi, is that we will rebuild the city, after its defeat: we prepare it like a virgin for the wedding and then later, much later, that city will fall at the call of Allah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was confused by the Commander's ramblings. It was like a language that was half information, half religious text. But Ahreed had also learned to watch for symbolic terms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered if the Commander was actually talking about re-organization of the defeated city, some type of preparation for another event in the future. The religious references appeared to replace the factual information: when the Commander could not say precisely where or what he was talking about, he could simply refer back to religious text. In the future, the religious text could contain the commands, by a type of special interpretation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the future, he thought, Commander Karesh could simply call out 'The Virgin is ready for Marriage,' and the city would react to assist the ISIS unit. Ahreed thought hard about his new situation. He was beginning to understand the language of the jihadists well, plus he was gaining important information that would be useful for ASIO back in Australia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough sometimes Ahreed wondered if he would ever see Australia, or meet an Australian again. Human life was cheap on this battlefield. Little girls, boy soldiers, old people: nothing was sacred to these monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as his Commander's bloodshot eyes slowly began to close over. It was only the second time he had seen the Commander drink and Ahreed noticed that the rumours about alcohol were true: it made people talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed's father, brother and sister would never drink alcohol. He pondered for moment on some of the conversations he had with his brother, Ahrou. His brother definitely had some interest in the jihad, for now Ahreed could see clearly the special language jihadists used to maintain secrecy, while at the same time give commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed could now also see that the Commander was vital for the survival of the troop. Without the Commander, Ahreed would be left as Sergeant with a group of older boys who he could not trust. Ahreed realised he had to organise the boys who trusted him to defend themselves. If something happened to the Commander, thought Ahreed, then the young boys would not be treated well by the older boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were more chuckles from the other older boys sitting in the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a very nice young boy, Ahreed Al Australi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have more experience than me,\" replied Ahreed carefully, standing up suddenly, \"Please organise yourselves: continuous watch, to the west and to the south.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustafa smiled a little. \"And what call shall we use?\" Then he wolf-whistled. The other older boys burst out laughing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Approach alert,\" replied Ahreed quickly, \"This is a defensive alert but take care - they might also be our soldiers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustafa looked down, still smiling, then nodded his head slowly. \"Ok, we'll keep watching!\" he announced, to another burst of laughter from the others in the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mustafa, our <i>Assad,</i>\" said Ahreed, \"We need protection in this night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustafa nodded again, stood up and walked into the darkness, glancing back at Ahreed once or twice, still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed pretended not to notice.

It was time for morning prayer, and he suddenly remembered his beloved second Baba, Esfir. He wondered again what might have happened to him back in Libya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed also thought for awhile about his real Baba, his life back in Australia and his scholarship at the Kings School in Sydney. He wondered what his brother, Ahrou was doing. He remembered his sister in Melbourne. Almost a tear welled in his eye, but Ahreed pushed his memories away as he reached out for his prayer mat. All of the boys carried a mat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ahreed bowed down to Allah, the first morning beams of sunshine stretched across the desert of Persia. Every morning, it was a sacred moment. Every morning, Ahreed thought about Esfir, his ASIO Baba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of prayer, Ahreed heard a popping sound in the distance. 'Pop, pop.....pop, pop-pop-pop.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leant up from his mat and looked across the rocks into the distance. He could see occasional flashes of light. A second or two later, he would hear the sound. There was a fight happening in the south-western corner of the city. Ahreed's view from the north-east corner of the village camp revealed many suburbs, buildings and slums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe popping and the flashes in the centre of the city continued, so Ahreed backed away from his post and went to find the other night watchers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaithfully, there were still two older boy soldiers keeping watch to the west and to the south. Sixteen year old Abah and fifteen year old Kahliah were awake and detected Ahreed's approach as the sergeant snuck around the camp from the first watch to the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed mentioned to them how impressed he was by their ability to detect his approach. They laughed at him, half appreciating his gesture, but also half resenting his authority. He was just fourteen years old, yet he had the authority to take control of the troop overnight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice from behind spoke suddenly. \"Sergeant Ahreed is such a big man now.\" It was Mustafa. Ahreed did not move or turn. There may be a gun pointing at his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustafa continued, \"The big man who did not know he was followed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed focussed on the exact position of the voice behind him, moving his hand slowly but without bending his elbow until he reached the front of his belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have cut your throat, Sergeant Ahreed...\" Mustafa persisted, \" So what - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn three swift movements Ahreed spun, ducked and jumped, slashing his knife through the voice of Mustafa. The big boy fell to the ground, Ahreed on top. Blood spurted from the throat and Ahreed leapt off him and shook blood from his hand, stepping back towards the others without even looking down at the fresh carcass of Mustafa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed inserted his knife back into his belt after a quick wipe. Without knowing whether their Commander would return, Ahreed had no choice. For the sake of the others, Mustafa was now just rat food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'Pop, pop, pop' continued in the distance, and Ahreed knew it was some kind of attack in the city. At any time his troop may be called to fight. He could not lose the trust of the older boys. His jihadi training pointed the way to testing the others later. He stood in front of Abah and Kahliah and paused before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Ahreed Al Australi, and I command that you, the Lions of Allah, move forward to protect our lion cubs, by securing our north-eastern camp border.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Abah suddenly felt obliged to follow the command. \"Yes, Sergeant Ahreed, we will secure the north-east.\" The older boy was shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed now had a reliable ally in the ranks of the older child soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ahreed turned and looked back at the buildings, their windows and rooftops. The rest of the troop was watching Ahreed. The young sergeant seems to imitate Ahreed's every move. They were astounded at his actions after the white pill and it was obvious he was ready to kill anything that moved. Ahreed lifted his heavy AK-47 up and marched towards the first doorway he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boy soldiers did the same. A few of them glanced back at Ahreed with widened eyes as they chose their direction. Some were afraid. Others, especially the younger boys, thought he might be a blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed had no doubt he would shoot anything that moved behind his doorway. His legs and arms now easily carried the heavy metal of the gun, while any door in his face he would kick down. The effects of the little white tablet had really kicked in now, and he was angry about the loss of young Hakim and determined to avenge him. Nothing else mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander paused, turning and looking back at Ahreed as he yelled at the door with his strange accent.

Though he was wearing earmuffs, the sudden bolt of thunder and flash of lightning shocked the boy. He panted for minute or two after the bullet cut a clean hole in the paper behind the pumpkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing, he turned to his teacher. \"Why the pumpkin, uncle?\" He asked Esfir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not call me uncle, Arghree - you must call me baba, always.\" The ASIO veteran took a breath before continuing, \"You will see why the pumpkin, when you hit it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir put his hand on the boy's shoulder, his other on the boy's hand, leaning his face in close to Ahreed's. His new son needed to be comfortable close with him as well as learn to shoot. \"Now be steady and strong, and remember, the lion does not hunt with one eye closed. Use both eyes when you aim close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BANG!\" went the gun again, and the pumpkin splattered in all directions. Esfir was amazed that the boy hit the pumpkin on only his second attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There,\" pointed Esfir, \"Now you see the difference. When it is heavy and wet, it explodes - just like a man's head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed suddenly dropped the gun, grabbed his stomach and bent over, vomiting on the concrete floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back up, Ahreed tilted his head at Esfir. \"How can you say such a thing?\" he protested, panting and with tears in his eyes, \"I would NEVER shoot a man's head! A man's life is sacred before Allah!\" he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir grabbed the boy's shoulders and forced him to turn around. \"Look at me, Arghreed, LOOK AT ME! What if the man is about to shoot you, huh? What if he is about to shoot me, your baba eh? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are NOT my baba!\" Yelled back Ahreed, angry now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if he was going to shoot your real baba, then? Eh?\" Fired back Esfir. \"What if some crazy jihadist has gun at your head and tells you 'if you do not shoot, I SHOOT YOU!'  Huh? It's not so simple, kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said I would not be a soldier!\" Yelled back the boy, spitting and trying to get rid of the taste of vomit from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A soldier no, no. But in dangerous places there are bad people, bad things. You must SURVIVE, Arghree! Continued Esfir, still holding the boy's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angry youth pulled away from his teacher. \"I can survive without your guns, your fake family, and your fucking ASIO!\" Ahreed ran back to the stairs leading up to the house. He turned and called back at Esfir with fire in his eyes, \" And stop calling me Arghree! Only my REAL Baba calls me that!\" Then he stumbled onto the stairs and desperately started climbing to the light of the open room above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir constrained his urge to chase after the boy, instead squatting down to the floor and shaking his head. What could he do? This kid was just fourteen and a pampered Australian youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ahreed reached the top of the stairs he stopped, almost unable to breathe. His legs began to wobble beneath him uncontrollably, forcing Ahreed to grab hold of the railing. He sank down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir waited at the bottom of the stairs, listening. He could the boy panting at the top of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed flopped on the floor, turning over at looking up at the ceiling still enraged and now hiccuping with fear, shame and desperation. He still felt sick in his guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir kept waiting. It took several minutes for the boy to quieten down. Finally, he called up the staircase, \"And what is survival, Ahreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy started to breathe heavily again. Angrily, he yelled up at the roof, \"Survival is not dying in your holy fucking war for holy fucking ASIO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising slowly step by step, Esfir quietly replied, \"Survival is not just staying alive because you are afraid to die.\" Esfir took another step up, carefully listening. \"Jihadists believe survival is dying for a good reason.\" He stopped and waited for a reply from the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could be a good reason to die?\" mumbled Ahreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some believe  for the rule of Islamic law, some believe it is the gateway to heaven and life everlasting, some just believe in getting seven virgins, or ten virgins for themselves.\" Esfir paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just stupid,\" Ahreed mumbled to himself. \"What do you believe survival is....

He remembered well the evacuation of Akram Hussein and his family, being a huge success for the Australians at the time. Akram had been a key engineer in the design and process of achieving nuclear capability under the recent Iranian regime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir was previously a part of the old regime's intelligence service and had defected to Australia quietly many years ago. At that time he could foresee the fall of the government in Iran and the introduction of Sharia Law. As a modern, well educated man, Esfir knew that the trends of the western world would be of little interest to the new social system there. Esfir realized at that time there was no point in remaining in Iran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis departure had left behind his wife and two beloved children, Javeed and Koosha. To this day he does not know what happened to them. He hoped deep down that one day, as part of his work for the Australian Secret Intelligence Organization, he would learn of their fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe call on his ASIO phone message system surprised him, but also buoyed his hopes for another assignment in the Middle East. It was an advice that his new teenage son, Ahreed, was in Canberra and being prepared for activation as an anti-terrorist informer. Of course, this was not one of his real sons. It was simply the creation of a family unit for undetected travel into the world of the human traffickers at the edge of the Mediterranean Sea. He was partly dismayed because travel back to Libya or Egypt may be some months away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir went back to his study and picked up the file on the boy. No mother, his father another operative like Esfir, the boy's brother mixed up with radicals in the community. It seemed to Esfir that ASIO had the right pick. But how would the pair of them work on the ground, when they were placed in Libya?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a brief call to his housekeeper. He needed a room to be prepared for the boy. It was important that Esfir establish a good relationship with the fourteen year old Ahreed, so that outsiders would not notice that the two of them were a false creation of ASIO. This was just as important in Sydney as it was in Pakistan, or Libya, or in Egypt. He hoped Ahreed's language skills were up to scratch in Arabic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these locations were possible 'drop points' for the pair, as they collected and reviewed information about the money making schemes of ISIS. His ASIO assignment for most of the current year was about the financing of the 'Hundred Year War'. He wondered how long it would take the boy to be inducted into ASIO and sent to his house to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir had his own system of training prepared for this Ahreed boy, and he needed time to ensure the kid was ready for deployment in the Middle East. He looked down through his notes...</span></div></div>",

He wanted to yell at the woman, Kirstin. Instead he just kept ignoring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your Baba, a mister Akram Hussein, has been organising a bombing in Melbourne?\" Kirstin darted at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed looked up at the woman suddenly, anger welling in his tears. His lower face shivering, he answered, \"My Baba told me those people were EVIL!\" he yelled. \"MY BABA SAID, if you ever do anything like this, Ahreed, I will forget you. My Baba said to me, this action will cause all Muslims to be treated badly in Australia, like you are treating ME NOW!\" He held the woman's stare for a moment, then looked back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin relaxed and turned over to the next page in her notes. \"So you don't know about your father's involvement in the terror attacks in Melbourne?\" she again looked at the boy, awaiting his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed lost control. He did not know how to listen or to speak, but started rambling, \"My Baba is a good Australian - he told me this country is good and that he came here to protect me and my brother and my sister. My Baba says the government is good, and that my sister will be a doctor one day because of this government.... but why why does this government bring me here? Why do you torture me??\" he finished, panting, almost hysterical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin scribbled a note or two onto the page she was reading. She paused, looked up at Ahreed, his eyes aflamed with anger staring back at her. \"You call this torture, Ahreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked away to the side. He glanced around the room, then back into his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin placed her notes down on the stainless steel desk and leant forward, pointing her pen across at Ahreed's face, \"You don't even know what torture is, young man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was still panting with rage and fear. He kept looking down. He felt he was in prison, being persecuted by a government who hated Muslims like him. This woman was twisting his words, confusing him. He was afraid to say anything more, but uncontrollably blurted, \"Torture is taking me away from home - you have taken me against my will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin held the boy's gaze, and speaking quietly she said, \"No, Ahreed, I'm just doing my job. We must question you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy snapped his gaze back down into his hands, fidgeting in his lap. He could never believe that his Baba was responsible for the Melbourne attack plan. It simply was not possible to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin pressed further, \"What other kinds of torture are you expecting from us, Ahreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to imagine his worst thoughts of what torture meant. He thought about beheading, the sound of a cow as the knife was dragged across its neck. He thought about being shot in a firing squad. He thought about his Baba, yelling at him with a knife in his hand. For a brief moment, he saw a vision of his mother, blood all over her dress, lying on the ground reaching out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin watched the boy's face. Ahreed was very distressed - she could see that. She waited, watching the tears run down his brown cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed looked from side to side. He shook his head, took a breath, then pointed his finger onto the stainless steel table in front of him. \"This is torture, Miss Kirstin...\" he began, \"This is pain. I do not know the answers to your questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin glanced back down at her notes casually, flipping the page. \"Okay, Ahreed, but I need to know what you think we are going to do to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed paused. He looked up at the woman, Kirstin. He looked around the room again. He looked back at her. She looked young, with dark hair and flashing eyes. Her face seemed hard, looking back into his eyes. But there was something else. There was something behind her brown eyes and skin, a closeness he had not felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know, Miss Kirstin,\" answered Ahreed, glancing down then back up at the young woman. \"I cannot imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opened and Russell re-entered the room. Kirstin stood up and the two gestured at their notes as Russell sat down. Kirstin closed the door, but remained at the side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are very sorry to put you through this, Ahreed,\" began Russell, \"But it was necessary for us to ask you these things before we move to the next stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed glanced between the two of them. \"What do you mean, the next stage?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your new family, Ahreed,\" continued Russell. \"We have a new Baba for you back in Sydney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was suddenly distressed again, \"But my Baba...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin interrupted Ahreed, \"Your Baba will always be there, Ahreed. We will not take him away from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell, picking up the conversation added,\"We need you to come and work for us. Your dad already works for us and we need you to become a new source of information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was calming down, but still confused. \"What information do you want from me? I know nothing about the Melbourne stadium terror plot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin spoke in reply, \"But you do, Ahreed. You know many things. Once you are trained by your teacher, you will understand many more things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is my teacher?\" the boy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Esfir, and he is from Iran, just like your Baba is...\" added Russell. \"He will guide you, but you need to pretend to be his son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed was still confused. \"But my Baba?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin moved over to the steel desk and leant down to Ahreed. \"Your Baba will always be your Baba, Ahreed. You will see him, talk with him, spend time with him. We will make sure of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Ahreed began to calm down. So much had happened today, and in an instant it seemed like his whole life had changed. Yet somehow, he had always known deep down that he was going to be connected with the troubles of the Australian Muslims. It was as though his Baba had prepared him. He realized that the sudden departure of his sister to Melbourne, the beginning of his high school at the King's School in Sydney, all of it was connected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry, Ahreed,\" repeated Kirstin, \"But we had to ask you certain questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell added, \"And I was the good cop, while Kirstin had to be the bad cop, Ahreed...that's why she seemed so nasty.\" Russell gestured with his hand towards the notes on the table in front of him, \"It was the procedure we had to follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed could feel his heart slowing down. For the first time since this afternoon, he was calmer again. Still, he was uncertain what all of this meant.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Esfir Haidi was originally from Iran and had been an ASIO operative for some years. He remembered well the evacuation of Akram Hussein and his family, being a huge success for the Australians at the time. Akram had been a key engineer in the design and process of achieving nuclear capability under the recent Iranian regime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir was previously a part of the old regime's intelligence service and had defected to Australia quietly many years ago. At that time he could foresee the fall of the government in Iran and the introduction of Sharia Law. As a modern, well educated man, Esfir knew that the trends of the western world would be of little interest to the newly restored, traditional social system in Iran. Esfir realized at that time there was no point remaining in his homeland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis departure had left behind his wife and two beloved children, Javeed and Koosha. To this day he does not know what happened to them. He hoped deep down that one day, as part of his work for the Australian Secret Intelligence Organization, he would learn of their fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe call on his ASIO phone message system surprised him, but also buoyed his hopes for another assignment in the Middle East. It was an advice that his teenage son \"Ahreed\" was in Canberra, being prepared for activation as an anti-terrorist informer. Of course, this was not one of his real sons. It was simply the creation of a family unit, for undetected travel into the world of the human traffickers at the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir went back to his study and picked up the ASIO file on the boy. No mother, his father another operative like Esfir, the boy's brother mixed up with radicals in the community. It seemed to Esfir that ASIO had the right pick. But how would this pair work on the ground, when they were eventually placed in Libya? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a brief call to his housekeeper. He needed a room to be prepared for the boy. It was important that Esfir establish a good relationship with the fourteen year old Ahreed, so that outsiders would not notice that the two of them were a false creation of ASIO. This was just as important in Sydney as it was in Pakistan, or Libya, or in Egypt. He hoped Ahreed's language skills were up to scratch in Arabic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these locations were possible 'drop points' for the pair, as they collected and reviewed information about the money making schemes of ISIS. His ASIO assignment for most of the current year was about the financing of the 'Hundred Year War'. He wondered how long it would take the boy to be inducted into ASIO and sent to his house to live. He also considered whether ASIO wanted the boy overseas or here in Australia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsfir had his own system of training prepared for this Ahreed boy, and he needed additional time to ensure the kid was ready for deployment in the Middle East. He looked down through his notes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aaron Teasdale was 47 years old. He had been a supervisor in the Australian Secret Service for nearly twenty years. He started as a state policeman in the New South Wales Police at Yass, a country town on the main highway between Sydney and Melbourne, later transferring to the Australian Federal Police at the nearby national capital, Canberra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout his career, Aaron had been assigned missions that involved families and children. The Australian Secret Service had been very busy in this area of families because of boat people people arriving on Australia's northern shores for several years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of his assignments were about security threats and falsified stories of refugees from Asia and the Middle East. This latest case however, seemed far more intense. He read through the eleven points of required training for this fourteen year old Sydney boy, Ahreed Hussein al Isfahan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not the first time that Teasdale had seen a child brought into the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation as an operative: through the years several kids had been placed into his files, assisting ASIO with the monitoring of family and extended family members. However, it was most peculiar that a child psychologist was not appointed to oversee the boy's progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eleven points of training had been recently updated - within the last few hours - and Teasdale clicked on the reference icon to compare it with this new case. To his surprise, the PDF file was a breakdown of the eleven known stages of training for a jihadi youth. In other words, an analysis of the radicalisation process of adolescents known to be used by ISIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComparing the two, he could see immediately that the boy's training program was modelled on the known Jihadi method. Trouble was, no one had been appointed to oversee the boy's welfare. Teasdale knew this was illegal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat back in his office chair and nervously rubbed his chin. He knew there was something he should do about this. He knew it was not fair or reasonable to put a fourteen year old boy through this program. Beginning with point one, the list of steps read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1/     Sever emotional support system of family, broad community, schooling, and all trust-based support systems: ensure the sense of abandonment emotionally affects the youth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeasdale shook his head. This stuff was torture to a kid. There was also a note about the updated training program: it explained that the activation of the Sydney kid was to be accelerated and that it was to follow, as near as possible, the Jihadi method instead of the 'usually time demanding process'  used for children who became connected to the Intelligence Organisation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer knew he had to do something about this illegal program, but in the meantime he needed to authorise the requested immediate and urgent transfer of the boy, who currently held no Australian passport. The kid, Ahreed Hussein, had been introduced to his 'new' father but it was, like, an hour ago. The schedule was to have the two operatives on the ground, in Libya, within just 72 hours! I was ludicrous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only way the mission was possible was if Teasdale authorised the 'Hughs'. It was a high-speed, low noise helicopter that was capable of night flight, necessary to move the pair to Brisbane within a couple of days for the long, international flight into Athens, Greece. The request was to occupy the Hughs for about 5 days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Teasdale quickly realised the Hussein case was extraordinary, it was not necessary for him to bring it to an immediate halt. He had several days, and there was no reason to alert anyone to his objection right now, he thought. Since the Melbourne terror threat on ANZAC Day, several of these peculiar programs had emerged. The officer was weary of getting in the way of Homeland Security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead he would make some administrative diversions appear, such as DNA profiling of the child, facial recognition registration, fingerprinting and so on. These were all absolute requirements of ASIO, and he would simply ensure these procedures were followed. To the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would, in theory, delay the deployment of this young Hussein, so that Teasdale could make his case for diversion of that deployment. He felt it necessary to review the training program with the overview of a child psychologist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, there would need to be a snapshot of the boy's personality recorded, as required for the debriefing process later when Ahreed came off his first assignment. How do you judge the psychological effects of the assignment without an analysis of what is 'normal' for this particular individual?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was simply not fair - nor lawful - for the Australian Secret Intelligence Organisation to place a young Australian boy under this much duress - no matter how vital the assignment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He turned back to the list of training program objectives set for the fourteen year old Sydney boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2/    Having created a sense of abandonment, restore faith of youth by all-consuming care and concern. Provide excellent food, opulent environment, boost self esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3/    Intense accelerated firearms and strategy training, for instinctive rather than practical purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, hang on a minute,\" said Teasdale out loud. He wondered what \"opulent environment\" meant. Then there was the practical training - which usually took at least months - compressed into this 'for instinctive rather than practical purposes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell did THAT mean? Thought Teasdale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, he compared the ASIO training program for Ahreed with the Jihadi principles of child soldier instruction. They were almost an exact match. Teasdale was disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSending a fourteen year old Muslim Australian into the Middle East to do what? With only 'instinctive' familiarity with weapons and strategy? Just because this new recruit was 'vital', didn't mean you had the right to exploit him to such an extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeasdale kept reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4/     Instruction in self-abortion of operations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeasdale shook his head again. This was spy-speak basically for 'suicide training'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't there enough 14 year olds topping themselves already? Without teaching more how to do it?\" Teasdale mumbled as he continued reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5/      Rapid support from authority figures, to funnel behaviour to required level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pondering the meaning of 'funnel behaviour' and 'required level', Teasdale considered who else he ought to contact about this boy's deployment for ASIO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, ASIO one-one-two-nine, what is your main concern with this deployment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia Rodriguez was 52 years old, a veteran of the Australian Secret Service and impatient with this man in her office. His daily ASIO conference was 1120am, which she knew from his unit code: one-one-two, and she knew he was ninth in command of his unit, being 'one-one-two-nine'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earlier in the day the conference, the more important the assignment portfolio within ASIO. Information was organised and compartmentalised for security in this way, on a daily basis in the Australian Secret Service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis also allowed Rodriguez to consider Teasdale's rank, one-one-two/nine in relation to her own, zero-six-three/two. Those with a zero at the beginning of their ID tended to be very high ranking. They decided the direction of ASIO on a daily basis. However Teasdale's conference time was adjusted to Middle Eastern time and he was ninth in command of that unit. She was second in command of hers. But the importance of Teasdale's unit was uncertain to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodriguez glanced back briefly over Teasdale's submission then clicked through to another window, showing a brief overview of Teasdale's personality and history. She had access to the personnel files of all the people she dealt with in the Organisation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeasdale was taking some time to answer. \"...Well, 063-2, I am concerned about the compromise of the welfare of this young Australian boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodriguez clicked through to yet another window on her computer. It showed the day's current order of priorities for the Australian Secret Intelligence Organisation. A local threat of a mass gassing at a sporting stadium in Melbourne still dominated the agenda. It had been dominating for a long time. It was obvious to Rodriguez why the boy's deployment had been so dramatically accelerated. She could see the bigger picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are aware,\" Rodriguez began, \"That there is an agreement between Australian Security and the boy's father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Teasdale patiently, \"But I am required to get a child psychologist's review filed before his deployment. It's for the child's welfare, and for the sake of debriefing the boy, post-operation. We cannot assess him properly after each mission if we do not have a psychological review prior to deployment. We need to compare the two, before and after, to assess risk for new assignments in the future, and so it goes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'The thread of continuous assessment',\" began Rodriguez, attempting to quote policy..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, 'continuous, <i>comparative</i> assessment', six-three-two,\" corrected Teasdale. He had written the policy: he knew the exact words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodriguez was concerned about the credibility of Teasdale's argument. This operation he was questioning dated back many years, involving too many deep-cover agents. These highly hidden agents of ASIO, Teasdale knew nothing about. They were a radical, almost desperate approach to counter-terrorism after '9/11'. Should terrorism break out on Australian soil, it had always been the plan to activate these cells of anti-terrorism established by ASIO in Australia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bombing of a popular night club for Australian tourists in Bali, Indonesia had not been enough to activate this operation, though it came close. A few minor incidents on home soil, then suddenly an imminent threat within Australia at a huge sports stadium. Plus, the intelligence suggested a gas attack. This had sent the higher ranks of ASIO into near panic mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly weighed up the situation. A young teenager activated according to a long-term plan; the terror threat on local ground; the capacity for ASIO to judge accurately the state of mind of the operative in the future...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, she nodded. Although she was eager to assist her superiors and activate Ahreed quickly, she could not deny the importance of a psychological analysis of the boy's state of mind. Teasdale spoke well but it was obvious he had never been an active operative in the field. Rodriguez considered his email and his stated position, typing some notes into the file as she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Rodriguez had little concern for Teasdale's basic objection, it was valid and had to be adhered to. \"Very well, \" she spoke, \"We will delay determining the date of activation of Ahreed until your child psych review is completed.\" She typed a few more sentences into the file. </span></div></div>",

He wanted to know where his star pupil was. While crossing the quadrangle to Mr Waites' office, he noticed Ahrou Hussein walking on the opposite path. Mr Bhaduri diverted to a crossing and met the young man as he walked with his friends. \"Ahrou, have you seen your brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahreed? No, not today since the bus, Mr Bhaduri.\" replied Ahrou. \"Maybe he's doing something for music.. a concert rehearsal, Mr Bhaduri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maths teacher glanced across the quadrangle, but not seeing any boys Ahreed's age, decided to press on to the Principal's office. He began to pass by as he continued, \"Ok, perhaps you are correct, Ahrou. I will see you tomorrow night at the centre, yes?\" Mr Bhaduri merged into the tide of other students going heading home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man called to the teacher as he disappeared into the crowd, \"Yes Sir, seven o'clock,\" with a thumbs up and nodding gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Bhaduri stepped into the office reception, the noise of the passing students tapering off as the glass door closed behind him. \"Eileen,\" he approached the desk, \"Is Professor Waites still in his office? Can I speak with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist picked up her phone, \"Hold on, Mr Bhaduri, I'll check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBhaduri glanced out through the windows across the quadrangle as he waited, watching Ahrou laughing and joking with friends outside. The maths teacher noted how engaged Ahrou seemed to be. This was an important indicator of progress. It was important that the student break away from his peer support group, finding greater closeness with the centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Waites can speak with you Mr Bhaduri,\" interrupted the receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout replying, Bhaduri ushered himself in. \"Professor Waites, I'm concerned about a student, Ahreed Hussein. He did not appear for his maths test today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe principal shuffled away a piece of paper his was holding while seated at his desk. \"Did you check with Eileen if he was absent, Mr Bhaduri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBhaduri hesitated, \"No, but I am sure I saw him in the yard, earlier in the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Waites looked down, recalling the special conditions in his briefing by the ASIO agents earlier in the day. After a brief hestitation, he replied, \"Then check with Eileen, and if you are not mistaken send the year level coordinator an email, Mr Bhaduri.\" Waites then looked down and repositioned his glasses on the end of his nose to read another sheet of paper in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maths teacher was embarrassed. It seemed the Principal was impatient with him for not following the proper channels. Bhaduri hesitated before turning to leave, \"I'm sorry, Professor, but his brother Ahrou also told me he was here.... I was.. concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mr Bhaduri,\" replied Waites, nodding as he looked back down at the papers in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBhaduri made his way out briskly. He made a mental note to remain calmer in future. It was important that he did not seem to be over-interested in these special students of his.</span></div></div>",

He waited for a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the operative in Iraq answered his call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am calling a code grey,\" Bhaduri typed, \"Because I am concerned about operative 'El Ahrou of the Pacific.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Operative El Ahrou has an appointment, you know this.\" was the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"El Ahrou will make his appointment, but his brother is missing...\" Bhaduri typed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kings School maths teacher waited for awhile.

Afraid of the man who was driving, he turned to the young woman sitting next to him in the back seat. \"Am I in some kind of trouble, Ms Kirstin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked out of the car window, smiling. \"Why do you think that, Ahreed?\" she asked, distantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed paused for a moment. \"Because you are taking me away.\"<br>\r\nThe sound of the traffic outside filled the silence as she looked up at the rear vision mirror. Ahreed could see her eyes meet the man's as he drove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think we are taking you?\" asked the woman, glancing back out of the passenger window. She seemed to be half ignoring Ahreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down into his lap, feeling frustrated now, as well as frightened. Every question he asked was returned by another question. \"How could I know, when you have not told me!?\" he demanded, letting the two of them know he was becoming upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled again, still staring distantly out at the bustling city of Sydney passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed kept waiting for an answer. Neither the man nor the woman replied. Ahreed was afraid to ask any more questions. He looked around the car instead and noticed a sign stuck to the driver's visor. Ahreed realised it was a hire car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver Commodore drove on, Ahreed noticing its entry to the M4. He recognized Paramatta, Strathfield and then Petersham pass by as his journey continued. He so wanted to ask again about his destination, but his trust in the two strangers had been exhausted by the conversation leaving the Kings School. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the car turned towards Mascot and then approached the airport, his alarm bells really started to ring. Suddenly, he blurted out, \"Where... where are you taking me?!?\"<br>\r\nThe woman beside him and the man driving kept ignoring him. The woman just reached into her handbag and took out a small tablet device, then started texting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't fair!\" protested Ahreed, \"You can't do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Ahreed,\" replied the woman, \"We're just going on a quick flight to Canberra.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed sat suddenly forward, looking out at the airport surrounds as if trying to find a bearing. The woman stretched out her arm and grabbed him by the shoulder, pressing him back into the seat. \"Stay calm, Ahreed,\" she said, raising her voice slightly and placing her smartphone down on the next seat. \"It's going to be alright...there's no need to be alarmed.\"<br>\r\n\"But what is this!?\" protested Ahreed. \"You can't do this to me... this is Australia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next really worried Ahreed. Instead of driving to a carpark, the vehicle drove under an overpass and was suddenly on the tarmac. There were people walking all around outside and Ahreed quickly considered his escape options. A plane appeared right in front of the car as it stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed lurched to the left hand door suddenly and opening the door as fast as he could, scrambled from the back seat and out onto the tarmac. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was no time to look over his shoulder for one of the ASIO agents chasing him. He had to lose them both so he quickly scrambled up the back of one of the stacks, noting the direction of a distant doorway as he gained height. From there he could jump to another stack, keeping low as he moved over the canvas strapping. He thought he might even be able to hide under one of the heavy, green canvas covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Kirstin called out to her partner across the tarmac. \"Leave him for now, Russell,\" just as he arrived at the large roller door. She knew if they gave chase they would create a commotion in the air freight area, which could easily ring out across the entire airport's alarm system. She snatched up her device from the back seat of the hire car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" asked Russell as he arrived back, a bit puffed from running. \"You can't just let him run amok in the hanger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to..\" she explained, \"..otherwise we'll create an official incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've lost him, Kirstin.\" He continued, \"We've got to find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirstin turned from Russell and started speaking to the device. \"One-one-five, one-one, Kirstin.\" Her check in code passed immediately and a voice at ASIO Headquarters replied. The code advised HQ that she was agent 11, her rank, while 1-1-5 described her unit and its daily check-in time of 11:50am. So the agent at the other end knew immediately that the matter was urgent because it was now 4:45pm, not Unit 1-1-5's usual contact period of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice came on to the secure phone line. Kirstin nodded, listening intently then adding, \"Yes, Mascot Airport international terminal tarmac, by aerial five parked at Gate 23.\" She listened to instructions, glancing around a bit tensely to see if she and Russell had attracted any unwanted attention. \"Subject is a code four, around Customs Holding warehouse number 7.\" She nodded again, finishing with, \"Yes sir, 1-1-5-1-1 over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the device from her ear, clicking a button on its edge and shoving it into her pocket. It was now monitoring sound and HQ knew that the boy had escaped on foot in that area of the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than one minute, two agents and three senior Customs supervisors were in position, scanning for the boy. Between the main entrance and exit, in the CCTV monitoring room, inside the terminal building for gates 20 to 36, on the highest rooftop close to the terminal building and at the metro rail station. The basic assumption was that the boy would attempt to leave the airport and try to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about 8pm, Ahrou Hussein was doing homework at his computer in his second floor bedroom at one of the King's School's boarding student buildings. He was startled by a sudden tapping on his window glass and lurched back in his chair, away from the dark pane. As he strained cautiously to investigate, he saw his brother's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahreed, what are you doing, fool?!\" Hissed Ahrou.

He sent me with them.\" Ahreed gasped suddenly, then continued,\"They took me to the airport but I ran away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you call baba, Ahreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It could mean ASIO suspected the maths teacher of involvement in the ISIS recruiting movement. Bhaduri logged on to his familiar, secure internet server. Immediately, he clicked on chat to an operative in Iraq. He waited for a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the operative in Iraq answered his call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am calling a code grey,\" Bhaduri typed, \"Because I am concerned about operative 'El Ahrou of the Pacific.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Operative El Ahrou has an appointment, you know this.\" was the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"El Ahrou will make his appointment, but his brother is missing...\" Bhaduri typed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kings School maths teacher waited for awhile.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aaron Teasdale was 47 years old. He had been a supervisor in the Australian Secret Service for nearly twenty years. He started as a state policeman in the New South Wales Police at Yass, a country town on the main highway between Sydney and Melbourne, later transferring to the Australian Federal Police at the nearby national capital, Canberra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout his career, Aaron had been assigned missions that involved families and children. The Australian Secret Service had been very busy in this area of families because of boat people people arriving on Australia's northern shores for several years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of his assignments were about security threats and falsified stories of refugees from asia and the middle east. This latest mission, however, seemed far more intense. He read through the eleven points of required training for this fourteen year old Sydney boy, Ahreed Hussein al Ahrahed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not the first time that Teasdale had seen a child brought into the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation: through the years several kids had been placed into his files, assisting ASIO with the monitoring of family and extended family members. However, it was most peculiar that a child psychologist was not appointed to oversee the boy's progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eleven points of training had been recently updated - within the last few hours - and Teasdale clicked on the reference icon to compare it with his current assignment. To his surprise, the PDF file was a breakdown of the eleven known stages of training for a jihadi youth. In other words, an analysis of the radicalisation process of adolescents known to be used by ISIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComparing the two, he could see immediately that the boy's training program was modelled on the known Jihadi method. Trouble was, no one had been appointed to oversee the boy's welfare. Teasdale knew this was illegal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat back in his office chair and nervously rubbed his chin. He knew there was something he should do about this. He knew it was not fair or reasonable to put a fourteen year old boy through this program. Beginning with point one, the list of steps read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1/     Sever emotional support system of family, broad community, schooling, and all trust-based support systems: ensure the sense of abandonment emotionally affects the youth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeasdale shook his head. This stuff was torture to a kid. There was also a note about the updated training program: it explained that the activation of the Sydney kid was to be accelerated and that it was to follow, as near as possible, the Jihadi method instead of the 'usually time demanding process' normally used for children who became connected to the Intelligence Organisation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Teasdale quickly realised the Hussein case was extraordinary, it was not necessary for him to bring it to an immediate halt. He had several days, and there was no reason to alert anyone to his objection right now, he thought. There were technicalities with 'deployment' that could stretch the timeline out to several weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could make some administrative diversions appear, such as DNA profiling of the child, facial recognition registration, fingerprinting and so on. These were all absolute requirements of ASIO, and he would simply ensure these procedures were followed. To the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would, in theory, delay the deployment of this young Hussein, so that Teasdale could make his case for diversion of that deployment. He felt it necessary to review the training program with the overview of a child psychologist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, there would need to be a snapshot of the boy's personality recorded, as required for the debriefing process later, when Ahreed came off his first assignment. How do you judge the psychological effects of the assignment without an analysis of what is 'normal' for this particular individual?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was simply not fair - nor lawful - for the Australian Secret Intelligence Organisation to place a young Australian boy under this much pressure - no matter how vital the assignment! Teasdale started typing.</span></div></div>",

Explaining his concern for Ahrou, he asked the Master about the young man's recent behaviour. Bhaduri outlined a reason for being on the premises so late, concerning falling marks and the evening phone call an hour earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climbed the grand old, hand carved staircase to the second floor, along the carpeted corridor and then to Ahreed's shared room and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" asked a hushed voice on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Mr Bhaduri, Ahrou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and the young man quietly ushered his teacher in, quickly closing the door behind him. Bhaduri was astounded to see Ahreed sitting on the bed. \"What happened to you at school today, Ahreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They took me from school, the intelligence people did, Mr Bhaduri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher was feeling panicky. He had an operation for Ahrou which he could not discuss with Ahreed. \"What did they want you for, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Mr Bhaduri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher bobbed down to bed level to continue questioning. \"How did you get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhreed's lip quivered slightly. \"I, I escaped from them at Moscot Airport, caught a train and then two busses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBhaduri's mind was racing. Was it him they were after? Was Ahrou about to be summoned by ASIO? Bhaduri sat down on the end of the bed and thought hard. If there was some type of trace on Ahreed, surely ASIO would already be here. They could even have let him slip away to see where the boy ran to on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what troubled Bhaduri the most was why Ahreed? The secret service could be monitoring Ahreed's phone right now. \"Why didn't you go home, Ahree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear welled in the boy's eyes. \"I was too afraid... what might be there. Once before I went home and the whole house was empty!\" He turned to his older brother, \"Ahrou, you remember that, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhrou nodded, \"Yes Teacher. Baba said the landlord hated us when he found out where we were from and had everything taken out. We had to move to another place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Baba!\" sobbed the younger boy, where is Baba? I am too afraid to call him.. in case I get him in t-trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can call Baba, Ahreed. Don't worry.\" Ahrou noticed his teacher catching his gaze. Bhaduri leant back and lifted his finger to his lips so Ahreed could not see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher thought quickly. \"Ahreed, why would ASIO want to hurt you? They probably have someone who has complained, or thought you were suspicious... some busybody who hates Muslims.\" Bhaduri paused while the boy's older brother waited for their Baba to answer the phone. The maths teacher was very worried about the situation, but it was true that all of it could be nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alo, Ahrou?\" asked his Baba as he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Baba, it's Ahrou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahrou, do you know where your brother is?\" asked his Baba, sounding worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Baba, he is here with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alhamdulillah!\" exclaimed his Baba,\"Is he alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes Baba, but he is very frightened. The secret service took him from school,\" explained Ahrou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me speak with him, Ahrou, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older boy handed his phone to his young brother. Ahreed spoke with his Baba for several minutes, tears in his eyes again. Mr Bhaduri took Ahrou aside and explained the meeting place for the coming Friday morning. His teacher whispered into his ear, \"This is a big moment for Australia, Ahrou. You may become famous throughout the world as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhrou was shaken by the news. Meeting actual Jihadists for a possible mission could mean his own martyrdom.</span></div></div>",

I'm scared they're going to hurt me, Baba..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkram Hussein, 67, was worried about his youngest child and knew he had to explain. He'd always known ASIO was coming for Ahreed because the Australian Government had been supporting his whole family since its arrival in Sydney nine years ago. ASIO had also alerted him of their plan to move Ahreed to a new school in this year, but Akram had expected it would be at the end of the year. He assumed the speeding up of the process was because of the Melbourne terror alert he had heard about. Everyone was on edge after the Australian Prime Minister's emergency announcement to the nation about a possible gas attack in a Melbourne sports stadium and an attempt to blow up a city hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis daughter Noora was also studying at Melbourne University while Ahreed and his older brother, Ahrou were attending the Kings School, Sydney's most prestigious secondary college. Noora was doing medicine and Akram and both of his sons, Ahreed and Ahrou were very proud of her. They were also worried about her being in Melbourne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of his previous work with the Iranian Government's nuclear program, Akram and his family were welcomed as refugees, but at a cost. One of his beloved children should give back and Ahreed, even brighter than his older sister, had been chosen before the boy had started high school. He was to do two years at the Kings School, then move to Alnoori Muslim School. If successful at this next process Ahreed was facing right now, he was to become a sleeper cell embedded in the radical Muslim community by ASIO. They were especially interested in the radicalization of young teenaged boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aging engineer had already faced his own struggles in Australia. The fear of detection as an agent by others in the Muslim community, the regular moving of their home for security reasons, the loss of his beloved wife. Having no mother from four years of age, Ahreed too, had suffered. Akram explained all of this to Ahreed for what seemed like hours, though it was really only a precious few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Bhaduri had figured out it would be best to wait and see what happened before risking any further communication with his contact in Iraq. Akram arrived late in the night and picked up Ahreed, while Bhaduri explained to Principal Waites what had happened at the boarding house. The maths teacher was surprised when Akram left without taking Ahrou as well.</span></div></div>",
