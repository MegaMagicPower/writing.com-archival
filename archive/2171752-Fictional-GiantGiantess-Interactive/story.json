This was a journey he made alone after he and Riku had returned to their home islands after defeating Organization XIII. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was curious...he remembered how the strange fruit in this forest had made him huge...it was only for a few moments that he was permitted to enjoy the view and new size though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he never forgot how cool it felt,.towering over the tree tops..too bad Donald rushed him to get back to normal. Sora sighed and folded his arms behind his head and sighed, \"Darn...am I lost? I can't find that dumb tree with the fruit!\" Sora complained...before the fruit itself was thrown down to clunk him on the noggin by none other than the Cheshire Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho ho ho ho ho! You're quite a long way from home! Like poor Alice...\" The whimsical voice of the pink and purple cat said from the top of the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora rubbed the now sore spot on his head and frowned up at the cat, \"What was that for?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the fruit you seek...though you must be careful to--\" Cheshire Cat began to explain...but Sora quickly began tearing into the fruit, mouthful after mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...you might have overdone it...\" The Cheshire Cat giggled before vanishing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the worst that could happen?! URRRRRP!\" Sora belched loudly as he polished off the rest of the fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere seconds later...he felt a tingling throughout his body..and his line of sight was soon over the tree tops!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hheheehehe! I'm sooo huuuge!\" Sora's voice thundered, scaring birds from their roost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big does Sora get?</span></div></div>",

Multiple colorful orbs were scattered in patterns all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Sora didn't know was that these were in fact multiple worlds now smaller then his feet.

What's going on?!\" Mickey inquired frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Donald could answer, a deep rumble of thunder caused everyone to clap their hands over their ears....it almost sounded...like a voice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora...?\" Goofy gulped as Donald and the others whirled around to the Captain of the Guard: \"What!? What about Sora?!\" Chip hopped up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fellers! Ya gotta take a look at this!\" Dale hopped over to a screen connected to a satellite of sorts that monitored any incoming threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone crowded around the monitor and saw that Goofy was correct...it was Sora! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PPpfpghhew....\" Donald blubbered as he fainted dead away on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How....what-....\" Mickey was at a loss for words as the thunderous voice of their colossal friend rang out once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...I recognize that little castle!\" Sora gasped slightly as on his shoulder the Cheshire Cat appeared. \"Indeed! Your size is quite impressive! Your mere toes would dwarf any and all worlds now!\" </span></div></div>",

Sora gleefully looked at the numerous orbs around him. One in particular caught his attention as it was right between his big and second toe. The spiky haired boy giggled at the sight, he felt so big and powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I never thought I'd be this big!\", Sora grew a toothy grin as he put his arms behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheshire hummed as he layed on the hairline of Sora. \"You clearly are enthusiastic about all this. But I wonder, just how long intill your glee affects others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora rolled his eyes up confused. \"Huh, what do you...\" the boy stopped as the cat once again vanished. \"Man, I wish he'd stop being so cryptic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouting a little, Sora looked back at his toes. At this size they could do some real damage, with one flex it would become toe jam. But he wouldn't do that.........right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora shook his head and looked back at Disney Castle, his friends be fine with his sudden titanic size.

They're all glued DEEP in your GIANT pits!\" Sora boomed as he floated backwards and admired his work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo a casual observer, it would look like Riku's underarm was littered with three tiny dots. The planets could easily be mistaken for dirt given the raunchy smell coming off the youth's pits. But these were fully inhabited worlds, subject to the cruel games of these two teens...turned gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! They look like pit dirt!\" Sora guffawed childishly. Riku grinned smugly, \"They might as well be..their lives are meaningless in the eyes of us gods! Their worlds exist only for our fun!\" Riku boomed, his green eye peering in at his billions upon billions of victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Riku do now...?</span></div></div>",

The last thing he remembered was flying the gummi ship out to investigate a new world on behalf of King Mickey....and a strange light blinding him and causing him to veer off course. During the bumpy ride, he must've hit his head and fallen unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows where he was now? Possibly drifting through space...with no fuel or supplies in the ship! He almost hesitated to open his eyes..but a sharp object poking at his cheek caused his lovely blue eyes to flutter open. Looking down to see what had prodded him in the face, he gasped slightly as he saw a tiny person holding a spear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giant! What do you want with Lilliput?!\" The tiny being demanded. It wasn't just one tiny person either, as Sora looked down at his body he would see dozens of the tinies who appeared to be wearing tribal warrior garments, scurrying to and fro across his immense form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's more, he appeared to be be tied down by loads of tiny, and easily breakable, strings! Sora couldn't help it, he had to laugh! What a thing to wake up to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis laughter hurt the tiny warriors ears and his movements sent several of the tinies tumbling off of his torso. This caused them to start trying to stab him with their spears!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad move...it only succeeded in tickling the youth. \"Ha ha ha ha ha! Cut it out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his bellowing laughter finally subsided, he looked back down at the tiny who had woke him up in the first place. \"So...where am I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on our world: Lilliput! And you are to leave immediately!\" The man threateningly held the spear at Sora's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora frowned, \"Well that's kinda rude...I just got here!\" Sora started to sit up, sending the man tumbling off of him and causing the threads to snap from his body. \"Ha ha, you guys thought you could tie me down like this? That's kinda cute. Anyhow, is everyone here as tiny as you guys?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora got to his feet, the ground quaked with his steps. \"Whoa...!\" Sora said in childish wonder as he saw that he indeed towered over not only people,  but the entire landscape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm huge! This is soo cool!\" Sora gleefully declared, his booming voice echoing for miles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire!\" The chieftan yelled, hundreds of arrows and spears harmlessly bounced off of Sora's legs and shoes. \"Huh? Aw don't be like that! It's not very smart to try to attack someone so much bigger than you ya know!\" Sora crossed his arms and grinned mischievously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip here had been hot and stuffy in that ship...he hadn't bathed in a couple days he remembered..and he wiggled his sockless toes with a squelch inside his shoes. </span></div></div>",

He was having fun messing with these bugs, but this seemed like a serious issue one only he could solve. Pulling his feet away, he stood up and towered over the people worshipping his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spiky hair boy gave a toothy smile down at the people. \"Heh, don't worry your gods will take care of it!\" He then picked up one of his back shoes still emitting a little steam. \"Just in case I have to get serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinies watched as Sora stepped over them and towards the beach, making the ground quake.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nAs Sora stepped onto the beach and felt the sand on his moist sole, he took a look at the ground.

More were located on thier ship in the water, looking up in shock at the giant teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora smirked before raising his left foot and releasing a rain of sand. The soldiers below gasped as they saw the boy's face covered by the sole as it approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora laughed as he leaned onto his foot. Unlike before, he stepped down hard and felt the bodies being squashed by his plump sole. Lifting his foot back up, the three people he stomped stuck to his sole luckily not as red paste but twitching from the flesh holding them prisoner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling light taps, Sora saw the ship firing thier cannons at him and the soldiers using thier rifles. Sora simply laughed as they only tickled him. The keyblade user smirked as he slipped his right shoe back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't have the water wash the sweat away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers on the ship soon understood the statement as they were covered in a shadow and thier sky was filled with the treads of Sora's shoe. Quickly everyone abandoned the ship just as the black shoe came down and completely crushed the ship into the water and created a large wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the soldiers from Blefuscu resurfaced, they saw Sora raise the foot with thier comrades squished into the sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest swimming back to your island, unless you wanna get squished like your friends!\", Sora threatened wiggling his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers quickly began swimming away as fast as possible. The ones in Sora's foot couldn't even speak as they were squashed again by Sora walking back to the others.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nArriving back to the others, Sora looked surprised when they began to bow immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you giant!\", the chief yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the tinies looked up with determination in thier eyes. \"We will worship you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora giggled before slipping off his now soaking wet shoe. \"Alright little guys, but first you might wanna take care of these bugs.\", titling his foot up, Sora flexed his sole to release them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three popped off they were grabbed by the others and hauled away. Sora lowered himself and shook the ground as he sat. \"Alright, now that we're good how about we resume that toe meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinies quickly started again, wanting to please thier gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while.....</span></div></div>",

Our king is hungry!\" Most of the tinies scurried off toward the town nearby to begin cooking a feast fit for a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, King Sora...has a nice ring to it.\" Sora smiled, remembering how he wanted to be king of Pride Rock back when he visited Simba's world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down beside him, Sora saw several wide eyed tiny kids looking up at him in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like Sora has some fans...</span></div></div>",

The giant teen giggled at the kids scrambling to try and mimic the adults. Sora slowly kneeled onto his right leg, the keyblade wielder then laid down his right palm in front of the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younglings looked wide eyed at the palm before gazing up at the giant. Sora smiled and nodded while lightly wiggling his fingers. The kids slowly crawled onto the fingerless gloved palm, about eight of them fit in the center. Sora curled his fingers slightly to secure them before rising again to his titanic height. He then brought the palm to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy looking to be the oldest at around ten, approached Sora's wrist. \"Ummm...we wanted to thank you your majesty! Everyone was working really hard to protect our home and you got rid of the meanies really quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora warmly smiled and chuckled. \"Hehe, hey no problem! Also you guys can just call me Sora, K?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids nodded and grinned as they saw the giant's friendly nature. A few of the younger one's stepped forward and held up stone tablets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um mist-Sora, could you please sign this?\", one timidly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you look up to someone strong you usually ask them to sign a tablet.\", the other finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry gave a toothy grin at the request. However, this would prove difficult. Both because he wasn't sure how to write on stone and that being a giant would prove fruitless in writing on something that small. After rubbing his chin for a bit, Sora grinned as a lightbulb went off in his head, turning to the youngling Sora brought a hand to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sorry I can't really sign, but I can give you something!\", Sora smiled before wincing as he pulled a strand of his spiky hair out. He then gave it to the two youngest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kids looked in awe at the hair given to them. At thier size, the strand was like that of a light rope. They smiled and bowed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much!\", they said in synch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora gave a close eyed grin as he laughed, happy that the kids were happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora chatted with the kids for a good while, telling them about his adventures and getting to know them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon....</span></div></div>",

The ground thoomed beneath Sora's large feet. A few kids ended up in his sole's shadow, though he simply wiggled his toes and lowered his foot slow enough that they could run out of it's chessy aura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora chuckled. \"Hey come on little ants, my feet can't smell THAT bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids giggled as they called out \"They do!\" And presumed thier evasion of the massive feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne boy end up tripping and falling down onto the ground.

The plump sole soon came down and the cheesy smell increased intill finally the kid was lightly pinned and covered in the cheddary foot flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora laughed as he felt the small body underneath him, the small body was like a mere ball of lint. He made sure not to add pressure to avoid hurting the kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MUHAHA! I've squished one of you, no one can escape my monster feet. Now onto the rest!\", Sora spoke in a mocking villian-like manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his foot of the boy, the kid adjusted to the sudden light before looking up to see Sora's giant form grinning down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, but it looks like you lost!

Another giant has arrived! He is being looked after by our top medics but we are not sure if he poses a threat!\" They called up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora's eyes widened, \"Make sure everyone is safe...I'll go check it out!\" They nodded and went into the process of securing the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground quaked as Sora went over to the beach where a certain young man without sleeves and a head of silvery hair lay and just beginning to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riku? RIKU!\" Sora yelled happily, Riku's eyes shot open as the giant spiky haired boy leaped onto him. \"S-Sora? I've been looking for you everywhere!

Heh, I almost feel bad for them...\" Riku said with a teasing grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora pouted and crossed his arms, \"What's THAT supposed to mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku chuckled and shook his head, \"Nothing...nothing.

Ick...your feet always were infamous...at least now you've got some people to torment with their stink besides me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora stuck his tongue out playfully, \"Like you're one to talk!

You're to go to this world and deal with the villainy going on there. He wouldn't tell me much more than that...only that you'd enjoy being able to 'cut loose'.\" Mickey shrugged with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku frowned, it was an odd request....wiping out a world was usually something considered evil and the doings of the darkness and Heartless.

This stupid world!\" Riku flopped back in the cockpit of the stuffy gummi ship. The insides of the ship now stunk of Riku's body odor and as instructed...the silver haired boy hadn't removed his shoes or socks in this whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got no idea what to expect...but it better be worth this trouble.\" Riku grumbled as the ship went in for a final descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landing gear was deployed, and the ship came to a rest on a landing pad....which was floating slightly off the ground in defiance of gravity itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku hopped out of the ship as it powered down, looking around skeptically...he realized he was standing on the outskirts of what appeared to be a model futuristic cityscape that stretched as far as the eye could see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow, he saw millions and millions of miniscule people scampering around the streets. Jolting him out of his stunned state, his smartphone rang in his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out and seeing Sora's grinning face on the screen, Riku answered. \"Hey, Sora...what's up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Riku!! I wish I could be there with you!! The King said you're getting to rampage in a tiny city like a giant monster!\" Sora said excitedly with bright enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally dawned on Riku the reason for all this...the sweat and stink buildup, the lack of bathing or changing his clothes...the tiny city of villains...oh yes...he indeed was going to enjoy this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's pretty awesome...better get to work!\" Riku said, clicking the phone off, knowing Sora would pout for a bit but he'd understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the city, Riku licked his lips.</span></div></div>",

He was able to see her safely home to Destiny Islands and spend a day with her...before vanishing forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was the cost of the Power of Waking.

He'd been warned over and over by multiple people that once he overused the power...he'd be gone for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking a few times, Sora saw nothing but bright blue sky...and a few clouds. \"Huh...?\" Sitting up quickly, Sora saw he was in some sort of field...and adjacent to him was what appeared to be a dollhouse of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird...\" Sora said, leaning down to the 'doll house' and peeking inside one of the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe occupant of the home was a young man whose parents were out of the country for a business trip, leaving him in charge of the house. It was noon, the boy had just woke up after sleeping in late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe startled to see a gigantic sky-blue eye peering in at him, dwarfing the window itself. Young Gregory could scarcely believe it...then he finally started screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora was surprised to see a tiny person inside the model house! Wait...tiny person...tiny buildings. \"Woah, am I back in that weird Timeless River world?\" Sora crossed his arms and closed his eyes to think it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..can't be! Everything isn't black and white.\" Sora resolved that he'd better stand up and try to figure out where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory meanwhile was panicking as the entire house shook as Sora got to his feet...the giant boy's shadow fell over the entire property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW! I'M EVEN BIGGER THAN I WAS BACK THEN!\" Sora's voice rumbled down, causing Greg to clutch his hands over his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory didn't want to stick around for whatever this gigantic freak was going to do. But if he ran outside he might get crushed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching down over the house, Sora looked back inside. \"Hey uh...I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm kinda lost. Can you tell me where I am?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're in America! New York! ....Planet Earth?\" Came the shrill squeak of a reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...never heard of any of those places.

No wonder he was scared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette rubbed the back of his head. \"Sorry about scaring you, guess i didn't think how someone so tiny would react.\", Sora smiled sincerely before bringing his hand down.

He fit like a pea right in the center, being smaller then Sora's thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Man hes like a Kaiju, i bet he could give Godzilla a ran for his money.\"</i>, now that he was relaxed Gregory found himself more in awe with the sheer might of Sora's height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora slowly lifted up his hand, not wanting to shake up Gregory. He smiled as he brought the young man to his face finding the tiny sitting in his palm kinda adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my name is Gregory.\", the tiny said slowly. Sora smiled as he curled his fingers slightly to keep the little guy secure. \"Hi Gregory like i said before I'm Sora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo are you an alien?\", Gregory suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", Sora blinked tilting his head at the sudden question, Gregory's eyes sparkled in curiosity as he sat up on the gloved palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory thought about everything possible, every fictional story or conspiracy on beings that could be like Sora. \"Are you an Old one, do you know about the fish people?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora pouted at that. \"Hey I'm not old and I'm just like you...well except bigger hehe\", he chuckled. \"Back where I'm from you might've been as big as me. But could you maybe tell me about you and what exactly New York is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny hummed. \"Well right now were in the upstate part, most people know it for the city but my parents moved here some time ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora listened intrested to the tiny's words. \"Ohh so this world is called New York!\", he said slightly blasting Gregory with his warm breath. Clenching his ears, Gregory sweatdropped at the assumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um no New york is just a part of this world, we actually have a lot of cities and countries. And what do you mean world?\", Gregory asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora frowned as he remembered everything that has happened. \"Well...i wanted to save my friend and i had used this power called Waking, i managed to save her but it was too much for me. We got to spend the day in peace then the next thing i know i woke up next to your house Greg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory looked sympathetically at the giant, waking up after thinking you vanished couldn't be a great feeling. Crawling over to the large thumb, the tiny slowly rubbed it in a comfort attempt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that happened to you Sora. You did a good thing if you wanted to ensure your friend was ok. Um...if you want you can stay here until you figure out how to return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora blinked as he brought his palm closer. \"Greg..are you sure, you aren't worried?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory put on a shaky smile. \"N-no it's fine my parents are on a trip plus we own this land. Nobody should see you...for now at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora smiled happily as he suddenly brought Gregory to his face, hugging him to his cheek. \"Thank you so much little guy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory flushed at the sudden action before awkwardly hugging the warm cheek and patting it. \"N-no problem big guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

There's plenty of room here, I'll make some calls and get you some food.\" Gregory suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, really? Thanks!\" Sora said happily as he crouched down and placed Greg back onto the lawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" Greg said as he darted back into the house. Sora stood back up to his mountainous height and looked around. \"Wow, I'm so big I can see a city waaay over there!\" Sora boomed aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spiky headed hero could get used to being this size. The house shook around Greg as Sora took a few steps around the property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? I need to place an order for fifty buckets of fried chicken. Maybe an order of mashed pota-...hello?\" Greg was met with a dial tone, they'd hung up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I not surprised...it sounds like a prank just by saying it out loud.\" Greg sighed in defeat. \"I'll just try some other places and pray they take me serious.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg never used those food delivery apps before...but boy was it coming in handy now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sora was wandering around, feeling grateful he was welcomed by a new friend who at least had room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing Sora was curious about..was whether he kept his powers and most of all: The Keyblade. Putting his hand out to summon the mystical weapon, he sighed as the familiar magic that made it appear in his grip...didn't occur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I really did pay a price for overusing that power.\" Sora sighed and looked at his hands, curling and uncurling his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully I can find a way back to everyone. But for now...this is pretty cool.\" Sora relaxed his arms behind his head in his casual pose, continuing to walk along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora's tremendous shoes were leaving enormous footprints in his wake. So needless to say if he went too far...Greg would have a trail to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg FINALLY got someone to take him seriously, and a truck full of freshly made pizzas was on its way. \"Now I just gotta keep the big guy out of sight-\" Greg looked outside and saw that Sora had apparantly wandered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeez...\" Greg darted out of the house and saw a trail of humongous shoeprints heading away from the house...the question is...did Sora leave the property?</span></div></div>",

It was a peaceful atmosphere much needed after the dark events that had transpired. Still he had a new friend and he was willing to help him until he could get home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he enjoyed his walk, Sora seemed oblivious to just how big he was. The bridge sized treads of his shoes sank into the grounds, creating rows to put plant seeds down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elderly woman watching T.V jumped as the ground outside the house shook like that of a rhythmic earthquake. \"What in tarnation?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWobbling to the window the woman gasped as the fields that had yet to have a tractor run through were set for planting. \"BILLY COME HERE THE ALIENS CAME AGAIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Greg huffed as he jogged after the the boot shaped prints. The imprints looked bigger then a condo and Greg wouldn't lie when he was worried might crush something...or someone by accident!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after 20 minutes of running, Greg found the giant other worlder. It was a coastline a small beach that was empty due to the chill of the fall season. Sora was sitting criss cross and easily picking up piles of sands between his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora hey!\", Greg called jogging up before taking a seat to relax next to the giant knee clad in dark pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spiky brunette smiled as he awkwardly chuckled. \"Oh hey Greg, sorry i kinda wanted to see more of New York. I guess i didn't realize how much i travel at this size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory sighed as he regained his breath. \"Its..ok i come here by foot a lot so I'm use to the walk. Plus it's only natural to wanna explore this new world. Are you ok?\", the tiny asked noticing the thoughtful look on the giant's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora nodded and smiled as he looked out at the sun reflecting on the ocean. \"Yeah this spot just reminds me of home. Me and my friends Kairi and Riku grew up on a place called Destiny islands it was like this beach...well bigger of course hehe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory looked out at the ocean seeing sea lions hop up on some of the rocks. \"You miss them a lot huh. I know it might not be the same but when i was in middle school my best friend had to move away. I wanted to give her my number but i never put it in her goodbye letter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny pattes Sora's knee. \"People might get separated but...you still have the memories of them. Keep them strong and they'll bring you back to your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora grinned before giving a sharp nod. \"Yeah your right! I'm not gonna give up on reuniting with them i swear on it!\", jumping up had Gregory bounce into the air before landing with a yelp. \"Opps sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg sighed smiling. \"Its cool, still getting use to that size. Anyways the pizzas suppsed to be here in 30 minutes and i spent 20 walking. You mind giving me a lift back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora nodded eagerly reaching down he scooped the tiny into his palm. Walking back over the trail of giant footprints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon...</span></div></div>",

Looking up towards the road, Greg's eyes bulged as he saw the huge truck headed their way! \"Oh crap! Hide, hide!\" Greg yelped up at Sora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What for?\" Sora asked innocently with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we let the delivery guy or anyone see you...people'll freak out!\" Greg warned. \"Oh...OOoooh...\" Sora nodded firmly and crawled behind the house, keeping low. The large delivery truck came up the driveway, the delivery boy might've been suspicious about the hundreds of pizzas order...if he didn't know Greg personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delivery boy's name was Andy, he was Greg's best friend. Parking the truck, Andy got out of the driver's seat. \"You having a party or something?\" Andy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...nothing like that.\" Greg said nervously as he fumbled for his bank card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So I guess you'll be eating pizza for a few weeks...or months.\" Andy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure.\" Greg answered shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're acting kinda nervous. Is something up?\" Andy asked suspiciously. Greg gulped, \"N-nervous? Me? No..nothing's wrong.\" Greg said with a nervous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sora was trying to pop his shoes off. His feet might've been a lot bigger than normal...but they were sweaty and a little sore from that walk! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to keep it down, he finally popped the footwear off. \"Ahhh...oop!\" Sora let out a booming sigh and then clamped his hand over his mouth...remembering he was supposed to be hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently placing the footwear down, still emitting steam from within their depths. Sora rested his feet on their heels and let his gargantuan, pink and very meaty feet breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora grinned as he decided to compare his foot's size to the house.</span></div></div>",

Andy rose an eyebrow as he gathered his own stack. \"You sure you're ok man? You seem kinda on edge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory awkwardly chuckled as he led to way to the front patio where he began placing the boxes. \"Yep couldn't be better! Jusst really feelin these next few months of pizzas haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy was about to question further when a bitter stench suddenly hit his nose, it smelt like body odor. The strong scent was hitting in warm waves and had a putrid...cheese smell? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh dude did something die in your house!\", the pizza man said plugging his nose as the thick smell clogged his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing into his fist, Gregory widened his eyes as he smelled the odorous wind. He had his share of used socks and this definitely was the foot cheese sweat you get from worn/baking your feet in shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Damn that must be Sora, geez who knew he stunk that much!\"</i>, Gregory panicked as hiding the giant was even more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh well you know now that my folks aren't here I've kinda been leaving my socks around!\", he quickly blurted out coughing as he breathed in the putrid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy looked unimpressed. \"Ok there is no way your socks would be that <i>cough!</i> bad. Look i can call someone to take over my shift while i check whatevers making that smell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg put his hand on his friend's chest to stop him. \"NO! Uh...it's fine I'll go check you just keep bringing out the pizzas k!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving him a chance to respond, Gregory jogged around his house. He coughed as the sweaty smell of putrid cheese odor grew stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora what happe-MPH!\", the question was cut off as Greg turning the corner directly ran into a wall of warm and sweaty heel. Like a speck, Gregory was absolutely tiny compared to the looming stompers with smeared sweat drops falling like buckets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory groaned as he was face first in the warm sole, his nose directly smelling the bitter cheddar funk. What's worse is like glue the sweat had him stuck to the warm stinky foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny couldn't yell as he risk tasting the seemingly endless sweat shedding from the feet. The warm bitter stench squelched out as Sora flexed his huge feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly vanished, in the blink of an eye, the whole city had been wiped off the map as if it was never there in the first place. Theories started appearing all over the Internet as to what exactly happened to the city. Everything from Aliens to Demons and even secret government experiments were blamed, but none of them had any concrete evidence to back them up. To this day, no one really knows what had happened to this Unnamed City. No one, except a certain blue-haired scientist......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma had stopped for a short breath during the final rounds of her jogging in the morning, wiping her head she look down at her watch. \"One lap left....\" She said to herself before she started back. She had started doing these shortly after Bulla had been born as she had gotten out of shape while she was pregnant and, well, she had a new \"hobby\" that was more enjoyable when she was all hot and covered in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into her room, Bulma checked what everyone else was doing to make sure she wouldn't be disturbed during her \"fun\" \"Okay.... Mom's watching Bulla today, Trunks went to go play with Goten and Marron, and Vegeta....\" Bulma sighed in frustration. \"Of course He's training. What else does that Meathead of a Saiyan do?\" Bulma said while pushing a couple of buttons on a hidden console in the wall. \"If he won't \"play\" with me, I guess I'll have to do it myself!\" A panel in the wall slid open to reveal a hidden room! \"Welp time to see how my \"subjects\" are doing.\" Bulma said with a sly smirk on her face. She had made a bunch of these kind of rooms to hid some of her more... questionable activities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step into the room she saw her newest \"project\" in all it's glory. An entire city that had been shrunken! Originally it was small enough to be held in Bulma's hand, thats how she moved it with no one noticing. Now it had been regrown to big enough for her to still have fun with.<br>\r\nBulma grinned as she slipped her jogging shoes off and smelt one of them \"Whew! That smells awful, it's perfect!\"She said with a mischievous grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed the shoe into the street and watched the tiny people reacted to the disgusting footwear. Some ran, some started vomiting on the streets others just fainted. \"Aw come on guys, it's not THAT bad.\" Bulma said as she fit her other shoe on top of a round building, letting her foot stench permeate throughout it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down in front of the building,her legs creating wall so the people couldn't escape. Watching as the tiny people ran out to escape the smell, only to be hit by the source of the stench, Bulma's sock clad feet! \"Awww what's wrong guys? They're just feet, it's not anything to be scared of!\" Bulma said whilst wiggling her toes. \"Here, I'll show you just how beautiful they are!\" She started peeling her socks off, they were so soaked in sweat that they could've been wrung out and create a sizable pool of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally got them off, they were dripping in sweat, like they had been dropped into a pool. The poor people at her feet were gagging at the smel<br>\r\nl assaulting their noses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! How rude, a sexy woman like me shows you her amazing feet and you start gagging!\" Bulma said. The tinies look up a her in fear as they had learned in the past couple of months that you NEVER make Bulma mad, Bad things tend to happen to people that upset the Blue-Haired Woman. \"In fact, I'm so mad, I should just crush all of you right now!\" The people fell to their knees begging her to not kill them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welllll, I could give you guys a second chance, IF you started worshiping my feet!.\" Instantly, Bulma felt their tiny hands and tongues on her soles, as small as they were, the sensation was refreshing nonetheless. Bulma rested her back on the buildings behind her and closed her eyes, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh, A girl could get use to this....\" She thought to herself, Feeling some of the people stop, she opened one eye and said: \"If any of you run away, I'll stuff you all into my socks.\" afterwards, she felt them start worshiping even faster. \"Muuuch better.\" she said before closing her eyes once more........</span></div></div>",

Her feet were wet with sweat and glistening, they reeked like moldy cheese and the runts coughed and gagged on her powerful stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny people whimpered and sobbed at this situation, they wished they could escape this gargantuan wicked scientist who had kidnapped them. She was a complete titan compared to them...in total control...and she loved it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...my feet are so BIG compared to you maggots!\" Bulma thundered, it was clear she was digging this power rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her toys, she noticed some of them trying to stealthily sneak away from her. \"Oh? And just where do you think you're going?\" <br>\r\nThe runaways froze in fear, they knew the jig was up and they had lost all hope of getting away from this mad scientist, Before they could even react her hand had already scooped them up and had brought them to her face. \"It seems you don't appreciate my lovely feet enough.....\" Bulma said, her perceiving eyes looking down on them. \"Maybe you'll like them if you get up close and personal with them!\" A mischievous smile grew on her face as she put two of them in between her big toe and the toe next to it, one for each foot. The smell was amplified much more when they were even closer to her massive toes, it almost smelled rotten! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma gazed down on the final runaway as they cowered in fear on her hand. \" Hmmmm, Shall I do something special with you? Or should I let you join your lucky friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please, I-I'm sorry-\" The poor shivering boy tried to plead, but Bulma was already struck by an idea...a really cruel and nasty one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....I'm pretty sweaty...and just for you tinies I didn't wear deodorant for my jog!\" Bulma bragged and crinkled her nose as some of her b.o. wafted up her nose as she placed the tiny on her knee for safekeeping...while she stripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma stripped off her shirt and revealed her voluptuous and still very nicely rounded breasts in a tight bra. \"Ahhh..that air feels good...now...time to lift these arms.\" Bulma plucked the tiny up and lifted an arm slowly and seductively to reveal her rancid and glistening pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's eyes had started watering as soon as she had lifted her long slender arms, it would have been attractive if it wasn't for the abhorrent stench emanating from it.He could almost see the stink coming off of the pit, it looked as though the air itself was being distorted by the stench, either that or it was steam being released from the confines of her armpit. He attempted to wiggle out of Bulma's hand but her grip was too strong. \"A little eager aren't we? Then I'll skip the foreplay and let you get right to it!\" Bulma said before pushing the small bug right into her pit, pressing him right into the middle of the pit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the boy had ever thought of what hell was like, then this was infinitely worse than anything he could have imagined. The pit was so soaked in sweat that he was coated almost immediately, he had made the mistake of opening his mouth to scream as she pushed him leading to him getting a mouthful of the vile liquid. He reflexly gagged as more and more sweat forced its way down his throat. The Wicked Scientist wasn't satisfied with just pushing him in though, she began rubbing him up and down her armpit, making even more sweat cover him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped moving her finger and moved away.... only to find that the sweat had stuck him to her flesh! \"HAHAHAHAH! Thats the Funniest thing I've ever seen! You're so small and pathetic that you actually got stuck!\" Bulma said whilst wiping away a tear. \"Ahhhh, I've had a lot of great ideas but Shrinking this city was easily my best! I think I'll let you stew in there while I continue my fun.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her arm trapped the boy in a voidlike darkness. The stench was getting worse by the second. \"God, it smells like something, no SEVERAL things have died in here!\" Considering her newfound hobby, that assumption wasn't too far off.<br>\r\n\"I gotta get out of here, or else this smell is going to.....going to..... The rancid, almost tangible smell of rotten eggs and molding bread had begun invading the boys body, soaking his skin, flowing through his mouth, seeping into his ears, and burning his nose. I gotta get out.... I gotta ge... I....I... Eventually, the oder had invaded his very mind..... The boy stopped thinking shortly afterwards...........</span></div></div>",

Why do I have to go with Jaco to get my present?!\" Trunks whined. The young boy was dressed in his martial artist garb with a sleeveless blue-green gi and matching pants as well as brown colored boots. It was a hot day so his casual outfit of a hoodie and such weren't warranted...plus the young man had been being a bit lazy with his hygiene lately..something about wanting to 'smell manly'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma didn't even want to imagine how long he'd gone without changing his usually gag-inducing socks. However, she believed she had a solution and given that it was the day after Trunks' birthday...she'd prepared a special surprise that not only he'd enjoy but would let him stink up somewhere OTHER than her HOUSE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I told him to and that's the only way you're going to get it.\" Bulma sighed as the mother and son duo went out to the backyard where Jaco was waiting beside his Galactic Patrol issued ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why I have to let your kid stink up my special elite spaceship.\" Jaco the Galactic Patrolman pouted. \"Because if you don't I'll tell Vegeta!\" Bulma snapped and clobbered the strange man over the head with her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow ow ow fine fine!\" Jaco winced and rubbed the lump on his head as Trunks snickered. The half-saiyan and elite patrolman got into the cramped flying saucer and took off to the coordinates Bulma had given them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So spill it! What's the big surprise?!\" Trunks demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh..fine....your mom asked me to drop you off at a planet of criminals that I'm supposed to be apprehending or defeating...but you're going to go all kaiju there.\" Jaco casually stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean...?\" Trunks asked with a raised eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meaaan...I'm gonna give you a device that lets you grow into a giant...however much you want...your ma said that way you can stink up everything and not her house.\" Jaco explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks' eyes widened and he grinned a boyish grin, \"REALLY?! This sounds awesome! Hit the turbo! Let's go let's go!\" Trunks cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at the rather seedy looking sprawling city-planet...Trunks was dropped off by Jaco and given what appeared to be some complex tv remote. \"Just call me on your phone when you're done....\" Jaco said uncaringly as he took off in the ship...leaving Trunks all alone in the scum and villainy filled planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, he thinks I'm gonna just call him to take me home? No way, I'm going to stink up a LOT more than just this dump.\" Trunks thought deviously as he  examined the Size Remote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid...ain't it past your bedtime?\" Trunks looked up in the direction of the voice and saw he was being surrounded by thuggish alien beings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...you might get mugged..or worse.\" A second alien sneered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks just smirked and pressed the 'grow' option on the remote...</span></div></div>",

You dorks were acting so tough a little while ago! I guess you're the type who likes to pick on people smaller than you? Sucks for you that the tables just turned!\" Trunks taunted them with a devilish grin. The cracking of bones was heard followed by a crunch, Trunks blinked and saw a tiny series of blood splats on his bicep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft!

He sighed deeply and tossed the footwear carelessly on a row of slummy houses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thaaat's the stuff....whew...I don't think mom's gonna like doing laundry when I decide to change these things...\" Trunks joked as he gripped his socks and began to slowly and almost seductively peel them off of his thick and meaty feet.</span></div></div>",

A wet, swampy, stank oven that you were trapped in for who knows how long.

You stink!\" Gwen huffed at Ben who was sitting in the booth across from her. \"No way! I was sitting here first!\" Ben argued.

I'm not an alien...I'm just...gettin' bigger! Awesome!\" Ben cheered as soon he was over 60ft. tall and towering over the nearby buildings. \"I'd like to see Gwen mess with me now!\" Ben chuckled as he went to cause some mischief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting a carnival, he grinned wickedly as he stomped towards it. The ticket booth guy looked out and Ben squatted down with a raised eyebrow. \"Am I tall enough to ride?\" Ben snickered and stepped right over the turnstile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground quaked with his footsteps, and Ben already had an idea on something pretty funny to do. He plopped down on his rear, and began prying off his shoes. \"Grrgh!\" Ben grunted, his voice causing the people around to cover their ears before..with a moist pop his shoes came off to reveal hole-ridden and sopping wet socked feet.</span></div></div>",

The hero looked up as a shadow came over him but had no time to react before the hands crashed down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh to easy\u201d Ben said as he slapped the hero into the ground at his feet with the same action one would use to swat a fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you've won? I'll show you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually I think this fight is over. Since I just swatted the fly to the ground I really don't want to give it the chance to fly away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoo..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen lifted his white and black sneaker clad foot off the ground and moved it over the hero and brought it down immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero thinking quickly threw up his arms and caught the foot, grunting as this drove him into a kneeling position in the ground. Thankfully he was strong enough to keep the foot from ending him brutally, just barely though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm you're made of some sturdy stuff huh?\u201d  Ben asked looking down at his foot feeling the slightest bit of resistance under the sneaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, I told you I'll -\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo bad I'm not even putting any effort into it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen started to press down harder and harder on the super hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grunted as his face pooled with sweat and turned a dark shade of red. The pressure being forced on him locked down his lungs stopping his breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight <i>littleman</i>!\u201d Ben laughed and twisted the soul of his foot into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the last thing the hero was expecting as when the foot started twitching his grip on the hard rubber sole of the shoe was ripped free and with a final shout! He was driven to the ground below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gave a wide grin as he felt the hero flatten under his sneaker with nice long <i>Squiiish</i>! Followed by several popping and crunching noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, that was fun!\u201d He said as he lifted his foot to inspect is work\u2026 Only to find his entire sole splattered with blood and the hero\u2019s remains. \u201cWhoa.. okay that is a little gross even to me, oh well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout looking down he stomps his foot back into a clear spot on the ground and scrapes it back several times to get the \u2018gunk\u2019 off it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot noticing the tiny kid only coming up to and inch on him right where he stomped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n//////////////////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young kid had decided to watch as his superhero did battle with the giant monster. However upon seeing his hero slapped into the ground he decides to go to him. Completely oblivious to the true danger before him he runs  forward toward the to fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe runs parallel with the giants left foot to get to his hero when the giant brings his foot down on the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe freezes in shock and is unable to move as he has to watched his hero get pounded into a giant red smear before him. He watches as the giant lifts his foot up but all the kid focused on was the unrecognizable smear of the city hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing to focused he didn\u2019t notice the shadow that was cast over him at first. He glanced up with wide terror filled eyes at the heel of the monsters shoe descending upon him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A scream rose through his throat and mouth but was never even voiced before the shoe slammed into him with a quakening <i>BOOOM!</i> Bursting his body like a grape. Thankfully it was fast and he didn\u2019t feel any pain as his life was removed from the world by the giant Ben Tennyson with a quick <i>squiiish</i>,  Which went unnoticed to Ben as he was more focused on what to do next while he scraped shoe clean to notice the small life he accidentally ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay where should I go now..?\u201d Ben thought as he scratched his head and finished scraping the guts off his shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sleeveless delinquent was still getting a hang on it..but it was better than starving and it seemed to sate his growling stomach like it was actual food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a palm on his stomach, he scowled as his belly growled. The alley he was currently in was around the corner of a deli.

Tossing a tiny pebble, it impacted the side of the man's head harmlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grumpy man turned and spotted Kevin, \"Huh?

Deciding to play it safe, Kevin didn't drain ALL of the man's energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's too fat to haul a body somewhere..besides, I don't need the cops snooping around.\" Kevin casually said to himself as he yanked the doggy bag up and opened it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plethora of heavenly smells greeted Kevin's nostrils. \"Cheese fries AND a burger!

Good to know your not too stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrushihara set both of his feet on their heels, the plump sweaty soles emitted a vinegar and cheese like stench as drops were smeared over the large feet.

They were enormous, even at his current normal size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well from what I felt and saw at my tiny size...they were pretty soft and smushy. And...and your toes are like..perfectly rounded.\" Hiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrushihara laughed, \"If I didn't know better I'd say you're getting a foot fetish, little one!\" He grinned toothily and flexed his big toe, crossing his foot over his knee so it was right next to Hiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some...extra cheese for that pizza?\" Urushihara cooed.</span></div></div>",

Looks and feet both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...ok master.\", Hiro meekly said putting his pizza away and turning to face the large fuming foot next to him. Grasping the large foot, Hiro lowered his face to the sweaty sole, getting a blast of cheddary fumes to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrushihara raised an eyebrow as he smiled amused, the purple haired boy sighed as Hiro started rubbing circles in his heel and ball. \"Ohh nice work squirt, if i hadn't gone in for that interview I'd guess you were a professional foot rubber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro awkwardly blushed as he drew his nose closer to his master's demonic toes. The funky cheese stench was stronger then ever and he spot the other linty jam in the gaps. Taking a big sniff Hiro inhaled the intoxicating odorous fumes from the gunky toes, he felt his nostrils burn as the think smell tingled his nose hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like the smell? Only the best cheese for my servent.\", Urushihara teasingly patted Hiro's cheek with his toes, lightly rubbing his toes under the human's eyes Urushihara whipped any remnants of tears. \"Let's get rid of those, i don't any lame tears on my human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro smiled before sticking his tongue out pressing it into the slimy crevice of the toes. The warm gooey cheese scooped up onto his tongue, the warm cheese filled his mouth. Warm goo was scooped up as it coated the walls of the toes, swallowing the cheese warm cheddar residue filled his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrushihara licked his lips as he felt the licking to his toes, not only was the feeling of power higher then ever. But the eager service felt amazing! Not to mention having willing servitude...was pretty cool to.</span></div></div>",

Before he could open up his door, he found himself shrunk once more. \"Heh, thanks for the pizza and the foot worship runt!\" Urushihara boomed from behind him. Hiro found himself enveloped in the sticky, sweaty palm of his NEET master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrushihara had popped his feet back into his steamy footwear. He gave a toothy grin as he opened up the passenger side door and stepped out into the evening air. Uncurling his fingers as he shut the car door, he grinned smugly as he saw his little human. The runt seemed to have given up hope of EVER escaping...but in the same vein had already accepted his role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So since you treated your master so well...I think I'll let you ride in my pocket on the walk home.\" Urushihara declared. Being a demon general in Ente Isla had taught him at the very least to think strategically. Not to say he was going to go soft on the bug-boy, but he knew when to ease up..especially after someone beneath him was well behaved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thank you, master..\" Hiro said gratefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah..\" Urushihara waved him off before depositing him inside his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun had now set and by the time Urushihara made it to the Villa Rosa it was pitch black. \"I just hope Maou and Ashiya don't yell at me for being so late getting here.\" Urushihara whined as he went up the steps and approached the apartment door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? What's this?\" Urushihara noticed a sticky note on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Urushihara, we went away on E. I. business. The place is yours for the next two weeks. NO ORDERING THINGS ONLINE!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple haired bum gained a wide grin. Two weeks...all to himself and no having to sneak his puny servant around? E.I. was definitely code for Ente Isla, so it must've been something important and they had to leave on short notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be amazing...\" Urushihara chuckled as he entered the single room apartment.

Urushihara hummed as he looked at Hiro, looming over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple headed NEET thought over the fun he could have not having to worry about his king and fellow general being there. He could browse his computer and sandwich his servent between his rank soles but he had already had a lot of foot fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say squirt any ideas on where you should worship?\", the NEET jokingly asked, sure his human wouldn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Hiro rubbed his chin as the large thumb and finger squeezed him. While he was growing an admiration for his master he didn't want to seem bossy out of fear. He soon noticed the underarm of the purple and white shirt, there was a dampened patch of fabric where the pit was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping Hiro put on an awkward smile. \"W-well you haven't shown me your armpits master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrushihara rose an eyebrow before smugly grinning. \"Huh your right! I had you sniffing my cheese that i forgot about my pits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro was soon set on the thigh of the general, putting him in proximity of the large musky crotch. Urushihara soon grew a teasing smile as he grabbed the bottom of his shirt and pulled it off. A wave of B.O flowed out as the sweaty shirt peeled off his sticky skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny human blushed as his master's slim build towered over, Urushihara smirked as he plucked up his human and layed back on the floor. Putting his arm behind his head, Urushihara let his wide and sweaty pit breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrushihara's pit oozed out a think and sour stench, thoroughly ripe from his neglected showers. The purple hairs were greasy and matted down by the sheer amount of sweat shedding from the glands. Hiro paled as he could already smell the overwhelming odor flowing out, a mix of fear and excitement filled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright little one, i think your mighty master needs his pits to be worshipped. Pamper them like my feet and they'll keep you warm hehe.\", Urushihara chuckled as he set Hiro in front his wide pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro coughed as the sour odor utterly consumed him in it's raunchy scent. Still he found the smell...sweet strangely, like an onion making him tear up. Walking into the aura of musky stench, Hiro reached out and pressed his hands to the greasy wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to rub in circles, Hiro also made sure to take deep whiffs of the powerful stench smiling as the odor made him feel...safe. It showed how mighty his master was, how strong Urushihara was to have power over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrushihara licked his lips as he felt the tiny massages to his greasy pits, feeling even mighter that his sour odor could overpower a human. He also felt Hiro pressing his nose in to take sniffs, he grinned amused as his once fearful toy was know like a cute servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your enjoying yourself, i know i am.\", Urushihara smirked as he stretched his arm getting it to squelch out more sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro almost beamed as the sour stench increase drowning him in the foul odor more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon....</span></div></div>",

Your master gave you an order!\" Urushihara roared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro let out a frightened squeak and burrowed his face in the greasy pit.

As he approached the door to the studio, Hatsume burst out and greeted him enthusiastically...startling him of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO! FINALLY YOU'VE COME TO TEST OUT MY NEW BABY!\" Hatsume yelled. \"Gaaagh!\" Midoriya yelled and staggered back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? Test?\" Midoriya had arranged this meeting with Hatsume...but she'd not mentioned any sort of test!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! It's to power up your quirk! Come here!\" The pink haired female dragged him inside quickly. Before Midoriya was a large device that resembled some kind of microscope in structure. On its side was a keypad and monitor, it had a glowing rounded end that was aimed directly at Midoriya as he was placed on a platform that was marked with a bullseye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uh...w-what's going on?\" Midoriya stammered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This baby right here...\" Hatsume patted the side panel of the large device, \"Has been crafted in secret from Mr. Powerloader! It's meant to combine essences of various known quirks...into another person! All I have to do is select a random quirk to zap you with...and then do the zapping...and you'll get the benefits of having TWO unique quirks! It's GENIUS I tell you! This could change everything!\" Hatsume rambled and laughed maniacally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidoriya sweatdropped, not liking the look of this ray..or the thought of being electrocuted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I just need something to boost the quirk I already-\" Midoriya began to protest gently, only for Hatsume to shriek: \"STAND STILL! HERE WE GO!\" And pull a lever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly a green beam of energy came out of the ray and zapped Midoriya, making him flail comically and yell as he was electrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine sparked and began to smoke, \"M-my baby! No no no no!\" Hatsume hit the emergency shut off as the ray's loud rumbling died down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is all that racket!?\" Power Loader demanded as he entered the room. \"Hatsume! What did I tell you about testing your experiments on other students?! And what is THAT thing?!\" Power Loader demanded of Hatsume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh...my head...\" Midoriya got up off the ground, dazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've come to ME first, Midoriya! Or at least informed me you had a death wish!\" Power Loader snapped at the green haired boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry...I'll be going now...\" Midoriya said, feeling a tad funny. \"You need the nurse? Nah...you're fine.\" Power Loader shrugged off the feeling...it was the boy's own fault for letting this happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, Midoriya was walking to class...it was still early so most of his fellow students hadn't arrived yet.

Please wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku continued his sprint, giving panicked glances up at the ceiling and watching it inch closer. He also felt his uniform begin to tighten and heard some rips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku widened his eyes at the familiar figure up ahead. \u201cAizawa-Sensei watch out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tired hero looked up hearing his student, only to feel the ground shake and a large wind blast him. Looking over his shoulder at the large fleeing figure, he sighed before fishing out his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku ran into the back of the school, having to bend over to get outside. Stopping for a breather, Izuku took in his current state. His uniform was torn with the jacket unbuttoned and the shirt looking ready to burst. His pants cut off at the knee and squeezed his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely Izuku didn\u2019t just get big in height. His muscles seem to be more bulky then what they used to be, with his biceps, pecs, and thighs looking bigger. Patting his stomach, he felt what appeared to be a eight pack. The tingling sensation return and Izuku rushed over to a groove of trees in the distance. As he got closer, there were more rips and by the time he got to the groove, his chin was above the trees and getting taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes felt tight and made Izuku cringe as the tight fabric squeezed. The pain stopped and the giant sighed. But wait, if the pain was caused by the clothes. Izuku looked down with a burning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin miles everyone heard a loud embarrassed echo.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\u201cI must say Midoriya-kun, this is quite the predicament.\u201d, said principal Nezu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathered outside were the principal, a few teachers, and all of 1-A. All of them were looking shocked at the same sight, The top of Izuku\u2019s head sheepishly peeking out from behind the vegetation. In front of the spectators laid the remains of Izuku\u2019s uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything that can be used to.....cover young Midoriya.\u201d, said All Might with a hindered smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it had been a challenge, something was given to Midoriya. A few white covers were secured as much as possible by Sero\u2019s tape before Izuku slowly picked the makeshift garment up. The ground shook as the giant put the covering on while trying to to stand up. Eventually the clothing slipped on, only a little tight and getting a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked in awe as Izuku stood up and covered them in a shadow. The towering giant had certainly changed. His muscles matched that of his mentor\u2019s, being large and thick. The white sheet garment acted as a pair of underwear, squeezing a large bulge and doing nothing to covering a large and firm butt. All in all, Izuku seemed to have grown to 200 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling spiked Izuku, it wasn\u2019t the growing tingling like before. It was a strange excitement, from seeing everyone in front of him as dots on the ground. Particularly seeing Kacchan looking up at him, not with a pissed off look but with a small blush as the same with his other classmates, girl and boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little adventurous, Izuku bounced his large pecs. The results, making everyone\u2019s blush darken.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nThe school day eventually ended. While everyone was going home, Izuku stayed where he was. It was decided that Izuku should stay at U.A for the night intill a solution was reached. Luckily his mother was out of the city for a week so he didn\u2019t have to worry her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku sat where he previously hide. All around him were large foot prints and even butt marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened do the giant now?</span></div></div>",

Soon the food piles began to dwindle, and Midoriya was still going!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez...\" Kaminari muttered, Bakugo was fuming beside him at this whole situation.</span></div></div>",

Everyone was small to him...even his hero and idol All-Might!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shivered as his bulge grew beneath the already revealing garment. It was also a hot night and he felt gigantic drops of sweat slowly leak down from his underarms...plopping to the concrete below with a series of splashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggling his toes, he felt how moist those plump digits were...especially the crevices. Since he'd literally sat out all day in the hot sun...the young titan was noticeably surrounded by a malodorous cloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, that thought excited him even more! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began to reach down beneath his makeshift covering towards his crotch, sudden yells from the parking lot caught his attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerking his hand out from his musky and erect member, he looked down towards the sound.

The man gasped as the sole covered his sky. Noticable drops of sweat could be seen dripping off and hitting the ground like raindrops. Dirt stuck to the sweaty flesh and flew off as Izuku wiggled his toes excitingly. The man was about to question him but was silenced as the sole began to lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KID WA-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man couldn't finish as the stomper crushed him into the ground. Izuku made sure to be careful, he didn't want to damage the man right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Izuku brought his foot back up, it was shown the mugger stuck to his sole! The tiny body was squashed into the flesh and was trying to dislodge from the smelly foot. Izuku giggled as he felt the struggles tickling his sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mugger soon freed himself and fell back to the ground. He spit onto the ground, he had gotten a mouthful of the sweat after being encased in the flesh. A cheesy smell now stuck to his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he looked up to give a piece of his mind, he greeted by the descending sole again. This time the toes were closing in on him. As his body was squished again the big and second toe spread, allowing him a view of the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku leaned down and looked down at the face from his toe crevice. \"L-ook kid! I promise i wont do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greenette shook his head before smirking slightly. Clenching his toes and ignoring the pained yelp, izuku dropped the villian between his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man only had a second before the ground shook violently as Izuku sat his homogenous rear onto the ground. He then saw the teen eargerly grin before placing his hands on his knees.

Rubbing the sweating flesh and getting covered in more filth. The flesh from the heel up was rather smooth and easy to put his fingers into. The heel was very rough and had the most dirt covering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku closed his eyes and hummed in delight. He felt great, not just from the foot rub but the returned feeling. Izuku had stopped a villianus act and in return now had the villian squirming before him like a bug.

Make your master feel good~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rubbing continued with a occasional lick to add. With all this serving, Izuku may not be ready to give up Tanaka when the time comes.

No socks had been made..unfortunate for any tiny villains he'd come across! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!

Not to mention I've made sure it doesn't leave the victim-I mean subject...completely in the buff in the process!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, now you won't be able to show off your car sized junk for the ladies!\" Mineta teased Denki, \"S-shuddup!\" Denki yelled at the short grape-headed boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not interested...\" Jiro twirled one of her ear-jacks around her finger, trying to hide her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Hatsume was already powering up her device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! No, wait!\" Denki yelled out, everyone else had vacated the room in preparation for the sparky boy's growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIRE!\" Hatsume had set it to 200ft just as Izuku now was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energy enveloped Denki...and he started to fill the room up with his rapidly expanding form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-whoaaaaah!\"  Denki's thankfully clothed rear burst through the wall directly in front of Jiro.</span></div></div>",

Aizawa looked back at the sudden noise as the area around him darkened. The underground hero sighed annoyed before fishing his phone out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the dust cleared a large figure stood up to the full height of 200ft. Denki coughed before looking down at his cupped palms, all his friends fit perfectly in the center. Jirou was looking down at the palm to hide her red face, Mineta looked shocked, Ashido seem to be excited about the sudden growth, and Mei was looking over the side of his hand with a horrified expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki looked down with a dreaded face. The machine was now a pile of flattened metal beneath his brown shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...sorry Hatsume-San.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaminari-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond and black haired giant looked down to see his teacher standing before the wreaked building. Smiling sheepishly, Denki squatted down and placed his friends on the ground. Aizawa looked over to Mei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened now?\", he asked annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei simply smiled. \"I was trying to figure out a way to return Midoriya to normal. I created a new size device and decided to test it on Kaminari! Unfortunately he turned my baby into scrap metal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizawa facepalmed. \"Well first the school will have to undergo reconstruction, but in the meantime I've called up All Might. Kaminari just wait here intill he and Midoriya return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki nodded before slowly stepping out of the building, making the ground shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow he's like a tower!\", Ashido called up in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizawa however, simply sighed. \"Just what we need another giant, be glad this one's not nude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirou covered her face. \"Y-yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Meanwhile-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku stood next to a building with a blush on his face. Down below numerous people were crowded around his shoes and taking pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an easy day so far for the greenette and All Might. The No.1 hero would draw out any villains that were causing havoc, only for Izuku to snatch them up in his fist. The criminals were given appropriate punishement, simple robbers were handed over to the police. However, a human trafficker spent an hour in Izuku's shoe, many onlookers cheered at the giant's punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, All Might had to do business with the police. In the meantime Izuku waited for his mentor, all while being admired by the citizens. He may like being a giant, but his embarrassment would never go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Giant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku looked down, among the crowd of adults a small child was at the front waving up at him. The greenette smiled and bend over, ( minding the building behind him ) laying his palm in front of the little one. The child crawled onto his fingers and looked in awe as Izuku brought him to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child was a eight year old with black hair, wearing an All Might Jacket. Izuku gave a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy gave a big grin. \"Hi! Your really big and strong, is this your quirk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku sheepishly rubbed the back of his head. \"Um...not exactly, but what matters is that I use this size to stop villians!\", Izuku finished with a imitation of All Might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy grinned and brought out a notebook. \"Can I have your Autograph please?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku sweatdropped. \"I uh...can't really sign that but how about a picture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child's grin didn't falter as he took out his phone and turned around. He positioned it to where he and Izuku fit in. After the picture the boy hugged Izuku's finger, the giant smiled warmly before lowering the boy back to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blush returned as he realized that everyone was recording! 'Ah this is going to be all over!', Izuku internally panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the villains were turned in Izuku began to make his way back to U.A, All Might sat on his palm de-transformed. Izuku was red as his mentor praised his actions today.</span></div></div>",

The hot steamy soles released it's cheesy smell into the air and blasted the tiny trio with the hot smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku hummed as he wiggled his toes, he was eager to have some fun. But he was even more eager to get Denki involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright so holding them to your feet is already a fun way to show who's boss!\", The greenette explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki nodded and using his left hand, popped off his brown shoes. The blond and black haired boy's socks where not on the same stink level of Izuku's, but there were some damp sweat spots. He then pulled off both of his socks as well. As opposed to Izuku's, Denki's feet had a more salty and vinegar like kick to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku smiled and nodded. \"Yep and you can furthur this by stepping on them. So Kaminari-Kun, could you put one down please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki nodded before loosing his grip and sliding the leader out of his hold onto the ground. The blond villian blinked before noticing the area darkening, looking up only to be squashed into the grund by Izuku's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki watched in fascination as the villian was mashed beneath his friend's foot. After grinding his foot a bit Izuku turned to him. \"Now you try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki grinned before deciding to try something. Letting go of the remaining trio, Denki lowered his foot and found to his surprise that both fit under his sole!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to apply pressure and rub his foot against the bugs beneath him. Denki sighed, the villains squirming felt amazing and boosted the feeling of power he had. Knowing that with one step he could squish someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you're great at this already Kaminari-Kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki grinned as he applyed more pressure, subjecting the bugs to his vinegar sole. \"Yeah well this is really a lot of fun Midoriya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku smirked. \"Hey, wanna play a game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, what game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greenette scooted back, making the ground shake with his large butt. After stopping, Izuku brought up his right foot and showed the leader now stuck to his sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna see who can get the most to stick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki smirked as he caught on to the game. \"Oh your on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiveling and making a crater with his rump, Denki then brought up his right foot. The two villains embedded in his sole as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villains could only turn thier head from the marks thier bodies made in the giant's soles. The sight that greeted them, the opposite sole coming towards them at fast spe-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMOOSH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two opposite feet slammed into each other. Izuku's were a little bigger, but Denki's were a little wider. The two giants applied pressure on both sides, mashing the trio up and coating them in a mix of cheese and vinegar. Izuku giggled at the squirming while Denki gave a toothy smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the two teens separated thier feet to look at the result of thier foot sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa Kaminari-Kun, you got all three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki's sole had the two villians squished into the same position as before, but in addition was the leader from Izuku's foot placed in the middle. The electric student grinned proudly as he looked at his success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku soon crawled over and grabbed Denki's other foot. \"Hmm you don't have as much sweat as me, but your feet are really plump. So there must be a lot of flesh to squish with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, guess i'm a born stomper!\", Denki grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was next for the giants?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Standing in front of them, seemingly not bothered by their foot stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hey All Might\", Izuku grinned as well as Denki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boy, I've come because I have a mission for you and Kaminari!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two blinked in surprise as Denki spoke. \"Huh what do you mean All Might?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero jumped up and soared until he landed on Izuku's shoulder. \"A villian hideout, responsible for kidnapping people with passive quirks and even those without quirks has been found. You two were requested as the investigators believe you will deliver the right justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku felt his fist clench. The idea of being kidnapped for being quirkless hit a little too close home for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki smirked and zapped a small volt out of his index finger. \"No problem All Might! You up for a little bug catching Midoriya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku calmed his anger before smiling and nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Might laughed and jumped down to the ground. \"Excellent! I'll give you two the directions right away. But first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giants looked as a crowd of support course students walked out carrying another giant pair of garments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The support department went ahead and crafted new clothes for you young Kaminari!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki grinned as he reached down and picked up the garments. Like Izuku, the garments consisted of a tank top and short gym shorts. However, both were black and the tank top had white lightning bolts like his costume. Additionally a pair of black slip on shoes were provided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks little guys!\", Denki smiled at the students, causing them to blush as the giant started to slip off his grey jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then boys, I've put the directions to the hideout in this holographic pad. Once you arrive make sure to apprehend the villians and rescue any captives.\", All Might explained as he laid a large pad down that was still small to the two giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nodded and watched as All Might wished then luck and dashed off before his time ran out. The students quickly ran off as they saw Denki begin to unbutton his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down, Izuku peeled off the trio from Denki's plump sole. The three villians coughed as they were freed from the salty sole and sweated from the heat. The greenete smirked as he used his other hand to reach for his sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep these bugs secure, make sure they get more punishment!\", Denki laughed as he watched his friend drop the tinies into his damp sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Smashers were once again imprisoned in a cage of foot odor and watched in terror as the giants sweaty sole entered the sock. Izuku hummed as he felt the bodies squished into his sole. His giant sole engulfed the three as he slipped his red shoe on and stepped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Midoriya, I'm gonna need to stand to put these pants on. Could you cover me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku blushed as he looked over at his classmates. Denki had put on the tank top and let his muscles show. While Denki's muscles didn't grow like Izuku's, the lightning boy had large and firm muscles being squeezed by the clothing and showed the bottom of his abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....sure!\", Izuku quickly said as he stood up, shaking the ground and turning to block his friend from the view of those on the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he listened to the ground boom as Denki changed into the gym shorts provided, Izuku saw a few people left on the street looking up in awe as his hulking form rose into the sky. He grinned before bouncing his enlarged pecs for them, making them blush and cheer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at his friend, Denki had put the gym shorts on as well as his shoes and previous sweaty socks. The gym shorts went mid thigh and folded around his bulge and showed his firm rump. His thighs and toned legs were showed in thier full glory. The blonde and black haired student stretched his biceps across his strong chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Midoriya, let's go bug hunting!\", Denki grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku smiled and nodded as he turned back towards the street. He carefully stepped out onto the street followed by Denki. The two giants looked down as the tiny citizens waved up at them and cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo there's another one!\"<br>\r\n\"Both are so muscular!\"<br>\r\n\"How big are they!?\"<br>\r\n\"Sit on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku blushed while Denki gave a toothy grin, the two giant teens began to walk down the nearly empty street as the sun began to set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we heading?\", Denki asked.<br>\r\nIzuku brought up the pad between his thumb and finger. \"It says the hideout is located somewhere in the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki nodded and followed, making noticable THOOMS with his steps.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nBakugou let out a mumbled string of curses as he walked down the street. The sky was orange as the sun set in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst the school called and said classes were closed for an extensive period. Then he saw the news reports of Deku fighting crime with his new giant body, resurfacing the memories of falling on his large crotch. And now, his old hag had him out late to get groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen was taken out of his brooding when he felt the ground begin to shake. Bakugou looked up and widen his eyes as he saw the sight down the road approaching and making the ground shake more violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou watched as the towering figure of Izuku stomped down the road. His eyes zoned in on his large pecs and bulge looking painted on by the little clothing. The large figure came closer and the next thing the explosive boy knew, the similar red shoes had stopped right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou looked up the colossal wall of muscles casting a shadow over him and found Izuku's signature grin pointed down at him over the pecs that slightly covered his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Kacchan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou felt his face heat up as the large voice of his rival boomed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deku...what are yo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi Midoriya wait up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond teen was cut off from his questioning when another loud voice called out and the ground began to shake again. Running around the house size shoe, Bakugou gasped as he saw Denki coming down the street also a giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you gotta slow down, I can't run after you at this size.\", Denki sighed before bring his eyes to the dot next to Izuku's foot. \"Ah hey there Bakugou! Bet I sure look different then last time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat increased in Bakugou's face as he saw Denki's muscled body looming over him too. For once in his life he felt small as he was a mere dot to the two titans before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, sorry here you can look at the directions.\", Izuku apologized while handing over the tiny (to them) tablet to Denki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'll go on ahead, see you later Bakugou!\", Denki did a small wave before stepping over the normal sized Bakugou giving him a view of his under bulge and firm butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I gotta go Kacchan, but first....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou felt the air begin to feel heavy as Izuku squatted down and made his thighs bulge and darken the shadow covering him. The blond teen saw an unfamiliar sight grace the face of his rival, a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should really be careful, if I didn't see you I may have ended up stepping on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy watched silently as Izuku rose back up to his titanic height. The giant began to follow Denki down the road and Bakugou merely watched as the muscled back and large butt disappeared into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou clenched his chest as red coloured his face. \"Step...step on me..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ash blond smacked his cheek as the thoughts plagued his mind. \"What the fuck am I thinking! Damn hag, why the hell did I have to come down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou ran down the street trying to get the thoughts of his titanic rival out of his head.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nThe two teens slowly walked through the trees that went below thier knees. They were nearing the hideout and needed to try and keep the force of thier bodies down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku and Denki crouched down before crawling over to look above the trees. A mile away (or a step to them) stood a warehouse with multiple viecheles around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warehouse had figured in lap coats and sketchy clothing. However also outside were multiple people in normal clothing. Some of them were unconscious and being carried while others looked scared as they were forced into the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne caught Izuku's attention and made him widen his eyes. A young child was wearing an All Might hoodie, had black hair, crying, and struggling as he was dragged in. It was the child Izuku had met earlier today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku felt anger boil up inside him, as he pressed his foot squishing the Smashers down harding. Denki looked concerned at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midoriya, don't worry. We'll get those guys and fish out some punishment ok.?\", he spoke as quietly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

Denki patted Midoriya on the shoulder, \"Don't worry...we just gotta make sure the hostages are saved and then we can deal with the runts.\" Denki grinned toothily, causing Midoriya to smile as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the warehouse, the scientists and armed guards were being led by Giran, the League of Villains' broker and ally. The man took a puff of his cigarette as the conscious prisoners were forced into the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiran pointed at a large shipping crate behind him, \"Get them in there. These twerps'll end up making Shigaraki reaaaal pleased once they're all turned into Nomus.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two titan teens heard this, and narrowed their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe League of Villains was involved in this...by the sound of it they'd stumbled upon the guy who supplied them with test subjects for Nomu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku, always the strategist, whispered to Denki calmly. \"Hey...let's wait til' they get them in the container...then I'll reach in and grab it to secure the hostages. Then we can deal some punishment to these villains.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki smirked toothily, \"I like your plan. Let's do it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys nodded and waited, not wanting to risk going in too soon and alerting the armed thugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the terrified hostages were all put in the shipping container, the boy who Izuku had met earlier let out a wail as the door was slid shut and locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiran took a drag on his cigarette once more and grinned, showing a gap in his front teeth: \"Wonderful. Now let's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire warehouse started to shake, interrupting the League of Villains member as the roof was suddenly tore off and a gargantuan, yet familiar...green haired youth glared inside..towering over the entire place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" One scientist yelled out before Izuku reached down and scooped up the container, lifting it easily and tearing the steel top off like a tin can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hostages squinted in the sunlight, but the boy recognized Izuku immediately! \"It's you! Mister Giant! You came to save us!\" He said with happy tears.</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile Denki crouched down besides Izuku and smirked down at the shocked villians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, scared of the big guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne scientist attempted to run to the back exit, only to be snatched up by Denki and clutched in a fist. It was soon a mere game of catching the tinies and securing them. In his right fist, Denki already had four pressed against each other. Picking up another Denki instead slit the tiny scientist between his pecs, flexing the two muscles to squish him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiran tched as he dropped his cigarette and snuffed it out with his shoe. The League of Villains had seen the reports of the giant teen, in addition to a tantrum from Shigaraki they had to move the operations of creating more Nomus to a secluded location. Only for the problem to appear right before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey haired man soon looked up only to see a giant palm filling his vision. Giran was enveloped in warm flesh as Denki trapped him in a fist and brought his body to the giant's face. The lightning hero smirked as he looked at the head sticking out of his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I think I'm correct in assuming your the leader here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiran did his best to remain passive. \"Act mighty all you want kid, I'm not gonna cough up any info.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki chuckled as he bounced his pecs. \"Oh me and Midoriya are gonna do so much more then just act!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the villains captured Denki stood up, before lifting up his large foot and stomping the warehouse flat. <br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nOn the outskirts of the forest, Izuku laid his palm down and let everyone walked down to the awaiting police. The only remaining hostage was the young boy who hugged the giant's thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you mister giant, I was so scared!\", the child cried as the warm hand gave comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku warmly smiled and used his other thumb to rub the boys head. \"Your welcome, and my name is Midoriya Izuku.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child looked up with a toothy grin. \"Nice to meet you Midoriya-Nii my name is Tobio!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I think you should go with the police now ok?\", Izuku said lowering his hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobio nodded and started to walk off the palm before suddenly turning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squish the villians up real good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku laughed and nodded as he watched the police leave. Turning back towards the forest, the greenete smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright time for some fun.\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nWalking back to the clearing, Izuku saw Denki with the villains still prisoner. His friend looked at him and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Midoriya, ready to punish these bugs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku nodded eagerly before plucking one of the scientists out of the fist. Dangling the tiny body in front of his eyes, the giant smirked before lowering the speck and placing it on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist groaned as he was dropped on the ground, his attention was brought up as the area around him darkened. Looking up, he gasped in horror as not only was the muscled back looming over. But Izuku was bending his knees and the green clothed firm rump was coming down towards him. The butt stretched the shorts and were the size of buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no Plea-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cries were silenced as the speck disappeared beneath Izuku's large butt. Some mercy was granted as the scientist was directly in the crack and not flattened beneath a firm glute. The two muscles clenched however, and mashed him up in the musky hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku barely felt the tiny body smooshed by his globes, fueling the sense of power he had. Denki sat down opposite of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah neat move! Now let's move onto the rest.\", the blond and black haired boy said placing the villians between the two giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept Giren in his left fist and eyed him seriously. \"You'll be staying here, intill you decide to spill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWent did the giants wip out first?</span></div></div>",

Denki chuckled perversely, \"Someone's keen to see these feet.\" He wiggled his eyebrows seductively as Izuku yelped and looked flustered...before Denki let out a moan as the shoe came off in Midoriya's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the steaming insides of the shoe, Midoriya couldn't help but want to...</span></div></div>",

The greenete could feel the heat as his nose entered the black shoe, beginning to allow the odor to invade his nose. Izuku then proceeded to take a big sniff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freckled boy felt his face tense up as the strong scent was inhaled. Izuku let out a moan as he took in the salty scent with a underlay of chesse to sweeten it. The smell was so powerful and it gave pleasure to Izuku at both the lovely stench and that these scientists were about to experience it themselves. The vinegar stood out and was implanted into his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki chuckled and smirked as he watched his friend lust over his shoe. Suddenly getting an idea, the boy lifted up the currently bare foot in front of Izuku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Midoriya, how about you put some of these bugs on my sole?\", Denki asked wiggling his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku blushed before nodding and putting the shoe down. As he placed the foot wear down, Izuku counted all the scientists between his and Denki's colossal bodies. There were ten, however Giran was squished into Denki's other foot and another was bearing the weight of Izuku's rear. So in total eight bugs to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down, Izuku took one and brought it to his lips. Denki watched in confusion as Izuku opened up his mouth and placed the squirming bug on his tongue and closed his mouth. Izuku sloshed the scientist around in his maw, making sure to coat him in spit before taking him out. The greenete then slowly placed the small body onto the plumpist part of Denki's sole, just beneath his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a slight push to trap the tiny in the foot flesh, with the saliva helping keep him stuck.

You now felt weightless again before he got up. \"Damn, bro...you're really getting a workout!\" You mumbled, of course it was muffled and you were basically mouthing into his foot flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>=Test 5: Ball Throw=</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku stood in the circle, looking at the ball nervously.

Izuku reared back and prepared to use One for All in his entire arm, only for nothing to happen as the ball uselessly flopped to the ground. \"Uh..what happened?\" Izuku gasped as his quirk seemingly didn't activate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I erased your quirk.\" Aizawa growled. \"The judges for this exam were not rational enough! Someone like you should never be allowed to enroll here!\" Aizawa scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait..you did what to my-...Wait I know you! You're the hero who can cancel out other people's powers! The Erasure Hero: Eraserhead!\" Izuku gasped, slightly fanboying despite his intimidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you intend to break your bones again? Count on someone else to save your useless body?\" Aizawa glared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" Izuku was suddenly gripped by Aizawa's scarves and pulled close. \"No matter what your intentions, you would be nothing but a liability in battle! You're worthless if you can only throw a single punch before breaking down!\" Eraserhead yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time you were furious, how dare this grumpy jerk talk to Izuku like that! You couldn't help yourself, squirming in your anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Midoriya..but someone like you can NEVER become a hero!\"</span></div></div>",

Mindlessly he leaned and grinded on the foot thinking a piece of debris had fallen in. Your ranting grew muffled as the plump sole squished down harder, knocking the breath out as the cheddary fumes were shoved in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I restored your quirk, you have two more tries, hurry up.\", Aizawa stated firmly as he deactivated his quirk and released your nervously sweating brother. You grumbled as your brother swiveled his foot to immobilize you under his sweaty fumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku looked at the ball in his hand, he thought over what Aizawa said. The drawback of the quirk was a lot and using his full arm was bound to show the same damage as the exam. As he contemplated the throw that would show his quirk the tingling against his foot returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why is there a bug in my shoe now of all times?\"</i>, Izuku internally vented as he leaned onto the squirming, desperate to squash the bug distracting him from the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the pressure increase as Izuku put his weight onto you, the sole squelched as it pressed you between itself and the insole. While you'd be overjoyed to be swimming in the stinky sweat of your big brother's chesse, you understand why the pressure suddenly increased. \"Huh, ah man looks like i been found ou-t ACK- GEEZ big bro you're really good at stomping when you put your mind to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku blinked as the squirming against his big foot felt different, like something was...talking against..it. The greenette's eyes dramatically widened as he reconized that feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I-Izumi!\"</i>, Izuku yelled in his thoughts as he realized the squirming he'd been squashing was his brother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midoriya what's the hold up?\", The erasure hero asked both irritated and confused at the shocked expression of the greenete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku blinked as his teacher brought him out of his thoughts, additionally his classmates where looking curiously as he had a peculiar expression all while mumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry I'll go now!\", Izuku flushed as he bowed his head. Aizawa sighed before telling him to hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drew his hand back, Izuku felt you against his sole again. You smiled as you rubbed the plump sole pinning you down with the sweaty weight. \"You can do it big bro, go on be the best hero!\" You cheered against the soft and cheesy sole squashing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku smiled. <i>\"Izumi your encouraging me aren't you, like always...I won't give up i promise!\"</i>, feeling the rush of his gifted quirk Izuku began to focus that into his fingers as he propelled his hand forward. With a yell he launched the ball, sending it flying with a burst of wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cheered on your brother. \"WHOA GO Br-Mmpf!\", well you were silenced again as Izuku was pushed onto his foot had you not been durable you'd be flatter then a penny. The meaty sole squashed down as Izuku stood on the foot above you, sweat covered you as the weight splashed it against the insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a success, albeit the greenette's finger was throbbing and red as the drawback was forced through it. While you were initially scared upon hearing your brother got last place, relief hit you as it all turned out to be a logical ruse by Aizawa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Izuku was eager to take out his brother, he needed to take a trip to Recovery Girl before returning to class. You smiled as you slipped out one of your snacks, though slightly downtrodden due to your chips being crumbs now.</span></div></div>",

So now your poor big bro's finger was healed, but he was exhausted due to the side affects of the nurse's quirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the finger doing?\" You heard a voice ask Izuku as your brother suddenly stopped walking. \"It's fine...thanks!\" Izuku said nervously. He was always so awkward, you smiled into his sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey wait uuup!\" A cheerful female voice boomed above. You felt Izuku tense up when the girl spoke and thought his name was 'Deku Midoriya'. You sniggered a bit, causing Izuku to press down on you.

Ya know Deku would make a great hero name! Plus, I think it sounds kinda cute!\" Uraraka proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Izuku's foot heat up hotter than it already was, you could just picture your older bro's scarlet face as he yelped: \"Deku it is!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paradigm shift! My whole world is upside down heheeheheh!\" Izuku covered his face and giggled like some sort of schoolgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but think of how much you were gonna tease him about his new 'girlfriend' later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku made it home, parting ways with Uraraka and Iida half the way. Now he opened the door and immediately saw their mother wailing amidst several tissues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what's going on?\" Izuku gasped as he shut the door and popped his shoes off with a waft of steam coming out of the red footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis socks were hugging his feet so tightly with their sopping wet cotton, you could both swear you hear 'squish' sounds with each step he took towards your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Izukuuu! Thank goodness you're hoome! Izumi is missing!!\" She sobbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aw shit...how could I be so careless...</i> You thought guiltily. \"M-mom! It's alright, he sorta...went to school with me.\" Izuku explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAAAAT?!\" Inko shrieked. \"H-He's in my sock, he's probably regretting his decision now.\" Izuku tried to soften the possible punishment your mother might dish out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! You boys and your gross game. I was worried sick!\" Inko shouted right at Izuku's big socked feet. It was a rather funny sight, Izuku chuckled slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure you're tired from your hard day. I'll get dinner ready since I was too upset to start on it!\" Inko huffed at Izuku's foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry ma!\" You yelled up at her, somehow getting your face dug out from Izuku's meaty sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehehe, I'm gonna go to my room and rest.\" Your big bro went to his room and began to peel the socks off.</span></div></div>",

As his plump sole was revealed the greenette flushed at the strong cheesy stench he began to smell coming from his foot. For whatever reason, Izumi was never bothered when he ended up beneath his large feet, almost like he enjoyed his odorous soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally peeling off the sock showed the large plump sole, smeared sweat covering the flesh slightly pink from the smothering heat. Sure enough in the ball of Izuku's sole was his brother firmly squashed into the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey big bro.\", Izumi nonchalantly greeted eating a protein bar both flattened and covered in grimy sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku quickly reached down using his thumb and finger, pulled his brother out with a POP and onto his palm. Cupping his palms around his brother Izuku brought him to his face looking worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izumi are you ok! I didn't step on you too hard right?\", you brother fretted over your state, covered in his sweat from hours of constant stomping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled finishing your protein bar with a nice cheddary musk topping. \"Calm down big bro! You know me I'm tough your stompers haven't hurt me before, plus your last person I'd get pissed at for stepping on me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to your freckled brother's face you reached out and rubbed his nose. You rubbed the back of your head as you sheepishly looked off. \"Plus I'm the one who crawled into you socks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku smiled as he set you on the pillow before laying on his stomach. \"Thank you, for encouraging me back there even if i kept squishing you...\", Izuku flushed he then hummed as he rubbed his chin, a curious expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would you climb in my socks of all places, you could've climbed in one of my pockets and not have to get stepped on all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled as you put your hands behind your head and layed back. \"Big bro that'll be lame, i wanted to spend the day in your cheese!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku flushed as his eyes widened. \"M-my cheese?\", unconsciously Izuku wiggled his large toes. His foot odor had always been an embarrassing topic, just because of how much he sweated not to mention smooshed Izumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned closing your eyes. \"Yep your feet are great bro! They always show me how strong your become when you stomp me, and the smells awesome the cheese is unlike anything I'd ever smelt.\", you smiled warmly opening your eyes. \"Plus...the smell makes me feel safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku felt his eyes water, his brother was always uplifting him but this whole time Izuku was helping Izumi by stepping on him. Smiling Izuku scooped up Izumi and hugged him to his cheek. \"Thank you Izumi, i didn't know i was helping you whenever i squished you. But I'm i am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Izuku flushed as he thought of you being under those steps all day, even if you liked it he still got embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the table were three delicious looking bowls of katsudon. Well one was a small sauce bowl that was still bigger then you, so that always guaranteed leftovers. It sat next to Izuku's that casted a shadow over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the food!\", you and Izuku gave a itadakimasu before beginning to end the one of many yummy meals your mother makes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInko smiled at her boys before gaining a worried look. \"Izumi..i know you want to be with your brother but please next time could you ride in his bag.

N-no I'd never let happen Izumi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sweatdrop formed on your head from your mother's worried ranting. Still, she was right getting caught sneaking into U.A definitely wouldn't be fun.

I'm so proud to have you to as my children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner was cheerful and more lively as Izuku talked about his first day. It was dinner to celebrate the future, from the troubles in the past growing into gateways of prosperity. Izuku while enjoying the dinner still had the dark thought at the back of his head, he had said he was a late bloomer and spent many days training for his quirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm sorry Izumi..i know you hate fake people. I don't want you to feel betrayed please.\"</i><br>\r\n___________________________<br>\r\nAfter the yummy meal, you both moved to Izuku's room. Laying down, your brother set you on his firm chest, feeling the sweaty pecs pushing against the shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strong b.o and slight musk from your brother's pits hit you. It wasn't bothersome of course, it showed his strength and power to protect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku lightly rubbed your head as he took a deep breath. You were his brother, you wouldn't just go babbling it knowing the significance of One for All. Maybe you wouldn't be mad at the secret, Izuku didn't want a rift in his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

He had been hanging with his friend when a middle school student starting picking on them.

As he grew up he always would shrink down others when they asked him, some asked him to step on them with his large feet. Being a giant made Izuku think of how powerful he could be, Bakugou always told him that he could literally crush a villian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friend didn't miss out on his quirk as well. Bakugou and his junior high class all wanted to be shrunk by him. Some even asked to rub his feet, which Izuku worried about since his feet did get a little stinky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also was more assertive as he would shrink someone down and threaten to crush them if necessary. Not to mention the one time he shrunk a bully down and 'accidentally' left him on Kacchan's seat just as the ash blond sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku was gentle but also enjoyed being a giant a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now Izuku was.....</span></div></div>",

Izuku giggled as he felt the cool ground against his warm sweaty sole. He decided he should stop humoring his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step longer then the last, Izuku's large foot hovered over Bakugou. The ash blond looked up at the sudden darkness, only to see the sky full of Izuku's sole about to fall on him. Before he could activate another explosion, Bakugou was soon pinned to the ground with the sole smooshing him into Izuku's stomper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku laughed. \"Hehe, I squished the bug! Just wait villians, you'll be joining him soon.\", Izuku grinned as he lifted his heel and lightly grinded Bakugou into the ball of his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku closed his eyes and hummed. The feeling of Bakugou's now minuscule body squashed into his foot made him think of the future. Him next to All Might, a shrunken villain quivering at thier feet soon ready to be crushed beneath thier feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy suddenly opened his eyes and gasped. \"Opps, I'm still smooshing Kacchan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile under Izuku's sole, Bakugou was enjoying himself. Despite the pressure of the squishy flesh he was inhaling the strong sent stuck to Deku's sole. The boy always wore his big red shoes and rarely changed his socks that looked glued on. Bakugou grunted as the thick cheese filled his nostrils and warmed him in a sorta mini sauna. If Izuku ever got rid of his foot stench, Bakugou be pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the pressure was lightened as Izuku sat on a desk and rested his foot on his knee. Bakugou was stuck to his squishy sole face first and looked imbedded in the flesh. Using his thumb and finger, Izuku pulled his friend out with a loud peel sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you sure know how to use those feet!\", Bakugou yelled as he panted covered in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku rubbed the back of his head and chuckled. \"Yeah...it feels good when I step on something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back over to his desk, Izuku began pulling on his worn and damp socks. As he gathered his things, Izuku thought of where to put Bakugou for the walk back.

The sole rised and let the squishy sole rest on him only to come down and squash Bakugou into the insole with a squelch and splash of sweat. Bakugou grunted from the pressure before laughing and whiffing the endless scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greenete stopped in his walk as he saw an All Might poster hanging up on a store window. Izuku grinned and looked at a weed growing out of the sidewalk. A small smirk grew as Izuku imagined the weed was a quivering villain.

It did still get embarrassing when he saw just how much his friend liked his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the feet, Bakugou soon reached the toes and the source of a lot of the chessy musk. He couldn't help himself and planted his face into the big toe and take a whiff. The heavy odor smelt amazing to Bakugou and made his potential nosebleed grow more possible as the stinky smell helped give off a scope of just how big Izuku was.

Inhaling the scent was one thing but Bakugou couldn't help his temptations and stuck his tongue out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku felt the front of his pants tighten a bit and began to flush as the rubbing grew faster and he felt wet streaks across his sole that were warm and lapped up any sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was next?</span></div></div>",

He stopped when a shadow covered him, causing him to look up in confusion at a sky that looked the sole of a shoe-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">CRUNCH</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku looked in shook as the fleeing dot suddenly disappeared beneath a large red shoe belonging to a leg coated in black.

All the adults are mean to mama now because of my quirk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger was silent as the child began tearing up at the memories. Hearing the sirens closer now the stranger held out a hand, strangely bending his pinky towards his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...was there a hero to stop all this?\", the stranger asked in a raspy voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", Izuku blinked away his tears as he looked at the palm. After a second, he slowly placed his smaller hand in the dry one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShigaraki soon grinned wildly as he and the kid walked into the alley, once again stomping on the squashed remains. \"Kid, your quirk can do a lot. How about you be my support unit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku smiled and looked in awe at a sudden purple portal forming at the end of the alleyway. Shigaraki was full of glee as he knew that they could now literally crush the hero society.</span></div></div>",

The two men had been hopeful when they first spotted the young greenette, thinking he'd persuade the villians to let them go. They were wrong as Izuku jogged over with a mischievous smile and held his hands up as they glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two heroes seem to vanish as their bindings fell to the chairs and floor. However looking closer, in the center of each seat was a hero now a inch in height. Izuku giggled at the shocked faces before he quickly snatched both of them in a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku took a seat on one of the seats and used his other hand to start pulling off his worn shoes. A pop sound was audible as Izuku's wet socks popped out and visible streaks of steam floated out. The young villain smirked as the heroes pathetically squirmed in his fist, little did they know of the smellier prison waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe size shifter quickly tosses the two men into the separate shoes. He then slid his large feet into each foot, giggling as his toes knocked the heroes into his chessy insole. Izuku hummed as he felt each inch tall hero get squished underneath the area of his toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn inch was the default size for Izuku, just right to squish but he could always shrink them further. The greenete smiled as he stood up and felt his soles squash the pathetic squirming and engulfed the heroes in his plump feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku soon walked to the entrance of the bar with heavy steps before turning back to wave. \"Goodbye everyone, I'll be back tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange, Izuku was a very sweet boy. But that could turn into playful cruelness in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heroes were going through a chessy hot hell at the moment. The soft weight on top of them would lighten momentarily before crushing them back into the ground. The lucky thing about Izuku's feet was that they were very plump so he could stomp on tinies and not immediately turn them to paste. So Izuku enjoyed his walk with his comfy insoles no worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Izuku arrived at his new apartment, Shigaraki's master had been kind and given Izuku a place to live. All the young villain needed to do was get groceries with a allowance he was given. Izuku was really grateful as he also was given a lot of playtoys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the the living room was an assortment of things such as model cities and multiple pairs of footwear. On a shelf was multiplied notebooks containing info on heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what fun was first?</span></div></div>",

He leaned forward and began to untie the laces, with a satisfying <i>woooosh</i>, the shoes were pulled off and the air kissed the enormous feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe socks of the young ex-student were like a second skin, glued on so well that one could make out each individual rounded toe. However, most important and notable of all...were the individuals smooshed into the arches of the socked feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!~ That feels niice...\" Izuku sighed before hoisting his right foot onto the opposite knee...and laughing loudly. The tiny hero was flat as a pancake and stuck in an indent into the socked sole. Grinning toothily, Izuku peeled him off...and did the same for the next foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the dazed and now 'marked' puny heroes in his fists, Izuku chuckled. \"Hehehehe, I'm excited to play with you both!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero in his right fist whimpered pathetically, \"P-please kid...don't do this!\" His response was a sharp squeeze from Izuku, and a pouty frown. \"Don't call me kid! I'm a villain you know! I've got a lot more going for me with Tomu-chan than I EVER did trying to be a hero!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku looked over to his scale-model city and gained a mischievous grin. Young Midoriya stood up, the tinies clenched in his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis socked feet made squishy sounds as he traversed across the hardwood floor...Izuku liked leaving sweaty footprints all over the apartment. Looming over the city, Izuku placed the tiny heroes on a rooftop that they would never survive a fall from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquatting down, Izuku set to work peeling off the rancid and well worn socks. \"Let's play Deku-Zilla!\" Izuku grinned widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe socks were yanked from Izuku's feet, and the two tinies would peer over the sides of the roof down to see the absolutely massive bare stompers. Izuku's feet were wide and meaty, the soles spectacularly plump and thick, his toes were plump...and above all...a rancid cheesy stench wafted up to the heroes...and they could see grime around the giant's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you guys think of my BIG feet?\" Izuku began to raise a foot up in the air for them to see his sole..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quiet bugs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku brought his plump sole down fast and blocked his childishly angry face as the chessy sole was close to crushing the building and heroes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, one hero grabbed his fellow hero and jumped off the roof, putting out his hand a yellow platform appeared and caught them. Just in time as Izuku crushed the building flat under his large foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku laughed as he grinded the rubble under his sweaty foot. \"Hehe, so you do have some fight in you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greenete rose his foot, dropping debris now coated in sweat and a chessy odor. Izuku watched as the platform shattered and the heroes fell to the ground.

Count me in!\" The flashy pro had boldly proclaimed...much to the annoyance of those he was teamed up with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't about gaining notoriety-\" One of the other pros, Lizolfo, a lizardman hero, had scolded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! EVERY opportunity as a pro is a chance to gain fame and notoriety!\" Dynamo had disregarded his fellow pro's concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDynamo was cocky, he didn't plan on keeping with the 'surveillance' side of things. He'd bust in and take down the LoV's leader himself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, his brashness was exactly the reason they got caught! So now here he was, quaking in his red boots and pretty sure he'd soiled his white costume, hiding in a model skyscraper as the gigantic teen stomped closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd seen Lizolfo dash across the street into the opposite building. \"I...I can't be wiped out here...not like this...not by some oversized brat!\" Dynamo ranted to himself, his infamous ego taking a nosedive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow of Izuku Midoriya overtook the building, and  Dynamo turned with horror to see the enormous eye staring right in at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found you!\" Izuku's voice boomed, rattling the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his jetboots, he quickly propelled himself through the building's halls, just as the colossus' hand plowed through the walls where he'd just been hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Lizolfo peering out from an alley across the street, perhaps he could divert the giant's attention to him instead?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was pondering this diabolical plan, he smashed through the window, propelled by his thrusters, and ran smack into Izuku's clutches! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got ya!\" Izuku cheerfully exclaimed as he clenched Dynamo in a fist. \"W-wait!

So just as Izuku gets into highschool, Bakugou is already a pro hero. The biggest one here is that Izuku actually has a quirk, one that makes him only a inch tall and very durable. Bakugou is older, so in my mind he's taller and a bit more muscled.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku sat on his kitchen table waiting for the arrival of his babysitter. It was embarrassing as he just got into highschool and he still had to be watched when his mom went to work. Though he couldn't blame her, having a inch tall son caused some concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the door opening made izuku stand up in excitement as the sound of heavy footsteps came into the kitchen. Soon he saw a towering ash-blond man dressed in a more casual version of his hero outfit. Including a black tank top with a orange X that squeezed the firm muscles and black pants that clung to his toned legs. He still wore his mask and as Izuku was covered in a shadow red eyes looked over the large pecs at the green haired boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA toothy smirk grew as Bakugou saw the tiny boy. \"Hey Deku, it's been I while since I've seen my squirt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku smiled despite the looming giant. \"Hi Kacchan!\", the next thing he knew, Izuku was being enveloped in the orange palm of Bakugou's gloved fist. Bakugou chuckled as he pulled the front of his tank top forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about giving your big buddy a hug!\", Bakugou grinned as he bounced his pecs and moved Izuku towards the crevice and pushed the tiny boy in between his firm muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku soon found himself being squeezed by Bakugou's pecs. The massive heartbeat rang out and the smell of his manly b.o crinkled his nose. \"Mmf Kacchan you smell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou smirked as he began to leave the kitchen. \"Hey it ain't my fault I got called up during work to watch your tiny ass!\", adding a quick pec flex to get a groan out of the tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku sighed but smiled as he nuzzled into the firm muscles. Growing up, Bakugou had always watched him and been his big buddy. During his junior high years he'd been a bit of a bully and viewed himself as top dog, treating Izuku like a bug. Izuku spent afternoons being squashed under Bakugou's feet and even sat on while the ash-blond mocked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut going through high school and becoming a hero, Bakugou mellowed out and began acting nicer to Izuku. He still acted big and put Izuku in size situations, but Izuku came to like his big friend's smells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou soon arrived at Izuku, he gawked as he walked in and saw all the All Might merch. Looking down at his pecs. \"Damn Deku your still a hero fanboy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed mumbles came out of the muscles. Bakugou made his way over to Izuku's bed and laid down, sighing as the bed creaked under his weight. Fishing Izuku out of his pecs, Bakugou placed him on top of his abs and placed his hands behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Deku...</span></div></div>",

Kaminari grinned, \"Yep. He's kind of a big deal....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? How so?\" Momo inquired as she took a bite of her lunch elegantly. \"Well...instead of choosing to become a pro hero, he formed a really cool rock band. They're pretty famous.\" Kaminari boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro's jaw dropped, \"No..no way! Your brother is....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaminari smirked, \"Yeah, he's Raito of the hero metal band: PainBrake!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who'd have thought you'd have such a cool older brother...\" Jiro muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! What's that supposed to mean?!\" Kaminari blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh I've seen pictures of him! He's super cute!\" Hagakure butted in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo dreamyyy...\" Ashido swooned, \"His dance moves are pretty good too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**After School**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki walked through the door of his house and called out: \"Mom! Dad! I'm home!\" Popping off his school shoes with a sigh, steam emitted from the insides of the brown footwear. Denki's socks were visibly wet and adhered to his big feet. \"I can't wait to get outta this stuffy uniform.\" Kaminari loosened his red tie and undid the buttons on the uniform to let his sweaty torso breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Kaminari, his older brother had already arrived! His mother was preparing a large dinner...and his father was trying to get her to calm down and stop overdoing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mr. and Mrs. Kaminari believed Raito to be resting in Denki's room...nobody knew what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell?!\" Raito yelled out, he stood amidst a sea of carpet in Denki's room....he'd shrunk! Raito's mind immediately went to whether this was a hallucination or not...but then he remembered that weird guy who bumped into him at the airport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guy was really shifty...maybe he has something to do with this....I hope it isn't going to effect little bro!\" Raito always did care about his little brother a lot..it'd been awhile since he saw him last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the floor began to quake beneath the tiny Raito...and the door swung open to reveal his colossal 'little' brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-woah....he's certainly....changed since last I saw him....\" Raito gulped as the sweaty socked feet of his giant brother shook the floor and were headed right toward him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw crap! I gotta move!\" Raito yelped out as the squishy sounding socked feet thoomed towards him. \"I gotta change into something more comfortable.\" The giant boomed to himself, his voice sounding like a deep rumble to Raito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrying off his jacket and tie, Denki left them draped over a chair at his computer desk. Now leaving himself in his school pants and a visibly sweat dampened white dress shirt...and some very sweaty and odorous socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaito blushed as Denki slipped his pants down to reveal his boxers, the cocky electric boy kicked these into the corner and sat his sizeable rump down on the end of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaito breathed a sigh of relief, he wasn't going to get stepped on it seemed. But now he had to get Denki's attention! </span></div></div>",

Raito stumbled as the front of the socks hitting the ground, produced noticeable shakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've brought a change of socks, i was sweating up a storm during today's exercises.\", Denki chuckled as he tapped his soles, producing small wet slaps and unintentionally causing Raito to trip as he felt the earthquake like shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaito rubbed his head as he face planted. The brother chuckled as he looked up at the looming form of his brother. \"Man Denki you could take out a villain just by tapping those bad boys. Ughh or maybe just knock em out with the smell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder Kaminari suddenly gagged as the odorous fumes spilling out of the socks hit him. A vinegar and salty stench throughout coating the large feet, Denki had certainly always had his smells but this one a MUCH bigger scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki hummed as he put his foot on his knee. \"Raito never really complained about my smell, I'm sure i skip out on a shower!\", the blond proudly grinned before grabbing the ankle of the glued on sock. \"Alright let's let you bad boys breath.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling on the sock, you swear there was a peeling noise as the fabric pulled away to show the glistening sole. Sweat was smeared all over the plump and meaty sole, a stronger wave of vinegar stench was unleashed and made the steam being emitted practically visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaito finally jogged up to the feet, covering his mouth with his red jacket yet falling to keep the putrid odor out. Looking up as just as Denki peeled his sock off and let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denki hey I'm down here, bro can you hear...\", Raito had yelled up but widened his eyes as he saw Denki move his foot off his knee and directly hold it over him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder Kaminari couldn't even yell as the large sweaty was brought down. Raito was thrown to the floor and vanished as the foot easily squashed him to the floor. Plump foot flesh pinned Raito down and squelched as warm and putrid sweat was splashed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaito was completely buried under the ball of Denki's foot, enveloped in the warm sole. The elder brother cringed as his nostrils directly inhaled the vinegar musk, making them burn as he was soaked with the sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Da-damn Ok Denki looks like you got me, now c'mon let your big bro out!\"</i>, Raito thought, he couldn't be made at Denki but the sweat was really strong here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki meanwhile grinned as he peeled off his other sock. \"Man i can't wait to tell Raito about U.A! I wanna see what he thinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon...</span></div></div>",

But that's the cons with having a quirk that made you a inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to 1-A had been a challenge, covering the long distance and avoiding students that didn't even look down to see the tiny student on the ground. You were beginning to become discouraged even more as the 1-B teacher Vlad King stepped over you and didn't hear your pleas for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours, you finally arrived at the door for your class. The towering door put some curiosity in just how tall your classmates would be.

However, the shaking stopped as a shadow loomed over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind you was the large brown shoes of the uniform.

Never mind, feel kinda bad for you little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed as the vinegar musk hit you like a heavy cloud. You suddenly were brought up and placed on top of Denki's spiky hair. Denki grinned as now that both of his hands were free he could peel off the painted on sock. Grabbing the heel of the damp fabric, Denki began to peel it off like a sticker, trails of sweat coming off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe musky stench grew 2x as the glistening plump sole was revealed, looking slightly pink from how hot it was in the shoe. Denki hummed as finally with a wiggle of his gunky toes, his large fuming foot was free. Reaching up, Denki plucked you off his head with a michivious grin growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright shrimp your cab's ready!\", Denki said holding up his sweat ridden sock by the ankle, letting the sweaty steam flow out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gagged. \"Y-your putting me in your sock?! Can't you just carry me in your pocket.\",you pleaded, though in a more annoyed then terrified voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki chuckled. \"C'mon dude, i want ya to be warm before we chill. Just take a nice whiff of my smell and you'll learn to love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelped as Denki released you and plummeted straight down into the musky sock, the landing was soft and squelched as you landed on the damp fabric. Half dry and gooey gunk was splattered around you and fumigated the vinagar musk like a fragrance. You felt your nostrils tingle as you breathed in the potent stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You nice and cozy squirt? Cause i think it's time to go.\", Denki grinned as he wiggled his toes before beginning to slid them back into the wet socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as you coughed, watching the large toes come closer. The big toe was bigger then you and showed as you found yourself being pushed into the sock as the stinky toe smashed against you. The gunky toe jam's odor hit you as the sweaty and soft sole passed over stopping with you under the meaty ball of the foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki sighed as he stood up, feeling his plump sole completely envelope you in it's flesh. It was a strange yet nice feeling. Your groans were muffled as the vinegar sweat was smooshed onto you as you felt the pressure dramatically increase. True to his words, Denki's soft feet didn't immediately crush you but it felt like a smelly heavy blanket was pinning you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding his large foot into the brown shoe, Denki created loud thumps for you as he wacked the insole with his wiggling toes. Grinning toothily Denki began to make his way home, eager to 'welcome' his new classmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon...</span></div></div>",

Being the son and so called 'masterpiece' of Endeavor meant he was groomed to surpass the No. 2 hero one day. Shoto was isolated from his siblings and made to only focus on the harsh training and the few moments of free time he had with his loving mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuyumi, Toya, and Natsuo were deemed failures by their father and were not permitted to interact with Shoto. There was one sibling who consistently defied that decree however. That would be you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name was Yuki Todoroki, and the reason you were deemed a failure was because you were around five inches tall. You might as well have been born quirkless since your quirk was so ineffective at your size. You were a teenager when Shoto was still a kid. For once you actually had found a bright side to your puny height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made it quite easy to sneak around, and you found that you were quite durable and resilient. You underwent a sort of training all your own, maneuvering through the house and finding various ways to get around. So it was that you would sneak in to see Shoto and cheer him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor kid was almost always down in the dumps or crying from your wicked father's treatment. You made it a routine to sneak in to play with him every day if you could. However, it would usually end the same way if you were caught by your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father would roughly 'escort' you out and yell at Shoto. But Shoto sometimes would cleverly hide you and you were allowed more time with your little brother. On more than one occasion you spent the night in his room, snuggled up with him and comforting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all before the incident where your mother lost it and scalded Shoto with boiling water. You weren't sure what to think, how could your mother do something so horrible? But deep down you didn't blame her entirely...you blamed HIM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father may be the Number 2 hero but he was a cruel and abusive man. The straw that broke the camel's back was when he sent your mother away to a mental hospital AND sent you away to live with a distant relative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEndeavor paid off the relative whom you'd never met to NEVER contact him or any of your siblings. You were cut off from the only family you'd ever known and dumped into the arms of some relative you didn't know at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the years your hatred and resentment only grew. The sole target of this hate was your father. You at times thought about hiring a villain to assassinate him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that could only do harm, especially if the villain lost. Then you'd be in trouble with the law and any hope of meeting up with your family would be lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when you were around 21 years old and had your own place, you sought out your siblings. Arranging a meeting with Natsuo was easier than you thought. He had moved out some time ago to go to college, being the second youngest. Toya had died at some point, apparent suicide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuyumi was also easy to get a hold of, since she was the eldest of your siblings. It turned out your 'condition' wasn't exactly unheard of in the world..so luckily for you as time had passed there came more acceptance and even accommodations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a smartphone that was just your size even! You scheduled a meet-up at a local diner. It had been years since you had last seen any of them...</span></div></div>",

The literal small plate of bread and butter you ordered as an appetizer was untouched as you were too invested in your thoughts to even eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in years you were going to meet your siblings again, the cold feeling of isolation was too familiar and being able to meet some of your family could give the warmth you desired. The smiles of your brothers and sister....of Toya. They were all you had those years being away, you'd rather remember that then the distraught faces as you watched them leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki?\", a masculine voice called out as a shadow was casted over the table. Looking up your eyes widened as the familiar white haired head of Natsuo loomed over, his bulky form casting the shadow. Your brother had a surprised look as he examined you, well you had grown your hair out a little not to mention working on a computer did give you a bit of dark circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsuo, hey.\", you smiled as you stood up. The two of you silently looked at each other, taking in the differences that happened over the years. Your brother was older and more mature looking. Natsuo soon smiled before wordlessly setting his palm down before you, with no hesitation you walked onto the warm surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white haired boy slowly brought you up and the next thing you knew, Natsuo hugged you to his firm chest. \"It's been a while huh?\", you nodded as you returned the hug. \"Yeah it has...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling you away, Natsuo grinned. \"Sooo, how have you been?\", You felt more at ease soon sitting down on the palm. \"I've been good, i have a place to myself, got a job designing video games. I heard your a college kid now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsuo chuckled and rubbed his head. \"Heh yeah, i moved out as soon as i could, just cause i couldn't really bear it there.\", the boy's tone took a slightly distasteful tone as he looked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a tinge of anger as you thought of your torn family. Your father was now the #1 hero and your family was still broken, the reason all this happened was because he wanted a perfect hero child-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I'm sorry for the wait Natsuo!\", a familiar voice called out. You shook your head, slightly disturbed at the negative thoughts that hit you. Looking up you felt positive again as walking up was your older sister, looking more mature as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuyumi widened her eyes as she saw you standing in the palm of her brother. \"Y-yuki.\", you smiled and waved. \"Hey it's been some time sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes of the red and white haired girl seem to water slightly as she smiled. Cupping you with her hands, Fuyumi hugged you to her soft cheek. You chuckled as you couldn't help but tear up a bit as well. \"I held onto hope..that we would get to meet you again.\", Fuyumi sniffled as she smiled and set you back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou warmly smiled as you took in both your siblings, maybe the phrase \"a new chapter in your life\" wasn't a bunch of bull. \"Thank you, both of you for accepting my calls first off. And second, thank you for not forgetting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsuo looked at you seriously. \"Yuki we'd never shun just because of what HE said.\", Fuyumi looked over with worry at her brother's tone before coughing into her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also we aren't alone!\", she said trying to bring back the happy mood. It seem to work as Natsuo grinned and nodded. You were confused as both your siblings moved to the side, you however felt shock and...happiness fill you as another shadow was casted over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming over was Shoto! So different then before, his sad childlike face now looked hardened and his scar no longer bandaged. Your little brother despite his chillded face grew a small small as he looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki-nii.\", Shoto said slightly awkward from all the years he gone without saying that name. You were silent before raising your hand palm out. Shoto blinked before doing the same with his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Shoto?\", you asked quietly sneaking the room after being able to avoid your father and the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on his futon with his knees to his chest was your brother. You felt your heart sink at the think bandage on his left side, walking up your brother gasped before scooping you up into his small yet giant hands. \"Yuki-nii, he did it, she's gone cause of him...and your going away to!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded slowly looking down before forcing a grin on your face. \"D-don't worry! I promise one day I'll come back. When i do we can watch you becomea hero together ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoto sniffled before slowly. You and your younger shared a hug, maybe for the last time you sorrowfully thought. Hopping onto the ground held up a palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a high five, to being the best hero.\"\", you smiled getting Shoto to smile through his sniffles and lightly press his palm to yours.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoto lightly pressed his palm to yours...a little too hard as you were shoved onto the table. The three bigger siblings gasped and just as Shoto began to apologize you let out a chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you definitely changed after all these years! Well in high fives at least!\", you grinned sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoto blinked before smiling again before reaching down to scoop you up. You soon were hugged into the crook of your brothers neck. \"Yeah, thank you for not forgetting Yuki-nii.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext....</span></div></div>",

Unknownst to the staff and students a...small threat was within the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name was Fen a seemingly normal person by photo, but your were actually the inch tall villian named Minu. The reputation  you had was ironically small as both heroes and villians have little knowledge of you, due to your size hiding was easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting picked on and literally stepped on by your peers led you to villiany. Lately you were given a job by the League Of Villians, you didn't really care about society or if All Might was defeated so why not join?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cursed as you were blasted back by a large red object crashing down in front of you. Still being durable was good but getting stepped on wasn't fun. You glared up at the freckled giant smiling above as he jogged out to meet his friends shaking up the ground with his stomps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid giants, alright the class schedule is probably in the principal's office.\", you sighed as you managed to run in just as the towering door closed behind you and blasted you with air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShigaraki had given you a mission to find the schedule of the classes to plan an attack. You couldn't fail, your credibility...and life was on the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You understand your mission..right?\", Shigaraki said his red eyes blaring down at you from behind his blueish hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to stutter as you sat in the shadow of the hooded giant. \"Ye-yep don't worry boss I'll get the schedule no problem!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShigaraki's dry lips formed a grin as he suddenly pinned beneath his palm. You yelped as the cold skin weight like a heavy blanket on top of you. The blood seem to cool in your veins as the giant held a thumb above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, but if you fail.... then i won't need my quirk to turn you to dust.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered at the recent memory before making your way into the school. The biggest struggle so far wasn't giants but just how far you had to travel! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 30 minutes you seem to have only traveled a few halls, it didn't help that you had forgot a map and were basically hoping the next door would be the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped to take a breath, standing now before a door that could tower over normal sized people labeled 1-A. A sort of melancholy filled you, a future of you being Fen the hero not Fen the villian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were a out to resume your trek, fear hit you as the gigantic door slid open. Looking up your eyes widened as from a pair of large white shoes was a tall boy with half red and white hair. A cold face not currently looking at you, now all you had to do was sneak away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodoroki blinked as something out of the corner of his eye caught his attention. Down near the toe of his shoe was a small speck. The boy narrowed his eyes and wiggled his toes in his stuffy show, feeling sweat squelch as his soles pushed against the insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled as you looked up, seeing Todoroki now looking at you. Soon the dark undersole of the white shoe ascended into the sky as the giant lifted up his leg. Running away didn't do anything as Todoroki stomped down and crushed you to the floor. You yelped as the heavy weight was put on you along with the dirty shoe sole, intense pressure came over as Todoroki began to swivel his foot over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodoroki raised an eyebrow as the \"bug\" he stepped on wasn't crunching with his foot grinds. Lifting up his foot, the giant widened his eyes as upon looking closer he saw the \"bug\" was in fact a tiny person!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a breath as the crushing pressure was relieved. Looking back up you gulped as Todoroki reached down, you soon found yourself enveloped in a warm sweaty palm before being brought to the cold eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So i was right, you aren't a bug.\", Todoroki calmly said not shocked at stomping a tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared at the giant as you struggled in the fist holding everything except your head. \"Erggh let me go you damn hero!\", dread however filled you as you thought over your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mismatched eyes of Todoroki narrowed as he clenched his fist tighter, getting you to wheeze. \"Just as i thought, a villian. Your so incompetent that even at this size your caught. Before i give you to the authorities I'll show you how pathetic you villians really are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook in fear as....</span></div></div>",

Class 1-A was chatting amongst themselves as finishing the lesson early had given them free time, as well as naptime for Aizawa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong them was a student who wasn't always noticed. That student was you Fukase, unlike others with a transferable quirk or super speed your quirk was being a inch tall. You had gained a spot in class due to your high grades, though this was for a week to see if you could make it in the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course being tiny had it's issues, you lost count of how many times you ended up under the large white sole of a certain greenete's shoe (though his sincere apologies made it hard to be mad). Luckily high invulnerability was part of the quirk meaning you could be squished and not end up like a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kase-kun you ready for lunch?\", the voice of your temporary classmate boomed as he leaned over with a warm smile. He was one of the many classmates you got along with and helped you get places with your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning you shook your head. \"No you can go on ahead, i need to look over the notes for today!\", Izuku frowned a little before smiling. \"Ok but make sure to eat before the class starts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as the freckled boy rushed over to his friends and left the classroom. Stretching out your arms, you began to flip through your tiny accommodated notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more then 15 minutes you spent reviewing the notes, wanting to remember everything taught. You soon were brought out of your concentration as the desk lightly thudded shaking you. Looking up, Aizawa tapped the desk with his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better hurry if you want to eat kid.\", the teacher said in his gruff voice. You nodded, putting your things away before being plucked up. Confusion hit you as instead of carrying you out, Aizawa set you next to his large boot. \"Wait aren't you going to bring me there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizawa grew his infamous grin as he began walking towards the door shaking you up with his steps. \"You didn't think i was gonna be your cab right. If your going to be a hero you'll need to get places on your own. Now, better hurry up before lunch ends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked in shock, you sighed as you realized he was right. Being unnoticable and indestructible wasn't going to get you anywhere if you couldn't arrive on time. So the next three minutes were spent just getting to the door and crawling under it. Now came the hallway....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what's this?\", a cocky voice suddenly boomed as the ground shook in the rhythmic style of steps. Before you could look up, you were thrown onto your butt as a giant brown shoe stomped down in front of you. Rubbing your sore rear, you were thrown into the air again as another brown shoe crashed on the other side of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up past the towering legs you saw the giant in question was blond giant stretching into the sky. The boy was smirking as his eyes were slightly shadowed by his bangs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonoma felt his smirk grow as he saw your speck form between his large feet. Tapping his foot shook you up as his plump sole squelched in his humid shoes. Squatting down so that his firm thighs flexed and his pants hugged his round rear, the blond leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard about you, the bug of the great class 1-A! A lot of people could've been in your place, and all it would take is for them to crush a bug.\", Monoma boomed getting you to sweat from the cocky and threatening tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cocky face was soon blocked as Monoma reached down and grabbed you in a warm fist. You yelped as the giant stood up and brought you to his smug face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since i don't have the opportunity to put the Oh so amazing heros beneath me, I'll savor doing it to you!\", the warm and loud breath of the blond blasted you as his eyes grew more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling down his tie and unbuttoning the top of his shirt, Monoma licked his lips. \"I'll keep you somewhere nice and warm until i can have my fun.\", you widened your eyes and struggled against the firm fist as it descended to his now exposed and muscular chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed as upon coming within radius a strong sweaty stench hit you. High b.o waves from the smeared sweat on Monoma's body, class 1-B must have been training earlier as sweat dripped from the firm pecs. However you were soon brought to the side of Monoma's body and the b.o scent became more...sour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonoma chuckled as he lifted his arm, feeling the heavy and rank air flow freely. You coughed as a stronger and thicker odor hit you, more sour and humid that made your nostrils flare up at the intense waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing yput coughs the blond giant hummed. \"Oh what's this, i thought the mighty class A could take a little smell. Let's see you endurance for a true hero's stink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled as you were soon greeted by the greasy and fuming armpit of Monoma. The blond hairs were matted down and sour steam could be seen emitting from the skin. Loosening his fist, Monoma smirked as he slammed you against his pit and began to rub his palm around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squishy and warm wall slapped you, unfortunately a drop of the greasy sweat landed in your mouth. You accidentally swallowed the foul liquid and felt bitter from the sour sweat being smeared over you as Monoma squished you around. Darkness soon took over as Monoma removed his hand and lowered his arm, smooshing you in a hot cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonoma smugly grinned as he adjusted his shirt, feeling the faint speck in his warm and wet pit. He already felt eager to show you how beneath him you were, but best keep you warm for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

The warm and putrid odor of the armpits sour sweat burned your nostrils as you breathed it in, it feeling thicker then normal oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonoma grinded his arm against his side with each step, this unfortunately meant you were now pressed into the squishy rank pit, practically getting absorbed into the sweat glands. Not only were your clothes going to smell like sour sweat for who knows how long, but the bitter liquid actually slipped into your mouth. You couldn't even gag as you'd essentially drink the sweat squelching out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonoma smirked as he returned from class, feeling the faint squirming against his pit be squashed with a simple squeeze.   He felt at the top of his game, squished into his pit with his hard earned sweat was one of the mighty class 1-A students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Monoma?\", his classmate Kendo had asked walking by. \"Some members of 1-A were asking about a classmate of theirs, Fukase a tiny guy. Have you seen him at all , he wasn't at their class?\", the orange haired girl said rubbing her head in worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond hummed as he crossed his arms, putting pressure on the student in question. \"Hm no i don't think i have, hopefully they do soon~\", he said seemingly friendly, though he fought the urge to make a smug remark about you not wanting to get wacked by his classmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendo sighed. \"I see, maybe they'll hopefully find him soon.\", the class soon grew more quiet as everyone went to their seats to begin the lesson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonoma grinned as he looked down at his armpit, feeling a tiny speck admist his greasy and putrid skin. <i>\"Sorry insect, but i want to to show you the true crushing power of 1-B. So you'll be spending more time with me, your new giant....friend.\"</i>, Monoma deviously thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day soon continued on, luckily there weren't any other physical lessons to further heat up the pit. Still, Monoma found ways to make the pit squishing worse. While passing Todoroki in the hall, he gave a patt on his shoulder telling him good luck in finding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodoroki accepted it, albeit confused about the sudden nice gesture. Unaware Monoma tapped his neck, particularly on the left side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond then activated the fire side of the quirk he copied, though not enough to make flames but to heat up his body. This caused the already warm pit to heat up as sweat began to pour out of the glands, drenching you in the putrid rank stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonoma cockily grinned as he felt the drops dripping from his pit. \"I hope you don't drown, it be such an embarrassing defeat for 1-A to be matched by someone's sweat! Take it in, this is where you belong and i won't just use my armpits to show it.\", a shadow fell over Monoma's eyes as he smirked toothily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to his dorm, Monoma eagerly swayed his arms to squeeze you as he thought of the other ways he could humiliate you. Arriving in his room, the blond hummed as he threw off his jacket, smirking as the sides of his button up were soaked in sour stench and liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping off his shirt to show his muscular torso, Monoma decided to...</span></div></div>",

Having graduated from U.A you were ready to take on the world and fight villains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so you thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a new hero you admitted the excitement went to your head as you believed you could beat any foe. Your quirk allowed you to heat up parts if your body, to the point where you could produce fire from your skin and delivery devastating attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a quiet night, you were patrolling as you wanted to use as many hours as possible, just to get the full hero experience. Hearing communication coming from a alley, you rushed over suspicious of the late night chatters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the alleyway three punk looking men were chatting. One with a mohawk raised his eyebrow. \"Why the hell are we scouting when we could be breaking skulls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man with pointed ears and tanned skin tched. \"The boss wants a hero, for whatever reason i don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you three doing?\", Rin said dramatically pointing at them. The group looked confused at the bombastic hero. \"The hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin smirked as he flicked his nose. \"It ends here villians!\", erupting his fist in fire, Rin charged forward with a battle cry. The trio didn't move or look intimidated, the mohawk glance at the third member a purplenette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple haird villian held out his hand, producing a flash. Rin yelped as he covered his eyes and fell onto his back. The hero suddenly felt faint as his vision blurred, he could vaguely see the trio standing over, looking like giants from this ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tan man smirked. \"Huh whatta you know our hero came right to us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin groaned as he sunk into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up Rin immediately felt distraught as the concrete ground he had passed out on was now that of wood. There wasn't a breeze of cool air and the atmosphere felt like that of an inside one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh finally up hero?\", a voice boomed down from above, it was raspy and had a mocking tone. Booming loud enough to seem as if it came from hundreds of feet above. You thought maybe it was a intercom, perhaps you were taken to a warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a large object crashed down in front of you, a large force of impact sent you flying back a few feet. The object in front of you appeared to be a red...shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you felt dread fill you as from a long pair of black cloaked legs leading up to a literal giant sitting on a bar stool. From the top through shaggy blue tint hair was a pair of red eyes looking down at you with disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right where you belong, the hero scum is just dirt to get trampled! Consider yourself lucky you'll be the first bug i crush.\", the red eyed giant sneered as he eerily grinned, resisting the urge to raise his foot and squash you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook as you felt fear, true fear. Before you wasn't just a giant but you recognized the look of this titan. Recently there had been a attack at U.A, luckily no one pershished. But they tell the other heroes to be on the look out for a villain that resembled this giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShigaraki narrowed his eyes as he suddenly bend down and reached for Rin. Using his thumb and finger, the giant plucked up the speck grinning widly as the hero squirmed. \"Oh can't talk, that's no issue I'll have you squeal when your duty as my toy begins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in fear and dread as you were held before the face of the league of villian's leader Shigaraki Tomura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then my toy, let's....</span></div></div>",

But as she looked around, and the girl quickly noticed that everything that is\u2026gigantic. And then she noticed a bunch of shoes that belong to a girl her age. They were awfully cute, and the owner has a very good taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the thing that really amazed her is the <i>size</i> of them. Not the oblivious \"Wow I'm so tiny\" way, but in a \"Do these actually belong to human?\" Linda of way. Even if she is normal size, they would still be pretty darn <b><u>gigantic</u></b>. But strangely enough, they are strangely alluring to her. And the one closest to her was a yellowish green flipflop with pink straps that has a colorful red rose in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a big shadow is looming over her. With unease filling her belly, the girl slowly turned around and saw a gigantic Japanese girl around her age. Her hazelnut orbs that beamed with such friendliness and gentle curiosity that it made the girl's tension just fades away. And her big smile is just warm sunshine in physical form. She wearing a baggy green colored long sleeves which covered her hands entirely. And she is wearing some rather snug looking black leggings. And finally, her long and high arched bare feet\u2026are pretty much proving your assumption is very correct. But weirdly enough, the sight of the girl and her feet made your cheeks rather warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya I'm Kuki Sanban! What's your name!\" The named girl happily greeted her guest. While being totally uncaring to said girl's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My..name is Jacqueline Marsden.Nice to..meet you Kuki.\" Jacqueline meekly replied to the girl. The tone of her voice is a clear indication that she is a little perturbed by the girl's sheer friendliness and warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you! Want to play some games?\" Kuki happily questioned you with an eager bubbliness just dripping in her voice. Jacqueline just nodded in total surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuki squealed in delight and turned her back to her new friend. She's going to find the best game for them to play with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline on the hand turned her attention towards the sandal. A rather bizarre curiosity compelled her to get closer to it. Once she just got close, she inspected. The sight of the massive and deep imprint is simply jaw-dropping. It truly showed the scale of Kuki's feet. And it's dark color is making her cheeks is even warmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl brought her face close to the shoe. She was blindsided by the stale but surely still <i>strong</i> aroma of sour cheese, stale corn chips, and very faded fruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Jacqueline..what are you doing?' Kuki questioned with confusion on her face. The embarrassed girl quickly removed her face from the shoe. Then worry and shame came on her Kuki's face as she comes up with a possible answer. \"Do my shoes smell that <i>bad</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the hyperactive and fun-filled lifestyle of a KND operative. You tend to be very smelly in <i>certian</i> places. A lot of her fellow operatives use this \"places\" to gross each other or more importantly use them as a weapon against adults and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she is not one of those kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-oh, it's not that. They just so...big like your feet!\"The girl halfway lied to the bigger girl with shakily smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuki's eyebrow twitched at the \"big feet\" remark. She bit back the urge to insult her guest about her own feet which are way too <u><i><b>little</b></i></u>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're also..very cute too!\"The girl quickly added with genuine honest. The comment made Kuki produce a big blush, and strange quivering expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment made Kuki feel weird. But in a good but <i>fuzzy</i> way.Suddenly her smile came back stronger than ever! She got a most wonderful idea for a game. She sat down on the floor and crossed her feet in Jacqueline's direction. Her long toes and their amateurishly rainbow-colored nails pointed directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you think they are cute. Then let's play a game with my feet!\"Kuki playfully exclaimed to her new friend. The girl kinda eagerly nodded, and slowly walk to them. She really wants too see them up close and personal right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happens next?</span></div></div>",

Is it gonna rain?\" Luffy grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, it's just a passing cloud...doesn't even look like a storm.\" Nami sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as those words left the navigator's mouth, a strange mist seemed to envelop the Going Merry. \"Uhh, what's going on?\" Usopp questioned. \"Come on, this is creepy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro was snoozing away as the strange mist covered the ship like a fog. It slipped into the kitchen where Sanji was stirring the pot of stew. Everyone seemed to feel strange..except for the happy go lucky captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys! This is weiiird!\" Luffy cheerfully exclaimed as he turned around...only to notice that the three crew members who were out on deck just seconds ago had vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Luffy leaped down onto the ship, causing an enormous earthquake for his unnoticed and confused crewmates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji was in the kitchen, standing on the counter at a miniature size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami was standing out on deck alongside Usopp and the still snoring Zoro. They were confused until they were knocked off their feet by the booming voice and subsequent earthquake.</span></div></div>",

This was proven when he gawked as the wooden floor now seem to go on for miles. In the distance he could make out two familiar figures that looked like Usopp and Nami, they both were looking forward and up with shock. The look soon fell on his face as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a mile away to them was a towering mountain with the red and blue clothes of thier captain and his straw hat head at the top turning in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm Guys! Where'd you go!?\", Luffy called out in a booming voice that was amplified of his usual voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi down here!\", Zoro called as he began dashing up to their now giant captain. Getting closer, Zoro saw Luffy's face in the sky looking around quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoro wait!\", Nami called out panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, What's...\", Zoro froze as he saw the reason for the navigatior's cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Luffy's face was no longer visible. Instead filling Zoro's sky was the sole of Luffy's sandal, coming down at a fast speed. Despite the impending stomp, Zora took notice of the dirt in the treads and even what looked like pieces of crushed bugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swordsman finally took action and jumped to the side just as Luffy stomped the ground. He stayed laying down as the foot rose and passed over him and with booming steps, now Zoro was right between the captain's giant feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro brought a hand to his face as a strong odor reached his nose. On a ship where the sun shines, people was bound to  sweat. But Luffy took the cake for the most produced sweat. And the cheesy musk was surrounding Zoro as he was between the stompers of his now giant captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi Luffy down here!\", Zoro tried yelling up despite the smell making him cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon...</span></div></div>",

Ed had been crashing at her place since he'd regained his limbs and proposed to her that day. His arm and leg were human again but at the cost of his alchemy he brought Alphonse back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now, Winry was pretty shocked when the crystal started to glow and she was reduced to a mere 2 inches in height! \"Oh nooo what the hell!?!\" Winry squeaked at her new diminutive height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden rumbling roar made her jump, turning in the direction of the sound...she saw Ed, his hair out of its traditional braid and his large and visibly sweaty feet propped up on the coffee table...as the boy was asleep on the couch and snoring away which explained the 'roar'.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Winry felt a shiver run through her spine as she saw how big her fiance was, sleeping shirtless with only his black trousers on. His arms were draped over the back and made his toned muscles stretch out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny mechanic couldn't help but blush despite the worry that came with the situation. Winry took a deep breath before running across the room to the towering coffee table. She grabbed onto the wooden pillar and carefully started scaling it, coming to few close calls of sliding down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting as she finally made it to the top, Winry flopped onto the top relieved that at least part of the challenge was over. She was reminded of the next when a chessy scent hit her nose, and a couple of yards away stood the large soles of Ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Winry approached the damp looking soles, she held a hand to her face as the faint smell increased dramatically. The chessy funk now floated her nostrils as she stood directly before the towering soles. Ed's snoozing face was visibly between his feet, far off unaware of his wife now tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack, was he not wearing socks again?\", Winry asked no one as she thought of all the times Ed's feet were swimming in sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the stench, Winry thought this would be her best bet to get Ed's attention. When they were children the Elric would always complain if she tickled his feet. The steaming soles looked a bit rough, but hopefully Winry could get Ed's attention. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Winry was now close enough to the funky smelling soles to reach out and touch them...albeit reluctantly at that. \"Grr...I HAVE to...even though this is soo gross...\" Winry groaned and removed her hand from her face, turning slightly green as the steamy stench blasted her in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I'm going to MAKE him wear socks with those boots from now on.\" Winry said with a queasy expression, before she dove her hands into the foot. Ed's foot surprisingly had some give to it..even though that caused his murky foot sweat to come oozing out over her hands and arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up you big oaf!\" Winry grunted as she used her fingernails to 'tickle' the giant's feet, even though that caused cheesy grime to get under them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar over on the couch, Ed snorted and started to stir...</span></span></div></div>",

The scientist began to thrash and panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait a minuAAA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was cut off as Ed let go, plunging Archaine into the smelly doom. Landing onto the insole with a noticable SPLASH in the sweat, the temperature hit him at full force. The inside of the boot was like a sauna, with hot air and instead of steam it was filled with a cheesy foot stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACK, OI ALCHIMEST LET ME OUTTA HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis reply was a loud chuckle and the entrance darkening. The cause, Edward's toes beginning to enter the shoe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry bug, my foot will keep you company!\", Ed mockingly called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArchaine began backing up as the foot was shoved in the boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he slipped and landed on the wet ground with a SQUELCH. The scientist watched in horror as the foot passed over and began to lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole then squished down on him, enveloping him in the soft sweaty flesh. Archaine clamped his mouth shut, but the overbearing sweat and smell was shoved in his nose instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot crushed down harder as Ed stood up. The blond hummed as he stomped in place and felt the bug become plastered to his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah~. Alright Al I'll be back soon.\", Ed said walking towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\", Al said to his brother as he heard his brother stepping harder then usual as he closed the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd walked down the hall, humming as each step squished Archaine and drowned him in foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon.......</span></div></div>",

The taste of vomit filled Archaine's mouth as the slimy toe gunk was shoved into his face. The rancid chessy aroma burned his nostrils and began to salt his eyes to the point of tears. The true worst of it came as the two toes started to squeeze the bug's head. Archaine's muffled scream rang out as Ed simply clenched his toes, giving the scientist excruciating pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArchaine believed he was done for. His head felt compressed and ready to pop.

May had hopped a trip back to Amestris to deliver Al to his brother while they came up with some way to restore the younger Elric's height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphonse groaned, \"I'm not looking forward to the teasing Ed's going to give me about being so small compared to him now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay smiled and chuckled slightly, \"I'm sure it won't be THAT bad.

On his torso was a light colored sleeveless shirt...after all Resembool was in the midst of a heat wave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the front door he saw the diminutive Mei Chang holding the teensy weensy Alphonse. He couldn't help it..he started to laugh as he let them in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl's face flushed red and he pouted a bit in Mei's hand. \"Ed...this is serious.\" Mei pleaded with the maniacally laughing boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping a tear from his eye and sighing, Ed nodded. \"Yeah...you can leave him here...I assume you've got stuff to do back in Xing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei nodded and placed Al on the coffee table before the couch, \"Don't worry, I'll research a way to get you back to normal Alphonse!\" Mei declared passionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl nodded, \"I know you will! And I know brother will help too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after Mei departed and Ed closed the front door before flopping on the couch in front of Al. \"So...LITTLE brother....I guess you'll be staying with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl smiled and nodded, \"Yeah, I hope you don't mind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd gained a devious grin, \"You'll need to pull your weight around here...you may be my LITTLE brother but you can't bum off us for free.\" Ed over emphasized the word 'little' deliberately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl gulped.</span></div></div>",

He knew from all their time together that Ed didn't wear socks...part of him had been glad he couldn't smell them back in those days...as they'd always looked dreadfully sweaty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphonse was jerked out of his own thoughts when one of the red soles of Ed's boots propped up against the edge of the table. Ed's hands were gripping either side of the boot and the colossus was grunting with effort. \"Hrrrrgh..!\" Ed's voice rumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Ed...do you need some help?\" Al curiously inquired. His answer was a wet sloshing coming from within the boot, making Al shudder.

She was assisted by almost the entirety of Ed and Al's hometown, word had spread of the newly giant alchemists' return and their successful journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphonse had wandered off to play with the local children who were fascinated with him being a giant now. Winry sat on Ed's chest as the boy was relaxed back in a grassy field out around the Rockbell property. Winry shivered as she could smell Ed's manly scent emitting from his colossal body...particularly his pit stains on his black jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd took notice of this and looked at her concerned, \"Winry...are you alright?\" He asked softly. Winry sighed and looked at his handsome face, \"It's fine...you just kinda stink.\" She teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Ed to blush scarlet and stammer: \"W-well..sorry! I was only busy saving the whole world-!\" Ed began to snap..until Winry snuggled into his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it...it makes me feel....safe....cause you're here.\" She said quietly. Ed blinked in confusion, blushing further before he petted her with his finger. \"Really? Do tell...\" He gained a smug grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinry sighed and sat up, nuzzling his finger. \"So...what can I do to make you feel appreciated then...mister hero?\" She stuck out her tongue teasingly causing him to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...my feet are kinda sore....\" Ed said with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you asking me to rub your stinky GIANT feet? REALLY?\" She jokingly clutched her throat and made gagging noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey, you asked.\" Ed snickered. \"I ain't taken off these boots since before we fought Father...and walked aaall the way here from Central. Just warning you...\" Ed wiggled his eyebrows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinry groaned and smiled, \"I guess I can...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's jaw dropped, \"Wait..you serious?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want a foot rub or not?!\" Winry yelled.</span></div></div>",

With an audible POP, the footwear came of and had a trail of steam flooding out from the insole. Both of Ed's feet were barefoot and had a tint of red from the hot chambers they were kept in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant slowly lowered Winry before his feet that where propped up on the heels. The mechanic closed her eyes as a wave of heat hit her soon followed by her friend's strong scent. Though unlike above there was a cheesy smell to accompany the salty sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand if you feel intimidated, your's truly was working to the extreme.\", Ed said as he placed a hand on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinry sighed. \"The only thing I'm worried about is getting this smell out of my clothes, now stay still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking forward into the strong musky aura, Winry scrunched her nose at the strong smell before reaching forward. Running a hand down the moist sole, she took note of the softness of the plump sole despite being sockless. Placing her other hand on the sole, Winry started running her hands over the mushy sole and kneaded it to message it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd couldn't help but sigh, the feeling may be minuscule but the rubbing was both relaxing and left a tender feeling. He smiled as he saw Winry working hard in tenderizing his sore feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinry heard Ed's delight and grinned as her rubbing was effective. As she covered more area she started to get more used to the strong odor. It was strong and reminded her when they were young and had to practically wrestle to get Ed into the bath. The smell had a sweet tint and reminded her that Ed was back, leading her to blush as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was next?</span></div></div>",

Winry smiled sweetly and did something that surprised them both, she planted a nice kiss on Ed's sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward's eyes widened but he soon gained an intrigued smile, \"So THAT'S why you agreed to do it...you like these bad boys don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinry blushed and removed her lips from Ed's cheesy sole, \"W-what?!

To her surprise however it caused the elder Elric to moan, \"Looks like the only thing those deadly wrenches of yours are good for now is tenderizing my giant feet.\" Ed teased with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up!\" Winry pouted and shared a laugh with the giant Elric. </span></div></div>",

Winry felt herself relax as the heartbeat rang out from Ed's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you did a good job rubbing, I don't think anybody could make me feel as relax as you.\", Ed softly said as he rubbed Winry's head with his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm going to have to get use to it.

Though one thing stayed in his head, he was with Winry and felt his heart burst as he thought of a future of them together. He wondered if children were possible, but that was a headache for another day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sunset, Winry began to shiver slightly from the cool air.

After all, we wouldn't want you spoiling your dinner.\" Sebastian said coyly as he departed the study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Phantomhive scowled at the door and greedily took a chomp of the bun.

It seems Prince Soma was not jesting when he said these were blessed by divine energy.\" Sebastian informed his lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why did that affect me in this way?!\" Ciel growled, his voice rattling the window behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, if I may be so bold...perhaps Prince Soma thought he was doing you some sort of kindness. He does seem to want you to be happy after all.\" Sebastian stated calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How on Earth would that fool think making me this size would make me 'happy'?!\" Ciel roared in frustration at the prince's apparent stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did tell Soma that you wanted revenge on those who hurt you. Perhaps this 'divine' energy mixed with that dark desire and my demonic influence to give you-\" Sebastian began before Ciel interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I'm supposed to stomp right after those bastards to their front door and kick it in? How incredibly short sighted.\" Ciel scoffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Ciel felt that familiar rumbling in his stomach, \"Oh bloody hell, not again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps instead of kicking their front door in...you could stomp the entire building eventually.\" Sebastian chuckled as he watched Ciel begin to grow through the ceiling of his study.</span></div></div>",

Sebastian bowed, \"Yes my lord.\" The demon raced off and left the gargantuan lad to his growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel felt his legs crashing through to the lower rooms and then to the foyer. \"Those three had better be VERY distracted.\" Ciel murmured to himself, his voice becoming louder with each growth spurt. Ciel's head burst forth through the roof of his manor and he was able to see far across his property. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earl's body had caused untold amounts of damage to the Phantomhive Manor. Over half of the stately home was now crumbled to ruins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusting off his clothes of rubble, Ciel sighed and crouched down low. Being careful not to damage the mansion any further, he crept as best he could over to the forested area of his property. Part of the young earl was still grumpy about his mansion being damaged, but he now saw the bright side of his new size..and with it..power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoincidentally Ciel Phantomhive had been hearing underworld mumblings that a homestead out in the country had been purchased by the auctioneer who had sold the young boy to the cult in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the papers Ciel had been looking over was the deed to the property itself that he had 'collected'. Ciel could have just yanked the property out from beneath the man..but that wouldn't be very satisfying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially since the documents detailed the man had a family now. A family...Ciel's family had been taken from him, and this bastard had the nerve to have his own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Phantomhive giant crouched down behind some trees and looked up to see Sebastian standing daintily on one of the limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is taken care of my lord. Not only will those three work to restore the damage, but I laid the blame solely on Bard's explosives. I was so very convincing that even he started to wonder if he had left some dynamite around.\" Sebastian said rather braggishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Sebastian...let's set out to that home that the auctioneer has been raising his family of insects in.\" Ciel grinned wickedly and stood up to his tremendous height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, by my estimation...you are 60ft tall my lord. The perfect height to show your power to these scum.\" Sebastian cheerily encouraged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel nodded, \"Let's get moving.\" Sebastian hopped on Ciel's shoulder and the giant began taking thooming footsteps away from the estate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenndal Wilford was having a nice lunch with his family...the days of auctioning in the underworld had earned him a nice amount of money to settle down with a lovely property. His wife and son had no idea his dark past of course, and Kenneth would like to keep it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when a quake rattled the whole house! \"W-what on Earth was that?!\" His wife asked worriedly, before another one,  closer this time, knocked several plates off the shelves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure...perhaps an earthquake?\" Kenneth said in confusion, but deep down he had a rather ominous feeling about the series of quakes that were continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quakes stopped when the house was encased in shadow. Looking out the window his wife screamed and fainted, as Kenneth ran to her aid, he heard a deep rumbling voice...that somehow seemed rather familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenndal Wilford, your judgement has come!\" Ciel boomed from outside the house, towering into the sky.</span></div></div>",

Ciel wiggled his free toes with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, create this city.\", the earl ordered. Nicholas nodded and began walking to the center of the room, feeling the ground shake as Ciel followed him. As Nicholas stopped, he gulped as he was covered in Ciel's shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing, Nicholas summoned a miniature city about the size of Ciel's desk. The servent himself was a giant as the buildings went up to his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Nicholas concentrated on summoning people smaller then him to fit the city. He was glad that the people to suffer Ciel's playful wrath would be criminals and not innocents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the city, multiple confused voices squeaked out. Some had been in gang meetings and others had just pulled out thier weapon to mug a poor soul. Thier attention was brought up as they first saw a giant in a butler uniform, and shock turned into horror as they saw the Queen's Watchdog Ciel Phantomhive as a titan looming above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel smirked, he may not be able to see thier faces but he knew the insects must be horrified. The earl reached down and picked up Nicholas, placing the tiny man on his left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you like a front row seat.\", Ciel asked with a mischievous grin. Nicholas quickly nodded, opting to stay silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinies watched wide eyed as thier sky was replaced with a pale sole that began dripping large drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farewell~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel brought his foot down heel first. He felt all the fake building crumble beneath his sole. He also took note of a additional popping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinies snapped out of thier stupor and began to yell and flee wherever they could. One man gazed shocked as the white toe sat in front of him. A splash of red coated the ground as the man beneath it was claimed instead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How interesting, you're so small. Yet i can still feel your pathetic bodies pop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing his foot up, much debris fell back to the city. A good amount stuck to Ciel's sole due to his sweat. Particularly the red splat marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say insect, this was a pleasant idea.\", Ciel gave a sorta friendly smirk at Nicholas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, how did Ciel have fun with his new city?</span></div></div>",

I'm sure my foot odor is keeping them warm a plenty. But I think they could us a 'blanket'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicholas caught on before nodding. Soon a pair of Ciel's socks appeared in front of the Earl and servent. They were dark blue and had a few wrinkles, as well as some damp spots. The used socks lowered to Ciel's pale feet and began to slip on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel hummed as the socks covered his feet, already beginning to warm them. These bugs would experience the worst of his foot odor all while being mere specks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was next?</span></div></div>",

With a mere thought, Nicholas had Ciel teleport behind his desk in his office chair, and the chair his Earl had been sitting on in the center of the room had vanished. Ciel's shoes were now on his feet, a fact that caused Ciel to smirk slyly and wiggle his toes a bit within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all took place within two seconds or so...Nicholas was getting the hang of these demon powers it seemed. \"Come in.\" Ciel called out, Sebastian entering a moment after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is dinner time, young master. I take it you are enjoying little Nicholas' company?\" Sebastian said, smiling. Ciel chuckled, \"He's quite talented with that magic you've gifted him with.\" Ciel stood up and stepped out behind the desk and began to walk to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose we should introduce him to the three other servants?\" Sebastian inquired as Ciel stopped his advance. \"Hm...I suppose he will be employed here...and he could also keep an eye on them given how you tend to let Bard blow up the kitchens and Mey-Rin's clumsy mistakes as well as Finny's naivety get the better of you.\" Ciel said with a grin as he teased his butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebastian turned to the desk where Nicholas was standing, \"Would you like me to return him to a more normal size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I quite like the size he is at....I'm sure those three will be quite intrigued by him...especially once they hear he is from the future. I am sure he'll be bombarded with questions.\" Ciel deviously smirked at Nicholas, this was his way of 'hazing' the newbie...despite having already quite literally walked on him today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good my lord.\" Sebastian bowed as Ciel went downstairs to have dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-Soon after-</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMey-Rin, Finny and Bard were gathered outside where Pluto was curled up and getting a belly rub from Finnian.

Sebastian was a force that always brought attention and slight fear with his presence. Thier attention was however drawn to the small figure on Sebastian's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first glance, the figure may appear to be that of a lifelike doll. These thoughts were discarded as they could see the \"doll\" moved it's head and blinked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah your all together, good.\", Sebastian greeted them not reacting to thier shocked faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S..sebastian...your shoulder!\", Mey-Rin pointed a shaky finger at Nicholas who awkwardly scratched his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebastian simply glanced at the tiny butler and quickly used his finger to stop the scratching. \"Ah yes as you can see we will be having another servent aid us in servicing lord Phantomhive. He is called Nicholas.\", the demon calmly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's one thing, but Sebastian....he's tiny! Even Finny's a giant to him.\", Bard exclaimed scratching his head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be no issue, Nicholas will be able to assist me plentiful. Not to mention he does well at entertaining others.\", Sebastian brought his gloved hand to his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Nicholas stepped onto the white palm. He was held before the three, feeling Sebastian's strong gaze above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I believe you should introduce yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three servents quickly tried to compose themselves as they stood up straight in front of the demon and his tiny. Finny took a step forward first, smiling down at Nicholas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name is Finnian! But you can call me Finny. I tend to the garden!\" Nicholas smiled at the bright nature of the young servent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBard walked forward next, a friendly grin on his face. \"I'm Baldroy, you can call be Bard. I work in the kitchen and really turn up the heat when it comes to cooking!\", Bard chuckled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicholas could pick up a American like accent from the stubble man. He could also feel Sebastian tense up his hand slightly as heat was mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMey-Rin came forward last and bowed. Standing up, she tried looking to where she thought Nicholas was, seeing multiple visions of the little servant through her glasses. \"Oh..hello I'm Mey-Rin! I help out as a maid around the manor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicholas smiled, all three seemed to have very interesting character. However, confusion hit him as the large white dog on the ground was no longer there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny servent suddenly fell back onto the soft ground with a yelp as a new face suddenly popped up in front of him. The newcomer was a man with long white hair and red eyes, also a pair of small fangs. Despite the man bringing his face closer to Nicholas, Sebastian didn't move his palm or interfere in any way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white haired man sniffed Nicholas much like a dog would. The tiny butler looked in fear as the slit eyes stared intently at him and the large sniffs made his suit pull towards the nostrils slightly. The sniffing stopped and the dog-like man suddenly had a happy look on his face as he let out a bark like noise. Nicholas then found the large pale nose nuzzling him as the man closed his eyes and let out pleased growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....good boy?\", Nicholas slowly rubbed the nose and the man's moaned growls grew louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, it seems Pluto's Taken a liking to you.\", Sebastian stated amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto backed away, and Nicholas blushed as he saw the dog man was nude as his toned torso was exposed. Sebastian let out a small sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now's a better time then ever to go inside. Hopefully all of us will be dressed soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back towards the manor, Sebastian placed Nicholas back on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside........</span></div></div>",

I'm also curious if you can sense if they are still alive?\" Ciel inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicholas concentrated and sure enough he could sense the remaining souls of the criminals within the city between the boy's toes within his footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a good number of them still alive, my lord...though they probably wish they weren't.\" Nicholas grinned devilishly, causing Ciel to chuckle darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You give me quite the idea, make them un-killable for now....I want to extend their suffering for as long as possible. Perhaps they shall fester in there overnight...should I wish.\" Ciel grinned demonically and Nick chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a single thought, the tiny prisoners were made durable enough that they wouldn't die from the heat or miasma of the Earl's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel sat back in his chair and sighed, \"I am quite glad I have a servant like you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you my lord! That means a lot!\" Nicholas chirped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after this Ciel called for Sebastian and the three of them ventured up to the Earl's bedroom. Sebastian dressed Ciel in his nightclothes and expected Ciel to ask him to stay there until he fell asleep. However, the tall butler was surprised when his master declared: \"You may go perform other duties, Sebastian. Little Nicholas shall stay with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebastian was glad he wouldn't have to stand there for most of the night...that was never very enjoyable. \"As you wish, my lord.\" Sebastian bowed and exited the room, closing the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at Ciel's feet, Nicholas saw that the Earl still had his odorous socks on. \"Are you going to wear them to bed, master?\" Nicholas asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Ciel grinned diabolically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However...I do think I shall remove the sock which doesn't contain the city for now...I want you to shrink down quite small until you can fit in between my noble toes. I want you to praise me as if I am your god.\" Ciel said in a hushed tone, the power of lording over someone so small was addicting...and the boy wanted MORE.</span></div></div>",

He watched in glee as Nicholas dwindled down from his already small size. Soon Ciel held up his pointer finger that had a single speck standing on top, he had to squint in order to see Nicholas standing in the creases of his finger.

Soon the air shifted around him and became filled with the familiar chessy foot odor of the Phantomhive earl. The massive toe gap was below the tiny servent, stretching out like a canyon and releasing burst of foul odor. The flesh platform soon tilted as Ciel dropped Nicholas towards the toe gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny servent used his power to slow his descend and felt the air get thicker and more heavy with the chesse being tripled as Nicholas landed on the slimy flesh. He decided to please his lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Thank you my lord! This is the greatest honor I could ever receive!</i>\", Nicholas said to Ciel in a telepathic message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earl smirked as he laid down. \"<i>If you're so grateful, prove it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicholas kneeled onto the stinky ground before leaning down and pressing a kiss to the ground, getting a cheese taste in his mouth.

Finally, with an audible <b>POP</b>, Ciel's heel came out of the dress shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thin stocking was visibly soaked through, steam poured out of the mouth of the shoe as Ciel reached forward and gripped the toe of the footwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel's face loomed above Nick like some kind of Victorian deity. Ciel took his time, his smug grin widening as he slowly pulled the loosened dress shoe off the rest of his humongous appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fufufu, I do so enjoy your new size...you are far punier than ever before aren't you?\" Ciel's voice boomed down to the 1cm servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicholas whimpered but gave a \"Yes my lord!\" This was despite the fact that the young giant couldn't even hear the tiny demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel licked his lips and popped off his second dress shoe, placing them down on the floor beneath the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, use that significant strength of yours to remove my stockings.

The closer the speck sized boy got to the foot, the stronger the heat and stench pouring off of it became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the admittedly diluted miasma, Nicholas thanked whatever gods there were for the stockings covering Ciel's colossal feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStockings he was now tasked with pulling off...at 1 centimeter in height. Gulping, Nick took handfuls of the soggy stocking on Ciel's right foot. Nicholas cringed as what seemed like gallons of sweat oozed out of the fibers and ran down his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicholas held onto the stocking, and began to walk backwards.</span></div></div>",

They were the definition on how a woman's lower extremities should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlim and delicate. Her toes were at a good balance. Not long to the point where they are skeletal. And not to the point of being chunky and bloated. The petite undersoles had a little bit of fat. Your spoiled little heart would have swooned over this...if it wasn't for the positively <b>disgusting</b> smell it carried. You and Elizabeth's face cringed as the acidic perfume of sour milk and vinegar made your nostrils itch. The sight of the dripping sweat and the specky crevices of her toes deeply disgusted you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe state of her feet was like the greatest insult to you. How can such a cute weapon that has even cuter feet not take care of them. It was a downright horrific insult to you as a female. Something her older sister will vehemently agree about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's play Jack and the Beanstalk little witchy!\" Patti cooed as right foot gently stamped on her new friend with an audible <b>squish</b>.

At least they aren't in the shape of younger sister. The only other people she know who feet makes squishing sounds are Black*star and Maka.

You grew up in a church in the village of Hage with others like you, children left alone by thier parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing up, you never really had much confidence in your magic. Unlike your friend Yuno who was gifted, you often did little feats with your power. Your magic was related to size, or the ability to shift it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that much for others. You could only grow other people about a foot at most. A real display was when you used your magic on yourself. You were able to dwindle down to a inch, and could see the world from a bug's prospective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may not be combat efficient, but it was fun being able to sit on others heads and be carried in a palm. Sure you did get bullied sometimes, and may have been on the receiving end of a stomp. But your friends always helped in times of need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne stood out among them all, a spiky haired boy named Asta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen was easy to spot with his loud voice and fast movement. Asta may lack magic but he certainly made up for it in muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsta spend a lot of time working out and you did keep him company sometimes. You'd even shrink and watch his hunky body from below. The loud boy always laughed and thought you just liked shrinking. But truth be told, watching Asta looming over you as a giant always brought a blush to your face.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"Oi Zana!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sitting outside, enjoying the weather when you heard the familiar loud voice. Looking behind you, Asta was jogging up to you with that signature grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Asta.\", you meekly said. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsta pointed towards the woods. \"I'm gonna go workout a bit! Wanna join me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and stood up before starting to walk towards the direction of Asta's finger. You were stopped as you felt your friend grab your shoulder. Asta looked at you confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you gonna shrink Zana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked before nodding. A tingling overcame you body as it glowed. The next thing you know your face was facing Asta's waist, then knees, and finally the white tips of his shoes slightly taller then you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you saw Asta's grinning face before it was replaced by his approaching palm that scooped you up and held you in front of his green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! I like when you shrink Zana!\", Asta's loud voice said as it vibrated the air. \"You look more cute like this!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your face head up as Asta reached his palm to his head and slipped you into his hair. As the silver haired boy dashed into the woods, you held onto his headband to avoid flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsta soon arrived in a clearing before grabbing you and putting your body on a nearby rock. You then watched in awe as the teen pulled his shirt off, exposing his toned biceps and strong chest with abs. Asta stretched his arms over his chest before scooping you back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoshi Yoshi!, I'm gonna secure you now Zana ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and blushed as you were brought to Asta's firm pecs. Whenever you shrank Asta always enjoys putting you somewhere on his body. He says it's fun and always feel more pumped having you stuffed somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing you at the top of his pec crevice, Asta slowly let go. You slid into the canyon of pecs before stopping as the two muscles held you in place. The pressure increased as Asta bounced his pecs and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud boy then laid on the ground before beginning to do push ups. He felt his muscles clench as he felt your small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing surrounded by the pecs was on thing, but the accompanying sounds made it better. You not only heard Asta's heavy breaths but also his loud heartbeat surrounded you. It became warmer as the pecs squeezed you and sweat began to slip down the crevice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile as Asta was doing his pushups, he looked down at his chest. He grinned and laughed thinking of how his body was protecting you.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Due to how slick his torso was, it was a wonder you hadn't come loose sooner. You squirmed as Asta grunted out his count with each push. \"Six thousand twenty! Six thousand twenty one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself plummeting to the ground. \"Asta! Heeelp!\" You yelled out, gaining the silver haired giant's attention just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding himself up with one arm, he caught you in the palm of his other hand. \"Whoa! That was close! I think its break time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsta flopped on his rear and wiped his brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... I've just started and I'm sweating! Hehe, hope you don't mind.

It was dark, slightly moist but warm, the feeling of the few hairs in Asta's pits brushing your body from time to time and hearing nothing but your giant friends muffled voice counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Asta had finished his sit ups and lifted up his arm and you squeezed your eyes together because of the light rushing in.<br>\r\n\"So here we go!

If you wanted to be of any use you'd have to become physically stronger!<br>\r\n\"A-Alright! And what did you have in mind? Lifting weights?\"<br>\r\n\"No, nothing like that! With your shrunken form we have some advantages when it comes to training. Ever since I listened to you talking to yourself I thought about how we could train! My chest is big enough for you to runaround on it, my hand or even my finger are strong enough for sparing, and so on.<br>\r\nAnd with your first training session we can kill two birds with one stone.\"  Asta sat down and leaned forward, taking his shoes off and thus reveal his feet, drenched in sweat from his workout.<br>\r\n\"You are going to massage my feet! This way my feet can get some air to breath and some relaxation and you can strengten your arms!\"<br>\r\n\"Massage your feet? U-Uhh might I ask what other things you came up with?\" you asked the Giant curiously and a bit scared.<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna give away all of it, most of it should be a surprise, but I guess I can tell you some things. You got a couple of advantages that I don't have when it comes to training. With your small size you can practically train anywhere. Here out in the woods with me, indoors, etc. So some parts of your workout will be parallel to mine out here, you could run laps around my body while I do sit-ups, try and dodge my drops of sweat while I do push ups or massage me after my workout.<br>\r\nOther times you will train when we are at the orphanage- push my shoes around or dodge the feet of the boys and girls. So you can get stronger, faster and more durable in as little time as possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazazed about how much thought Asta had giving this, the training methods may be... exotic to say the least but you had to try it. Asta always managed to ignite a fire in you and made you feel like anything is possible.<br>\r\n\"A-Alright! I'll do it, so that I can become a magic knight! And Asta, don't show mercy with me. If I try to chicken out of this, force me! If I try to give up, punish me! I want to serve the kingdom together with you and Yuno!\"<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit! So let's not waste anymore time, massage my feet!\" Asta said with a big grin on his face.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sir!\" You moved towards Asta's giant feet and put your hands against the moist skin.<br>\r\nThe smell was nothing really new to you, thanks to your training sessions you experienced most of Asta's body odor first hand. Sometimes the smell stuck to you for days before you were able to completely wash it off. His feet were surprisingly soft, they had a few rough spots, but you were sure his feet would have a whole other feeling to them.<br>\r\nYou soon understood why Asta thought of it as a training, at your size it was hard to push the flesh around and the moist skin didn't make it any easier for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you started to get exhausted after just 10 minutes, Asta watched you with sparkling eyes- it felt great. Not only was it fun for him to see how someone tiny massaged his feet, it was relaxing. Not to talk about that he was actually helping his friend by having his feet massaged!<br>\r\nThe giant boy happily hummed as he thought of even more training options for you.</span></div></div>",

The kimeno clad man swiftly passed a shiny apple into Mahiru's basket his red eyes narrowing as he was gone within the next second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking out his groceries, Mahiru smiled as he exited the store. Meanwhile Tsubaki watched with a sly smile as he chuckled. \"I hope you enjoy my gift Mahiru Shirota, it will definitely give you a...different perspective.\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nMahiru smiled as he walked into his apartment, opening his bookbag he scooped out the snoozing black cat. \"Kuro wake up we're home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat yawned before sighing as it hopped to the floor. Walking over to a pile of pillows, the cat poofed before a familiar bluenette flopped onto the pile. Kuro yawned stretching out. \"How long were you out Mahiru? I can tell whea nap goes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru hummed as he walked into the kitchen. \"I needed to get ingredients for dinner and there was a sale so you know it was busy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire put his hands behind his head as he lounged back, he could've gone for some instant ramen but Mahiru was being eager to cook a hot meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......not that he minded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out the ingredients for a katsudon dish, Mahiru rose an eyebrow as among the groceries was an apple. It looked like it came straight from a fairy tale as it shined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't remember buying this, why would i need an apple for katsudon?\", picking up the fruit Mahiru didn't know what compelled him, but he took a bite out of the fruit. Mahiru's eyes widened at the fresh taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow i didn't know they had these on sale!\", Mahiru smiled as he took another bite. \"I definitely should buy some mor-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette suddenly gasped as a strange feeling came over him, a strange light headedness. Before he could sit down, Mahiru gasped as before his eyes the counter was now at the level of his eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond by second, the ground drew closer and the ceiling of the kitchen rose higher. Soon Mahiru stood in shock as the kitchen appliances now loomed into the sky like skyscrapers! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru yelped as suddenly the ground shook as the apple fell down beside him, almost flattening him like a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what is this?! How did i...was it the apple, what the heck happened?!\", Mahiru yelled in panic as he looked up the looming counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mahiru you ok?\", Kuro's voice boomed from the other room. Mahiru perked up as he heard his Servamp's voice. \"Kuro quick get in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eve began to jog as quick as he could to the entrance of the kitchen, though the shrunken size began to show as after a minute of jogging, Mahiru only tredded a foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping to catch his breath, Mahiru sighed. \"I need to get to Kuro, i don't know how but maybe he'll know something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could jog again, the ground suddenly began to shake. Mahiru tried steading himself as the ground shook like that of...steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mahiru?\", the booming voice of Kuro boomed as he entered the kitchen. He held onto his tired look, though his eyes grew concerned as he couldn't find his brunette eve. Yet he wasn't feeling a separation so he couldn't be far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru ran up and looked up in awe as the looming giant form of Kuro stretched into the sky. The vampire's black boots sat on each side of him, looking to be as big as houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuro down here!\", Mahiru yelled as loud as he could and waved his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuro...</span></div></div>",

Sitting by the fountain of the wide courtyard, Misono had a small table with tea freshly poured. However, the purplenette declined taking a sip as he tapped his finger with a troubled look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright butterfly that was his servamp soon perched on the armrest of Misono's chair. \"You seemed troubled, you're not one to let your tea get cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisono sighed as he put a palm to his forehead. His source of frustration came with a bad run in with Tsubaki's subclasses yesterday, he wasn't troubled for himself but what happened to his friend Mahiru. The brunette had rushed in not to mention wasn't as good as ge could be with his lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru had gotten a few injuries and luckily they got away. While he usually kept up his high front mannerisms, Misono was both worried and angered at Mahiru getting hurt due to recklessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear he rushes in and dosen't even make sloth take any blood! He still knows so little about being a eve.\", Misono ranted before softening his gaze. \"I don't want to him...i can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun set and the night sky pulled over, Snow Lily fluttered up before landing beside the seat of his eve in his vampire form. The blond hummed as he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want Mahiru Shirota to be better trained as a eve, i knew you cared for him~\", Lily closed his eyes with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisono flushed. \"S-shut up, and yes...i do wish for him to be a better eve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servamp looked off before suddenly pulling a small vile out of his pocket and setting it on the table. Misono looked confused at the honey like substance. \"Lily what is..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a old formula your family locked up, even before i was serving you it was in the Alicein vaults. They say it could give who ever consumed it...a smaller perspective.\", the vampire explained recalling past stories he heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisono blinked in thought before thinking over what his servamp said. A different perspective, that could help teach Mahiru? Perhaps he could make a plan out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"Why do you think Misono called us this early?\", Mahiru asked as he walked with Kuro on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat let out a small groan as he slumped tiredly. \"I don't know, how troublesome we had to wake up early.\", Mahiru sweatdropped as they only woke up at 8 a.m.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the large Alicein manor, Mahiru couldn't help but still be in awe of his new friend's home. Before he could knock, the door opened and they were greeted by Mari and Yuri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for coming Mahiru and Sleepy Ash, Misano is waiting.\", the subclasses said in sync.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette awkwardly chuckled before nodding. \"Yeah..no problem lead the way-GAH!\", Mahiru groaned in pain as his shoulder still stung from the scuffle with Tsubaki's subclasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuro opened his eyes. \"Mahiru i told you to take it easy.\", Mari and Yuri looked concerned before nodding to each other. \"Please come with us, Misono can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eve followed the two subclasses through the decorated halls. Mahiru was curious as to what the rich boy had in store, calling him out of the blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they arrived at a wide lavish room, Misono had his hands clasped and three cups of tea were layed out on the table. Lily smiled as he saw the visitors arrive. \"Thank you Mari and Yuri, and welcome big brother and Mahiru, please sit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sorry if we're late, you kinda called outta the blue.\", Kuro lazily said popping out of cat form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisono sighed. \"I called you both here because we need to discuss your method of fighting. Or rather...your lack of strategy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru frowned as he took a seat. \"Look i know this is about that fight but i thought i could incapacitate Belk-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You nearly were killed, you are lucky the worst he did was bruise you!\", Misono snapped as he hit the table. \"Do you think the people care about you wish to see you another casualty of this war!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru widened his eyes before unconsciously touching the bandaid on his cheek. Misono took a deep breath before relaxing into his chair, feeling faint already from that outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look i just want to teach you not to be so reckless in the face of danger. But first why don't we have some tea.\", Misono gave a small smile before picking up his cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension slowly vanished an Mahiru smiled as he nodded picking up his cup, not noticing how his and Kuro's appeared a different color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily smiled as he leaned down. \"Tea is always a warm welcome, especially when occupied by..\", the servamp said beginning to slip off his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisono spit out his tea. \"Don't strip the tea's enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru chuckled as he sipped the tea along with Kuro, a sweet honey taste hit his taste buds. \"How this tea is amazing Miso-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the brunette could continue he suddenly felt weightless before it felt as if he was falling.

Walking back over to Misono, the servamp placed the now tiny pair onto his open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisono gave a determined look at the inch tall figures on his palm. \"Now, i can teach you how to not treat a fight like child's play.

Looking around, Mahiru saw they appeared to be in some sort of labyrinth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where...are we?\" Mahiru inquired aloud, looking up he saw their ceiling was made up of some sort of clear surface. There were holes dotted across the ceiling. But looking past that transparency...he saw they were indeed still in Misono's mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright..I give up...what kind of crap is this?! This isn't simple at all!\" Mahiru complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\" A booming...and somewhat familiar voice rumbled down to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir prison shifted, and Mahiru felt as if the entire world was shaking and falling apart. Kuro remained dozing, either uninterested or uncaring about what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru fell on his rear and looked up to see none other than Misono himself...a giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Misono!? What the hell! You're huge!\" Mahiru yelled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple haired rich boy couldn't help but gain a smug grin on his face. He always had disliked being short compared to others. \"This is how I intend to show you how to be a proper Eve...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By shrinking us? I don't get it...\" Mahiru said doubtfully. Misono chuckled darkly, \"That maze you find yourselves in has been built on to my normal footwear EXACTLY to my specifications! Consider this an endurance test...as well as a lesson in team work.\" With that, Misono lifted a visibly sweaty bare foot and slid it into the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru and Kuro's maze prison was thrown into darkness for only a few moments, as the sole came to rest atop the transparent ceiling and press against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiniature lamp posts lit up along the maze, Mahiru blinked. \"Jeez, talk about attention to detail...wait....\" Mahiru looked up in awe to see that..sure enough...Misono's colossal sole was pressed firmly against that transparent ceiling....and was beginning to fill the entire labyrinth with a cheesy smell.</span></div></div>",

Mahiru Shirota smiled as he strolled down the pathway and enjoyed the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette was on his way to his friend and fellow eve's hot hotspring. Tetsu had invited him and Misono over to enjoy the warm baths admist the chilly weather. Kuro was curled up in his scarf trying to stay warm. \"Nyahh, why couldn't we stay home, i could've enjoyed a warm nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru looked amused as he adjusted his scarf. \"Tetsu invited us over after we've been held up as of lately.

A boy in white ripped clothes gasped as he furiously bowed his head. \"Ah I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um it's ok! I was lost in my thoughts i didn't see you.\", Mahiru waved his hands, awkwardly trying to stop the string of apologies coming out of the stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white clad stranger had comedically tears falling as he bowed one more time. \"I'm so so sorry i can't believe myself!\", the crying boy suddenly ran in the opposite direction that the duo were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru blinked slowly as he tried to process what just happened. \"D-did i say something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat servamp sighed as he sank his head back into the scarf. \"S'probably worried about offending people or something, either let's go i wanna take the best nappp..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Mahiru began his trek again attempting to put that strange encounter behind him. Unknownst to him the stranger peeked his head out from behind a tree, looking at his disappearing form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, a orange leaf fell to the ground, only to be crunched into pieces as a wooden sandal stepped on it. Tsubaki hummed as he brought the buzzing phone to his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I-i put the dust on the eve of Sloth, it should effect the next human he comes across.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki cackled as he stepped on another fallen leaf. \"Hehehe finally something interesting, i hope those eves have a grand time!\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"Ah hey you guys are here.\", Tetsu smiled as he let Mahiru and Kuro into the nice building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuro popped into human form as he yawned. \"That walk took forever, couldn't you have used your lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got here in like 30 minutes and no i couldn't fly here we'd be seen!\", Mahiru said his eye twitching at the laziness of his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld child hummed as he peeked over the broad shoulder of his Eve. \"You managed to get Sleepy Ash out of your house that alone is a accomplishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetsu scratched his head as he went to his thoughts. \"Misono got here not to long ago, i made snacks but the other customers got kinda hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru looked curiously at the blond. \"What do you mean got hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoji door suddenly opened quickly to reveal an agitated Misono. \"He means he gave the food meant for us to the other guests! I swear this is why i didn't want to leave him in charge of the snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily popped his head in not irritated like his eve. \"Oh come now I'm sure we could just make some more, the hot springs won't cool down anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetsu nodded and smiled. \"Right I'll make some more! This time their for us got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette sighed but chuckled. \"Well help you out, it'll go a lot faster if we all help out. Kuro you go ahead I'm gonna take my stuff out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuro sighed. \"How troublesome, don't rake forever ok?\", the vampire followed the other to the kitchen to prepare food for the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisono went to follow but rose an eyebrow as he noticed something shining of the brunette's jacket. \"Mahiru...what's that on your back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru blinked as he took his jacket off. \"Huh i don't know, it looks like glitter but it's glowin-wait what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glittering substance suddenly began to intensify, Mahiru and Misono shielded their eyes as the light overtook them. As it dimmed the boys were now no where to be found.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nTetsu hummed as he opened up the door to the room he reserved for his friends. \"Mahiru Mr. Sloth was asking about you and Mr.Lust was worried about getting his clothes dirty cause he started to..huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond blinked as the room was empty, Mahiru backpack was on the table. It was like they just vanished. Tetsu scratched his head confused before momentarily getting a whiff of a sour stench from his under arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah i haven't bathed today i was focused on getting everything ready.\", the blond wasn't bothered by the smell not to mention his earlier push ups didn't help the sweat he shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Mahiru groaned as he woke from his faint spell. \"What..was that?\", Looking over, the brunette gasped as he saw his friend also unconscious. \"Misono are you ok?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing over Mahiru gently shook Misono, the purplenette blinked before quickly sitting and looking around. \"What was that where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the brunette could respond the ground suddenly began to shake, each second a loud thoom crashed into the ground and made the ground move like an earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh what is that!?\", Misono yelped as he stood up and nearly fell over. He and his fellow eve rushed around the building his wooden wall and around the corner. What awaited them was shocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetsu was standing over 200 feet into the sky, his toned body was as high as a mountain much more taller then usual. The thooms were a result of the large firm yet meaty soles of the giant stomping the ground, the smeared sweat slapping against the tatami floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru looked wide eyed at the sight. \"T-that dust must've shrunk us but how when..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisono gridded his teeth. \"I can't believe it....I'm shorter then before how is this fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetsu hummed as he wondered where his friends went.

Now from the blond's height not only did the small forms look unrecognizable, but the squeaking that was his friends didn't even reach his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetsu rubbed the back of his head as he rose an eyebrow. \"Huh what kinda bugs are those? It's cold out so why would we have bugs.\", wiggling his large toes and creating thumbs that shook the ground, Tetsu hummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should probably get rid of them, dad wouldn't want them crawling around.\", Tetsu nodded before he began stomping over to the specks, now forgetting Mahiru's bag on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mahiru and Misono had tried calling up to their friend only for him to not react. They had been hopeful after his blue eyes locked on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisono sighed in relief. \"Thank goodness, now we just have to tell him to look at your jacket. Hopefully he won't shrin-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the voice of Testu boomed down, more mightier then a intercom. Mahiru and Misono widened their eyes as Tetsu had seen them but thought they were invasive bugs. What he said definitely showed how dangerous this predicament was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond began to walk over, the two boys yelped as from a step alone they sent tumbling onto thier backs. The already large soles were now bigger then houses as they carried the giant blond. Tetsu's sweaty soles smooshed against the tatami , a salty and strong scent coming from the firm soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaking stopped but as the boys looked up they gasped. Sitting in front of them was the round and large toes bigger then them, a vinegar salt odor flowed out. But looming high up Tetsu looked down at the dots before his large feet, he looked curiously as he tilted his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru coughed as the salty smell hit him, his nostrils getting burned up from the heavy odor. \"Tetsu it's us, were not bugs!\", he tried to yell up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetsu however still couldn't hear them from his towering height. As he lifted his large foot, sweat glistened as it smeared across the firm yet meaty foot. Putting his hands on his hips, Testu frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry little guys i can't have you crawling around, i promise I'll crush you quick ok.\", raising his foot higher Tetsu smiled as stomping from this height should quickly squish the insects out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisono was frozen as he looked up in fear, a shadow of vinegar doom loomed over. The kind face of their friend was blocked by a foot that he intended to crush them under. The sole began to come down, intended on crushing them beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mahiru snapped out of his shocked gaze as he quickly summoned his lead, grabbing Misono and flying them out of the stomping foot's path. Just as they escaped the shadow, Tetsu's foot slapped against the floor sending them tumbling of off of Mahiru's broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetsu leaned down onto his foot, he hummed confused as he felt the lack of anything crunching under his sweaty sole. Either he missed or those bugs were REALLY tiny. Sure enough lifting his foot showed a lack of bug carcass on his large sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Bugs i promised to make it quick, my feet aren't scary. Well to me at least.\", Tetsu began looking around trying to spot the fleeing specks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru and Misono meanwhile were cringing as that fall definitely caused some bruises. The brunette rubbed his head. \"Geez i can't believe Testsu didn't recognize us, even try and stomp us?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the two could discuss more the ground began to shake again. Both stood up in the case they needed to flee again. However as soon as they did a shadow casted over, looking up the cause was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His heel made a peeling noise as it rose before the rest of the thick sole followed. Sasuke grunted as the large smelly weight rubbed him before finally lifting of him completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Uchiha's eyes adjusted to the sudden dim light, seeing himself in a tunnel of sorts. The blue ceiling and floor were coated with that chessy stink and seem to be filled with a salty liquid.

This was caused as Naruto was turning his sandal over his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond boy grinned as Sasuke's tiny body landed on his palm. He laughed as he saw the tiny covered in his foot sweat and looked ruffled up from the smooshing he gave him. Sasuke's ears felt a ring as the loud booms came out from above, the black haired boy sat up from the warm soft ground and looking at the source of the booms he gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned as he saw the disbelief. \"Ha you should see the look on your face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke gritted his teeth as he processed the situation, that weird jutsu must have done this. Then that chessy blanket was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were keeping me as a insole!\", Sasuke growled at the cocky face of his rival high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked. \"Yea, you were really comfy so thanks!

While most shinobi were used to harsh conditions, the untrained residents of the town were more interested in staying in the cool air as much as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, were busy trying to get a handle on this new jutsu you'd found. An old scroll in your apartment had held an old script, and some drawings of hand signs you'd not seen before. No matter how many times you did the hand signs though... it didn't work. Nothing happened. Not even a spark of chakra or anything. At this point, you'd taken to idly performing hand signals as you walked around, wandering down the street to pick up some food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slapped your sweaty palms together one last time, you sighed. Maybe you should just give it a rest... As you thought that, you twisted your palms together, a sudden puff of smoke erupting from around your body! You'd done it! Now to find out what this jutsu did...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke clouded your vision, you couldn't see through the thick white. It was weird, jutsu smoke usually dispersed almost instantly, unless a lot was produced... Waving you hand in front of your face, you tried to blow away the smoke... but it was pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Naruto Uzumaki was strolling down the dusty streets of Konoha, groaning from the heat.

Silver smirked as he let Ethan go. Ethan was able to catch his breath only to lose it by screaming for his life as he hurdled towards the ground. Ethan hoped this was a bad dream when the very same hand that tortured him saved his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let anything harm my pet.\u201d Silver said. \u201cOnly if my pet behaves however.\u201d Ethan was in shock from the fall, and also in a bit of fear of the giant red-head and what could happen to him if he were to tick him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what about your size?\u201d Ethan mustered. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a Pokemon trainer at that size!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Silver smirked once again. \u201cThis is just to show your place and what happens when you misbehave.\u201d Silver got his device, which blinded Ethan again. Once he opened his eyes, he was on the ground and Silver, back to normal, put a black collar around his neck. \u201cThat collar can\u2019t be taken off until I do, got it?\u201d Silver explained. Ethan had no idea how to react to his situation. He could make a run for it, or yell at him, but Silver would just use the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps I can take the device from him if I wait long enough for the prefect opportunity?\u201d Ethan thought as Silver pushed him.</span></div></div>",

Very large sums of cash, attachments to beyblades not released yet, and other illegal dealings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA match had just ended, you were utterly destroyed in a match with Daigo Kurogami, a boy near your age.

You were a kid of the street and finding a beyblade in the trash was a small piece of hope to your homelessness. But it was all for nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah what an amazing show! Very splendid job Daigo!\", the announcer yelled out to the crowd gathered in this underground ring. Daigo walked over, his sharp eyes holding his usual cold gaze.

The spiky haired boy's face was covered by his palm as he began reaching for you! You were frozen in shock as you were enveloped in the fist of Daigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled as only your head poked out of the warm fist.
