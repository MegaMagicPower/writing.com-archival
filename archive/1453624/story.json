Bored, Troy looked at himself in the full length mirror he had installed on his closet door. He looked about the same as he did leaving high school, tall, about 6 foot with a swimmers build, carrying about 150 pounds on his muscled frame. He had added a few pounds over the summer, no longer exercising as he use too. He didn't really notice but his lower abs were starting to disappear under a thin layer of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy of much the same stature as Troy walked into the room and introduced himself as Cliff, Troy's roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two exchanged introductions and small talk. Cliff was from up north, and was a track runner in high school. As Cliff finished talking, his stomach squirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, sorry, it has been doing that a lot lately, want to run down to the Cafeteria to get some grub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure man,\" Troy replied, patting his nearly flat abdomen \"I could use some food, too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the cafeteria, the two were amazed at how large and well stocked of different foods there were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it is buffet style\" Cliff added, \"This is not going to be good for my already rising waist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff raised his shirt and revealed a small roll of fat, barely enough to pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, quite worrying, you are still thin, and besides we get a free membership to the campus gym, lets just enjoy ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the two did enjoy, each went back numerous times to try different foods and find there favorites. On top of the many full trays of food, each filled a plate with delicious desserts</span></div></div>",

The two sat down on their beds and were trying the sweets Cliff has been given from his mother before he left home. Troy did really like them, and was trying one after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's delicious!\"<br>\r\n\"Strawberry and whipped cream, my favorite!\" Cliff exclaimed in glee as he grabbed a piece for himself from the sweets' box. He dug in and insisted Troy gets some of his as well. The boy did and he was glad in doing so \"Tasty!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm addicted to this stuff, it's hilarious\" Cliff then let a chuckle. he patted his belly \"I think that's why I'm turning more into a pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy laughed a little at that. He said after finishing his pastry \"You're making a huge fuss, it's not like a small cake could make you very fat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, ask me- it's as if everything I eat goes straight to my waist!\" Cliff spoke up, his index finger poking the small fat on his waist and clearly hating it \"No matter what you do or what you eat, it's always there\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you still look fine\"<br>\r\n\"You look better though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy looked down at his own stomach. it was bunching slightly underneath his t-shirt and Troy could feel that. It was a very uncomfortable feeling and Troy wondered since when his stomach felt like this. He spoke up nervously 'Y-yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies like strong and muscular boys, when they see you like this, they don't give you a chance\" Cliff grabbed the small layer of fat on his abdomen \"It's okay if a girl has a small belly or something, because they have other stuff to show off with. We, if not muscular, have none. We need to stay in shape always\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" Troy gave a light shrug of his shoulders \"But, some girls like chubby guys\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, grandma\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shared a nice laugh. Troy was startled to see that Cliff, and after all his complaining, reached for another piece of pastry \"Dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hum?\" Cliff's eyes didn't leave his food. he was enjoying every bite of his chocolate-dark chocolate pastry \"Humm?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing, nothing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff gulped quickly and extended his full spoon \"Want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks\"<br>\r\n\"Okay then. I'm eating all of them- don't care\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy flashed Cliff a rather nervous smile and got up from his bed, leaving Cliff eating his pastries alone. Troy made his way to his closet and examined himself in his  full length mirror secretly and without Cliff noticing him. His hand lifted up his t-shirt and his other one rubbed his abdomen slowly. He was too taken by the fact that he couldn't feel his abs like he used to that he didn't notice Cliff walking his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Troy could react or turn around, Cliff slapped hard his roomie's ass and let a hard crazy ass laugh as he ran away out of their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy, and in that moment, forgot competently about his stomach and went to chase after Cliff, seeking revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It has been a month now, and the two were already used to this lifestyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy made efforts in his studies more than Cliff did. This latter wasn't bad himself, but he just couldn't get up in the morning and go listen to a boring lecture everyday. When Troy bugged him until he got up, he would, but when Troy was late himself and had to go fast, he wouldn't have time to wait until Cliff wakes up from that bed of his, so he'd just leave him sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Troy was up early, and he wasn't going to let Cliff sleep in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, get up\"<br>\r\n\"Huum\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy narrowed his eyes at his roommate, who shoved his blanket away and let Troy get a full glimpse of his naked torso; Cliff hasn't been doing a great job in staying in shape, and his belly which now spilled over his boxers was a great proof. He was annoyed at that, and he always complained that he couldn't get a girl because of it, yet he never stopped eating more and more- heck, Troy could swear Cliff ate even more and more when he complained. Weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up fatty\"<br>\r\n\"Hummmmmm....\" Cliff turned to sleep on his right. He mumbled \"You're the fatty\"<br>\r\n\"Cliff, get up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy tried very hard to not to think about it, after all, Cliff was...<i> true</i>; Troy had also let himself go. He snacked late at night and ate a lot when Cliff did. He knew something was wrong when he couldn't button his pair of jeans anymore, and when he had to borrow Cliff's pants. Troy could feel his belly's softness when he took a shower or walked and felt it jiggle. He even sucked in it when he talked to girl, afraid she'd notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, he didn't want to admit it. He was so embarrassed of himself that he hated to admit it. He even felt ashamed when he looked himself in the mirror and saw how his fat sides spilled over his pants. Just<i> embarrassing</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hummm-\"<br>\r\n\"Fine! I'm going! Clean the room!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy stormed out of the room angrily, after shoving some empty boxes of pizza out of his way. His yelling made Cliff sit down and wonder what the hell has just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It has been two months now that the two started their freshman year. A lot of bad and good stuff happened. To Cliff, everything was fine and good, to Troy, everything was going down and very badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom makes the best Turkey of all times, I miss her cooking\" Cliff spoke up as he shoved his clothes to his suitcase, not bothering himself to fold them or put them in order \"Being home is good- with the food and all, it's good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting no answer, Cliff looked up at Troy. The guy was laying down on his bed, t-shirt ridden halfway up his belly as it spilled over his unbuttoned jeans. It rippled and showed more rolls of fat as Troy pushed himself into a sitting position and kept poking at it. With him looking down, he was sporting his new baby double chin, something Cliff has managed to avoid because he seemed to gain only around the waist, the belly and the thighs. A jiggly ass is better than a fat chin anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff was used to Troy nagging about his gut most of the times, but he just extended the limits. Why making a fuss about a little belly? Everyone gets the Freshman 15 anyway. No one is safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude, ya okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff waked over his friend's bed. He reached for Troy's little tummy and patted it, mocking him \"A boy or a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cliff!\" Troy slapped his hand away. He narrowed his eyes at him \"You're not better off!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not being a drama queen, at least\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not being a drama queen!\" Troy leaped out of his bed, feeling his belly jiggle a bit and hating it \"I'm trying to be reasonable here!\"<br>\r\n\"Reasonable? You're not going to lose weight if you poke at that gut of yours everyday\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy knew Cliff was right. \"Just... get up and collect your stuff. Go home and forget about this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another 15 pounds at home and I officially am not fitting in any of my  shirts anymore\"<br>\r\n\"Dude, chill out\"<br>\r\n\"They're going to make fun of me when they see me like this...\" Troy patted his fattened torso. He turned around and felt awful when he saw how his love handles stuck out further than they did... <i>last month</i> \"Shit. Looks to me more like the Freshman 20! I can barely believe that I was muscular months ago!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need my pants again?!\" Cliff elbowed his roomie, flashing him a teasing look. Troy let a defeated sigh, looking down again at his stomach and making Cliff smirk secretly at the sight of his double chin forming,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe\"<br>\r\n\"Chill out. The turkey is awaiting\"<br>\r\n\"And the pounds are waiting too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Troy ate it without any hesitation. By the end of one burger and some noodles, the pants which cliff gave were feeling a bit tight, but Troy was to busy eating. After the whole meal Troy went and slept for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up to the sound of a doorbell. It was his 2 twin sisters, Ann and Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann, Belle. What are you two doing here so early?\" Asked Their mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a half-day!\" Said both of them happily <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, because there is someone special here to meet you!\" Said their excitedly because they were still small children and needed that type of talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it santa?\" Asked Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No honey\" said their mom laughing \" it's your brother, Troy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the twins shouted with excitement.

Finally something goes right! With his shirt hanging over his waistline, this newly flabby stomach was safely hidden and you couldn't even see that his pants weren't buttoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy turns and looks at himself sideways, and the good feeling fades.

Brushing his teeth he noticed that he could feel the jiggle of his gut.  It was definite.  He was getting a fat gut.  Troy was having mixed feelings.  He liked the idea of being bigger, carrying more heft.  But, on the other hand, he didn't like the idea of being a fatty.  He remembered how good it felt actually stuffing himself beyond full last night,  But how would he feel about getting fat? He patted the bulge which was still firm from last night's stuffing and gave it a satisfying thump. Getting dressed, he observed that he really couldn't hide it even under an oversized shirt.<br>\r\nHis stomach growled and Troy realized that he was hungry and he had slept until noon.  While he was in the bathroom, Troy had resolved to attach the belly by visiting the gym and starting to work off some of the flab, or, at least turn it into muscle. His resolve was tested when he found a flyer for a new buffet on the table with the mail.  He'd pushed it aside yesterday but hadn't thrown it away.  It probably wasn't a good idea if he really wanted to work this belly off but on the other hand, he'd be working out regularly once he set up his program at the gym and how could he focus on exercize when he was starving.  Gym or food was the question right now.  Of course he needed both but which to do first.  His mouth was watering at the thought of a real stuffing at the buffet but the responsible thing would be to put in a good workout first.  But he was now so hungry that he just wouldn't be able to focus on exercise. He had to eat something.  Maybe just grab a donut or two on the way to the gym but if he really satisfied his appetite, then the exercise would be easy. <br>\r\nTroy grabs his gym bag and heads out.</span></div></div>",

Let me set you up with some moves on the weight deck, a few more on the machines, and then you should add some cardio for carrying capacity - swimming, the bike, maybe rowing.  You've got good shoulders already, rowing'd probably firm those up nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" replied Troy. \"I've canoed a little - I'd like to try the rowing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rowing makes a good balance with chest work and heavy leg work,\" Tim observed.  \"It's not my thing - my cardio's all biking - but it'll help you build muscle.

Rachel was also wearing a very short gown, if she would just bend over... \"I hope you made the food!\" Rachel called across the room as she threw the duffel onto the couch, before turning around and running back to hug him. \"BRADY! YOU GOT HUGE! How much do you weigh? I love how firm you are, and you look adorable with stubble!\" Apparently Brady was appealing to her, another month of this and I will have her around my finger. \"I weigh about 250 pounds now, and thank you I got bigger just for you y'know.\" She smiled up at him, her eyes were bright and happy. \"Well thank you, now take that stupid shirt off!\" she had begun to pull on his shirt, which he pulled the rest of the way off. \"Ohhh, I like the wifebeater, leave that on, now since I'm sleeping over I brought some movies, go get dinner ready, unless you want to skip to dessert?\" Brady thought about Rachel and then what she most likely meant by dessert. \"I'll get us some grub\" Brady said nervously before walking to the small kithenette letting his gut jiggle as he walked, he could feel her staring.

Brady looked nervously at his gut, he was still shirtless...\"Not long man, just pump your armsand eat a ton, you should be able to start soon.\" As if on que the doorbell rings again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had come back out of the bathroom, and was sitting on the couch in Brady's lap, Brady who had eaten three pies was leaning back and running his fingers through Rachels hair, she wasn't asleep but she had only eaten one slice. Cliff beside him was struggling to eat the last of his second pie. Brady lifted a hand to rub his gut, it was very firm, which meant he may have gained a little. \"How do you feel?\" Brady asked, looking over at Cliff who was licking his fingers. \"I could get used to eating like this he responded happily\" patting his stomach that was so bloated you could barely see his abs under his skin-tight shirt. \"Good, now about that movie...\" he said leaning over to see Rachel's face, who was starting to rub his stomach. \"Only if I can feed my man some cake\" Rachel said using both hands to massagehis firm gut. \"Sounds nice\" Brady responded, and then looked over to see Cliff staring at his belly one again. So Brady got up carring Rachel over to the counter with the plates. Cliff moved as if to join them, but then settled back into the couch, Brady knew how he felt. Now what should he do?</span></div></div>",

I will turn fat, then have a beer belly and losing the abs I worked so hard for.  Plus I have a fast metabolism causing me to still keep my abs from yesterday and not gain any weight happily today\" Cliff said<br>\r\n\"But Cliff what about the Rachel liked me for having a belly and all her friends having boyfriends who have bellies.  Also, you don't need to work out anymore and can eat anything you ever wanted.\" Brady said<br>\r\n\"True and working out is boring everyday and the limited diet I had everyday with the same food and drink.

When Cliff was a child McDonalds was banned since his parents were health nuts and forbidden that place to him. Now that he's an adult he's ready to have some Mickey D's.  Then both Cliff and Brady talked to the microphone and lady said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like to order?\"<br>\r\n\"For me I'm going to have 3 angus deluxes, 1 Chocolate Triple thick shake and medium fries and for my friend 5 big macs, 2 vanilla triple thick shake, and large fries.

As they got to their house Cliff was so hungry for something and Brady placed all the food on the table and divided up the orders for him and Cliff.  Then Cliff said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you give me this much food?  I said I was hungry but not this hungry.\" said Cliff.<br>\r\n\"I gave you this much since you workout today so much so I had to give you more calories then you burned.\" said Brady<br>\r\n\"Oh I get it but now it's time to eat!\" Cliff said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff begin to tore into his first big mac and it tasted delicious with the grilled meat and greasy vegetables.  Then he begin to start having some fries which was the perfect amount of salt and oil.  Next having some of his milkshake so creamy and sweet at the same time.  By 20 minutes and Cliff finished 3 big macs, half of his fries and one of his milkshakes already.  Cliff felt he was in heaven by eating McDonalds for the first time but all of the burgers were damage to his abs.  Now he has a firm hard belly with his abs distorted in the belly.  His muscle tee started riding up to his bloated pecs and his jean's button about to pop off.  Next Cliff took off his pants showing an erection from eating all the food.  But after the fourth big mac Cliff started feeling stuffed to the max with finishing the fries and shake.  As for Brady he finished his food fast and was cheering on Cliff to finish his last big mac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little jock boy can't finish his last burger.  That's a shame since I thought you were going to finish that.\" Brady said.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm going to finish that last big mac!\" Cliff said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliff started to eat his last big mac like a wolf and finished with a burp.  Damage was done to his abs all distorted and his shirt's seam broken from the excessive eating.  But for Cliff it was amazing for him just eating as much as he wanted.  He waddled to his bed overstuffed but felt this was best day of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrady was shocked that Cliff ate all of that and it showed his compassion for wanting to gain.  He just hopes that Cliff's abs are going to fade but with his metabolism it can be little effect.  But maybe it helped slowed the metabolism and start that beginner pot belly.</span></div></div>",

The boys ate ravenously, and Brady kept up with Cliff eating 2 times as much ad him. Cliff grabbed a small chocolate cake, Brady ate 2. Cliff ate a stack of 5 pancakes, Brady ate ten. Soon the hunger slowed, but Brady was still determined to fatten up Cliff, and himself.

He felt conspicuous  and on display but kept himself busy watching the swimmers. \"Hey, college man.\" he heard and looked over to see Mr. Murphy, the assistant manager of the pool.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mr. Murphy.\"  he called back.  \"Hows it going?\"<br>\r\n\"Call me Pat, college man.  We are all grownups.\"<br>\r\n\"OK, Pat.\"  Troy answered aware of Pat's eyes lingering on his pudgy belly.<br>\r\nPat smiled.  \"Freshman 15?\"  he asked.<br>\r\n\"Troy was embarrassed.  \"Yeah,\"  he said.  \"School work and staying fit just don't seem to get along.  Looking forward to getting back in shape this summer.\"<br>\r\n\"Good plan.\"  Pat said.  \"You know we have a small weight setup in he back here which you can use if you like and shower when you are done.\"<br>\r\n\"Appreciate it.\"  Troy said.  \"I will keep that in mind.\"<br>\r\n\"And if there is anything I can do for you, don't hesitate to ask.  I'm here most of the time.\"<br>\r\nWith that, Pat turned and walked toward the office.  Troy looked him over.<br>\r\nPat had seemed old last year but now he realized that he wasn't much over 30.  Pretty well built but not cut and Troy noticed that his butt was especially well endowed. </span></div></div>",
