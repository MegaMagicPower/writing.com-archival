He is laid back and prefers to let things happen rather than do anything. However he always will help someone in need and when active is a powerful opponent to any wrong-doer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Trey</b><br>\r\nTrey is the Ice Shaman and loved food. He is lazy and has spikey blue hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Len</b> <br>\r\nThe uptight rich boy who joined Yoh on his own quest to be King of the Shaman.<br>\r\nPlease Note: In the english version he is known as Len or Lenny, the Japansese version knows him as \"Ren\" or \"Tao Ren\". This story is about the english anime, so please call him \"Len\" and not \"Ren\" to prevent confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Zeke</b><br>\r\nThe evil guy of the series, and the identical twin of Yoh. They both are the reincarnation of Zeke Asakura, the original shaman who gained ultimate power when he mastered the five elements. He was reborn as twins, though only one remained evil and carried the original Zeke's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Other</b><br>\r\nThis is where more characters can be added.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Power to change the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, Yoh had to train hard.

He was deep in meditation... oh actually he'd fallen asleep. So much for the fate of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up Yoh brushed off the bug not noticing it had bitten him, and walked off.

He called out, \"Hey Trey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrey turned and smiled as he saw his friend. He ran over to him and said, \"Hey Yoh how's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough. I'm trying to get some free time away from Anna. Want to go do something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrey said, \"Sure. I could use a break myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the two friends walked down the street together, side by side. Trey noticed something seemed different about Yoh. His clothes looked a little small on him but that wasn't what it was. Everyone made mistakes doing laundry, even Anna. Then it hit him! Yoh was taller than him! He had always thought he had been a little taller than Yoh even if most of it had been hair. But Yoh was clearly taller than him by a head! It was strange he hadn't noticed it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you getting a growth spurt Yoh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taller than me. I always used to be taller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Yoh stopped and looked down at Trey. \"Oh hey look at that. Maybe I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrey sighed. Yoh was always so nonchalant about everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do?\" Yoh asked</span></div></div>",

He knew he had been in the woods with Trey for a meditation exercise, and that they'd both been in the same tent. But now the tent was gone and he wasn't anywhere near a forest of any kind.

It was smooth, but loose enough there to hold on to. He started to climb the 50 wall of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Yoh, who had woken just a moment before, sat up. The movement changed the ground, now Trey was lying on the belly button instead of clinging to a wall. Trey could now walk straight out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it got worse for Trey. Yoh stretched down towards his toes, and that movement threw Trey from the belly button and he landed in front of the elastic band of Yoh's pants. From his point of view, the thickness of the band was at leas 20 to 30 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it got even worse for him. Done stretching, Yoh now moved his hand to the pant's band, right in front of Trey.

This was an infinetly worse place to be. Yoh was sure to reach in here more often than into his belly button meaning Trey had an even greater chance of being crushed. He had stopped falling through the dense hair and was sitting on something on something gigantic. Knowing where he was Trey knew this was the massive dick of Yoh. Trey's luck had held out again.

In his sleep Trey wrapped his arm around the large bare feet and started to lick the soles, while dreaming he was eating an ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Yoh was dreaming that he was Shaman King and the world were all bowing before him. Some of his defeated shaman were licking his feet to serve him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither boy noticed that Yoh was growing in the night. To Trey, the expanding feet was his ice creams getting bigger. Happily he kept licking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoh was dreaming his power caused the Shaman at his feet to shrink, while they licked his feet which were many times their size. He smiled in his sleep and he grew a boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the growth finally stopped, Yoh was nearly 1800 feet tall. Trey was a quarter of the size of his little toe, and was lying high in the air on the sole of Yoh's left foot. Still licking away at his enormous ice cream.</span></div></div>",

Finally it seemed to stop with Yoh becoming many times larger than he was before. Trey looked up at the palm and fell onto his butt as it got closer and closer, finally reached the ball. He was tossed and thrown around as the ball shifted but he steeled himself and leapt up grabbing onto a piece of loose skin that Yoh probably wouldn't even be able to see. Holding on tight, he was lifted once again out of Yoh's pants. He looked on with amazement at the monumnetal size of Yoh. It was unreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more pressing matters were at hand. Trey looked to see where the hand was going to be put and how much trouble he was going to be in when it stopped.</span></div></div>",

I mean people for me to feast upon\" He laughs, taking a step foreward, crushing many people with his gigantic foot. \"Ooops.. how 'silly' of me.

His work, it seemed, would never be done! He didn't have much time to protest or even think about protesting as Yoh quickly dumped him into his other ear. This one was just as wax and crud encrusted as the other ear. Apparently Anna never covered personal hygiene in all her \"training\" exercises. Then again, that seemed to be something most people with common sense could figure out. Trey didn't dare to even whisper these sentiments close as he was to Yoh's ear drum. Instead, he quietly went about his work, scraping, dumping, moving, and cleaning. It took awhile, but he finally finished his hair and clothes sticky in places with Yoh's wax. Trey managed to say, \"Done!\" and Yoh grabbed him out of his ear. He looked down at Trey and saw he was rather exhausted. Yoh was pleased with how well Trey had followed all his orders and considered giving him a rest. Then again, there was so much else they could with each other. Trey at this point didn't care much either way. He was happy to have these few precious seconds between chores to rest. Finally Yoh decided.</span></div></div>",

As soon as he stepped foot inside that house he knew he'd be attackled and forced to do \"training\" which lately had devolved into doing chores while Anna watched. Sometimes Yoh wanted to just throw a rag into her face and tell her to do her own work, but he didn't dare. Plus he was a pretty easygoing guy. Then again, maybe there was something wrong with the picture when someone as nice and care free as him has thoughts of yelling and starting an unnecessary fight. So with all those thoughts passing through his mind, he turned away from the direction his house was in and walked aimlessly down the street. Now that he was starting to feel more awake, the sun wasn't quite so bright and intruding. In fact, it was quite pleasant on his bare torso. Or what was bare between his open shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know, his body was slowly restructuring itself, increasing bone and muscle size, forcing his body to begin a growth spurt of unbelievable proportions. The bug that had bitten him was a rare breed of insect that caused swelling in the parts of the body that were bit. But this insect had been specifically breeded to have a proportionate effect over the entire body no matter where a person was bit. Also, the power of the swelling had increased dramatically to the point that if Yoh didn't get out the city within the next couple of hours, his toe alone would probably be enough to crush the city flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the fate of all the people in Yoh's hometown rested on whether or not Yoh left within the next few hours. Would they survive?</span></div></div>",

It was dark out and he couldn't see much, except for the strange grass that grew for miles around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and saw some of the grass had been uprooted and was laying on the ground. He picked it up and brought it close to his face. It felt quite a bit heavier than a blade of grass should, oddly enough. He examined and was shocked to see that it appeared to be a tree. He looked more closely at the surrounding \"grass\" and came to the same conclusion. It was all trees. He was still in the forest. Looking down on the ground Trey also saw some scraps of cloth. All that remained of his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, in the night, he had grown into a giant. Judging by the size of the trees compared to him, he approximated himself at about 120 ft. tall, give or take a foot. He thought about how small normal people would be to him and grinned.

They couldn't see his face due to the large boner he had. He stood there, completely naked, imaging the many ways which he could wipe this insignificant city out of existance.  He crouched down so his face loomed directly over the city, he heard several people gasp.

Cool huh?\" Trey said scratching his head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"B-But how...I mean....this is impossible.\" Yoh said falling down on his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares how it happened? The point is I can do anything now! So lets have some fun already!\" Trey said, and without waiting for an answer he placed Yoh up on his blue haired head, dropped Yoh's house, and turned his attention back to the city.</span></div></div>",

A bare foot lying on its side, with its little toe on the ground, and the big toe in the air. But this foot wasn't just gigantic, it was horrendously huge. It was so long that Yoh couldn't see where it ended by the heel, it vanished into the forest as the trees obstructed his view. The little toe alone was about as much as Yoh could see. The rest of the foot just stretched into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoh walked up to the little toe and measured himself against it. Counting in his head, he worked out how long the little toe was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoh felt weak. The toe he was looking at he estimated to be around 250 feet long. That would mean the entire foot was over 3000 feet long, making the giant over 20,000 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was that tall, a normal person would be around... less than 1/32 inch tall!\" Yoh thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to freak out, and fainted leaning against the sweaty sole of the gigantic foot.</span></div></div>",

Since the giant was so big the folds of his skin were like handholds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later and Yoh had made barely any progress.

It was getting harder, as he had found after the little toe, he had to climb the actual sole of the foot and not the sole of the toe, as there was no way he could reach the next toe from the little one. So Yoh had walked along the tiny toe to the sole of the sweaty foot and climbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time he reached a toe, Yoh left the sole and walked along the toe towards the end to see how far he had to go.

He wondered how far he was from civilization not realizing he had accidently stepped on several villages just from walking. He decided to pick a new direction. He turned left and continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trey stopped Yoh had finally had time to catch his breath. Gazing up Yoh couldn't even see past the giant's ankles much less his face. He thought about climbing onto the toenail but it was far too thick. He was essentially trapped just under the giant's toenail. Suddenly, Yoh felt the titan turn to the side and start walking. Unfortunately, Yoh didn't have any time to grab onto the skin and as the foot rose into the air, he was pressed down on his back.

Before either of the boys could do anything, Trey began to grow again! He was awake and aware to see it this time and he laughed as he saw everything shrinking around him. The mountain that was just a little taller than him fell below his waist, then his knees, his ankles, his toes until they were like a mound of dirt! Trey looked down at his hand and discovered he couldn't see Yoh! He had grown so much that Yoh had shrunk from his sight again! He shrugged and  pulled his collar out. He tipped the hand that had Yoh on it and held it there for a few minutes. There was nothing he could about not being able to see Yoh so he would probably be safe as long as he was on Trey's body.

He knew that all the tiny people on the ground would look up and see nothing but a massive foot lowering on top of them. They'd barely have time to register they were going to die before they were crushed. Trey ground his foot into the ground with every step.

He smiled as he saw the set of footprints trailing away into the distance. He was making good time but this was taking too long. He turned back around and ran. Now not only was he crushing anything that moved, but those lucky enough to avoid the giant stomps were killed by the massive earthquakes caused by every foot fall.</span></div></div>",

Cool,\" Yoh seems to be hanging on the man's every word while Len tries to hold back his urge to smack him! \"Which leg are you guys climbing?\"<br>\r\n\"Because Shiro is a kind and friendly demon that welcomes visitors, we'll go up the left leg. It's really chilly, but we'll have a better chance of surviving than crossing Ifreet's land. That cold-hearted brute will burn us to a crisp if we even THINK of treading through his fire continent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like the choice was obvious... but it only LOOKED like, because of a certain unhappy camper. \"Grr... this is ridiculous!\" Len groaned, \"Im going to waste my time climbing up a colossal fool when it could be better spent preparing for my domination of the planet!\"<br>\r\n\"Aw c'mon! Cheer up, Lenny!\" Yoh tried to calm him down, \"Trey's a good friend of ours, so we owe it to him to help this guy out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no point arguing with Yoh. No matter what Len would say, his partner/rival already made up his mind! After gritten his teeth, he finally bit, \"Urgggh... FINE!

And if there was one thing Len didn't like, it was knowing that he was att he mercy of the world's biggest idiot(literally!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Glad to hear I'm not the only one afraid!\" Yoh smiled as they exited the city and onto a seemingly endless plain that was Trey's big toenail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who said I was afraid?!\" Len shouted angrily at him, starting a huge argument as they proceeded on their journey. However, what the two didn't notice was that they were being spied upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Not too far away was a Stitched up blue Penguin with peg legs and two tiny demon wings watching them. It had grabbed a video camera from out of its pouch and was secretly recording them. \"Dood! Once Etna sees how hard I'm working she'll definetly increase my wages to .48 Cents Doods!\" The Penguin shouted happily as it secretly followed the two boys on their journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----Far Far Away upon the great Nose----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" Shouted a evil demon prince from his dark and brooding castle. He sat upon his throne, watching his plasmascreen television and the two idiots who were on a journey. \"Those fools think they transform MY ultimate warship into a ordinary person!? Never I say! Never! I will crush those insects before they even have the chance!\" Shouted the Overlord of the Starship Planet Trey in Galaxy Omega VIIII.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sitting next to his throne was a Blonde Haired girl dressed completly in white and had the cuteness and innocence of a angel. That and she had small angel wings on her back. \"Laharl! Don't tell me you would hurt your warships friends?! The power of love will never allow you to do such a thing!\" The angel girl shouted with joy as hearts began to completly surround her with words in the middle like 'love' and 'justice conquers all!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Silence Flonne! I'll not have you spitting justice and love at this time!\" Laharl laughed evilly as he pressed a button on his throne, causing a hole to appear beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Meanie!\" Flonne shouted as she fell deep into the hole that lead to the pit of suffering and agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Soon the entire Universe will be mine!\" Laughed the Sinister Laharl as he prepared for Universal Domination.</span></div></div>",

Strangely, the leg was covered in what appeared to be magma, rock, volcanoes, rivers of fire and lava, and other such strange things. The demon that lived on the leg must've changed the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it's kind of ironic that there's a land of fire on Trey when he's an ice shaman.\" Yoh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" Len replied, crossing into this fiery domain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as their feet touched the new ground, an incredible heat and humidity blasted them. Almost at once their bodies were covered in a thin sheen of sweat. It was like walking into an oven. But these boys were ovbiously tough, despite their age and attire, and pressed on into uncharted land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, thirsty, tired, and covered in sweat, they were regretting taking this leg to their goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look on the bright side.\" Yoh said. \"If we went up the other leg, it would probably be really cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how exactly is that supposed to comfort me?\" Len asked scathingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Yoh could answer something caught his eye. In the distance there appeared to be a large building of some sort. Suprisingly enough, something actually lived in this barren land!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Len look!\" Yoh said pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen looked where Yoh was pointing and saw the same building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like some kind of temple...\" Len mused to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares what it is?\" Yoh said. \"It'll make a great place to take a break from all this walking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without a further word, Yoh was running to the temple. Len sighed and walked after him, retaining at least some of his dignity. However close the temple may have looked, it still took a good three hours to get there, leaving Len and Yoh completely exhausted. They nearly collapsed at the doors of the temple, which were enormous, but managed to stay up and lean against the door. Unfortunately, after much pushing it was soon apparent that the doors weren't going to open easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do we do?\" Len said, sitting with his back to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock?\" Yoh said, doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard!\" Len shouted. \"Like the doors are just going to magically open because you knock! I mean the very idea is ludi--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of his words were drowned out as the doors opened inward with a loud grinding sound of stone against stone. Len slapped himself on the forehead and, grumbling and complaining, followed Yoh inside.</span></div></div>",

Len was determined to find a way to shrink Trey and enlarge himself beyond even this size, to take over the entire universe if he could. He wanted all to worship him in awe and fear. Yoh, meanwhile, just liked the idea of being big enough that no one could force him to do anything he didn't want to do, like train, or work, or run errands for Anna...wherever she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of trekking they decided to take a quick break. Len looked on at the seemingly endless expanse of flesh before him. Even if they managed to make it up the legs, through the bottom of Trey's shorts (shudder), across Trey's massive stomach, between his collosal pecs, and up towards the face, what would it accomplish? Trey would barely be able to see them, let alone talk to them. No, Len was hoping to find something on the way to the face that would allow him to take Trey's place as a god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is taking forever!\" Yoh said, shielding his eyes and looking on. \"At this rate, we'll be dead before we get anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! We just have to step up our game!\" Len said. \"Come on!

He was too big to do anything with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for the moment their task was getting to his face. Hopefully when they got there something would reveal itsself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, and shockingly enough, Yoh had a brainwave.<br>\r\n\"Hey Len, what if we combine all of our power and use all of it to teleport us as far up as we can go?\" Yoh asked.<br>\r\n\"How would that help?\" Len scorned. \"We'd be drained of all energy!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but think about it.

He was feeling around with his hands. He felt the ground and found it to be softer than other areas they had been.

Both Yoh and Trey gasped as their gazes landed on each other, seeing one another in full sight for the first time since yesterday. One minute, they were staring each other in the eyes, the next, Yoh was twice Trey's size. Trey gaped up at his friend as he increased more and more, his body taking up all his sight. Soon, Yoh's massive torso filled his sight completely. Trey looked left and right, up and down, but couldn't see past Yoh's huge belly. Suddenly Trey felt a powerful pull, dragging him closer to Yoh's huge body. Yoh had grown to the point that his body had developed a gravity field capable of pulling Trey's body onto his own. Within seconds Trey felt his bare feet touch on Yoh's massive belly. Smaller and smaller, bigger and bigger, both boys continued to change until Trey reached his normal size. He felt weak, indescribably weak. All the power he had commanded was now gone, seeking refuge within Yoh rather than him. Trey felt an emptiness within him. Looking around, he couldn't see anything except the landscape of flesh stretching in every direction. Sighing, Trey sat down and rested. He had no idea what just happened, but he was going to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trey rested on Yoh's belly, far, far, down, on his feet, Len and Zeke were standing on  Yoh's colossal toenail. It was like standing on glass, glass far stronger than any known substance in creation, but glass nonetheless. Zeke had a sour look on his face as he realized his lifelong ambition had been snatched away from him...again. Len was livid. He had been so close to realizing true power. In one fell swoop he would've humiliated Trey, stolen his power, been reborn a god, and stolen Zeke's plan from him! All the universe would've been his! Thinking of Zeke's plan, Len had a sudden, chilling thought. What if Yoh decided to do it? Would he? Len looked at Zeke and could tell he was thinking the same thing. Unfortunately, Yoh was many times larger than Trey had been and no doubt had the power to continue growing. Whereas he, Len, was still far from recovering his powers to traverse the body again. Zeke seemed to have used up a lot of his own power, since he wasn't immediately heading to the forehead to steal Yoh's power. Zeke saw him looking and said, \"My powers are still strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen flinched a little. That was awfully perceptive of him. Wishing to hide his mistake, Len said defiantly, \"Then why haven't you gone to the forehead to steal Yoh's power from him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke smiled in a sardonic, belittling way. \"It's not going to be in the same place as before. Nor will it be a crystal. The only reason it was a crystal before, was because the boy was an Ice Shaman. Who knows what form it'll take for Yoh, or where it will placed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen rolled his eyes and said, \"Please, then how did you know Trey's would be on the forehead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke replied, \"Simple. I divined it using my own shaman powers. Unfortunately, it was a spell I am only able to use once every few decades. It could take years to search this entire body completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And, if Yoh goes through with your plan, we'll have even less time!' Len thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all hinged on whether or not Yoh would decide to go through with the plan and send the universe down that long, dark tunnel. </span></div></div>",

Since Zeke and Len were also hit with the spirits, just not enough to do anything, they remained at their same size. But everyone else on Trey's body started to shrink along with Trey, remaining in proportion. And unfortunately for them, when Trey touched down on Yoh's stomach, his feet made contact, crushing those left on his soles. Many survived, but many more were obliterated. To them, Trey is just as big as he's ever been, and Yoh is just universal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoh felt strange with his new power. But his size also added a sense of power, and that sense of power was increasing his ego. Perhaps Zeke had a point? Why shouldn't he rebuild the universe in his image? What's stopping him from becoming god?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of himself being worshipped by an entire universe was appealing, and this inflated his ego once more, which in turned continued his exponential growth. Yoh wouldn't  have very long until he could carry out the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, far down on the toe nail, Zeke and Len weren't getting along.

To achieve that goal, all he had to to was wait a little while longer, to let his power expound itself over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen and Zeke were both determined that this would not come to pass. They both knew they had to do something or else Yoh would go along with the plan and they would trapped as bugs in a universe that was dedicated to worshiping Yoh! Len turned to Zeke and said, \"You may not be able to use furyoku to sense the souls, but if we combine our power we should be able to at least look for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke frowned and said, \"I suppose I have no choice.\" He smiled then and said, \"I guess I don't mind using another pawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen ground his teeth as he heard those words, but didn't say anything.

Which was on a hill deep in the mountains. It was place where him and Yoh would train regularly. It had four tall pillars in each direction and was covered in a thick, heavy fog which only allowed the hill, pillars, and tallest trees to be seen. The hill itself was at the center. Len noticed the first time they found this place that the center looked like a beacon. The center of the stone made of stone and strange markings. Plus there was a unearthly peace about this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich could almost make Len calm. Almost. \"Dammit! That bastard is making me wait on purpose!\" Len spat angrily. Bason trying desperately to appease his master by saying that someone was making Yoh late. Or that he could be under attack at the moment. But those didn't stop him from being angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards the center. Len sat down in the center of the hill. Upon the very center of the ancient stone ground with the mysterious carvings. He closed his eyes and started to place himself in a meditative state. \"Baston. I am going to meditate and hope that silences my rage. So. Do. Not. Disturb. Me!\" Len spat angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood Master Len.\" Bason said as he silenced himself alongside his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen began to meditate in pure silence as his servant went quiet. Drawing the spirits around him to him. The ground began to glow with each spirit, putting Len deeper into his trance as more spirits began to appear until the center stone symbols were glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to him, the four pillars in each direction began to glow as well. The Southern Pillar glowed red, a fire symbol surrounding a Pheonix appearing above it as strange fire energy began to travel from the pillar's glowing symbol to the Hill. Then the East began to glow green. The power of wind flowing around the Blue Dragon and to the hill. The North PIllar glowing blue as the Black Turtle appeared, sending the element of water to the Hill. Finally the Western pillar glowed brown, the White Tiger appearing as the earth energy traveled to the hill as hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Each pillar's elemental energy gathered above Len. Fusing into a single glorious golden ball of light. Len, too deep in meditation and put into a trance by the spirits in order for the transformation to continue, was engulfed by the golden light for 9 minutes until it finally disappeared. The pillars glowing symbols faded and the spirits around Len drifted away. Releasing Len from his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching his arms as he began to awaken from it. Len smiled a arrogant smirk \"That was a great nap!\"</span></div></div>",

It's disgusting! And this is a perfect way for you to prove your loyalty!\" he said wiggling his massive toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please Len, can't I do something else!?\" Yoh pleaded.  Len then stomped his foot down beside Yoh, \"Aww....whats wrong Yoh? Are you afraid? You're lucky my feet don't smell, or else this would be alot harder for you!\" he said laughing and flexing his toes.  \"O-Okay I-I'll do it. But I don't have a wash cloth!\" he said.  Len laughed hysterically, \"Oh please Yoh do you really think I'd have you clean my feet with ANYTHING......but your tounge!?\" he said which  caused Yoh's eyes to bug out.</span></div></div>",

No, the best thing to do right now was what he wanted until he could figure out just what was going on. So he approached the massive left foot and Len lowered it so it was flat on the ground. Yoh decided to start with the big toe and work his way down. Closing his eyes, he stuck out his tongue and touched it to Len's toe and started licking. It wasn't as bad as he thought it would be. Len obviously showered regularly and the feet tasted more like soap than anything, though there was the taste of sweat and dirt to contend with, not to mention Len's natural scent. The toe was kind of rough and his tongue was so small, Yoh knew he would be at this for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLen grinned as he watched Yoh clean his feet. The power he felt over him was simply amazing. He watched as Yoh disappeared entirely just from moving in between his toes. Yoh was too small for Len to properly feel his tongue, but he knew Yoh wouldn't dare disobey him by using his hands to try and clean off his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were looking good for Len.</span></div></div>",

Even though it took awhile, Len enjoyed every minute of it even though he couldn't feel it. Yoh's tounge was numb and red from so many hours of licking Len's rough soles.  Len lifts his foot off of Yoh and brings it to his face to see how he did, he seemed to be looking for even the tiniest speck of dirt so he would have a reason to beat on Yoh. However Yoh actually licked his feet squeaky clean! And after inspecting the other one Len looked at him, \"Good job Yoh! You should consider making a career out of this!\" Len mocked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoh didn't care what Len said, as long as he got to rest. \"I suppose it's only fair that I give you a reward Yoh, I mean you did exactly what I told you. And you didn't miss a spot on my feet! In fact......I'm proud of you Yoh!\" Len said smiling.  Yoh wasn't too tired to feel shock from hearing Len being so nice to him though!  His eyes widened in shock but he decided he'd best keep his mouth shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I guess you can take a rest. I guess you do deserve it.\" Len said grudgingly. Within seconds Yoh was asleep, \"Yeah thats right Yoh, you'd better rest up because things are going to get alot harder from now on. Believe me!\" Len thought evilly.</span></div></div>",

It had been hell, licking and licking with nothing to see but Len's toes and nothing to smell but Len's foot stink, sweaty from training and chasing after Yoh. And the taste! The taste of dirt all over! He'd never be able to wash that taste away! His poor tongue felt like it was permenantely scraped red and the rest of his body was sore from running, getting thrown around, and giving a forced lick to Len's feet. But now he was released. Blessed sleep washed over him and for now, the horrors of the day were stripped away. Of course, he didn't know what new horrors awaited him once he awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after several hours, Yoh slowly woke up, confused at first as to why he was in a clearing in the woods. Then the memories came rushing back, the licking, the mocking, the dirt. He looked around trying to see where Len was. It shouldn't exactly be hard to find him, he was hard to miss. But he seemed to have left for the time being which filled Yoh with hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, before he'd even thought of a place to run to, the ground started to vibrate under his feet. Len was obviously coming back from whatever he had been doing. Yoh collapsed to his butt, the hope that had ballooned inside, effectively punctured.</span></div></div>",
