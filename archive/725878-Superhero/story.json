But you know that your little world is doomed. Every morning, at about this time-<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Time to wake up!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The light in your room turns on. You groan. Your idiot brother yells, runs over to your bed and yanks off your covers. He waits about 3 seconds for you to get up, then (just like every morning) leaps up into the air with his right elbow lowered. Every day from up till now he has landed elbow first right in the middle of your stomach (or back, if you slept chest-down). Today, things turned out a little differently. You wait for the familiar impact. You wait some more. Finally, you open your eyes to see what went wrong.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your little brother is floating above you! You quickly roll out of bed, and examine this strange situation further. There he is, just hanging in mid-air. He has his elbow lowered, and his legs back - perfect elbow-drop form. The only problem is that he is falling very slowly. VERY slowly. You look around, confused. You wave your hand above him, feeling for strings or something. Nothing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You walk into the kitchen to get your mom's opinion on this. What?! Your mom is standing at the stove, holding her spatula up. A pancake is suspended about 3 feet above the spatula. As you watch, it slowly spins and descends back towards the stove.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You walk back into your room to think about this. You see that your brother is now about half a foot above your bed, and is still slowly descending towards it. You concentrate, and suddenly he falls to the bed at normal speed.<br>\r\nKER-WUMP!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your brother lands on the bed. He lays there for a moment, then sits up and looks at you with a confused look on his face.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"How did you move so fast?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Didn't you know, twerp? I've been training to be a ninja!\" you smile and reply.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He looks at you for a second, then shakes his head and walks into the kitchen. You follow him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You eat breakfast and get ready for school. On the way, you decide to experiment a little. You find out how to control your new power. You can slow down time a little, or you can slow it down a lot. You try to speed time up, but it doesn't work.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You get to school plenty early (by slowing down time, you turned a 15 minute walk into a 2 minute one). You are still thinking about all this when you bump into someone in the hallway. Oops. Guess you should have paid more attention where you were going.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Hey, dweeb!

You just gave him one for this week.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You try to apologize, but Bruno's not listening. He pulls back his fist to hit you.</span></div></div>",

He catches it and gives you an odd look then lights up a mini cigar, puffing lightly to get it going, then replaces his lighter to his pocket.<br>\r\n    You concentrate again and see a red leaf nearly stop mid-fall just to the right of Jack, very slowly fluttering through the air.

Then his cigar drops from his mouth as a look of confusion crosses his face.<br>\r\n    \"How did you...\" His voice trails off as he tries to make sense of things.<br>\r\n    \"Jack, no joke, somethings happening to me.\" You start.<br>\r\n    \"Wait. I don't believe this.\" Jack holds his lighter between thumb and forefinger right in front of his face, \"Ok get it now.\"<br>\r\n    You concentrate again and easily slip it from his grip, however this time you stay right in front of Jack instead of moving back to your spot.<br>\r\n    \"Holy crap man!\"Jack falls flat on his butt and grabs the nearby cigar, taking a long drag and enhaling deeply. \"You're freaking serious? Holy crap!\" Jack jumps up and walks to a nearby bench and sits down.<br>\r\n    \"You allright man?\" you ask.<br>\r\n    \"Yah this is just kinda confusing. So what is it you can actually do?\"<br>\r\n    You sit down beside him and put your head in your hands, \"Well as far as i can tell i can slow down time.\"<br>\r\n    \"Wow man. This is nuts. Ok I have an idea!\" Jack sits up straight with a brilliant look on his face.<br>\r\n    \"Oh no, what are you going to do now?\" You ask even though you don't really want to know. Jack always has a crazy idea, usually it ends up with him in trouble and you making up an excuse. This time you suspected it would be a bit crazier than usual.<br>\r\n    \"That Bruno guy is always bugging you, right? Well now's your chance for a little revenge!\" an evil grin flashes across jacks enthusiastic face as he pulls you up and through the path back to school.<br>\r\n    As you approach the school you can see Bruno in the parking lot, leaning against his car, bragging about it to a group of giggling air-heads.<br>\r\n    \"You could scratch his car right in front of his eyes and he wouldn't even know it! Imagine his face! Oh wait, even better! Just walk up behind him and pants him, like he did you, and then scratch his car!\"<br>\r\n    \"Your right! I could finally get payback for the beatings!\"<br>\r\n    \"That's the spirit! Now go get that jerk!\" Jack pats you on the back and sits down to watch the fun. <br>\r\n    You begin to walk over when you see another car fly across the parking lot, the driver showing off its power to his buddies. A grade 10 runs into the path of the roaring beast, the driver cranks the wheel to miss the kid and flies right at the back of Bruno. Bruno turns around just in time to see a ton of metal and horsepower ready to pinch him between itself and his car.</span></div></div>",

By now you are officialy creeped out and you decide that now it's probably a good time to get the heck outta here ''well, i've gotta go now, see ya.'' you say as you begin to walk out of the room, but as you get to the door it suddenly slams shut! You turn around and the man is glowering at you ''go? no i dont think so. i've waited for too long for this moment! and no little teenage punk is gonna mess it up for me now!'' You try to open the door but he pins you to the wall. ''Listen to me boy! You're powers are developed enough!'' You look at him, ''developed enough for what?'' The man smiles at you. ''Developed enough for me!'' You continue to stare blankly at him, ''what do you mean?'' The man frowns. ''when i was a superhero, i had the exact same powers as you. but much more powerful and developed. so developed that i could level a sky but after all my time living in exile and not exercising my powers, they have greatly diminished. oh sure i still remember how to use them. but i've lost the ability to use them myself. all was lost.'' A smile forms across his<br>\r\nface. ''but then i found you. When i saw you save those children from the bus, i knew it was a gift from god!'' now he begins shouting and ranting like a madman ''you were given your powers for a purpose! and that purpose was to allow me to reclaim my title as the greatest superhero of all time!'' Now your afraid, he's no longer the kind faced man you once knew. ''what are you saying!?'' Then a sudden realization comes over you, ''yo-you set the school on fire! you killed those people!'' The man smiles evilly, ''Bingo! Yeah i did that, but only because i had to! i had to get you to finish your training quickly! for you see, the longer i wait to absorb your powers, the more power I lose myself!, i only have less than an ounce of power left! i cant lose that or i'm done for!'' You stare in anger and shock at this new development. ''no, i-i wont! i'm turning you in to the police right now!'' You say as you blast open the locked door. You run out into the hall and towards the front door. you hear the man's voice behind you as you run outside. ''NO!!!!!!!!'' You run down the fire escape and down the street to your house.</span></div></div>",

They were black, and looked grumpy, tired, and unhappy.  \u201cThis is Blitz,\u201d he gestured to the one on the left, \u201cand this is Angelina.  They had part of my burrito too.  It appears to have enhanced their intelligence by a lot\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cWe were always this smart,\u201d said Blitz grumpily, \u201cit\u2019s not our fault that you were too stupid to teach it to us.

Angelina screeched,<br>\r\n\u201cAnd maybe I\u2019m a bit grumpy that up until two hours ago you thought I was an \u2018Angelo!\u2019\u201d  He blushed.  \u201cThe shelter said you were a neutered male, what else was I supposed to think?\u201d  <br>\r\nHe cleared his throat, coughing.  \u201cNow you two, how about we get back to business.\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow, since we\u2019ll be out for spring break, I was thinking that we should spend the whole time together fighting some crime.\u201d<br>\r\nSarah looked confused.  \u201cAnd how are we supposed to convince our parents?\u201d<br>\r\nChris stares at you.  \u201cNow that is where she comes into the plan.  You morph into a teacher saying that you\u2019re taking us on a school-sponsored field trip or something!  Then we\u2019re out for two weeks of crime-catching.  We all have positions.  I, for example, am good at getting people past locked doors with my laser beams.  Or, if that fails, and if it\u2019s a gate, and not a building that we\u2019re trying to get into, Sarah\u2019ll fly over to the other side and open it from that way.  At other times, she\u2019ll post as an aerial guard, occasionally taking Blitz or Angelina with her.  Blitz and Angelina are good at slipping through things, and are great swimmers.  They are our general spies, so you won\u2019t need to do any crawling or creeping.  Since I can only laser through non-living things, you will come in handy for the real firepower battle plan.  Anyway, during spring break, who should we hunt first?  There are two main people, Horatio Cortez, a convicted and escaped three-times murderer and rapist, and to search for a missing girl, a five year old named Melissa Ruther.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were rumors that he was over a hundred miles away in a deserted restaurant called \"Shoney's Steak &amp; Ale\" in the heart of Alexandria, Virginia.  You guys don't have enough money for even one plane ticket to get from your hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina, to the closest airport, Dulles, which would still be twenty miles away.  Being only thirteen, you have no car, and not enough money to rent one, (since you could rent one, turn into a license age driver, and drive it).  How will you all get up there?<br>\r\nChris slumped his shoulders dejectedly.  \u201cThere\u2019s almost no way we could do it!  I mean you could fly there, Sarah, but flying isn\u2019t that much faster than walking.  If it takes seven hours to drive up there, it would take a really long time to walk, even to fly!\u201d  Then, he looked hopeful.  \u201cIf you went horse, and Blitz, Angelina, and I rode you, then we could getter there faster!  Angelina could fly for most of the time.  Say the fastest horse is a Tennessee Walking horse, which has a long distance speed of seven miles per hour and it\u2019s about three-hundred ninety-five miles\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nHe sighed.  \u201cOh, wait!  My sister could drive me up!  But, the car is a 4x4 pickup truck, and only two will fit.  Wait, you could morph dog and sit in the back, no, that\u2019s not safe.  Sarah, you\u2019re small, you could squeeze in somewhere, and I guess you could turn rat or something and sit in my lap.  Yes, I\u2019ve got it!\u201d  Then his face fell.  \u201cYeah, but I\u2019ll need a lot of your money so we can pool it together for a bribe.  My sister is nice, but she won\u2019t drive for nothing!  Pay yourselves back with the reward money.  I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s a hundred thousand dollars!  So that no one gets suspicious, though, don\u2019t take more than a thousand dollars for profit; someone\u2019s gotta be wondering where the money is coming from.\u201d<br>\r\nYou each pull out twenty or thirty dollars, and Blitz and Angelina each pulled out a five dollar bill.  Chris was about to open his mouth and ask them where they got it from, but then shook his head, deciding he did not want to know or ask.  Finally, he counted it all up.  \u201cOne hundred dollars, that\u2019d oughta be enough!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Focusing your eyes, imputing the information that you so desire, you slowly compute it in.  A chocolate Lab with Blitz and Angelina on its back stares up at you and barks.  With a grin, you change him back, but give him long flowing blond hair.  \"Hey,\" he yells, \"Change me back!\"<br>\r\nYou smile and change his hair hot pink.  <br>\r\n\"Perfect.\"  <br>\r\nSarah nods, her eyes twinkling.<br>\r\n\"I like it!\"<br>\r\nSarah says seriously, \"Well, I suggest then that if you change Chris, then all of us but Blitz and Angie can fly.  Then, we can form an air assault.  I guess that I could carry Blitz and Angie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and slowly you change into an enormous Golden Eagle; although a Bald eagle is bigger, you don't want to attract too much attention.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Chris, who gulps uneasily, and you change him into a magnificent (albeit smaller) Gyrfalcon.  Thinking better of it, though, you change his form into that of a Perergine Falcon; in a dive, the fastest bird on earth.  Gulping uneasily at the sight of their owner being turned into their natural predator, Blitz and Angela immediatly shivered and hopped onto Sarah.  The five of you took off, gliding over the trees.  Sarah said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once we dive and attack, I'm suggesting that I go in and find the kid, whereas Chris and you can hold them off and distract them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fly on, wondering what animal to change into.  In a second, you know the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see three deserted cabins from 1980 when someone tried to set up a ski lodge here but deserted.  These are the headquarters of the Morterros.  Quickly, stealthily, Sarah lands, and without cracking a twig silently enters one of the houses.  Chris lands and blows a giant hole through the houses.  The gang members all runout.  Slowly, you curve up your body, until it is a very angry grizzly bear that eyes the gang members.  With a roar, you rush and attack the gang members.  Suddenly, one of them trips you and holds a gun in between your eyes.  A loud chomping noise and one of the gang members' fingers falls off.  Blitz spat angrily, muttering, \"That was disgusting!\"<br>\r\nBlitz walked away angrily.  SUddenly, you have an idea.  Focusing on Blitz, he grows until he is a bit larger than a cat.  He tackles a gang member and bites one of their hands.  Sarah comes out, with a scared little five-year-old girl in tow.  Quickly, before the sees you as a bear, you change into the more appropriate Great Dane; cuddly, but strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl clings to your fur and cries, Sarah quickly knocks out the girl, and carries her home in her arms while flying.  On the way back to the police station, jubiantly, you as a large parrot turn to Chris, who you jokingly put in the form of a hummingbird.  Finally, you arrive at the station in your human forms, and get to watch the little girl being embraced by her mother and father.  The reward that the police had assigned you take gladly, but when the family offers also you three politely decline.  </span></div></div>",

It seems you are going to prison anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie Smith?\" An officer in the vehicle, armed, looked to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, I didn't do anything!\" you shouted in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know\" Come to think of it, they didn't cuff you or anything. \"We just want answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou calmed down slightly. \"What is it?\" you asked, still shaky from the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you come in contact with a silver mouse recently?\" Come to think of it, there was a small mouse that you found in your cabinet recently. He panicked, he bit you, and days later he fell victim to a glue trap. You answered yes and he placed his hand on his chin. \"The virulent was roughly based on the rodent lyssavirus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Virus!?\" and you panicked once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was experimental, designed to increase mental strength\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\" A cold sweat dripped down your jawline. You remembered how since then, your grades and reaction time have improved. Your eyesight even improved slightly. \"What does this have to do with the accident!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis answer was quickly drawing his pistol and firing. You lifted your arms, closed your eyes, and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bullet fell to the floor, crushed on impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" Adrenaline pumped through your blood, fear coursing through your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost at the station. We'll explain everything.\"</span></div></div>",
