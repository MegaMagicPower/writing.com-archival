            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniel was out cold, as if some one had whacked him on the side of the head with a brick. In his unconscious state, he dreamed of a calm, endless ocean and he was on a small fishing boat in the middle of it. He was relaxing and having a great time. But as quick as it started, ominous clouds rolled into view, blocking the perfect, blue skies. In an instant, the waves became more and more violent against the poor vessel. Harsh winds blew and thunder sounded off in the distance. It didn't take long for the wooden boat to smash into pieces, throwing Daniel into the unforgiving water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel quickly regained his senses. He wasn't in a boat, but he still got the feeling he was in the water. He wasn't wet and it was very humid. The floor he lay on was smooth and solid. He fluttered his eyes open and hoisted himself up. He was sore all over. His sight came back and he realized. He was surrounded by glass. After a moment of looking, he realized that he was in a bottle. Yep. A clear glass bottle.  He tried to see what was outside the bottle, but the glass seemed all wavy to him. He sat down and pondered the situation. He folded his powerful arms across his chest (Realizing he had no shirt on, only a pair of jeans). \"Okay, either I'm dreaming, or I started drinking, even though I said I wouldn't  in my life. That, or I somehow shrunk.\" His eyes widened. What would his family think if he wasn't at home? How would he get home? Who could help him? But then, a moment of clarity. \"Wait, who is my family, and where is my home?\" He couldn't remember. He went over what he knew. \"I'm Daniel, I'm 18 and that's it.\" Not very helpful. He glanced to the right and noticed the bottle was floating on water and that it was sealed at the front with a big cork. Grunting, he got up and smacked the wall with his fist. Instead of the bottle cracking like it would usually do if he was normal-sized, his cage just rolled over on the surface of the liquid, tossing him all over the place. He fell onto the floor and groaned. Suddenly he heard the sound of rushing water. He quickly shot up and searched. A small hole- wide enough to fit his finger in- was letting in water. Letting it in <i>fast</i>. In no time at all, the clean water had reached up to his ankle. Doing some quick problems in his head,the water would soon reached his head,and there would be no air left. Panicking, he tried to break the glass with his fist. No good. The water came up to his knees now. He tried blocking the water with his hand. Still, nothing. He pushed the bottle to try to get the hole out the water. Somehow the water kept coming in. It was up to his chest know. He started to hyperventilate and clutch his neck, knowing that every breath was precious, and wasting everyone of them. It was up to the to of his chest now. This was it. The end. In a bottle.He felt a sense of vertigo and...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nCarrie opened the sliding glass door and breathed in the evening air. The cool wind blew over her bare skin, half-covered by a blue swimsuit. The 18 year old girl stepped onto the grass and strolled towards her pool in her backyard, about to take a nice evening dip in the water. It was the middle of summer and her parents were on a business trip somewhere in Canada. All she wanted was a nice swim in the cold water before sunset. She pushed her long auburn hair out of her face and behind her shoulders. She had a pretty face and a nice body, a perfect person.<br>\r\nShe stood at the edge of the water and squinted her eyes. She saw a small glass bottle floating in the water. <i>Stupid neighbors</i>. she thought. <i>Always throwing their trash into out garden. I should break it over their heads.</i> But the she saw the bottle rolling over in the water, and she swore she saw something inside. She dived into the pool, the cold water instantly stinging her skin. She was a good swimmer and could swim for a good distance. SHe swam underwater and resurfaced next to the bottle. She remembered when she was little, she used to pretend the bottles and toys in the bath were boats, and she was a massive sea monster, crushing and eating evil pirates. He closely inspected the objeect and saw something inside. It looked like...<br>\r\nLike a shrunken person! She gasped as she saw him fighting for breath as water filled the little space. She lifted the bottle to her face and peered inside, streams of H2O pouring our, slowly emptying the bottle. It looked like a muscular boy, scared for his life. She pulled the cork out with effort- it  was sealed on tight- and tipped him into her palm. Carrie tossed the bottle away and gazed at the boy in her hands. He appeared to be....... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unconscious... Carrie carefully looked over the tiny boy... or.. man, He seemed like he was around her age, comparing him to the boys at her school. She saw that he was still breathing, thank goodness.  She looked around to see anything that could indicate how this could have happened. She then looked back to the man in her hands, realizing the cold water probably wasn't helping him in the slightest. She soon waded her way to the steps of her pool and got out, figuring she'd worry about the tiny in her hands catching a cold more than drying herself. She stepped inside and carefully walked to her room. Since her mom used to be a nurse she was taught how to do CPR and how to revive someone who has drowned, though there was nothing in the book about a man who was less than 3 inches tall...  Doing what she could, she gently pressed on his chest, trying to pump out water while trying not to hurt him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments passed, trying as best she could to repeat her lessons. Soon water spurted out of his mouth! It was working! She sat him up, as to not make him choke on the now loose water. He coughed heavily and spat out the water onto her hand. He heaved over and laid down on his side. His blurry vision made him see a slightly tan ground. He rubbed his eyes and moaned in slight pain <br>\r\n\"Uh... w.. where am I?... what's ... what's going on?\" He rubbed his eyes some more and he looked up to see the face of a very concerned girl, at first he even blushed [Wow... she's... pretty. ..... but she's so... ] \"B-big... \" He crawled in her hand  towards her fingers to try and get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-easy!\" Carrie said as she curled her fingers to contain him. \"Don't fall....\"  She looked at him still worried. Who was he? How did he get so small? She figured she'd start with a simple question [Are you single?... NO!] \"W-who are you?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel felt her hand move under him and saw her curl her finger to stop him. He looked up and figured he would at least figure out where he was.. and thank this girl for saving him. After she finished Daniel sighed, [At least knowing my name isn't so useless after all...] \"My name is Daniel... and... you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Carrie\" [So far so good] Daniel thought \"How did you get so small?\" [Never mind....]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't remember. Last thing I remember was..... I was fishing and... next thing I know I'm inside of this.. bottle... it started filling up and....Well... I think you know the rest\" He said ashamed. He felt so ... weak... He could have drowned in a bottle... and if she wasn't there... He didn't want to think about what could have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Are.. are you okay?\" Carrie said as she gently sat down on her bed, still dripping wet along with her hair down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright...aside from the near death experience.. and being shrunk... and not knowing anything about myself other than my name and age...\" Gosh it really hurt to put that into perspective. Carrie saw Daniel become more solemn and knew it was because he had apparently lost his memory along with his height. She faintly remembered how her mom talked about short term amnesia and how something could bring a patient's memories back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... at least you know something\" She said, trying to find the silver lining with a smile. \" The best you... or... we can do is try to find out more about who Daniel is...\" She commented comfortingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked up to see her smile. Something about it... just calmed him and convinced him to trust in her. Taking a deep breath, getting a small hint of her perfume, he sighed \"I guess you're right. Thank you.. for.. saving me by the way.\" Carrie smiled a little wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" She then blushed brightly seeing him finally that he had his shirt off the entire time. \"Oh um... y-your shirt...\" Daniel looked down to see and remembered that he had lost his shirt, causing him to blush slightly as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! um... s-sorry I ... I don't know what happened to it... b-besides y-you've probably already seen your boyfriend's chest before right?\" He asked hoping this wouldn't be so-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... I've.. never had one.. a .. boyfriend I mean\" -awkward... Well now its awkward. [Really? A cute girl like you? No! Do not say that!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......not even for a c....cute girl like yourself?\" [WHY?! You're shrunk stop flirting!] Both he and Carrie blushed brighter. He couldn't believe he was flirting with a girl a hundred times his size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie couldn't believe that a tiny man was flirting with her who was a small fraction of her size! \"U-um.. yeah.. \" She looked away and tried to think of something to divert the awkwardness. \" H-hey... um.. </span></div></div>",

He also noticed that his throat was incredibly dry.<i> I'm thirsty after drowning. Huh. That's funny</i> \"Sure, let's go\" he finally replied. Carrie smiled and stood up, walking downstairs to the kitchen (why she went to her room to wake him up was beyond her). She trotted down the stairs, each step a juddering shock into Daniel's body. He almost fell off Carrie's hand at one point. After a bit, they had reached the kitchen. A pretty basic kitchen; a fridge, an oven, typical kitchen stuff. Carrie set him down on the table and started searching the cupboards for something he'd probably like. She searched a cabinet above the counter, and Daniel finally got a good look at her. She wasn't what you'd call tall, (for a normal-sized person) and she didn't have the best assets (You know...) but Daniel saw the beauty in her face and her personality, which was all he needed to like a person. But as he looked at her, he realized that she wasn't wearing much; just a bikini, and a thin one at that. Blushing, he turned his head away, hoping he wouldn't embarrass himself. He already did, but he didn't want to get on the wrong side of his savior.<br>\r\n\"Aha!\" she yelled \"Everyone likes cookies!\" she pulled a jar out of the cabinet and strolled over to him, placing it on the table. The thing about 3 times his size! \"Here you go, Daniel!\" she said, pulling off the lid (which would of taken some effort from him at this size) and giving him a cookie. It was dotted with brown blocks and was about the size of him. He walked over to the colossal cookie and pulled off a piece the size of his fist. He took a bite out of it, and instantly felt the melt-in-mouth chocolate and sugar within. \"It's delicious.\" he smiled <br>\r\n\"Glad you like 'em. They're home-made.\" she giggled as she watched him dive in for another chomp. He pulled of another piece and started that one as well. <br>\r\nAs Carrie looked on she felt something trickle down her face. She remembered that she was still soaked from the pool, and Daniel was dry (Somehow...) and she was still in her swimsuit.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dan. I'm just gonna go change and dry myself off. Stay here.\" she said as she walked through the door. <br>\r\n\"Where else am I gonna go?\" he mumbled, doubting she could hear him. He bit down again and started to look around. Nothing interesting, just a kitchen. A few reminders on the fridge and that was about it.<br>\r\nBut then he looked to his left. There, on the counter, was a small glass bottle.<br>\r\nUpon seeing it , he had a horrible flashback of him inside of it. Helpless and weak. Sounded strange, but he seemed to have developed a fear of glass bottles. \"Heh,\" he laughed \"I wonder how this happened?\" he crunched on the cookie again. \"I'm lucky It did happen, otherwise I wouldn't of met Carrie. Ah, she's an angel.\"<br>\r\nBut then he realized;...</span></div></div>",

And... you happy you're with me?\" Her tone shifted a little to genuine curiosity. <br>\r\n\"Well.. of course I am. You saved me... if you hadn't... I...\" He stopped, not wanting to think about it, looking away. He felt like he wanted to cry and break down... So much had happened to him... he just felt so... small... pathetic.  His legs felt weak forcing him to sit down. The lump in his throat became harder to swallow, choking him a bit. \"If you hadn't... I... probably would've never been found.... and just forgotten.\"  Just saying that brought him lower as he started to cry. He just felt so pathetic in this moment...<br>\r\nCarrie looked down and saw the tiny man in distress, feeling sympathy.</span></div></div>",

It was also kind of awkward, seeing someone like him (remembering he was still without shirt so she could still see his rippling muscles) break down and start crying. But she felt sympathetic, like a mother trying to calm down her child. With a little hesitation, she scooped up the crying Daniel in her hand. He didn't seem to notice as he kept sobbing. It was hardly audible. She watched him, wondering what she could do. She had something in mind, but wasn't sure if it would do much. Bringing him up to her face, facing her, she drew him closer to her lips. She gently pressed him against them, hoping it would comfort him, even slightly. She kissed him, but only for a little while. She pulled him back slowly, waiting for a reaction.<br>\r\nHe had stopped weeping and was looking at her in confusion with teary eyes. He wiped his face to look somewhat presentable but all he could say was \"W-why?\"<br>\r\n\"Because,\" she said calmly. \"I wanted you to feel comfortable. It doesn't matter what happened earlier, but you have to know that your safe with me! I'll do my best to protect you and take care of you until we can return you to your normal height. You have nothing to fear!\"<br>\r\nShe said it so determined, it raised Daniel's spirit. Despite his sadness, he cracked a smile. \"Guess I look like a loser, huh? Tha-\" he was cut off by another kiss, but this time he received it head on. Her lips were soft and enveloped his entire head. He enjoyed it and was almost disappointed when she pulled away. She held him close to her mouth and smiled. \"Guess what. I've got a surprise for you upstairs.\" she whispered. Her breath smelled like strawberries and cream. <br>\r\nWithout another word, she took him upstairs into her room. It was a typical girls room. Pink walls, white bed, stuff like that.<br>\r\n\"Here you go!\" Carrie said, showing him her nightstand. Sitting on it was a miniature bed and a change of clothes. <br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Dan exclaimed as she set him down next to it. <br>\r\n\"When I was up here, I remembered we had an old dollhouse in the attic, so I went up and brought this stuff down.\" she giggled as he inspected his new clothes. It was a red t-shirt and tracksuit bottoms. Carrie turned around and he changed into them. He sat on his bed. It bounced.<br>\r\nCarrie smiled and a yawn came to her mouth. <br>\r\n\"Well, we better hit the hay.\" She said, climbing into her own bed and pulling the covers on top of her. \"Well, goodnight.\" She yawned after turning off the light. Dan jumped into his.<br>\r\nHe looked up at the ceiling. <br>\r\n\"Man. What a day!\" he thought to himself. Smiling, he shut his eyes and was soon asleep.</span></div></div>",

Everything was dark, and he couldn't even hear himself struggle. He could, however, feel his heart thumping against his chest.<br>\r\nHe felt a presence behind him and, as if on cue, felt himself being spun around. His heart almost stopped when he saw Carrie's giant face, inches away from him, clear in the dark. For a second, he was relieved at seeing his new friend, but it was short lived when looked closer. <br>\r\nHey eyes were not the same as before. Not the caring eyes he had seen before, but they were visibly cruel, like a fox cornering it's prey.<br>\r\nA grin danced on her lips as they parted, and so did her teeth, giving him a terrifying view of her mouth.  It closed and she stared at him, without a word. Her tongue glided over her lips and she opened them again, this time she started to take him upwards. <br>\r\nSuddenly, he knew what was gonna happen.<br>\r\nHe wanted to beg her to let him go, but his voice was trapped in his throat. He couldn't even struggle out of her grip. He looked down at the cave of  <br>\r\nflesh below, praying that she wouldn't drop him.<br>\r\nShe let go.<br>\r\nHe tumbled in the air in a free fall. He screamed, unable to control his fear. He quickly hit the slimy tongue, and slid down the throat as the teeth shut behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie had woken up in the middle of the night from a strange rustling sound. Her eyes opened groggily, trying to focus on what was making the noise. Was someone in her house? On instinct, she reached for the phone under her pillow. Her vision cleared and she fixed her eyes upon a moving shape on her nightstand. She sat up and furrowed her brow. Daniel was fidgeting in his miniaturized bed, beads of sweat on his head.<br>\r\nWithout warning, he bolted upright, gasping for breath. Carrie was taken aback, and reached out a her hand and scooped him up. She brought him up to her face.<br>\r\n\"Dan, what's wrong?\" she asked, worried.<br>\r\nDanny put a hand over his eyes and sighed. \"Nightmares or something. It was about-\" He looked up at her worried eyes, and then her mouth. He remembered this was the same girl who swallowed him in his nightmare. \"Nevermind...\"<br>\r\nCarrie was curious on what he was about to say, but let it go since he obviously didn't want to talk about it.<br>\r\nDan shrugged. \"I guess I'll go back to sleep.\" he said, turning to jump back to the nightstand, but Carrie stopped him. <br>\r\n\"Actually, I was thinking you might want to sleep with me.\"<br>\r\nDan turned around and scratched his head. \"Umm, sure, if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\nCarrie smiled \"It might make the night terrors go away\"<br>\r\nDan grinned back. \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie brought him back and placed him on her pillow, tossing some of her hair onto him as a blanket in case he was cold. \"Good night, Dan!\" she sung. \"Good night, Carr!\" he answered back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was suspicious but passed it off as nothing. He looked back his food and was about to bite in again.<br>\r\n<i>Scuttle, scuttle</i><br>\r\nThere it was again! \"This is getting freaky.\" he mumbled. He put the cookie down and stood up. <br>\r\n<i>Scuttle, scuttle.</i><br>\r\nHe spun to his right.<br>\r\nOn the edge of the table, crawled up a spider. For normal people, this wasn't a problem. But to him, the thing was bigger that hi! Somehow, an abnormally large house spider. Eight disgusting legs and grotesque eyes, each of them as red as blood. It's body was covered in matted strands of hair and it's pincers jammed together menacingly. Normally, Dan had no problem with spiders. But when the spider your height, and a truck's distance away from you, it's reasonable to be afraid. Luckily, it only seemed to be interested in the cookie crumbs. Daniel saw this and picked up a bit of cookie. He quickly flung the piece and aimed it next to the beast. It bounced and came to a stop. The spider looked at it for a while and looked back at Daniel and the bigger pile.<br>\r\n<i>Scuttle, scuttle.</i><br>\r\nIt started to move towards him, sending adrenaline through his veins. His backed away, hoping it would go for the treats. He reached the edge of the table. Fortunately, it's objective seemed to be the cookies. He watched as it slid crumbs past it's jaws and desperately searched for a way out. <br>\r\nThe fall was too far and would end with a splat so, no. No chairs or counters close enough to jump to. Carrie was nowhere to be found so she was no help. \"How long does it take or someone to get changed?\" he groaned. \"Damn it, no escape!\" he kicked the ground in frustration, something he shouldn't of done. The monster looked up from it's meal at Daniel. He knew what it was thinking.<br>\r\nYum, more food!<br>\r\nThat, or...<br>\r\nHey, look! A poor, defenseless human! Let's leave him alone!<br>\r\nSmall chance of that happening.<br>\r\nHis stomp on the table caught it's attention and it started to...<br>\r\n<i>Scuttle, scuttle</i> towards him. It was almost upon him as he tried to run to his left. He was quickly blocked by it's front leg. It pushed him to the ground and opened it's pincers. \"Please don't...\" he whispered, feeling weak and pathetic again. Killed by an insect. Great. <br>\r\n\"Wait. What am I doing?! I have the strength of ten men!\"<br>\r\nHe used his powerful arms and pressed them against the hairy underbelly. He dug his foot into the stomach and kicked upwards. Using it as a lever, he tossed it over him, down into the abyss below. Off the table.<br>\r\nBut the spider wouldn't go down so easily.<br>\r\nIt wrapped a leg round his shoulder and pulled him down. He instinctively grabbed hold of the table, but the wood was polished and hadn't much a grip on it. Soon enough, he was hanging off the edge with a giant spider weighing him down. \"Get off!\" he yelled, using his free hand to punch the enemy. No good. His hand was slipping. With last effort, he slammed his  arm into its face. It made an unearthly screech and let go, plummeting to the hard ground below. He didn't want to look back down but he did anyway. The thing seemed unharmed and fled.<br>\r\nScuttle, scuttle.<br>\r\nIt disapeared into the into the shadows, never to be heard from again. Probably.<br>\r\nDan pulled himself up and sighed. He put his hands on his knees and panted. That was intense.<br>\r\n\"Dan?\"<br>\r\nDaniel looked up at Carrie.<br>\r\n\"I think I've got Arachnophobia.\"</span></div></div>",

Shortly after that, all kinds of things were discussed. One of them being a macrophilia, which for Jamie was kind of difficult at 6'2. However about a week ago, Mark surprised him with a size changing remote. Jamie had all for giving the remote a test drive, but Mark had been insistent on having a long discussion first. In theory being shrunk sounded super awesome, but Mark needed to be sure Jamie was alright. The two devised two 'safe words'; the first was an actual safe word (shark) and the second one was a small device tucked near Jamie's back teeth that would set off an alarm of sorts, in case Jamie couldn't speak or move. They also brought wristbands for communication regardless of how small Jamie got as well as a shot that would stabilized Jamie's mass (aka the smaller Jamie got, the more dense he would get and could handle a lot more pressure). Mark insisted on them testing out the size difference casually before even dipping their toes into anything sexual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, <i>finally</i> the day had come.
