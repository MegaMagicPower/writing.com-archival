            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I rode my bike through the parking lot of my apartment complex, swerving to avoid the occasional pothole.  Arriving outside my building, I locked up my bike and went inside.  After checking the mail, I took the elevator up to the 3rd floor; hoping I didn\u2019t get stuck in the elevator again.  This building sucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe condition of the building was to be expected; after all, it was public housing.  You see; my mom had me just after high school.  It put a stop to her dream of going to college to be a TV reporter; instead, she had to work two jobs just to make ends meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the elevator finally arrived on my floor, I walked down the hall to the apartment.  Letting myself in, I placed my backpack on the floor and closed the door.  \u201cMom! I\u2019m home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I didn\u2019t receive a response, I was about to look around when I saw a note on the kitchen counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Travis,<br>\r\nI got called into work tonight.  I spoke with Aaron\u2019s mother; you can spend the night there.<br>\r\nMom</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron Sullivan had been my best friend since we were 5 years old.  I spent so much time at his house, I considered it my second home.  As I walked down the hall to my room, I thought that it would be nice to see Aaron again; his family had just gotten back from a trip to the Bahamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a 15-minute ride from the apartment to Aaron\u2019s house; I arrived there just as it was starting to get dark.  Walking up to the front door, carrying my backpack with a change of clothes, I knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Aaron\u2019s Mom to answer the door.  \u201cHello, Travis.\u201d Opening the door, she said, \u201cCome on in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Mrs. S.\u201d walking in, I placed my backpack on the floor next to their suitcases.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry to barge in like this, but my mom had to work tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing the door behind me, Mrs. Sullivan looked at me and said, \u201cCan I talk to you for a moment, Travis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Following Mrs. Sullivan into the kitchen, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong, Travis.\u201d Gesturing to a seat, she sat down and said, \u201cI just wanted to ask how things were going at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing fine.\u201d Sitting down, I looked at her and said, \u201cI mean the diner cut back some of my mom\u2019s house, but she\u2019s picking up more hours at Hooters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you can always come to Mr. Sullivan or me for help; we\u2019re always willing to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Sullivan was always looking out for me, even though I wasn\u2019t her son.  About a year earlier, when my Mom was going rough a financial rough patch, Mrs. Sullivan offered to adopt me in order to make things easier for her.  My mom refused the offer; saying she\u2019d always make sure I was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that Mrs. S.\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cI appreciate the offer, but we really are doing fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Mr. Sullivan came walking into the room.  Seeing me, he said, \u201cHello Aaron, I heard you were going to be spending the night with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, I said, \u201cHi Mr. Sullivan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were just getting ready to get some take out since I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t have a lot of food here.\u201d Grabbing his coat, Mr. Sullivan said, \u201cI hope you\u2019re in the mood for some pizza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds great!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Heading down the hall, I saw Aaron\u2019s little sister, Madison walking out of her room.  \u201cHi, Madison.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Travis!\u201d running over to hug me, Madison said, \u201cYou want to see what I found in the Bahamas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Not wanting to disappoint her, I followed Madison into her room.  \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison ran over to her bed and brought back what looked like an ordinary rock.  Showing it to me, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s a wishing stone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to play along because I knew Madison would be upset if I didn\u2019t.  \u201cHow does it work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just hold it close to your mouth and whisper into it.\u201d After whispering to the rock, she opened her window and threw it outside.  \u201cOnce you\u2019re done, you just throw it away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you wish for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh-uh; you know the rule.\u201d giggling, Madison said, \u201cIf I told you, then it wouldn\u2019t come true.\u201d If you tell your wish before you get it, it won't come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I hope it comes true for you.\u201d Tousling Madison\u2019s hair, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to hang out with your brother now, I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the hall to Aaron\u2019s room, I went in to find him playing video games with his headphones on.  Sneaking up behind him, I tapped him on the shoulder just enough to distract him.  Not even a second later, the screen turned red \u2013 confirming that another player had just killed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell, man!\u201d Turning around, taking the headphones off, Aaron said, \u201cI was just about to kill that guy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah right.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cYou were always terrible at sniping people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the controller down, Aaron said, \u201cMy folks said you\u2019d be spending the night.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cYour mom working again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she got called into work at the last minute apparently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later, Aaron and I were playing a multiplayer level on Call of Duty when I had the sudden urge to use the bathroom.  The timing couldn\u2019t have been better since I\u2019d just been killed by a grenade.  \u201cI\u2019ll be right back; I\u2019m just going to use the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry back; I\u2019m outnumbered here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of Aaron\u2019s room, I started to make my way down the hall to the bathroom; only to stop outside Madison\u2019s room.  I didn\u2019t know why, but I had the urge to go into her room.  Unable to shake the urge, I opened her door and walked into find her having a tea party with some of her dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to her, I sat down and said, \u201cMind if I join you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d handing me a teacup, pretending to pour something into it, Madison said, \u201cHave some tea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a pretend sip, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s very good tea, Madison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison and I continued doing that for about five minutes until Aaron came into the room.  \u201cI\u2019ve been looking all over for you.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a tea party!\u201d I was surprised to hear my voice was higher than normal and sounded like Madison whenever she was excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was surprised as well.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your voice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing my throat, I said, \u201cSorry, I-I don\u2019t know what that was about.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cMadison and I were just having a tea party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Aaron had a shocked look on his face.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cTravis, what\u2019s happening to your face?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d seeing the same shocked look on Madison\u2019s face, I said, \u201cWhy are you both looking at me like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better look at yourself in the mirror.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, I walked over to the mirror Madison used when she was playing dress-up.  Looking at my reflection, I was shocked to say the least by what I saw.  My face was no longer that of a teenage boy, it was closer to that of a little girl\u2019s.  I watched in silence as my hair started to get longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercome with shock, I fainted and fell to the floor.</span></div></div>",

Bringing my hands towards my face, I found long brown hair.  \u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d Looking at me, Aaron said, \u201cBefore you try and sit up...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was too late, I was already sitting up before he could finish his sentence.  Looking down, I found myself dressed up as a Disney Princess; Belle to be specific.  I turned to Madison and noticed she was dressed as Cinderella.  \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal?  Why did you dress me like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Madison said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll this happened after you fainted; first your clothes changed and then Madison\u2019s did.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cSoon after, you...well I think you\u2019d better see for yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when Aaron helped me to my feet that I realized he now towered over me; even though we\u2019d been the same height.  <br>\r\nLooking at my reflection in the mirror, I had to clap a hand over my mouth to keep from screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had been 10 years older than Madison, but now it looked like we were practically the same age. \u201cHow could this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron opened his mouth to speak, but Madison beat him to it.  \u201cIt worked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could ask her what she meant, we heard a door closing in the distance; followed by Mr. Sullivan calling out, \u201cKids!

I was embarrassed enough by the notion that I was a bed wetter now, but I could\u2019ve done without Aaron walking into the bathroom just as Mrs. Sullivan was pulling down my nightgown.  \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t think anyone was in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hoped that Aaron hadn\u2019t gotten a glimpse of the pull-ups I was wearing.  \u201cWe\u2019re all set here, sweetheart.\u201d Looking at me, Mrs. Sullivan said, \u201cLet me throw out this packaging and then I\u2019ll be up to tuck you girls in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mrs. Sullivan left, Aaron looked at me and said, \u201cPull-ups, huh?\u201d grinning, he said, \u201cAre you a bed wetter now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d I glared at him and said, \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough I have to wear these; I don\u2019t need you rubbing it in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving Aaron a chance to respond, I left the bathroom and walked back down the hall to Madison\u2019s room.  As I climbed into bed next to her, she said, \u201cWhat did my mom want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Mrs. Sullivan walked into the room.  After making sure we were snug underneath the sheets, she kissed us both on the forehead.  \u201cGoodnight girls.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sitting up in the bed, I felt the Pull-Ups rubbing against my skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping out of bed, I pulled up the nightgown to examine them and found a telltale yellow stain on the inside.  <i>Great, I really am a bed-wetter now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Madison woke up.  Rubbing her eyes, she looked at me and said, \u201cGood morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting my annoyance seep through, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSittin up, she looked at me and said, What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing her my soiled pull-ups, I said, \u201cI wet myself during the night; all because of <i>your</i> stupid wish!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is that my fault?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her, as my annoyance turned to anger, I said, \u201cWho else wished me into a little girl!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Madison could respond, there was a knock on the door.

Getting off the chair, I walked over to her and said, \"I'm sorry I called you stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping off the chair, Madison looked at me and said, \"I'm sorry that I turned you into a little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Madison and I hugged each other for a moment, Aaron said, \"Now that we've settled that, I'll serve you guys breakfast.\" Standing up, Aaron said, \"How do waffles sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Madison and I got huge grins on our faces.

We took turns pulling his limbs and climbing on him. \"Come play with us!\" we begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't,\" he replied. \"I need to research that wishing stone. Go watch TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded like a good idea, so we ran into the living room and turned on the TV. The Sullivans had been watching local TV last night, so the TV was tuned to that station. \"Hey, look,\" I said, \"my mom's on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was standing in front of the apartment building where we lived. Apparently, something bad had happened there, but I wasn't paying attention. There was something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was different. Her eyes were different. What's more, she was called Melanie Richardson, not Melanie Rogers. \"Is... Is she still my mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron came in. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pointed at the screen, where the woman I had known as my mother signed off, identifying herself again as Melanie Richardson. \"What if she's not my mommy anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm sure it'll be alright,\" Aaron said. \"We'll see how things shake out when she comes to pick you up.\" He wiped the tears out of my eyes. \"Let's find you something else to watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron changed the channel to something more kid-friendly.

Before I could say anything, Madison said, \u201cLizzie, the shows back on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil this happened, I never thought I\u2019d be watching Thomas &amp; Friends again; having watched it the first time I\u2019d been 5 years old.

Giggling, I said, \u201cYay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, 15 minutes later, I heard a car horn outside.

Turning to me, he said, \u201cLizzie, I think your mom\u2019s here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up and slowly walked towards the door; worried that the woman I was about to see wasn\u2019t the same one I\u2019d seen yesterday morning.  My worries vanished when I stopped in the doorway.  Walking up the sidewalk was my Mom.  Sure she looked different than when I\u2019d seen her last; before all this, my mom\u2019s idea of a casual \u2018out of work\u2019 outfit was a t-shirt and jeans.  <br>\r\nWhile she wasn\u2019t wearing the same outfit she\u2019d worn on the TV, she still looked professional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got close enough, she smiled and said, \u201cHi sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was suddenly overcome with joy.  With a smile on my face, I ran out the door yelling, \u201cMommy! Mommy! Mommy!\u201d</span></div></div>",

I could still tell it was her, but there were differences to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, her eyes weren't dilated like they'd been when I saw her yesterday morning and she didn't smell like booze.  She'd always focused on taking care of me more than she did herself; in the last few years she'd been drinking and abusing cold medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was glad to see this was no longer appeared to be the case - the only time I'd ever seen her like this was in a photo taken with some girlfriends a few months before I was conceived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back to reality, I put a smile on my face and said, \"Uh huh! We played dress up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could respond, Aaron walked up to us.  \"Hi Mrs. Richardson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron, please call me Aunt Mel.\" With a smile on her face, Mom said, \"Now come here and give me a hug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron quickly leaned in and gave my mom a hug.  As he pulled back, I could see he was embarrassed about something.  I didn't know what it was until I saw him subtly adjust his pants.  I let out a little giggle, which got me a quick glare from Aaron while my mom wasn't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom walked me back to the car, which looked to be a new SUV instead of the old clunker she used to drive.  As she opened the back door, I frowned when I saw a booster seat on the rear seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went silent as Mom placed me in the booster seat.  After making sure I was snug, she went back towards the house.  Once she was out of earshot, I started to squirm a little in the booster seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Aaron walking towards me, I said, \"This is so embarrassing.\" Sighing, I said, \"I was getting ready to take my learner's permit test, now I'm forced to sit in this booster seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what happens when you're a little kid.\" Looking at me, Aaron said, \"Madison doesn't have a problem sitting in them.  I'm sure if you give it time, you'll get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to get used to it.\" Pouting, I said, \"I want to be a big boy again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the expression on my face, Aaron started to chuckle.  When I started to glare at him, he said, \"You look adorable when you're angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't think this was so adorable if you were in my position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Mom came back to the car with my overnight bag.  Seeing the annoyed look on my face, she said, \"Is someone getting a little cranky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to have a little fun at my expense, Aaron said, \"She and Madison both had 5 waffles for breakfast; I think she's coming down from her sugar rush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, it's a good thing daddy doesn't land for a few hours.\" Placing the bag next to me, Mom said, \"That's just enough time for you to have a nap, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not tired!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to close the door, Mom said, \"Say goodbye, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as I hated to admit it, I was starting to get tired and a little cranky.  Without looking at Aaron, I simply said, \"Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to Aaron, mom got into the car and we drove off.  I waved to Madison as we drove by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we left the neighborhood, I was worried about what was coming next - I was going home to a family that only remembered me as a little 5 year old girl.</span></div></div>",

I woke up about 3 hours later, just after 2:45.  Sitting up in the bed, I got my first decent look at my new room \u2013 and there was no doubt it was a room for a 5-year-old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost everything was in varying shades of pink.  It looked a lot like Madison\u2019s room; there was a dollhouse along with a table and chairs for tea parties.  I even saw a chest sitting on the floor, next to a mirror, that I could only assume had dress-up costumes inside it.  <i>This certainly beats my old room; even if it\u2019s for a little girl.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of bed, I walked over to a window and looked outside; surprised to find a spacious backyard with a playhouse and swing set in one corner.  A big smile appeared on my face when I saw an above ground pool attached to the deck.  <i>I guess if I\u2019m stuck like this for a while, there are worse places to live.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards the bedroom door, I walked out into the hall.  I slowly made my way towards the stairs, not really having any idea where I was going.  Walking downstairs, I found myself standing outside a large family room; half of which was taken up what I could only assume was a play area for me.  <i>Wow, this place is awesome!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the family room, passing the large TV on the wall, I spotted some photos out of the corner of my eye.  Most of them were of me at various ages, but there was one in particular that caught my eye.  It was a picture of my mom and a man standing in front of a tree.  My mom was wearing a wedding dress, so I could only assume the photo was on their wedding day.  Looking at the photo, I saw how happy mom looked; a far cry from the woman I\u2019d known until yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a noise nearby, I walked back into the hall and found myself in the kitchen.  I saw mom sitting at the kitchen table, looking through some mail.  My heart dropped sank when I saw a pill bottle sitting next to her.  The mom I knew used to take pills regularly; I hoped that wasn\u2019t the case here.  \u201cMommy, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweetie, you startled me.\u201d Turning to face me, Mom said, \u201cMommy\u2019s fine, I just have a little headache.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen\u2019s daddy coming home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis plane lands in an hour, so we\u2019ll probably be leaving soon.\u201d Picking me up, Mom said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you watch some cartoons until we leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mom carried me back into the family room, I once again spotted the wedding photo.  I would have preferred not to ask it in such a childish way, but my curiosity got the better of me.  \u201cMommy, how did you and Daddy meet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaddy and I met in college; your Aunt Megan, Daddy\u2019s sister, was my roommate.\u201d Sitting down on the couch, with me in her lap, <br>\r\nMom said, \u201cThe three of us spent a lot of time together, much like you and Madison.  One day he stopped by our room and, instead of asking to see her, he asked if I wanted to go to the movies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I listened, I hoped I was doing a good job of hiding my emotions; because I was feeling sad on the inside.  Mom always told me she never regretted having me; but after hearing this, I felt somewhat responsible for keeping her from having the life she deserved.</span></div></div>",

After finding a parking spot, with me in her arms, Mommy and I went into the airport to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as other people came and went; waiting patiently for daddy to come down the escalator.  As I stood next to mommy, I started to worry as to why I\u2019d subconsciously started referring to them as mommy and daddy instead of mom and dad.  The best explanation I could come up with was that Madison\u2019s personality had rubbed off on me.  At least I hoped that was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to get antsy when Mommy squeezed my hand and said, \u201cHere comes Daddy, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, I saw her pointing towards the escalator.  It took me a moment, but I finally spotted the man from the photo \u2013 the man who was now my dad.  Before I realized what I was doing, much like when I\u2019d seen Mommy at Madison\u2019s, I started running towards him yelling, \u201cDaddy! Daddy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaddy knelt down as I got closer and scooped me up in his arms; giving me a kiss on the forehead as he did so.  \u201cThere\u2019s my little princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled a little bit when I heard that.  Giving him a peck on the cheek, I said, \u201cI missed you, daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards mommy, he said, \u201cI missed you too, pumpkin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Mommy and Daddy kissed each other; surprised to find the whole display a little disturbing.  \u201cEwww!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Daddy got his luggage from the baggage claim, the three of us walked back to where the car was parked.  Once I was buckled into my booster seat, and they got into the car, Mommy started driving towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, she turned to Daddy and said, \u201cWhat do you say we treat Lizzie to a little family fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that would be a great idea.\u201d Looking at me, Daddy said, \u201cPumpkin, what do you say we take you to Chuck E Cheese?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small part of me, the part that was still a 15-year-old boy, got the feeling that they were up to something.  But the part of me that was a 5-year-old girl didn\u2019t care about that.  My excitement about going to Chuck E Cheese was greater than my concern that they were up to something.  \u201cYAY!!\u201d</span></div></div>",

I sat in my booster seat, eating my ice cream, as Mommy drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole drive home, I found myself thinking that something was definitely up \u2013 why else would Mommy and Daddy take me to Chuck E Cheese and ice cream.  A growing part of me, however, didn\u2019t care; I was having fun.  <i>Why did my brain insist on cluttering that up with suspicion?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we got back to the house, which I realized was in a neighborhood not far from Aaron\u2019s house, Daddy carried me inside while Mommy closed the door.  Looking at Mommy, Daddy said, \u201cIs there anything else, before I put our tired little princess to bed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can think of one thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Something is definitely going on here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, I almost forgot.\u201d Nodding, Daddy said, \u201cIt\u2019s not something we can hide for very much longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daddy carried me upstairs, Mommy said, \u201cWho\u2019s going to do the honors?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s only appropriate that you do the honors, babe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were in my room, Mommy took me and sat me down on her lap.  \u201cLizzie, sweetie, we\u2019ve got some big news.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cWe think its time we told you what it was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of news?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're going to be a big sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mommy was pregnant.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally that was happy news, and I would have shared in the happiness.  But these weren\u2019t normal circumstances \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to be a big sister.  As if the stress from the last day hadn\u2019t been enough, this news was enough to push me over the edge \u2013 I began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy pulled a tissue out of her purse and started to wipe away my tears.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cWell, <i>say</i> something, sweetie.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did, but it definetly wasn\u2019t what Mommy and Daddy expected.  Looking at them, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be a big sister!  I don't wanna! I don't wanna! I don't wanna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy held me close to her shoulder as I cried.  Looking at Daddy, she said, \u201cI guess she\u2019s not quite ready yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn\u2019t why I was crying; at least not entirely.  I wanted to be a big brother, not a big sister.  Or maybe I still wanted Mommy and Daddy to myself.  But mostly it was the idea that I was going to be a big sister...I think.</span></div></div>",

I instantly remembered not taking it very well.  Sitting up in bed, I realized that I needed to apologize for how I\u2019d acted.  After all, Mommy was going to have this stupid baby whether I wanted her to or not.  <i>Wait, did I just call the baby stupid?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing that thought aside, I climbed out of bed.

Looking back to Mommy, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling down in front of me, Mommy said, \u201cSorry for what, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about last night with the baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweetie, that\u2019s alright; it\u2019s normal for kids your age to react that way.\u201d Looking at me, Mommy said, \u201cDaddy and I should have told you more delicately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll my issues from last night started to come back; mainly how I didn\u2019t want to share Mommy and Daddy.  \u201cBut you\u2019re <i>my</i> mommy and daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that what this is all about?\u201d picking me up, Mommy said, \u201cSweetie, just because you\u2019re going to be a big sister doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t be your mommy anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of me knew that, but a larger part of me wasn\u2019t sure.  \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, sweetie.\u201d Kissing me on the forehead, Mommy said, \u201cYou\u2019re my baby girl; I\u2019ll always love you no matter what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying me back to my room, Mommy tucked me back into bed.

Walking out of the stall, I saw my reflection in the mirror \u2013 that of a little girl wearing a Dora the Explorer one-piece bathing suit.  I had to admit, as weird as this situation was, I did make an adorable little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the bathroom, I saw daddy blowing up a pair of inflatable water wings.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing good in your swim lessons, but I just want to be on the safe side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a little annoyed at that revelation; while I hadn\u2019t been a pro swimmer before the wish, I was pretty good at it.  To find myself in a situation where I needed water wings was pretty embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaddy and I walked onto the beach; after putting the water wings on my arms, he spread out a blanket.  Rather than go straight to the water, I turned my attention to a box of beach toys that Daddy had brought.  Looking at them, I said, \u201cDaddy, can we make a sandcastle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we can, sweetie.\u201d  Taking my hand, Daddy said, \u201cBut first, why don\u2019t we go for a swim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I followed daddy down to the water, I dipped a toe into it and pulled it back \u2013 the water was cold.  Gesturing to the ocean, Daddy said, \u201cWould you look at all that water, Lizzie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out at the water, seeing a few boats go by, I said, \u201cWow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just think; that\u2019s just the top of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both laughed at Daddy\u2019s joke; after which we both went into the water.  We didn\u2019t go too deep, just far enough that I could just barely touch the bottom; but it didn\u2019t matter to me, we were swimming.  <i>This is amazing, I\u2019m swimming my daddy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy never really talked much about my daddy before Madison\u2019s wish; at least not to me.  I think there were times where she\u2019d mention him to some of her boyfriends.  Mommy had a lot of boyfriends before the wish.  When I was little the first time, most of them would leave as soon as they saw me.]=<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got older, some of them would stick around longer; but none came close to marrying her.  There was one guy, that I remember, who told me, \u201cKid, I like your mom, but she's got more issues than <i>National Geographic</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do remember one time, hearing her talk about someone who might have been my daddy.  I was about 9 years old; it was morning and I wanted some breakfast.  I\u2019d stopped in the hall outside the kitchen as Mommy talked to her then-boyfriend.  \u201cSometimes I wonder if things would\u2019ve been different if I hadn\u2019t had so much to drink; or if my gown hadn\u2019t been so low-cut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever ask yourself what if he hadn\u2019t done what he did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was before.  Now I had a happy mommy and a daddy who loved us both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stayed in the water for another 15 minutes or so.  After a while, we both started to get a little cold.  As we stepped out of the water, Daddy looked at me and said, \u201cWhat did the ocean say to the beach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Daddy, I said, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\u201d Smiling, he said, \u201cIt just waved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaddy and I both laughed as we walked back to the towel.  I began to think Daddy had a million of these jokes.</span></div></div>",

Stopping on Mommy\u2019s side of the bed, I started shaking her.  \u201cWake up, mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Mommy woke up and looked at me.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sweetie?  Did you have an accident?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reminded me that I was once again wearing a pair of pull-ups.  Looking at Mommy, I said, \u201cThe thunder is scary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaddy woke up at that moment and saw me standing at the foot of the bed.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that Lizzie is afraid of the storm outside.\u201d Looking at Daddy, Mommy said, \u201cI <i>think</i> she\u2019d feel better if she slept in here with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a problem with that.\u201d Looking at me, Daddy said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, pumpkin, we\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mommy lifted me onto the bed, I scrambled in between them.  I wasn\u2019t sure who I wanted to sleep closer to; but Mommy and Daddy quickly made that decision for me \u2013 as they both turned to face me and moved closer to the point where I was snug between them.  Kissing me on the forehead, Mommy said, \u201cGet some sleep, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I lay in my parent\u2019s bed, with my eyes closed, I started to think \u2013 <i>Why was I so afraid of thunder now?</i></span></div></div>",

After thanking her, I ran back to my room.

Looking at Mommy, I said, \u201cYes!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s settled then.\u201d Smiling, Mrs. Sullivan said, \u201cI\u2019ll text you the details later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Madison took my hand and pulled me over to a nearby fountain.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mental regression started to dissipate a little.  Looking at Madison, I said, \u201cI think so.  Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you just agreed to take ballet classes with me.\u201d Pausing, Madison said, \u201cI just wanted to make sure that was Lizzie and not Travis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard that psychic lady; we\u2019re the same person.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not happy about it, but I can\u2019t back out now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Madison could respond, Mommy walked over with Mrs. Sullivan.  Looking at us, Mommy said, \u201cGirls, you can\u2019t just run off like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to wonder why Mommy was so concerned, until I remembered that I was now a little girl.  I wasn't the big, strong boy that I had been before the wish.  Looking at her, I said, \"Sorry, mommy.\"</span></div></div>",

Nevertheless, I found myself getting excited to see them. <i>It'll be a relief when I don't have to guess how I feel anymore,</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the car, Mommy waved at them. \"Hi, Ma, hi, Pa,\" she called. Getting me out of the booster seat, she asked, \"Wanna give Gramma and Grampa a great big hug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all I needed to hear. As soon as my little feet were on the ground, I ran right over to the people I now knew to be my grandparents. Grampa looked like Daddy, so I knew which side of the family they were from. Gramma looked familiar, but I couldn't place it. Oh, well, they were my grandparents now. Having spent 15 years of my life estranged from one set of grandparents and having no knowledge of the other, I was perfectly happy to have these two. \"Mommy's gonna have a baby,\" I told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard,\" Gramma said, \"but thank you for telling us.\" Turning to Mommy, she asked, \"How are you holding up, Mel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing okay, Ma,\" she said. I guess it was an endearment. \"Lizzie sounds excited about the baby now, but you should have seen the fit she threw when we told her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids are like that,\" Grampa said. \"Peter certainly wasn't thrilled when Megan first came along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a car I did recognize pulled into the driveway, and out stepped Mrs. Wilcox from Child Services. I didn't know why she was here, but I did know how upset Mommy got whenever Mrs. Wilcox came by. I stood there, watching, not sure what to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I definitely didn't expect was what happened. Mommy called out, \"Megan!\" , then ran over and hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was puzzled at first, but then I put it together: Mommy had said that her college roommate, and Daddy's sister, was Megan. So, in this world, they were the best of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are things at work?\" Mommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going alright,\" Aunt Megan replied. \"I've got my substitute trained, so it's maternity leave for me.\" She patted her big belly.</span></div></div>",

By that point Daddy had gotten home, having apparently gone to get some coffee and donuts.  I was walking down the stairs as he walked into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish time would slow down.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe my little girl is about to start Kindergarten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over, Mommy gave Daddy a kiss. \u201cJust think \u2013 it wasn\u2019t that long ago she was in diapers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us got into the car and drove to the school.  I briefly wondered why Daddy was coming; until I remembered he was one of the Kindergarten teachers.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cDaddy, will you be my teacher this year?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, kiddo, I won\u2019t; because you\u2019re my daughter, I can\u2019t teach you.\u201d Looking back at me, he said, \u201cBut Ms. Eliza is a wonderful teacher, you\u2019ll like her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only once we reached the school that I really realized what was going on.  Instead of starting 10th Grade with Aaron, I was about to repeat Kindergarten \u2013 this time as a little girl.  Daddy went ahead to make sure his classroom was ready, leaving Mommy and me to walk into the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been almost 5 years since I\u2019d been in the building; it didn\u2019t look that much different since the last time I was here.  The lunchroom had the same tables; the only difference I saw was the carpet had been replaced.  The only new addition I saw was a small stage in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter signing us in, Mommy and I walked through the crowd.  As we did so, I started to feel a little apprehensive.  There were about two dozen kids running around the room \u2013 which made me realize something.  Until now my only contact with a 5-year-old was with Madison; now I found myself in a situation where I\u2019d be spending five hours a day, five days a week with other 5-year-olds.  Would I be able to keep myself from falling too far into Lizzie or would I lose Travis forever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was pulled back to reality when I heard Mommy say.  \u201cLook, sweetie, there\u2019s Madison and Aaron.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to where Mommy was pointing, I saw them standing over by the snack table.  Running over to them, I immediately hugged Madison.  After saying hello to Aaron, as I helped myself to a juice box, Madison said, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doing good.\u201d Sipping my juice box, I looked at Aaron and said, \u201cDo you remember Mrs. Wilcox from Child Services?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember her trying to take you away from your mom a few times.\u201d Confused, Aaron said, \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt turns out she\u2019s my daddy\u2019s sister.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cShe\u2019s having a baby and she's Lebanese.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA confused look on his face, Aaron looked at me and said, \u201cShe\u2019s Lebanese?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time in two days, I found myself struggling to find a word that I know I remembered.  Looking at Aaron, I said, \"What's that thing where girls like girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean she\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lesbian! That\u2019s the word!</i> \u201cThank you, I couldn\u2019t remember the word.\u201d Throwing out the empty juice box, I turned to Aaron and said, \u201cCould you do me a favor and look up Ed Malloy for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I could do that.\u201d Looking at me, Aaron said, \u201cBut why?  Who\u2019s he supposed to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he\u2019s Travis\u2019 daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we could talk further, I heard a woman\u2019s voice say, \u201cWe\u2019re about to start; if the children could have a seat in front of the stage.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Over the next year, you\u2019ll learn many new things and make new friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found myself looking around at all the other kids; finding it amusing that before last week, I probably never would have met any of them.  Now, due to a mysterious stone, I was likely going to be with them through High School.  Madison must\u2019ve noticed me looking around.  Turning to me, she said, \u201cAre you okay, Lizzie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI\u2019m just thinking about how I\u2019m starting school all over again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching her hand towards me, she said, \u201cAt least we\u2019ll have each other, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I took Madison\u2019s hand, I came to another realization.  Thanks to her wish; as far as everyone knew, the two of us were best friends.  We\u2019d be spending a lot of our time together over the next year.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cOf course, we\u2019ll have each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both turned our attention back to the principal, who\u2019d just finished talking about some of what we\u2019d be learning this year.  I watched as Daddy and a woman walked onto the stage and stand behind Principal Collins.  \u201cNow before I hand you off to your teachers, I want to wish all of you luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about 10 minutes for all the kids to be matched up with their teachers.  Although I remembered Daddy saying something a few days ago, I was relieved that Madison and I were in the same class.  The two of us were standing towards the center of the group when the woman, who looked to be about Mommy and Daddy\u2019s age, turned to face us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing her glasses up onto her nose, she said, \u201cHello boys and girls; I\u2019m Ms. Eliza and I\u2019ll be your teacher.\u201d Looking at us, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re all going to have a good time together, won\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 15 of us, in unison, said, \u201cYes, Ms. Eliza!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ms. Eliza got all of us into a single file line and led us out of the cafeteria.  It was a short walk down the hall to the kindergarten wing.  Opening a door, she gestured for all of us to go inside.  As we walked into the room, both Madison and I looked around with awestruck expressions on our faces.  The room was huge, at least from my perspective; with 3 tables situated in the center, each with 5 chairs around them.  I also saw a play corner with lots of toys and a fairly extensive library of children\u2019s books.  Looking at me, Madison said, \u201cThis is so cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s way better than the last time I was in Kindergarten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear from the chorus of \u2018wow\u2019 and \u2018cool\u2019 that our classmates shared our enthusiasm.  Making her way through the jumble of kids, Ms. Eliza stopped in front of the chalkboard.  \u201cWelcome to your classroom, boys and girls.  As you can see, there are many things we\u2019ll be covering this year.\u201d Smiling, she said, \u201cNow why don\u2019t we all take a seat; then we\u2019ll go around the room and introduce ourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to stick together, Madison and I quickly grabbed two seats at the nearest table.  We were soon joined by two boys and another girl.  The girl, for some reason, stuck out to me.  She wore glasses like Ms. Eliza and it was clear she wasn't quite used to them. \u201cHi.\u201d Offering my hand, I said, \u201cI\u2019m Lizzie, and this is Madison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, I\u2019m Rachel.\u201d Shaking my hand, she said, \u201cI really like your dress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, we listened as everyone else introduced themselves.  As I sat at the table, looking around the room, I found myself thinking - <i>Maybe being in kindergarten again won\u2019t be as bad as I thought.</i></span></div></div>",

As we walked into the room, Madison and I said goodbye to Rachel.  I watched as she ran to a nearby table and hugged two men.  <i>I wonder if they\u2019re lesbians like Auntie Megan.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning my attention away from Rachel, I followed Madison as we made our way through the crowd.  It didn\u2019t take long for us to find Mommy talking Aaron and Madison\u2019s Mom.  The two of us ran up to the group, big smiles on our faces.  Turning to us, <br>\r\nMommy said, \u201cHello girls, how was it with Ms. Eliza?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn unison, we said, \u201cGreat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you make any new friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh; her name\u2019s Rachel and she gots glasses like Ms. Eliza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us answered some more questions about what happened; some of whom came from Aaron.  I figured he was trying to see if I\u2019d regressed more than I already have.  I had a little, but I didn\u2019t really care.  Suddenly we heard someone behind us clear their throat.  We all turned around to find Rachel standing there with the two men I\u2019d seen her hug moments earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out his hand, one of them said, \u201cMy name is Thomas Anderson, and this is my husband Anthony; we\u2019re Rachel\u2019s parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you both.\u201d  Shaking their hands, Mommy said, \u201cI\u2019m Melanie and this is Grace and Aaron.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter introductions had been made, Anthony said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see another same-sex couple here; Thomas and I were wondering if we would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry, we\u2019re not a couple.\u201d Blushing, Mommy said, \u201cMy husband is the other Kindergarten teacher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Wincing, Anthony said, \u201cI saw the two of you talking, and I just assumed you were a couple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, we\u2019re not.\u201d Smiling, Mrs. Sullivan said, \u201cWe\u2019re just close friends; Lizzie and Madison have been friends practically since they were born.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRachel couldn\u2019t stop talking about them; we\u2019re new to the area and she was afraid she wouldn\u2019t make any friends.\u201d Looking at Madison and me, Thomas said, \u201cThanks, girls, for making our daughter feel welcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can never have enough friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the adults went back to talking with each other while Aaron kept an eye on us kids.  A few minutes went by before we all realized we had to use the bathroom.  Aaron escorted us to the bathroom and offered to wait outside.  Before I could go in, he stopped me and pulled me aside.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cSo, how was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid with me, Travis.\u201d Sighing, Aaron said, \u201cWhat was it like being around all those kids?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst off, my name\u2019s Lizzie.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cSecond, it wasn\u2019t that bad.  I actually think I\u2019m going to enjoy kindergarten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d With an incredulous look, Aaron said, \u201cWe were both supposed to be starting the 10th grade; now you\u2019re back in Kindergarten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not joking, Aaron.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cLike it or not, I have the emotional maturity of a 5-year-old; Kindergarten is the best thing for me right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Sighing, Aaron said, \u201cI just hope you\u2019ll be your old self again once we undo the wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t want Aaron to know that I was beginning to have serious doubts about undoing the wish.  \u201cOne can only hope, right.\u201d  Looking at him, I said, \u201cNow if you don\u2019t mind, I really have to go potty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stayed at the school for another twenty minutes or so; not before Mommy and Mrs. Sullivan made plans for Madison and me to have a play date with Rachel this weekend.  After saying goodbye to Aaron and Madison, Mommy put me in the booster seat.  As Mommy got in the car, I realized Daddy wasn\u2019t there.  \u201cWhere\u2019s Daddy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe has to stay for a little while.\u201d Looking at me, Mommy said, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry sweetie, we\u2019ll pick him up after we go to the doctor\u2019s office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know why, but hearing the term <i>doctor\u2019s office</i> sent chills down my spine.  Looking at Mommy, I said, \u201cWhy are we going to the doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe school requires us to make sure you\u2019re properly vaccinated, sweetie.\u201d Pausing, Mommy said, \u201cI know you don\u2019t like shots; but if you\u2019re brave, we\u2019ll get some ice cream afterward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried my best to hide my anxiety \u2013 Travis never liked shots and it was clear that Lizzie didn\u2019t like them either.

After a moment, an older woman came out of a nearby doorway.  \u201cHello, what can I do for you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering if you had any available spots in your beginner\u2019s ballet class?\u201d gesturing to me, Mommy said, \u201cMy daughter wants to learn ballet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt just so happens that we have one more spot available.\u201d Turning to me, she said, \u201cWhat might your name be, little one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was suddenly overcome with shyness.  After a moment, I said, \u201cLizzie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Lizzie.\u201d Smiling, she said, \u201cI\u2019m Gloria, and this is my dance academy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was sitting in the waiting area with Mommy, reading a children\u2019s book while she filled out the paperwork.  At least I was attempting to read it \u2013 I suddenly found myself having trouble with some of the bigger words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was just about to give up in frustration when I heard someone call my name.  \u201cLizzie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from the book, I watched as Rachel walked out of a nearby room with one of her daddy\u2019s.  Putting the book down, I ran over and hugged her, \u201cHi Rachel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a moment to realize the man with her was her father Thomas.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cHello Lizzie, it\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was suddenly overcome with shyness again.  I was saved from having to say anything when Mommy walked over.  \u201cHello <br>\r\nRachel, Hello Thomas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello again, Melanie.\u201d Looking at Mommy, Thomas said, \u201cWhat brings you two here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just signing Lizzie up for the beginner\u2019s ballet class.\u201d Pausing, Mommy said, \u201cWhat about you two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just signing Rachel up as well; I guess our girls took the last two spots.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d Looking around, Mommy said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Anthony?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe got called into work; there was a car crash on the highway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just realized I never asked what you both did for a living.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m an interior decorator; I just started as the manager of Brightburn Interiors.  My better half works as an EMT.\u201d Smiling, Thomas said, \u201cHow about you?  What do you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as I said at the Meet &amp; Greet, my husband Peter is one of the Kindergarten teachers.\u201d Smiling, Mommy said, \u201cMyself, I\u2019m a reporter for the Channel 7 News.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that you mention it, I remember watching your pregnancy announcement,\u201d turning to me, Thomas said, \u201cAre you excited to be a big sister, Lizzie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I didn\u2019t respond again, Mommy said, \u201cI think she\u2019s a little overwhelmed with all the new people she\u2019s met today.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cShe didn\u2019t take the news well at first, but I think she\u2019s coming around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking for a few minutes, Thomas said, \u201cWe should probably get going; Rachel is very excited to try on her ballet outfit when we get home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that I realized he was carrying a wrapped up ballet outfit.  Turning to Mommy, I said, \u201cMommy, can I wear mine when we get home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course sweetie.\u201d Turning to Thomas, Mommy said, \u201cIt was nice seeing you both again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was nice to see you again too, Melanie.\u201d</span></div></div>",

A small part of me was a little disturbed by how excited I was \u2013 but a growing part of me didn\u2019t care.  As I put the package on my bed, I looked at what it contained; a pair of ballet slippers and a pink leotard with a little skirt around the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the next few hours running around the house; doing my best attempts at some ballet moves.  There were several times where I slipped but I quickly got back up.  I was up in my room, having a tea party when I heard the doorbell ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of my room, I went to see who was at the door.  I stopped around the corner when I heard Mommy said, \u201cHello Aaron, what can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Mrs. Richardson.\u201d Pausing, Aaron said, \u201cI was coming back from practice, and thought I\u2019d come to see how Lizzie was doing.  I know she doesn\u2019t particularly care for the doctor\u2019s office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeaking around the corner, I was surprised to see Aaron wearing what looked to be a football uniform.  <i>What\u2019s going on, Aaron doesn\u2019t play football.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell aren\u2019t you sweet; she actually did very well.\u201d Pausing, Mommy said, \u201cShe\u2019s upstairs in her room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Uh-oh.</i>  Quickly running back to my room, I debated whether or not to change out of my ballet outfit.  I could hear footsteps coming up the stairs; but before I could make a decision, I saw Aaron walk into my room.  He stopped in his tracks when he saw me in the ballet outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Aaron, feeling a little embarrassed, I said, \u201cHow do you like my outfit?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I was starting to feel a little insecure \u2013 worried that I didn\u2019t look as pretty as I thought I did.  When Aaron hadn\u2019t responded for a few moments, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t I look pretty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Looking at me, Aaron said, \u201cYou look v-very pretty, Lizzie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d giggling, I grabbed his hand and pulled him into my room.  \u201cSo what\u2019s with all that stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh this?\u201d gesturing to his football gear, Aaron said, \u201cIt turns out that I\u2019m on the football team now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d looking at him, I said, \u201cYou suck at football, why would they let you on the team?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m good at it in this reality.\u201d Shrugging, Aaron said, \u201cI saw some photos at the house; apparently I\u2019ve been playing youth football since I was 7 years old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m born a girl instead of a boy; suddenly you\u2019re playing football?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not all.\u201d Looking at me, Aaron said, \u201cWith Travis...out of the picture, it seems my best friend is Colin Sheppard; who\u2019s the Quarterback.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin Sheppard, at least prior to the wish, had been kind of a geek.  It was strange to think that my being a girl now had affected so many people\u2019s lives.  Walking over to my tea set, I said, \u201cDo you have time for a tea party?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs fun as that sounds, I don\u2019t have the time.\u201d Looking at me, Aaron said, \u201cI just stopped by to see how you were doing; I know you used to hate shots and figured it was the case now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually the doctor did a good job distracting me; a nurse read me a story and before I knew it, I\u2019d gotten all my shots.\u201d Rubbing my arm, I said, \u201cI am feeling a little sore though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear the shots didn\u2019t bother you, but that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Looking at me, Aaron said, \u201cI was surprised to see you so excited to wear that outfit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it a crime that I want to try it out before ballet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I...it\u2019s just the Travis I knew would never be caught dead wearing something like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis would never fit Travis; it\u2019s too small for him, silly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling down to my level, Aaron looked at me and said, \u201cAnswer this question for me; do you actually like the outfit, or are you just doing this because you\u2019re a little girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it really matter?\u201d taking a breath, I said, \u201cI like this outfit because it makes me feel like a princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you stop talking like that!\u201d getting agitated, Aaron said, \u201cYou may look like a 5-year-old girl, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to act like one.  You\u2019re a teenage boy for god\u2019s sake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not an icky, booger-faced boy!\u201d starting to get upset, I said, \u201cI\u2019m a pretty little girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit Travis; you\u2019re not supposed to be a little girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said a bad word!\u201d making my way towards the door, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell my mommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could make it to the door, Aaron stood in my way.  \u201cAre you seriously telling me dammit is a bad word?\u201d looking at me, he said, \u201cCome on Travis, your favorite word has an M and an F in it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name\u2019s not Travis!\u201d trying to get past Aaron, I said, \u201cStop calling me Travis!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019ve got to put a stop to this before you completely become a girl.\u201d Going to open the door, Aaron said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to find another stone so I can put things back the way they were.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know whether it was out of fear or just exhaustion; frankly, it could have been both.  Before Aaron could even start to turn the doorknob, I fell to the floor and started crying.  It didn\u2019t take long for Mommy to come running into the room.  Seeing me in tears on the floor, she turned to Aaron and said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, we were just talking.\u201d Pausing, Aaron said, \u201cI must\u2019ve said something wrong because suddenly she started crying.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t anything you did, Aaron.\u201d Picking me up off the floor, Mommy said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty eventful day, I think she\u2019s just tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t know what it would accomplish, but part of me wanted to get Aaron in trouble.  Turning from him to mommy, I said, \u201cMommy, Aaron said a bad word!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMommy turned to Aaron with a shocked look on her face.  \u201cWhat did you say, Aaron?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may have accidentally said the word dammit.\u201d Pausing, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it just slipped out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be more careful Aaron; Lizzie\u2019s at an impressionable age.\" heading towards my bed, Mommy said, \"Her father and I don\u2019t want her to repeat that kind of language.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mommy turned to carry me over to the bed, Aaron glared at me.  Walking up behind her, Aaron said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mrs. Richardson, it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Aaron left a few minutes later, I was still worried about his wanting to use the stone.  I didn\u2019t want to lose this life; even if it meant being a girl.  After getting me out of the ballet outfit and into some pajamas, Mommy put me down for a nap.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days had passed since my argument with Aaron; it was now Saturday.  Almost everyone was in the backyard for the end of the summer BBQ that Mommy and Daddy were throwing.  I spent most of the first 30 minutes or so hanging around my grandparents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange being around Mommy\u2019s parents; I\u2019d only ever heard nasty things about how they disowned Mommy after she\u2019d gotten pregnant with Travis.  Instead of wanting nothing to do with mommy and me; now they were spoiling me.  I guess it helped that, at least for now, I was their only grandchild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent some more time with Daddy\u2019s parents too; since I hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to see them much earlier in the week.  Poppa, as he liked to be called, was showing me some magic tricks when we heard the gate open behind me.  Turning around, I saw Auntie Megan walking over with another woman following behind her.  It didn\u2019t take a genius to realize that the other woman was Auntie Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping off of Poppa\u2019s lap, I ran over to them; barging into Auntie Megan harder than I\u2019d meant to.  \u201cOof.\u201d Kneeling down, Auntie Megan said, \u201cBefore careful sweetie, you don\u2019t want to hurt the baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Auntie Megan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving me a kiss, Megan got up and walked over to the adults; leaving me alone with Auntie Amber.  I was a little awkward around her; knowing next to nothing about her except that she was Auntie Megan\u2019s wife.  She was very pretty; tall with brown hair.  <br>\r\n\u201cHi kiddo, are you excited for your first day of school on Monday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI\u2019m also \u2018cited about ballet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mommy told me you were doing that.\u201d Smiling, Amber said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to do great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron and Madison arrived with their parents a short time later.  Once everyone was settled, Daddy stepped in front of everyone.  \u201cMelanie and I want to thank you all for coming.\u201d Gesturing to Madison and me, he said, \u201cIt seems like only yesterday that these adorable girls were in diapers, but come Monday they\u2019re going to be starting Kindergarten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison and I stood there, feeling a little embarrassed, as everyone stared at us.  Turning his attention to the Sullivan\u2019s, daddy said, \u201cKevin, Diane; who would\u2019ve thought, 7 years ago, when I was assigned Aaron\u2019s 2nd-grade class as a student teacher, that we\u2019d become such good friends.\u201d Smiling, Daddy said, \u201cI love Aaron and Madison like they\u2019re my own kids; just as you love Lizzie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaddy wrapped up his little speech a moment later; as everyone gave a toast.  Once that was finished, Madison and I ran over to the little playhouse.  I was about to go inside when Aaron walked over and said, \u201cLizzie, can I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-Uh.\u201d Trying my best to look angry, I said, \u201cThere are no icky boys allowed in my playhouse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLizzie, please...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo boys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Aaron walked off, defeated, I went inside and closed the door.  Looking at me, Madison said, \u201cSo, uh, what\u2019s going on between Aaron and you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI proceeded to explain what happened a few days prior.  When I was finished, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want Aaron to undo the wish.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI like being a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cSometimes my boy mind sneaks through, but most of the time I\u2019m thinking and acting like a little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if Aaron finds a stone and undoes the wish anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Whiskertail suggested that I make my own wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s Mrs. Whiskertail?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s my stuffed animal rabbit.\u201d Looking at Madison, I said, \u201cI, uh, talk to her and the other stuffed animals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was worried Madison would think I was crazy.  Instead, she looked at me and said, \u201cCan I talk to them too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d grabbing Madison\u2019s hand, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go up to my room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison and I ran out of the playhouse; making our way towards the kitchen door.  On our way, I saw that Becky had shown up; she was currently in a passionate kiss with Aaron.

While the young man was downstairs, the woman came into my room; where I was waiting with Mommy, Aaron and Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one look around the room, the lady turned to everyone and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to speak with the child please; in private.\u201d <br>\r\nSighing, she said, \u201cThe crime scene is well and truly trampled, so please give me the courtesy of allowing us to speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess trampling a crime scene was a bad thing, because everyone left my room with their heads down.  Once everyone was out of the room, the officer closed the door and came over to me.  Kneeling down, she smiled at me and said, \u201cHello sweetie, my name\u2019s Doris.

Gesturing to each of the animals, I introduced them. \"This is Mrs. Snifflepuss, Mrs. Whiskertail, and Mrs. Honeysnout. Ladies, this is Doris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew Doris probably thought it was childish, but I was happy that she played along.  \"Delighted to make your acquaintance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Doris at the table, I did notice something funny; I couldn\u2019t hear the ladies talking like I did when I was alone.  After a while of us sipping pretend tea, Doris said, \u201cLizzie, I\u2019d like to ask you about what happened here today; if that\u2019s alright with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see the lady who got in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Pausing, I said, \u201cShe was old and scary looking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid she say anything to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Nodding, I said, \u201cShe said it was my density to bring forth the messy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Nodding, Doris said, \u201cWhat did you say to that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told her I wanted to be a ballerina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter asking a few more questions, and having some more sips of her tea, Doris got up to leave.  I followed her down the hall and watched as she went downstairs to speak with Mommy and Daddy. \u201cI'd recommend you get a security system, Mr. Richardson.

It was my first day of Kindergarten and, not surprisingly, I was looking forward to it.  I don\u2019t really know what caused the change in my attitude; but over the last few days, as today got closer, I got more and more excited about the prospect of going back to Kindergarten.  Sure there was a part of me that wished I was still in High School with Aaron, but that part was slowly fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was sitting up in bed when Mommy and Daddy came into the room; with Daddy holding a video camera.  I wondered what they were doing until I realized they were doing what most parents would do; videotaping their child on her first day of school.  Mommy was already in tears as she sat next to me.  \u201cI promised myself I wouldn\u2019t cry, but I can\u2019t believe my little girl is starting Kindergarten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s growing up so fast.\u201d Turning the camera to me, Daddy said, \u201cLizzie, sweetie, are you excited for your first day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh!\u201d giggling, I said, \u201cI very \u2018cited, daddy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving composed herself, Mommy said, \u201cLet\u2019s get you ready; the school bus is going to be here soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for me to get ready; after taking a quick bath, Mommy got me dressed up in the outfit she\u2019d picked out \u2013 a nice floral print dress.  I was starting to get excited, so I was squirming around as she tried to put a bow in my hair.  Thank god Aaron won\u2019t see this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having a bowl of cereal, I grabbed my Frozen backpack and went outside.  Holding Mommy\u2019s hand, while Daddy recorded, we walked the half a block to the bus stop.  When we got there I saw a few kids from the meet &amp; greet, none of whom were in my class, as well as a few 2nd and 3rd graders.  I started to get nervous at this point; it really hit me that I was starting Kindergarten again.  I should have been starting 10th grade with Aaron, but now I was back in Kindergarten with kids who hadn\u2019t been born yet when Travis had started Kindergarten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept to myself while I waited for the bus; I didn\u2019t know the other Kindergarteners and the big kids wouldn\u2019t show any interest in a <br>\r\n5-year-old girl.  Meanwhile, Mommy and Daddy were talking with the other parents.  I found myself wishing that Madison had the same bus stop as me, so at least I\u2019d have a friend to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the school bus arrived; I was the last one to get on.  I hesitated briefly, looking back towards Mommy and Daddy, before taking a deep breath and stepping onto the bus.  <i>Here goes nothing.</i></span></div></div>",

Deep down I knew what the letters were but as I sat at the table with Rachel and Madison, I had some difficulty remembering what they were.  I guess what Madame Burke had said was coming true; as time went by; I would start losing some of what I\u2019d learned as Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat became readily apparent when it came for us the class to color some drawings of the letters A B and C.  I was by no means a skilled artist before all this, but I knew how to stay in the lines.  Now, as Lizzie, I was having a really hard time doing it.  I was actually starting to get a little frustrated by my inability to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, I got to the point where I threw the crayon down in frustration.  Rachel and Madison looked up at me briefly before returning to their coloring \u2013 they had no problem staying in the lines.  Ms. Eliza must\u2019ve noticed I was getting frustrated, as she walked over and knelt down next to me.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Lizzie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t draw inside the lines.\u201d Pouting, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s really fustrating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot everyone gets it right on the first try, sweetie.\u201d Picking up the crayon, Ms. Eliza said, \u201cHere, I\u2019ll show you a little trick from when I was your age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing another copy of the letter 'A', Ms. Eliza took the crayon and started drawing along the outside of the letter.  Once she was finished, I looked at her and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is just to make the lines easier for you to see.\u201d Handing me the crayon, Ms. Eliza said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have no trouble staying in the lines now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ms. Eliza watching me, I started coloring in the letter again.  It only took me a few minutes to finish; this time I only strayed outside the line twice.  Looking up at her, a smile on my face, I said, \u201cTanks Ms. Eliza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, sweetie.\u201d Getting up, Ms. Eliza said, \u201cNow finish the other two, because it\u2019s almost time for lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ms. Eliza turned to walk off, Madison leaned over and said, \u201cI knew you\u2019d get it eventually, Lizzie.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It did learn one crucial piece of information from talking with him \u2013 apparently, my name was now Elizabeth and my mom had dropped me off for the night while she went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dinner was finished, and Mr. Sullivan went into the den to watch a pre-season baseball game, I decided that I wanted to get more answers.  With Aaron and Madison following behind me, I made my way to Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan\u2019s bedroom.  Walking in, I found Mrs. Sullivan putting away some laundry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing us, she said, \u201cWhat can I do for you three?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe want to know why you turned into a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I see you get right to the point.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cHave a seat on the bed and I\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some help from Aaron, I soon found myself sitting next to Madison on the bed.  Closing the door, Mrs. Sullivan said, \u201cIt all started about 16 years ago; about a year before Aaron was born.  As far as Aaron and Madison are aware, their father and I met in college after being introduced through a mutual friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re about to say that\u2019s not really the truth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is, as far as your father and everyone else is concerned.\u201d Pausing, Mrs. Sullivan said, \u201cWe did meet in college, but before the incident with the stone, your father and I were roommates.  We\u2019d been friends since Freshman year and did almost everything together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything changed a few months before graduation; it was the weekend of Aunt Rachel\u2019s wedding.  Your father, over the previous few months, had been telling everyone about this amazing girlfriend he had; everyone expected that he\u2019d bring her to the wedding.  The only problem was that she didn\u2019t exist \u2013 your father had made the whole thing up.\u201d Pausing, Mrs. Sullivan said, \u201cHe was so desperate in the days leading up the wedding that I was worried he\u2019d do something insane.  It was the night before he was supposed to leave, and we\u2019d just gotten back from a Frat party.  I\u2019d found this weird looking rock I was going to give to Uncle Ryan since he loved rocks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou made a wish with the stone, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to finish the story, Aaron?\u201d sighing, Mrs. Sullivan said, \u201cYes \u2013 I drunkenly wished that there was something I could do to help your father.  Suddenly there was a shock from the stone and I dropped it \u2013 but that was only the beginning.  By the time we\u2019d gotten back to our dorm, it was evident something was happening to me.  It wasn\u2019t long before I\u2019d gone from being a 6\u20193\u201d muscular guy to a petite 5\u20195\u201d woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, I said, \u201cSo what happened next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were both too drunk to do anything about the wish.\u201d Sighing, Mrs. Sullivan said, \u201cThe next morning, after we\u2019d sobered up, your father had the amazing idea to bring me to the wedding as his girlfriend.  I refused to do it, but he convinced me otherwise.  Anyway, we get the wedding and everyone is fawning over me as the girlfriend they\u2019d heard so much about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what happened to keep you from turning back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stop interrupting me, Aaron.\u201d Pausing, Mrs. Sullivan said, \u201cWe get back to school after the wedding and manage to find the stone.  We both tried dozens of times to undo the wish but nothing happened.  I later found out about the 48-hour deadline \u2013 meaning I was stuck as a woman.  By that point reality had started to change \u2013 I was no longer your father\u2019s roommate, instead, I was a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi.  We went our separate ways after that, I immersed myself in my new life while your father hung out with our former friends \u2013 who didn\u2019t remember me being a guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you said this was about a year before I was born.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just getting to that part.\u201d Turning to us, Mrs. Sullivan said, \u201cAbout a month had passed since the wedding and I realized I hadn\u2019t had a period since I became a girl.  I took a pregnancy test and found out I was pregnant \u2013 the result of your father and I drunkenly having sex after the wedding.  The rest is, as they say, history \u2013 I gave birth to Aaron 8 months later and we got married a few months after that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us sat on the bed, taking in everything we\u2019d just heard.  Looking at his Mom, in disbelief, Aaron said, \u201cI-I can\u2019t believe you used to be a guy.  You\u2019re so...feminine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve had 15 years to learn how to be a woman.\u201d Looking at Aaron, she said, \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, you look a lot like me when I was your age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaddy doesn\u2019t remember you used to be a guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, sweetie, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d looking at Madison, Mrs. Sullivan said, \u201cHe started to forget soon after we got back.  By the time I told him I was pregnant, he just remembered me being his girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does this mean for me?\u201d concerned, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough I\u2019m a 5-year-old girl; I don\u2019t want to be stuck like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we have to find that stone as soon as possible.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After a while of tossing and turning, careful not to wake Madison, I got out of bed and walked out of the room.  Making my way downstairs to the kitchen, I retrieved a flashlight and quietly walked outside.  It was unseasonably chilly outside \u2013 not the kind of weather my Frozen nightie was made for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching through the backyard wasn\u2019t easy; I had to be careful not to wake anyone in the house.  On top of all that, the stone could\u2019ve ended up anywhere.  As I searched through the garden alongside the house, careful not to trample Mrs. Sullivan\u2019s plants, I finally spotted the stone nestled behind the machinery for the HVAC system.  This was where I realized the benefits of being a young child \u2013 I was small enough to reach in and grab the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at it, I saw that it was a perfectly round stone with blue on the bottom and grey on top; matching the clothes I\u2019d been wearing prior to the wish.  \u201cThank goodness I found it!\u201d sighing, I said, \u201cNow Madison can reverse the wish!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI carefully made my way back out of the garden, only for someone to smack my hand.  I yelped in surprise and watched, horrified, as the stone fell from my hand and into the hands of an elderly woman.  Looking at her, I saw she was wearing strange clothing; was around 5\u20196\u201d and had long silver hair.  From her appearance, she reminded me of a gypsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t dwell on her appearance for too long, because she had something I needed.  Screaming, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s mine!\u201d<br>\r\nAn attempt to grab the stone back ended with my falling on my butt in the moist grass.  \u201cThis is a cursed item, little girl.\u201d Staring at me, with a cold look in her eyes, she said, \u201cYou should consider yourself lucky that I found you in time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, I was getting desperate.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cPlease, I need it to reverse a wish my friend\u2019s sister made.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at me with a surprise.  \u201cSo you\u2019re the stone\u2019s latest victim.\u201d Laughing, she said, \u201cIf it\u2019s any comfort, your friend will not be having a fun time either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her, I gulped and said, \u201cWhat do you mean...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, this is a cursed item.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cEvery wish comes with a price.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy friend\u2019s mommy was changed by a wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I silently wondered why I said mommy, the woman looked at me and said, \u201cI recently learned about her, which is why I\u2019m here.\u201d  pausing, she said, \u201cShe wished to help a friend in need, but the price was having to start a new life in the process.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to my feet, I jumped for the stone again.  \u201cWhat about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reversing a wish brings another price.\" Serious, the old woman said. \"The question now is if it\u2019s one you\u2019re willing to pay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure how to react to that.

Thanks to my shortened legs by the time I\u2019d gotten upstairs, she\u2019d already arrived outside the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing up behind her, I saw Madison sitting on the toilet; her pajama pants resting at her feet.  <i>Wait a minute \u2013 we both wore nighties to bed.</i>  Before I could think about that further, I saw Aaron standing by the shower with a confused look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly felt very concerned about Madison.

I knew that Travis was the 15-year-old son of one of mommy and daddy\u2019s friends, but I also had a strange feeling that I was supposed to be Travis.  But that was silly; I\u2019ve always been Madison\u2019s younger twin sister.  Looking at Travis, I said, \u201cBecause we\u2019re twins, silly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay something really weird is going on here; I think it\u2019s got something to do with that stone Madison had last night.\u201d A confused look on his face, as if he was trying to figure out what was happening, Travis said, \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be your son Aaron, and Lizzie\u2019s supposed to be my best friend Travis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Travis for a moment, Mommy turned to Madison and me.  \u201cGirls, why don\u2019t you go play in your room for a little while?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, mommy.\u201d Turning to Madison, I saw that she had the same confused look on her face as Travis.  \u201cAre you okay, Madison?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I-I\u2019m fine.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go have a tea party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Travis looked on, Madison and I walked down the hall to our bedroom.  Once we were far enough down the hall, I heard Mommy said, \"Travis, honey, I think it's best if you don't come around here for a while.\" pausing, she said, \"You're a good kid, but you're clearly dealing with something and I don't want my little girls exposed to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked out of earshot before Travis could respond.  As we walked past the playroom; we walked past a framed photo \u2013 one of Daddy, Mommy, Madison and me at Disney World with Cinderella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison and I were having a tea party with our stuffed animals when, a short time later, we heard a car honking its horn.  We both went to the window as Travis walked out down the sidewalk.  We watched as he stopped halfway down and looked back at the house; spotting us watching him from our bedroom window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood there for a moment before walking over to his mommy and daddy as they stood in front of their car.  Turning to Madison, I saw a sad look appear on her face \u2013 although I couldn\u2019t figure out why.</span></div></div>",
