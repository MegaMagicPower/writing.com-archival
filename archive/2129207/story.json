Besides, I'm almost ready!\" Ann Takamaki called out, her voice echoing in locker room she was just finishing getting ready in. When she asked Ryuji Sakamoto to help her exercise and keep fit for her blossoming modeling career, she knew the bleached blonde boy would be obnoxious about it, but they hadn't even started yet and he was already getting on her case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs good of friends they were, Ryuji's hot-headed attitude always got on her nerves, and if he hadn't proven how knowledgeable he was at working out, she would have gone to the gym alone. But the last time she'd been to the gym with him and their mutual black-haired friend, he was able to give her plenty of direction and make sure she got a full workout, which she knew she needed. Unlike the last time she had been to the gym with Ryuji, Ann had ditched her school P.E. sweats, instead wearing tight dark red jogging pants and a crimson tank top, an outfit she'd gotten specifically to be reminiscent of her former Phantom Thieves gear. She'd never wear that dominatrix cat suit in the real world, but form-fitting red workout clothes were a good alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStoring the rest of her belongings in a locker, Ann paused for a moment, then reached into her bag. Digging for a moment, she found the small diamond she was looking for. It was no bigger than her fingernail, and it wasn't a real diamond, not in the traditional sense- it was a gem created from a Shadow from the Metaverse. Joker had called it Regent, named after the real diamond, and through some method she didn't quite understand, Joker had turned the Shadow into a physical object. A melancholy looked passed over her face; Joker had left behind a lot of trinkets and gear from their time as the Phantom Thieves when he moved back to his hometown. One of them was the fake Regent diamond Ann now held softly, something she kept to remind her of her far away friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking away the beginnings of tears, Ann smiled. It was sad to think about, but Joker wasn't gone forever or even that far away really, and he wouldn't want her to be so sappy anyway. Good times were hard to think about sometimes, she knew, and didn't let it get her down. Still smiling and without thinking about it, Ann pulled her shirt and sports bra open and dropped the diamond into her bust. Not the best place to keep a precious keepsake, but it was the only place she had on her to keep it relatively safe, held against her chest due to the snug bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For motivation!\" She said out loud in her usual bubbly tone. Knowing Ryuji was getting agonizingly impatient, Ann slammed the locker closed and dashed outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff, took you long enough!\" Ryuji said, scowling with his arms crossed and leaning against the wall next to the doorway Ann emerged from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. You look like such a creep waiting outside the girl's locker room, by the way!\" She replied with playful snark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuddup! I'm doin' you a favor here, y'know!\" He bit back. Pulling off the wall, the track athlete took the lead. \"C'mon. Let's stretch out and then get some cardio. That'll be plenty for you right now.\" Ann dutifully followed, inwardly thankful for Ryuji. As much of a hard time as they gave each other, she knew he cared, and she suspected he felt the same way about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearing the treadmills, Ryuji stopped to stretch, bending his right leg behind him and pulling on his ankle. Ann followed his lead, unaware of the faint glow the diamond in her cleavage was emitting. During all of the Phantom Thieves heists, none of them had ever bothered to wear any of the gear into the real world, including items made from Treasure Demons. Joker never shared any of the equipment with the team as their leader, and none of them ever had a reason to ask for them. Now that Ann had \"equipped\" the Regent, however, she was unwittingly finding out that they actually had an effect on people in the real world, not just the Metaverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stretched, Ann was surprised with how easy it seemed to feel to her to do so. She wasn't exactly out of shape, but she was holding her leg taut for much longer than she expected to, not growing sore or tired at all. Shrugging, she began stretching the other leg, unaware of how taut her quads were on the leg she just lowered. The Regent under her top was an accessory that boosted the wearer's strength in the Metaverse, and it was beginning to do the same thing to Ann in the gym...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as Ann had been surprised at her flexibility while stretching, she was even more taken aback at her endurance on the treadmill. It was effortless for her to keep pace with the setting Ryuji had set for her. Granted, it was a slow setting to match her beginner status, but she was more than taking it in stride for the past several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can we turn this thing up? I'm not feeling much of a burn.\" Ann asked, not even slightly winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Faster?\" Ryuji said cautiously, not out of breath either; that was to be expected from a track runner, though. \"I guess, just don't wear yourself out too fast. You won't get anywhere doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know my own limits.\" Ann replied dismissively, unaware of how false that statement was becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a couple of beeps Ann pressed the button to speed up her treadmill, keeping pace with it in flawless step. As she jogged more intensely, her slim legs began to strengthen, developing lean, dense calves and thighs. Her glutes were especially affected, firming up and rounding out just a bit, pulling her already tight pants even more taught against her defined butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's enough for now.\" Ryuji said after another 10 minutes of jogging, powering down his treadmill and hopping off. \"Good job, you kept up pretty well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Ann replied with appreciative glee. \"You should give me a challenge next time. I didn't even break a sweat!\" Encouraged by Ryuji's rare praise, she proudly placed her hands on her hips, not noticing how much more solid they were than they had been less than an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, don't act all cocky! You're still a newbie!\" He scowled. Ann scowled back at him but let it drop, knowing that's just how he was. \"Okay, you want to tone up, right? Let's get some weight lifting in.\" Ryuji moved away from the treadmills and towards the weight racks, so Ann followed, remembering her first workout with Ryuji. Before, she had barely been able to keep up with him and by the end of it she ended up huffing and puffing on the floor, too tired to even stand. But now she felt great, better even since her short run. Chalking it up to just underestimating herself, Ann put it out of her mind and focused on Ruyji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... Here, try these.\" He said after inspecting the dumbbells and pulling a couple smaller ones off the rack. \"They're light but they should be fine for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Only 10 pounds?\" Ann asked as she took them in her hands. \"But these are so light!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh. I just said that. Now, start with your arms at your side and slowly bend them up to your shoulders. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Fine.\" She said, annoyed. Doing what Ryuji said, she lifted the dumbbells up and down several times. She tried to do as she was told and do slow reps, but the weights were so light it felt like she wasn't lifting anything at all. \"Ryuji, this is way too easy! Aren't I supposed to feel some kind of burn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ain't the point!\" He said. \"You're supposed to do lots of small reps to build up your strength and then you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" Ann interrupted, shoving the weights into Ryuji's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the hell?!\" He yelled, trying not the drop the light weights he'd been awkwardly given. Ignoring Ryuji, Ann reached for a new pair of dumbbells, making sure to grab larger ones than her friend had chosen for her. Deciding on the heftier weights with the number 25 on them, she picked them up with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hup! Now that's more like it!\" Ann said with a nervous smile. She was worried that she would embarrass herself by picking dumbbells that were too heavy for her, and that almost seemed true at first. After a moment, though, her grip seemed to tighten and secure the weights in her hands. Again following Ryuji's instructions, Ann slowly curled the dumbbells up and down and was pleased to feel actual tension in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just toss weights at a guy, Ann! That's dangerous!\" Ryuji cried as he placed the small weights back on the rack. \"And I can't afford to pay for them if you break 'em!\" Looking back to Ann, he noticed the size of the weights she was lifting. \"Wait, you're not having any trouble with those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I told you those other ones were too light.\" She said, pumping her arms at a steady pace. With each lift her biceps tensed tighter, growing more solid with each rep. Her thin, delicate arms began to thicken ever so slightly, going from slim and undefined to tight and athletic in an incredibly short time. Unlike her cardio workout, she actually began to sweat a bit using the dumbbells, a sheen of perspiration appearing on her bare arms. After doing reps for a couple minutes, Ann finally slowed to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better!\" Ann said as she placed the weights back on the rack herself. \"How'd I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji stared at her for a moment before blinking. \"Uhh... Really good, actually. You sure you haven't been trainin' on your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Why, am I doing something wrong?\" She asked innocently. Ryuji didn't know how to answer that- on the one hand, she was pushing way more than what her limits should have been for such a beginner, but on the other, she wasn't having any trouble with it. In fact, she was looking rather toned, at least in her slender arms- which were looking less slim and more built that Ryuji remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm just imagining things.\" He said. Ann was looking more athletic, sure, but she had been exercising for a while so she was probably just tensed up from that, and maybe he just hadn't been paying close attention to her lately. \"I'm gonna need to work out a new routine, though... This stuff's too easy for you, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure, fine. Hey, what about that?\" Ann dismissed Ryuji and pointed to...</span></div></div>",

I've got energy to burn and I want to pump some iron!\" She exclaimed, smiling brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji rolled his eyes at her chipper attitude. \"Careful, keep talking like that and you'll turn into a meathead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you really know how to kill a mood, Ryuji.\" Ann said, dropping her smile for an angry frown. \"Just help me with this thing, will you?\" With that she strolled to the bench press and laid down, waiting for Ryuji to come and show her what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit bein' so pushy! I'm the expert here, remember?\" He retorted. Nevertheless, he followed her to the bench she was waiting for him at, a stark change from Ann following him less than an hour ago. Taking his place behind her and the bench, Ryuji went on with his direction. \"Alright, grab the bar with both hands and lift, and make sure they're spread far enough apart, otherwise you'll just drop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, seriously?! You didn't even put any weight on it!\" Ann complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, 'cause you're an amateur! Now stop questionin' me, you asked me to coach you!\" He snapped, growing tired of her attitude. Still, by that point it seemed like maybe she could handle a bit of weight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'm obviously way better at this than you're giving me credit for, so give me a real challenge already!\" She pouted, not budging until Ryuji gave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe exhaled an exasperated sigh and decided it wasn't worth the effort to fight her on it (plus she had a point, she was a lot more in shape than he thought). \"Fine. But don't go cryin' if you can't handle it, got it?\" With that he went to the weight plates, picking out a couple of small 2.5 weights to only add a few pounds to the bar. Despite Ann's protests, Ryuji knew she couldn't be strong enough to lift more, if even that much. Quickly he attached the plates and locked them into place, then resumed his position behind the bench. \"There, happy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... It still looks too light though...\" Ann said disapprovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it ain't! Now are you gonna lift or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, jeez! I don't see why you have to stand there like a perv, though.\" She said bluntly as she grabbed the barbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not a perv!\" Ryuji relied, clearly flustered. \"I'm a spotter, this is where I'm supposed to stand!\" This was supposed business to him, not a time to indulge his more deviant thoughts and it threw him off that Ann had brought that sort of thing up. She didn't respond to his insistence though, instead following Ryuji's instructions and slowly lifted the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing frustratingly slow for her, the blonde girl pumped the barbell up and down in regular intervals like an oil well, feeling more of a strain than she expected but certainly not as taxing as Ryuji said. With each lift she could feel the tightness in her arms increasing, appreciating the steadily mounting pressure. It was soothing, like a massage that was making her more tense instead of relaxing her but still giving her a sense of satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Ryuji's persepctive, things were a lot more stress inducing. Normally he wouldn't avoid ogling Ann's body if he got the chance, but right now they were both supposed to be in workout mode. It was something he liked to take seriously, and wanted Ann to as well, so he affixed his gaze straight ahead while still keeping his hands ready to catch the bar just in case. Still, the fact that she was lying on her back right in front of him, in skintight clothes, distracted... it was too much temptation all at once. So, cautiously, he glanced down, hoping to get just a peek to satisfy his carnal curiousity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, Ann was cutely grimacing in determination, and luckily she didn't notice Ryuji looking down at her with how intensly she was lifting. The barbell was moving with no issue but there were still a few beads of sweat on her forehead from the several reps she'd been doing so far. The more important issue at hand though was her chest, which Ryuji did his best not to outright ogle. He'd seen her more exposed than this before of course- her Phantom Thief outfit had had a cleavage window after all- but somehow she looked, well, bigger. Her bright red tank top was strained across the front at the peak of her bosom, her breasts appearing wider and more broad overall.  They weren't obscenely larger than they had been, but Ryuji would have put money down that her boobs were bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was, in fact, a half truth. Ann's mammaries had in fact blown up a bit, enough to squish themselves tighter into her sports bra, but beneath them her pectorals were enlarging as well, stretching and growing thicker and more powerful underneath her bust. The increase in the strength and size of her chest muscles had the side effect of making her breasts stick out even further than if they had grown on their own, giving her an overall meager but solid boost to her sex appeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuji was oblivious to all of the details though, choosing to ignore what he saw and readjusted his eyes to look forward again. He rationalized it as her having some sort of growth spurt he hadn't noticed, or an illusion since she was lying down, or something like that. Besides, bringing it up would at best make things awkward and at worst make her angry, so for once he took the path of least resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to lift for a few more reps before deciding she was done, clacking the barbell back onto the rack. \"There! Like I said, no sweat!\" She said as she sat up before wiping her forehead with hand. \"Oh... Okay, a little sweat. Still, I think that went pretty well, right?\" She asked as she stood up, allowing Ryuji to see her back, broader than he remembered, and with some semblance of actual muscle definition, leading down to her rear... her surprisingly toned rear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ryuji?\" He blinked realizing he'd been staring as she turned around. Quickly he acted like he hadn't been gawking and she seemed none the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, really well!\" He said, dittoing her but also meaning it. \"Uh, you're actually, uh...\" He figured by now that he wasn't imagining things, Ann was absolutely looking different, plus she already said she hadn't been working out recently, so he was at a loss. Something had to be up. What if something was going on with her he didn't know about? \"You're looking kinda... really fit, y'know?\" He said, trying to be a careful with his words as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Ann gave him a surprised look. \"Whoa... Is this your weird way of hitting on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! No!\" Ryuji yelled, frustrated that she was taking his concern as a come on. \"Just- forget it! We're done for today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn shook her head and shrugged. \"Whatever. Thanks for your help, Ryuji!\" She said flippantly as she turned to the locker rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem...\" He replied faintly, looking at her again as she turned and walked away. Her body was definitely more taut than usual, and frankly, hotter. If she weren't such a close friend, Ryuji probably would want to hit on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, I'm goin' nuts...\" Ryuji scratched the back of his head with vigor to clear his head of weird thoughts before moving to clean up from their workout.</span></div></div>",

She trusted Ryuji, he was both and old friend and a fellow Phantom Thief after all, and he had been training for far longer than she had. Still, she couldnt help but feel somewhat annoyed at his overly careful attitude, she might have worked up a bit of sweat but nothing more. In fact she felt more energized than ever before, of course it had been somewhat unfamiliar in the beginning but all the exercises had gotten progressively easier. Though she supposed that it merely could have been the rush of success, similiar to the time where she had awoken to her power in Kamoshidas castle, it had only been after the first fight that she had felt the exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged as she went to put on her bra, only to pause as she did so. It felt tighter again and she could barely contain another sigh. Had they grown yet again? With a quiet grumble she adjusted the garment, noting how her breasts now seemed to slightly overflow the cups of her bra and shook her head. It seemed like she would need to go shopping again soon. She shut the door to the locker with an unintentionaly high amount of force, surprsing herself with the crashing sound it made. Paying it no further thought Ann Takamaki walked out of the changing room. Completely unaware of her new, more toned and defined figure, or the fact that which every little movement she mad it became more toned and more defined, more powerful. Not necessarily turning into huge muscles but rather continuing to improve, to strengthen and harden those already present. With each step taken, Ann Takamki became more perfect.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Futaba Sukura...has never been great at keeping a \"sleep schedule\". In fact, it was only a few months ago that she had heard the term for the first time! Just like her father, Sojiro Sakura, had explained to her friends many months ago, Futaba tended to to stay up all day and night for 3 to 4 days at a time, taking power naps throughout that stretch of time. For the last 3 or so years, it was a system that has worked for her, even if it was unhealthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut some big changes were occurring in Futaba's life, the kind that aren't suited for the \"3 days with no sleep\" kind of schedule. These changes started about 3 months ago, when Futaba had finally begun her 1st year at Shujin Academy. She was nervous, but also excited. Excited she had friends to support her during her 1st year here...sure, they were just Ryuji, Ann and Yusuke, that Mishima guy was here too, if you counted him. But having lame friends to help her was better than having no friends at all! And boy, was she going to need the help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba seemed genuinely overwhelmed in this new school...not with any of the school work, she handled that just find. Except for English...she hated English. No, it was the hundreds of different new faces that she had to grow accustomed to. She had to memorize dozens of new faces and names per day in her first week alone, it was horrible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, somehow worse than the forced social interactions was what she began to face about 2 months into her school year...EXAMS.<br>\r\nFutaba had remembered taking exams and doing just fine with them...but this was back when she was in middle school. High School exams were a completely other world compared to Middle School Exams. These were exams Futaba had to actively study for! And study she did...or, study she would, if it weren't for her sleep schedule...or lack thereof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there in laid the problem Futaba was facing...if she wanted to do well on her exams, in an effort to do succeed in school and impress her new classmates, potentially making new friends...she had to completely adjust her day-to-day actions during the Evening.  Futaba was spending most of it studying, getting no time to hop on her computer to play her wide assortment of games! Sojiro was even enforcing a bed time! \"<span class=\"cborange\">I'm 16, damn it!</span>\", Futaba angrily thought one night, head on her pillow, \"<span class=\"cborange\">I'm too old to have a bed time!..Stupid Sojiro..</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, despite her protests, Futaba was adapting well to the sleep schedule thrust upon her..she just wished she'd have time to play her games. It was around a week later that Futaba had overheard something on the way to school. She heard two 2nd Years boys talking about a new Soda Shop in Akihabara...Futaba's mouth started watering upon hearing this...but it got better. The Shop specialized in selling Futaba's favorite brand of Soda, Dr. Salt! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba, against all her logic and better judgement, lunged into the conversation of the two boys, literally wedging her head between the two. Like a rabid animal, she breathed down the neck of one of them, getting uncomfortably close to the boy and snarled \"<span class=\"cborange\">What...time...does...that...Soda Shop...OPEN!?</span>\"<br>\r\nThe boy, supremely creeped out by the proximity of the younger girl, said \"Um...I-I think it opens around 11 AM? It closes pretty late too, so just go to it after school...ok, so could you please get off me now!?\" Futaba obliged his request, exiting the train car. She was lucky that those boys don't go to Shujin...didn't need anyone thinking she's even more of a weirdo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what Futaba did need was SODA! That day, after school, she didn't go directly home nor did she head to the Underground Walkway to hang out with Ryuji, Ann and stupid Inari...she headed straight from Akibi and made a bee-line to the fabled Soda Shop. Futaba gazed upon the modest sized Soda Emporium like a conquistador discovering El Dorado...it was beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba rushed in, and was again amazed by the place...every flavor of Dr. Salt ever released, some flavors were even exclusive to this shop! After circling the Isles for about 20 minutes, she was snapped back to reality by the clerk at the front desk. \"Hey kid, are you going to buy somethin' or what?\"<br>\r\nFutaba, though flustered at this interjection, had indeed decided on what she wanted to buy. After all that time in the isles, she went back to the section with her desired product.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba approached the front desk, barely managing to see over it with her small stature, and placed upon it a case 6 pack case of ice cold...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While one of the other flavors of Soda, Chamomile Lemon, would help her adapt to a sleep schedule better...Futaba didn't drinks Soda to help her sleep, no one did! She drank for two reasons: It was refreshing, no matter the season and for the SUGAR! So that's why Futaba flung a hefty pack of Dr.Salt: EXTREME Mango Sugar Blast onto the counter...As she wrestled the 2000 yen needed to buy the pack from her jacket pocket, she had to stop herself from salivating in front of the clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Sojiro didn't like her having too much Sugar, it was Futaba's allowance, so she'll spend it on her the beverage of her dreams if she wanted to! With the transaction made, Futaba grabbed the soda case from the counter, slightly struggling with the weight of the bottles. As she was readying to rush out the door, she remembered something! She turned back to the clerk and asked, <span class=\"cborange\">Hey, um, sorry to bother you again, but, do you guys have any other ways I can order your Sodas? Like a phone number, website, even a Twitter handle I can follow so I know when new flavors are in stock?\"</span> The lazy clerk, taken aback by the surge of questions by the young girl. He hastily replied, \"Ugh, yeah, I think that stuff is all wrote on a poster on the front door. Should see it on your way out...\" While he wasn't lying, he hoped that was enough to get the small redhead of the store already. And so it was, as he watched her slowly exit, he wondering how a small-ass girl like that is gonna guzzle down all that soda...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just shows that most people had never met someone like Futaba before...despite her former status as a shut-in, never exercising throughout much of any of that period of 2 and half years, she's managed to stay absurdly skinny. Maybe it was her hyperactive nature and her insane sleep schedule effecting her metabolism? Whatever the reason, Futaba didn't care about keeping it that way, as she had already finished the entire 10 pack of Dr. Salt: EXTREME Mango Sugar Blast by the end of the day. Even if she wouldn't be able to sleep tonight, in her mind, this was normal. But in most cases, the Dr, Salt's she drank had much less sugar...now that Futaba had experienced the Sugary goodness of EXTREME Mango Sugar Blast, she had to have more...more...MORE, SO MUCH MORE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba wasted no time ordering 4 more packs of 10 of this Soda...and as it was a Veritable Nectar of the Gods to her, she needed all she could afford. Thankfully, it was now a Sunday, so as her order arrived in the morning, before Sojiro even woke up, Futaba was giddy as can be and she snatched the huge package off the front porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing to her room, Futaba stepped slowly and quietly, both to not wake Sojiro and so she wouldn't drop the box, breaking the blessed bottles within. Making it into her room, she heaved one of the four packs from the box, taking out the other 3 to store in her personal mini-fridge for later use. She downed her 2nd 10 pack in less that 90 minutes, her stomach bubbling with fruity fuzzy goodness. Even as she lay on her bed,  belly full of Soda, it still didn't seem like enough. She needed more Dr. Salt in her...like a camel in a desert, she thirsted for more! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring any calls from her friends to come hang out, Futaba spent the remainder of her Sunday in sugary Soda bliss, downing the other 30 bottles of soda and any other soda can that were lying around the house. In total, Futaba consumed about 21.2 gallons of Soda on this Sunday alone...she writhed in both pleasure and minor nausea as she somehow drifted off to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her 6 AM alarm woke her up, Futaba rose from her bed, tired from her soda binge, struggling to keep her balance. She knew drinking all that soda would put <i>some</i> pounds on her, which she had no objections to. After double-brushing her teeth, she pulled out the scale Sojiro kept under the bathroom sink, stepping on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba's tired eyes shot wide open when she found that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Futaba could hardly believe what she was seeing! From the time when she had just joined the Phantom Thieves up until just yesterday, Futaba had been a petite 90 pounds, which in combination with her short height of 4 feet 11 inches, has made her downright underweight. But as she stared down at the numbers on the scale, it didn't display 90 pounds...it displayed 140 pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped off the scale, Futaba was still in shock. 140 pounds...her baggy sleep shirt did seem a bit tighter...and her short lounge shorts felt even shorter! Futaba swiftly undressed herself so she could examine her body in closer detail, though undressing at this hour wasn't too uncommon, as she would normally take a shower before heading out to school anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSojiro had already been awaken and had left the house to open Leblanc for the day. Futaba's father has taken to opening Lablanc much earlier than usual, since he no longer had Akira at the cafe to help him out...Futaba knew he missed that frizzy haired boy...they all did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with Sojiro gone, Futaba had the house to herself. Normally she would not waste anytime and shower right away...but Futaba decided to take a quick detour to Sojiro's room in order to utilize his full length mirror. This would allow Futaba to get a better look at her body's current...shape. As she walked to Sojiro's room, Futaba had felt a strange bounce in her step. Looking down, she saw...boobs. Actual Boobs! As Futaba approached the full length mirror, she was able to take it all in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting from the top, while her face maintained its cute angular shape,  Futaba's neck was no longer at a toothpick's thickness, now possessing a healthy width. Moving down, she again marveled at the fact that her chest no longer resembled Mosquito Bites...Now hanging off her chest were 2 plush breasts! Holding one in each hand, she found that both had the thickness of a Softball with the width of a CD-ROM Disc...from what little knowledge Futaba had on Bra sizes, that must mean she's now at least a Double C cup, making her boobs somewhat larger than Makoto's! Nowhere near rivaling Ann's titanic knockers, but it was a start!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving further down, Futaba notes a slight curvature on her stomach and back, with no trace of her ribs being visible...a very small hang comes off her stomach, but she reasoned that some soda might still be left in there. As she reached the last part of her body exploration, she found any of the pounds she hadn't gained on her chest had settled on her thighs and butt. Futaba's plump thighs were at risk of touching each other, just from standing normally. This development got Futaba excited, as did the sight of her healthy looking behind, which she remembered had made her sleep shorts dangerously tight while bend over<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow having taken in the full grasp of her gain, Futaba ran off excitedly to the shower to prepare for School. While Futaba had expected some people to notice her filling out, she hadn't anticipated catching so many boys staring at her...even on the way to school, she caught those two 2nd Year boys starting right at her butt as she exited the train car! She even caught Yusuke taking glances at her chest and middle....Futaba had no idea having some additional thickness would capture so many boys attention..but she liked it! And she wanted more of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she had already spent most of her allowance this month on games and Soda, mostly Soda. She had gained a newfound appreciation from the ogling eyes of boys her age and still felt the unquenchable thirst for Dr. Salt....and that's when Futaba had an idea! She remembered reading that over in the US, just like how there were people who reviewed Wine for the flavor, there were also people who reviewed Sodas!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith what little money she had left for this month, Futaba had bought 4 more bottles of Dr. Salt, each with a different flavor. After school, she tweeted out that she's going to stream herself reviewing a Soda! Booting up her Webcam, felt excited about doing this...until she saw that there were already 300 people watching the stream! Futaba's excitement...had turned into panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n300 people?! She had planned to get into her casual cloths for this stream, so she could show of her new thick body, but she decided against it, figuring she'd keep her Uniform on for the 1st Review stream...even if it was a little snug right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba started the stream, she addressed her surprisingly large audience, \"<span class=\"cborange\">Uh...H-hello, everyone! Wow...there's a lot of you guys...Hoo-boy...anyway, the announcement of doing a 'Soda Review' on stream may have been weird, but trust me on this guys, it's gonna be great!

She then turns to address her audience with revived vigor. \"<span class=\"cborange\">Alright, so, before I start drinking, gotta let you guys know, I'm not just gonna be chugging this Soda, nuh-uh....That's what I did yesterday...anyway, this and any possible streams in the future is gonna be half-entertainment...half-informative. It's all about what I taste in the flavor profiles in these...expertly crafted sodas. That's why I'm not using any ice, you gotta drink it warm!</span>\" Futaba could hardly believe she was talking so professionally about observing \"flavor profiles\" and crap, but if this is what some people liked, she'd oblige their interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further delay, Futaba began her \"review\", taking light sips of the soda, she remarked on its sweetness, a rather really obvious trait for this brand. She then made vague comments on the tasting hints of other \"fruit flavors\", stating she detects hints of peach, grape and lemon. These hints of flavors were fabrications, as anyone could tell you by looking at the nutritional facts on the bottle's label...anything that wasn't Mango extract was an artificial flavor. Futaba was just saying anything she could to convince both herself and her audience that this wasn't just her streaming herself drinking soda...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Futaba was halfway down the bottle, finishing off her 2nd glass, she saw she'd already lost 70 of her 300 viewers. This sight brought Futaba's enthusiasm back down to the negative. As such, Futaba decided to go ahead and stop, proceeding to drink the remaining Dr. Salt right from the bottle...about 25 seconds into her uncivilized soda siphoning, she heard several pings from her trademark headphone. Upon finishing the bottle, she saw 5 or 6 little boxes in her \"Notifications\" bar of the stream site. They contained messages saying things like \"finaly, some real chugging :D\" and \"bout time u ditched the cup :/\", things of that nature...it seemed like her audience actually <i>liked it</i> when she chugged the soda like a slob...this was reinforced by the astounding fact that each message had an amount of money attached! 300 yen, 700 yen, 1200 yen, 2000 YEN! Futaba was dumbstruck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe addressed her watchers, \"<span class=\"cborange\">Ok...ok, ok, ok...OKAY! So...if I'm getting this right...you guys are willing to gift me...real money just to watch me chug soda? By the bottle?!</span>\" The response from the chat was fast and positive: <div align=\"center\">heck yea</div> <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">totally</div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">I just got paid!</div> <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">its hot, so yeah</div> <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">r u really a girl??</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba didn't anticipate this...but if she could down 40 bottles of Dr Salt in a day, she could do just 3 bottles in under an hour! And if people are willing to give her money for it...she can keep doing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cborange\">Ooookay...so you guys wanna see drink from the bottle? We-he-he-he-hell....I can totally do that for you...</span>\" Futaba heaved the Pomegranate Parade onto her desk, untucking her school dress shirt in full view. Twisting open the bottle, she gulps down soda with gusto. Stopping to breath a few times, she made short work of the bitter-sweet soda. After letting the fizz in her belly settle, Futaba twisted open the next bottle, not looking at what flavor it was...and not caring. She guzzled it down, hearing the pings of donations as she drank. 10 minutes later, she finished the 3rd bottle, unbuttoning her shirt to make room for her taut, fizz filled belly. Not wasting any more time, she began the last bottle, sucking the contents within like a raging whirlpool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith 8 minutes on the clock and over 20 donations of varying amount, she spoke to her viewers \"<span class=\"cborange\">Ooooof....and that...is that, guys. I'm out of soda to drink! Even if I had more, I don't think I could keep going. My stoooooooomach....mmmh. So, with no more soda, guess I'll end off here. I'm, uh, gonna put a poll on twitter to see if you guys wanna watch me do this again next Monday. See ya then, maybe!</span>\" Futaba then flipped off her webcam and ended the stream...she was exhausted, mentally and physically. Sure, 4 bottles of Soda were no match for her yesterday, but that was when she was alone...in front of an audience, she had to have some shame, so restraint...no one wanted to see her puke, so she paced herself the whole stream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that it was over, Futaba could finally take off her uniform and take a short nap...by the time she woke up, all the fizz in her stomach had gone down, but the liquid was still there. So much of it there was, Futaba couldn't even bother walking to the kitchen to eat dinner. Instead, she logged back on her computer, checking her various email accounts...on one of them, she saw notices from her bank....wow. Futaba had received total of 8439 Yen from the donations earlier...over 8000 YEN! That was almost as much as Sojiro gave her each month! With news like this, Futaba didn't bother checking her other emails. This was more than enough to head right back to bed and get a great night's sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba woke in the morning, wobbling as she was still getting used to her new weight...which seemed to have grown since yesterday. Pulling out the scale, it read 145...A small gain, but it seems the new girth spread itself evenly across her body, which Futaba had no complaints about. What she did have complaints of was her Uniform...the tights were, well, tight, encasing her legs like plump sausages. She was also having trouble buttoning her dress shirt, a problem persisted throughout her school day...Futaba walked to the Subway home, embarrassed by her girth. She reflected on how she could solve this problem, when she realized! The money, the donation money from yesterday, over 8000 Yen she could spend on whenever she wanted! As she arrived in Yongen, Futaba was still thinking about the donation money and what to do with it, ultimately deciding...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"<span class=\"cborange\">Hmmm...on second thought</span>\", Futaba pondered, \"<span class=\"cborange\">It would be better for me to use this cash to get some bigger clothes...even if I <i>do</i> enjoy when boys stare at by thick body, I'm not ready to get too much attention...</span>\" In the crowd of her fellow Shujin Students, all making their way to the Aoyama Itchome Line on their way home. As all the students walked, Futaba broke their collective silence, emitted a nervous chuckle, embarrassed at her previous thoughts. This garnered quite a few glares from the other students, some judgement, some not. Futaba's cheeks became flush with red and in an attempt to spare herself further embarrassment, Futaba walked much faster, breaking away from the pack, plump thighs rubbing together all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the past 2 days, Futaba did not immediately head home from school. She instead made a major detour on her quest for clothes. And if there's any place that she can find clothes, it's Harajuku! Stepping out from the station, Futaba started at the trendy districts streets, decorations on every window, so colorful and vibrant. And the people! Although Futaba had made great progress recovering from her social anxiety, the streets in Harajuku at this time of day seemed more crowded than Shibuya's ever were! As she tried to keep a look out for clothing boutiques of her style, Futaba thought back to when her frizzy haired friend brought her here, as part of helping to complete her \"promise list\"...pushing herself past people on the busy sidewalks, these memories of her time with the boy brought her a much needed calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearing the end of the main clothing district, Futaba had yet to find a boutique that had both her ideal style and price range. Walking further into the district, Futaba came upon a very large building, even larger than most stores she had seen in Shibuya! It was a \"Junes\"...Junes? Futaba remember hearing about this line of stores somewhere before...\"<span class=\"cborange\">Oh yeah! I saw an article about this store about this store on a news blog! Something about buying out smaller businesses in Western Japan...real nasty stuff.</span>\" Despite those rumors, Futaba walks into the Mega Store anyway. As she made her way to Junes' clothing section, her inner monologue continues. \"<span class=\"corange\">Hmmm...looking around here, it doesn't seem too bad. Maybe that article was just rumor mongering...though if it was true, we'd definitely take the Heart of the Junes Exec...I miss the Metaverse.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts continuing at an unabashed pace, Futaba had only just now noticed that she was knee deep in her intended destination, Junes' Clothing Section. Trying to find her way around, she lost her way in the aisles, all filled with clothes ill suited to both her personal taste and age. As she wondered, Futaba conveyed her frustration aloud. \"<span class=\"cborange\">Hunting/Fishing? No...Sports Wear? Hell no...Swim Wear? I'll get back to you later...Childrens? Ah come on, I went in a circle again!? Aggggh, I'll never find the pop culture sectioooooon!!</span>\" Falling dramatically to her knees, Futaba cried in frustration, similar to the ending to Planet of The Apes. As she cried, Futaba felt a tap on her shoulder, after which the source of the tap spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">Hey, aren't you Sakura-san? You know, the one who always hangs around Sakamota and Takamaki?</span>\" The voice was...nice. Not all that deep, but comforting...but how did this guy know who her friends were? Looking up, Futaba saw that the voice came from...\"<span class=\"cborange\">Mi...Mishima?!</span>\" \"<span class=\"cnavy\">Yeah, its me, heh. Didn't know you shopped for clothes here too, Sakura-san. I heard you yelling about the 'pop culture' section, cus I was just over there. I can help you find it if you're looking for shirts!</span>\" Futaba was verbally stunned...How could that smooth, heavenly voice be coming from Mishima!? The guy that both their leader and the rest of her team basically treated as a 'necessary nuisance' cus he was such a freaking loser! How could the person who saved her from almost breaking down in a public store be Mishima of all people!? As she tried to find the right words, Futaba looked back at her unexpected savior, noticing that he looked...very different. It had only been a few months since she and the rest of the former thieves had last spoken with him, but even from her short line of sight, Mishima looked a lot taller. His muscles looked a bit more defined as well, especially on his jaws and cheeks, now looking like a normal 3rd year boy instead of a tall 14 year old. The hair on his head had only grown out slightly, the back of his hair had grown further down to touch his neckline and his bangs now appearing smooth and trim. Futaba could even see some peach fuzz starting to emerge under Mishima's nose and chin...finally, from the floor, Futaba was able to take in his gorgeous deep grey eyes, darkened like the biggest storm cloud...when did he get such cool looking eyes? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally getting off the floor, Futaba still faced the surprisingly cute Mishima, managing to nervously muster up some words...\"<span class=\"cborange\">Oh..y-yeah, I was looking for that s-section...getting shirts and things...taking me there be great. I'll follow your lead, party leader...</span> \"<span class=\"cnavy\">Haha, alright then, guess you'll be my white mage! Follow me!</span>\" Following Mishima's lead, Futaba was still trying to process the fact that this lithe, handsome boy was the same Mishima the she once described as an NPC...Now it was like she was the NPC, following him, the player character! Fitting of that line of thought, she and Mishima arrived in the Pop Culture sub-section of the aisle, the shelves lined with tee-shirts possessing patterns and designs from all sort of videos game, anime and movies. Futaba marveled at the size of the selection. Looking around her, Futaba was thrilled to see that the shirts were available in her new size! \"<span class=\"cborange\">Awwwwhaha-some!</span>\", Futaba exclaimed, jumping up and down, unaware that Mishima was still behind her, trying his absolute hardest not to stare at the younger girls bouncy bits. Mishima coughed unsubtlely to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<span class=\"cborange\">Huh? Oh right, Mishima!</span>\", Futaba spun around to greet him once again, words rapidly ejecting from her mouth. \"<span class=\"cborange\">I just have to thank you for showing me this place, there are so many super cool shirts in my size and truth be told, this is my first time shopping here, I didn't even know Tokyo had a Junes, so I would have never found it without you, thank you, thank you THANK YOUUUUU!</span>\" Mishima, as always, reacted with modesty, \"<span class=\"cnavy\">Ah, geez, it was nothing Sakura-san...I did notice your clothes are looking a bit tight, so I guess I'm not the only one with a growth spurt, huh? Hehehe....no, but seriously, it was no big thing. Always happy to help a friend...although, if you want to meet again some place else, I'd be happy to, if you'd give me your phone and IM ID...</span>\"<br>\r\nFutaba ceases her bouncing, \"<span class=\"corange\">Wait, my phone and IM ID? Mishima, are you...asking me out?</span>\" Futaba smirked. \"<span class=\"cnavy\">W-hat, no, no! I mean, not yet. I mean, I just thought you'd like someone to show you some spots you've never been too...I know you've got an issue with crowds. Your leader told me once, ehehe. So...are you interested?</span>\" Futaba thought hard about this. She still needed to get back home before dark with new clothes, so she gave her answer quickly, feigning disinterest. \"<span class=\"cborange\">I might be...I already have your number, so if I decide that I am, I'll call you.</span>\" \"<span class=\"cnavy\">Already...oh, right...you're big into hacking stuff. I remember your leader tell me that too...well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me. See ya round!</span>\" As Mishima walked away from her, Futaba could not help but stare at his long, lithe legs, leading up to a fine boy butt...\"<span class=\"cborange\">Ughhh!</span>\", Futaba shakes her head, gaining back her concentration...\"<span class=\"cborange\">God, is that how boys feel when they stare at our butts!? Whatever, I need to buy some clothes already, times a-wastin'!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Futaba finally arrived home. As the door was unlocked, Sojiro still had Lablanc open. That was fine for Futaba...the less time he spent around Sojiro, the less chance he'll get worried about her putting on weight. Settling in her room, Futaba flung her shopping bags on the floor, filled with clothes both her size and several sizes larger. She knew she'd gain more Soda weight, so it didn't hurt to plan ahead. Deciding she'd sort through the clothes tomorrow, Futaba plopped onto her bed, breasts jiggles slightly as she landed. As it calmed down, she stared at them, \"<span class=\"cborange\">Ugh...still not used to all the movement up here...</span>\" Browsing her phone, Futaba spotted Mishima's contact info...she thought about his offer earlier. Was he really not a loser anymore? Futaba looked back at the info, thinking:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Futaba continued to stare at her phone, Mishima's LINE ID Icon staring back at her. Thoughts roiled through her mind, a blush surfacing on her still thin cheeks. However, Futaba had to dismiss these thoughts, shaking her head in a cartoonish fashion. \"<span class=\"cborange\">No, no, NO!</span>\", she thought, \"<span class=\"cborange\">I can't afford to start dating now, especially a 3rd year like him! Besides...I need to prepare for my stream on Friday Night. Need to stop off at the Soda Emporium. Bet there are gonna be a lot more donations. Looks like I won't have to get a job for a while, hehehehehe~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba let out a quiet, but still audible giggle as she continued her thoughts, getting up from her bed to change out of her clothes. Taking off her shirt and jeans, she was left only in her Training Bra and Underwear. Staring down, she noted that she should have bought some actual Bras at Junes earlier, a mistake she'll have to deal with later. Further down, she eyed her paunch, currently resting just at her pantie-line. \"<span class=\"cborange\">Wonder how big this is gonna be after tomorrow...super weird, but it feels good to...<i>touch it</i></span>\", a lewd thought appeared in her mind as she pet her baggage. After spending several minutes transfixed on her belly, Futaba turned towards her desk, ready to put away her glasses. Reaching for the drawer she kept them in, a large sight appeared out of her eye. A pile of...papers. White Papers, with a few folders scattered about the pile. \"<span class=\"cborange\">Papers...what the...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took half a minute before Futaba realized what those papers were. In her fervent Soda Lust, she had neglected to do her Homework for the past 3 and half Days....<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cborange\">OOOOOH SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!</span>\", Futaba cried out at the top her lungs. She was lucky that Sojiro was still not home, now frantically searching for a comfortable shirt and pants to wear, letting out panicked yelps and screams all the while. Once again dress, Futaba cleared her chair and turned on her desk lamp, before chugging a fresh bottle of Cielo Mist to wake her up. She then started on her work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours into the night, Futaba worked, solving page after page of complex equations &amp; word problems, along with a Book Report for a novel she'd yet to start. <br>\r\nIt was 4:00 AM by the time Futaba's head hit the cushion of her pillow, all homework now completed and sorted by subject in her school binder. But Futaba would only get a brief respite, as her Alarm Clock rang out just an hour later, at 5 AM. Once again, Futaba's newly formed sleep schedule...has bitten her in her bigger ass<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlogging herself out of bed, Futaba searched for her larger Uniform she had ordered...only to be met with her current snug uniform. \"<span class=\"cborange\">Uuugh!</span>\", she let out a frustrated groan, remembering the the School won't have her new Uniform ready for her until next Monday, since she ordered without prior notice. Grabbing the Uniform, she chucked it to her bed and headed toward her bathroom. Not in the mood to shower, slowly dipped her head into her bathroom sink and turned on the faucet. Reaching for whatever soap was within grabbing distance, she squeezed a few drops into her long soaked hair and gently lathered it in, before messily rinsing off. Her hair flopped onto her face, dripping on the floor and soaking her shirt. Shaking her head, water was now everywhere around her sink, but Futaba cared little. She roughly toweled off her hair, then brushing out the rest of the moisture, leaving it to air-dry. Removing her soaked shirt, she tossed it in the hamper. For a brief moment, staring at her belly, wanting to rub it like she did last night. This time though, she relented, thinking she didn't have the time for pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did, however, have the time for a delicious breakfast. Putting on her Uniform, she decided to forgoing any sort of stocking or legging, leaving her juicy thighs bare. She'd rather she some leg to the boys at school now than run the risk of her legging ripping and embarrassing herself that way. All dressed, hair (sort of) washed and after taking a swig of soda, Futaba was out the door, headed to LaBlanc!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the cafe, Futaba peaked inside, checking for Sojiro...he wasn't at the counter. \"<span class=\"cborange\">Phew! Must be in the back.</span>, she thought, opening the door fully and quickly grabbing a seat on the closest stool. Minutes later, Sojiro returned to the counter, he exclaimed \"<span class=\"cpred\">Ah!  Good Morning, Futaba. I thought I heard someone come in, should've known it was you, sweetie.</span>\" Sojiro smiled warmly, turning back around, grabbing a bowl from a drawer. \"<span class=\"cborange\">C'mon Dad, I told you no pet names, like sweetie or pumpkin...'s embarrassing</span>\" Futaba was only making a point of this to distract Sojiro from noticing her growth. While she was relieved to have taken a seat while Sojiro wasn't up front, successfully hiding her plumped thighs, Futaba couldn't hide her strained upper half or her unwashed face. Both of these would be a giveaway to her seditious soda drinking. Lucky for her, an engaged Sojiro is a blinded Sojiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning with a small bowl of curry, Sojiro placed it in from of his daughter, chuckling and placing his hands on his hips. \"<span class=\"cpred\">Ehehehe, well if you call me 'Dad' now, why can't I call you cute names?</span>\" \"<span class=\"cborange\">Cus names like sweetheart or pumpkin sound like what'd you call one of your dates...makes you sound like a perv if you say it to me...</span>\", Futaba took a bit of her curry, thrilled her ruse was working. \"<span class=\"cpred\">Gah...It doesn't sound that bad, does it? I haven't even been on a date in a while...</span>\" \"<span class=\"cborange\">Yeah, well don't make a habit out of it, 'k?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying that, the two sat in silence as Futaba finished her curry. A minute of so later, Futaba finished up, now ready to enact her escape plan. Her father still flustered from her harsh words, Futaba let out an exaggerated yawn and stretched her arms out wide, so wide that she conveniently knocked over her empty curry bowl! Shattering on the floor, Sojiro was taking out of his stupor. \"<span class=\"cpred\">Gah! What? Oh, damn it! Where's the broom?</span>\", Sojiro heads to the back, giving Futaba her chance to slip away! Her thighs slipping off the stool, Futaba ran to the door! \"<span class=\"cborange\">Ok, gotta go to school, bye Dad, love you!</span>\", she yelled, successfully evading her father's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way to the subway and on time to school, Futaba found that with only 1 hour of sleep and a liquid diet of Soda, it had become rather difficult to concentrate, even for a genius like her. With her lack of sleep and hair washed likely with hand soap, the other students had wondering eyes over every aspect of Futaba today. Overall, it was a horrible day, Futaba's only solace was the brief time she got to play with her belly in the Girl's Restroom during Lunch, as her friends were sadly unable to eat with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter School, Futaba no longer cared able the stares of her fellow Students, as she made a beeline to the land of milk and honey, the Soda Emporium! Entering the Store Front, she bought over 30 bottles of Soda, of many different brands &amp; sizes, using the last of her donation money and dipping into her savings a little. She didn't care though, as the thought of drinking all these Soda got her giddy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat elation would not last long, however...On the way back, Futaba stopped in her tracks...she could have sworn she heard footsteps other than her own. She kept walking, only to hear the footsteps again! \"<span class=\"cborange\">Hello?....If someone's following me, you'd better knock it off! So help me, I'll kick you in the nuts if you have them!</span>\" She got no response...at least not vocally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up her bags, Futaba continued onward. Minutes later, she stopped again, a shadow appearing out of the corner of her eye! Turning towards it...</span></div></div>",

That may change on the many paths this story may take.))<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm! Thank you for wonderful meal!\u201d A joyful, polite girl said to the one delivering the food. This elegant, splendor young lady with chin-length curly, light auburn hair wearing her winter school's uniform modified to her taste; a pink turtleneck cardigan with short puffed sleeves with a long-sleeved white shirt underneath, happily ate a Cosmo burger at the restaurant her father owns. She uncross her legs, revealing a black and red plaid skirt, white tights with a black flower pattern and black Mary Jane shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe server girl smiled. \u201cThank you so much! Would you like anything else, Ms. Okumura?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru neatly padded her face with a napkin and smile at the server girl. \u201cNo, that is all. I should be going. May I have the check?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe server girl chuckled a little seeing Haru\u2019s face and shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s on the house. Company policy that all members of the CEO\u2019s family gets to eat for free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Haru seemed a little dejected but quickly recovers. She hand her tray to the server. \u201cWell, that is quite alright then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru gets up from the table. After saying farewell, Haru left Big Bang Burger. Haru patted her pink turtleneck at her stomach. While she can\u2019t eat it the burgers too oftend, it is a treat she allows herself. She lick her lips, finding mayo and mustard. Haru blush in embarrassment. Did the worker notice it? Haru grab her sleeves and wipe her face to be extra sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru is happy to have today to herself. Father has been... preoccupied with work. Haru understands but it\u2019s lonely. Her \u201cfriends\u201d left her when her father ran into a bit of financial trouble but return when her father clear it up. But Haru didn\u2019t accept them back. Now she is spending her free time alone, taking a more interest in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru walked forward and her shoe landed in a puddle. Some water drop on her nose and she looked up. Rain fell on Central Street. Everyone had an umbrella or running to avoid the drops. Haru frown. She thought she checked the weather beforehand for any Torrential rain. Well, they aren\u2019t perfect. But this limits Haru\u2019s options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru stepped out of the puddle and walked slowly through the street. You get wet faster running then walking. However, her poor curly hair is still going to get wet. Haru frown at the thought and hurried her stride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru kept pace till she reached the entrance of the Underground Walkway. She shook her hair a little and checked herself. Her shoulders are only a little wet but her clothes are mostly dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, now that I got myself some food, where shall I go?\u201d Haru perk up, talking to herself.</span></div></div>",

Even if she couldn\u2019t hang out in Central Street, she could still spend her time here at the mall. And visit her favorite shop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru walked through the crowded mall, careful not to get violently bumped. Wow, a lot of people are here taking cover from the rain. Haru could hear their grumbling over how this will effect their day. Haru gently makes her way through the crowd, reaching the Flower shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d Haru waves sweetly at the Flower Shop Employee. Haru\u2019s clothes got a little from making her way through the crowd of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flower Employee noticed Haru and greeted her back. \u201cMs. Okumura. It\u2019s nice for you to drop by. What can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru shook her head and casually wiped some rain drops off her sweater covering her C cup breasts. \u201cOh, nothing today. I\u2019m just here today to get out of the rain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flower Employee nodded her head. \u201cYes. I\u2019ve seen a lot of agitated people walking in from the rain. Not a lot of them are customers, it\u2019s less then usual. I think the rain is keeping them away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru frown. \u201cThat\u2019s ashame.  At least the flowers outside are getting nutrition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru and the Flower Employee chatted more about Haru\u2019s garden that she has started on the company\u2019s roof top while managing the garden at school. She has been getting a lot of help from other clubs to where she has nothing else to do herself. Her father allow her to make the garden on the roof but doesn\u2019t come to visit for herself, to which Haru gets a little sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd thins out a bit while they have their conversation about what Haru is doing and about gardening. An hour passes before the conversation dies down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flower Employee sighs. \u201cWell, I should be focusing back on work. It was nice talking to you, Ms. Okumura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI as well.\u201d Haru politely said before walking away. Perhaps she spend a little time at Babel Music Store. Haru frown a little, feeling that it would probably be more fun hanging out with friends. Good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flower Employee turns around, figuring on what to do. She has some flowers that need to be delivered but she isn\u2019t suppose to leave the store. She could use more employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought occurs to her. \u201cMs. Okumura, Do you have any plans for today?\u201d She calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru stops confused and returns to the Flower shop. \u201cNo, not especially.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen could you do me a favor,\u201d the Flower Employee pleaded. \u201cI have a couple flowers that need to be delivered by the end of the day. Could you deliver them on the shop\u2019s behalf?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru is a little unsure but she is well acquainted with the Flower Employee. \u201cBut i\u2019m not a shop employee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flower Employee hesitated a bit but she needed to send these off. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You come around often and help with customers in picking their flowers. I\u2019ll pay you for your trouble. You can even choose which ones to deliver.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Haru do?</span></div></div>",

Haru\u2019s hand dove into her pink cardigan pocket. Her fingers wrap around her phone and pulled it out, looking at the caller id. It\u2019s Mr. Okumura, Haru\u2019s father. Wondering what this could be about, Haru answers her phone, brushing away her hair and putting it next to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, father.\u201d After a bit of pause, \u201cWhy are you calling me?\u201d Haru asked. Several people were coming down the stairs, hurrying to catch a train or go to the mall. Haru stepped out of the way, clutching tightly on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaru! What are you doing right now?\u201d Mr. Okumura\u2019s stern voice made it clear he wanted answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m in the city, Father. I was making my way to Shibuya\u2019s Underground Mall after it started raining.\u201d Haru leans back on the wall. People walking down the stairs saw the side view of Haru. Her slender body. Her long legs. Lacking in the breasts department, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you here so we can have a proper chat on some things that are currently concerning me. Head for home sooner rather than later.\u201d Mr. Okumura said, in a metallic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes father.\u201d The phone turned off and Haru looked at her phone. Now lock, the black screen reflected her sad face. She looks n her eyes, wondering what s troubling her father. Her father sounded very serious over the phone. Is she perhaps in trouble?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru put her phone away in her pocket and walked to the stairs to board the train. When she arrived at the platform, the train wasn\u2019t there yet. Haru sighed and waited in line to board. Well, there wasn\u2019t anything she could be doing, Haru thought to herself. If only Haru was able to spend sometime in her family\u2019s garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrain now entering the station.\u201d The announcer said. Haru\u2019s hair danced a bit as the wind picked up. The train got louder and louder till it sped pass Haru. The windows flew passed her, showing her lots of different passengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door open, Haru absence mindlessly passed through. Not noticing, her shoulder briefly rubbed against a exiting passenger. Haru didn\u2019t see what happen but this person dropped something in Haru\u2019s pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors closed and Haru looked back at the station. Haru is taken aback as a girl is frantically trying to get her attention. The strange girl has ash blonde wavy hair styled in bushy pigtails, with parted side bangs on the right side of her face. There are accessorizes with a single yellow hair clip above her left ear, as well as small circular earrings on both ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl seems like she is trying to tell Haru something, with a frantic look on her face. But Haru can\u2019t hear anything and the trains departs, leaving the strange blonde girl behind. Haru wonders who that was, unaware of the object in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru arrives at her family\u2019s floor, on a rather large skyscraper, a hour later since she hung up the phone with her father. The Okumura\u2019s are rich, owning a increasingly larger food service business. This business is about to hit international, with a store setting up in Hawaii. As much success as the Okumura\u2019s are getting, they are getting their fair share of rumors. Like drugs in their food that entice returning customers. There is nothing to prove that, nor that ridiculous rumors at Okumura\u2019s food causes... changes to a person\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru slips off her Mary Jane shoes and enter home. \u201cFather? I am home.\u201d Haru called out, letting her father know that she arrived. Her sock covered feet press against the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn here, Haru.\u201d A voice came from a nearby room. Haru followed the voice till she saw her father sitting down and looking at a bunch of papers. Most likely related to the company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru waited a bit before making her presence known. \u201cHello Father. What is it you want to speak with me about?\u201d She said timidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Okumura looked up. His eyes sternly look at Haru through his glasses. \u201cI heard from a local manger that you were eating at one of our... \u201cbranches\u201d. I told you, Big Bang Burger is not a place an Okumura goes to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru looked to the ground, fidgeting with her toes. \u201cYes Father. H-however, is it wrong to eat there? Our family owns it and the employees work hard...\u201d There is just something in the food that Haru just likes with a guilty pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe food this company serves is for the consuming market. It\u2019s not for those who has taken a higher step on the social ladder.\u201d (<b>Ok, so this guy does have a distorted heart.</b>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru doesn\u2019t press further. She watch her big toe cover her other big toe. Going against her father is hard for her. She still relies on him and she genuinely cares for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that he has won the argument, Mr. Okumura relaxes. \u201cNow that you have learned your lesson, let\u2019s get back to what I called you for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Mr. Okumura want to Haru about?</span></div></div>",

If an outsider were to observe this kind of display, they'd see it as some form of sorcery or new-age therapy...which was not entirely wrong. You see, as her profession as a fortune teller with legitimate clairvoyant abilities, Chihaya would practice a form of deep meditation each morning before she opened her stand for that day. Her morning sessions looked very similar to the current scene, except it was day time...and there were fewer candles...and no incense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this particular meditative session Chihaya was undergoing was in preparation for a special time of year in her profession: the Summer Solstice! A time when astrological bodies behaved in unusual ways, effecting the lives of many. And with her real-world abilities, it was up to Chihaya to help nudge those troubled by the Solstice in the right direction. And that leads us back to the current scene, as in order to make sure her abilities are in tip top condition to help the many clients she expects this Solstice Weekend, she must meditate twice in less than a span of a day. This way, all her energies will still be focused by the time she wakes up tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing in deeply, so very deeply, Chihaya has all her thoughts gathered on her own abilities...digging deeply into her own energies, gathering them, twisting them, letting her energies grow and flourish. Chihaya was so deep into her own mind right now, if her candles were to catch her drapes on fire, she wouldn't smell the smoke! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, even this did not properly describe how deep into the spiritual rabbit-hole Chihaya had gone into...in many moments, she saw an image of a man flickering into her mind...a man dressed in ancient clothes...as the image got clearer, she saw that they were in fact Ainu clothes! Was she contacting someone else...in her mind space? \"<span class=\"cplum\">Mind space, now that's just silly</span>\", thought Chihaya...but seriously, she had to know who this man was! Why was he in <i>her</i> mind space?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n So...as silly as it seemed...she asked him. Through her thoughts. Chihaya then...thought to the image of the Ainu man, demanding answers \"<span class=\"cplum\">H-hello? Hello, sir? Sorry to bother you, but can you explain what you're doing in <i>my</i> meditative dreams? I have a very important weekend to prepare for and I aint askin' fer no spooky Ainu folks crashin' mah meditation! Oh! oh God...</span>\" Seems like, much to her embarrassment, Chihaya slipped into her native dialect while upset in within her own thoughts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as Chihaya was winding her mind back in embarrassment, the strange man spoke. \"<b>Why yes, Maiden. You are correct. I am...a God. And it seems that you and I hail from the same Island as well.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">Wait, sorry..what? God? Same Island, WHAT? First of all, even if you were a god, you'd be a myriad Shinto god at best, and everyone knows those are a myth! Secondly...same Island? You seem like an Ainu to me, and I'm not an Ainu! </span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Ah!</b>\", proclaimed the 'God', <b>But how wrong you are...there are still many of us myriad gods wondering all of Japan, small as we are. My name is Shinda, one of many gods to the Ainu..and yes, while you may not be Ainu, you are from Hokkaido, as are my people. Among the gods, that makes us kin, and for so long have I sought another from my land who can inhabit the realm of the mind just as I can! And here, I find you, drifting in the expanse! Oh, what joy has come to this eon! Though your gift of visiting this realm is still weak, I will offer you my Blessing. Now, accept my gift to you! </b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihaya...was very confused. \"<span class=\"cplum\">W-wait, kin? Realm of the Mind? Gift...what in tarnation!? Hold on, back up a bit!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut 'Shinda didn't answer any of her questions, instead raising his arms in the air, he shouted \"<b>NOW MAIDEN, RECEIVE MY BLESSING AND LET YOUR POWERS GROW! FAREWELL! </b>\" The strange 'God' Shinda then erupted in a burst of light, snapping Chihaya from her meditative state!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihaya breathed heavily, looking around her...while all her candles have been blown out, the incense was still burning. Getting up, she checks her doors and windows...nope, nobody broke in and drugged her. Good to know... Chiyaha started to thinking out loud, \"<span class=\"cplum\">Well. That was something...I think. I probably just tired...better hit the hay, cus I've got a big day!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Chihaya doubt checked to make sure her door is locked, she went off to her bedroom. Entering the bedroom, Chihaya thought she felt...something</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"<span class=\"cplum\">Huh, weird. Just felt kind of...tingly</span>, Chihaya pondered aloud. She figured that it must be the stress talking, given how busy she expects to be for the next 2<sup>1/2</sup> days. Proceeding to ignore her worries, Chihaya readied for bed, stripping herself nude, headband and all. All of Chihaya's worries drift away as her bare body felt the touch of her sheets...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs morning comes, Chihaya wakes from her slumber, ready to face the beginning of her busy weekend. As she commences her morning Meditation, Chihaya is thankful nothing out of the ordinary happens this time...As she walks to her street corner where her Telling Stand in located, Chihaya seeing no one lined up, waiting for her to open as she had though they would...even after she had opened, Chihaya got her typical average of 6 Customers during the day...Though saddened by this, Chihaya understood that it was still a Friday and people were busy during the day, Solstice or no. Still closing early, Chihaya walks back home, hoping the Solstice will be in full swing for Saturday and Sunday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was it ever! By the time 10 AM had rolled around, only an hour after Chihaya opens her stand, she had already given 14 people their fortune! This number had only grown by the time the Sun fell, to a staggering 34 fortunes given. Walking home tired, Chihaya immediately collapsed in her bed, still clothed in her dress. However, any amount of meditation or good sleep had not prepared Chihaya for what Sunday was to bring...by the time it was High Noon in the sky, Chihaya had given 22 people their fortunes, with that number doubling to 40 by days end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of it all. Chihaya...barely made it back to her apartment. Her dress, coated in a fine sweat for 14 hours of Fortunes. To make matters worse, Chihaya begins to think exchanging hands with all those people might have given her a stomach bug, as she couldn't keep her dinner down that night. As she flops onto her bed, sweat and germ ridden clothes removed, Chihaya thinks she might open the stand a little late tomorrow...As she Slumbered, Chihaya didn't hear the laughter of a man, looming over her, as he whispered \"<b>Hmmmmha-ha-ha-ha-haaa....So you changed the lives of 80 People during the period, did you Maiden? As fantastic outcome...I only hope you enjoy my gift as much as I do, ha-ha...</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Sun that tormented her yesterday peaked through her curtains, Chihaya rolled over to check her alarm. As she did, Chihaya noted an odd bloated feeling on her stomach during the roll...rolling back to her former position, Chihaya felt it again! Getting up from her mattress, Chihaya strolled over to her bathroom, ready to relive herself if she needed to. Lifting the toilet lid up, Chihaya turned back round to do her dirty doo...but as she did, she noticed that her bloating from earlier has taken shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a rather large shape it was! Placing her hands on the protrusion, it looked as if Chihaya had swallowed a regulation <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">soccer</span>football! It felt so warm...it reminded Chihaya of...oh god!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Nonononono NO! That can't be it, I haven't been with someone in years!</span>\", Chihaya yelled in a panic...as she paced across her bedroom floor, her worried ranting was only interpreted as Chihaya heard...a laugh. A laugh that seemed like it was coming from nowhere, yet echoing from all directions. Chihaya, in her panicked state, was in no mood for games. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Alright you laughing sombitch, I am not in the mood right now, as either you show your face to me so I can kick your ass or skedaddle the hell outta my apartment!!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her enpassioned rage, the source of the laughter...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Instead of someone appearing before her, Chihaya only hears more laughter all around her. Chihaya again tries to threaten the voice. \"<span class=\"cplum\">I-I'm serious! Show your face already so I can bust it in</span>\" Shortly after, the voice finally responds with word instead of laughter: \"<b>Mhahaha-ha! I do not need to 'appear' anywhere, my dear Maiden...if you wish to converse, all you have to do is close your eyes and focus your mind. A simple task, no?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Is...he telling me to meditate?!</span>\", Chihaya thought, \"<span class=\"cplum\">How do he expect me to meditate at a time like this?! But...if it what I have to do, then I'll do it...</span> Chihaya sat back down on her bed, trying to ignore the discomfort her belly bumps gave her as she crosses her legs. She closes her eyes....and breath in deeply...in...and out, in...and out, in...and out. With only 3 breaths, Chihaya was now deep in the \"realm of the mind\" she had visited last Thursday, in a much shorter time. Floating in the expanse, she seeing a familiar sight...the Older man clad in Ainu robes! The \"God\", Shinda!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihaya scowled, pointing at the God, \"<span class=\"cplum\">Okay, you old Ainu freak! I don't care if you really are a God or not! Now that I can see you, you're going to explain to me what the heck you did to me to make my belly swell up like a ripe melon!</span>\" Shinda laughed, giving a smug retort, \"<b>Hahahaha-ha! Do you like it? Twas meerly the effect of my boon I had given you when last we met!</b>\" \"<span class=\"cplum\">Boon? What the heck are you talking about?!</span>\" \"<b>You really did not notice? For the past several days, when the Sun of the Summer Solstice scorched in the sky....you fortunes. Were they not more accurate? More potent? More...Profitable? Due to the unique astrological conditions that occur during a Summer Solstice, I was able to amplify your latent abilities.</b>\" Chihaya gasped, \"<span class=\"cplum\">You...you made me able to tell better fortunes? Why?</span>\" \"<b>Because I'm <i>generous</i>, my dear Maiden! And, due to the unique PRICE you are now paying for my blessing, I had nothing to lose...</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">A...a PRICE?</span>\", Chihaya asked, looking down at her belly... Shinda grinned, \"<b>Yes, my dear Maiden, a price...you see, we Myriad Gods, few our numbers have dwindled this past centuries, have needed to devise other ways to sustain ourselves, rather than relaying solely on the Faith grant by our worshipers...One of these methods is give a Gift to humans who posses a strong mind &amp; will, especially during significant events such as a Solstice...</b>\" Chihaya interjected, appalled by the God's reasoning, \"<span class=\"cplum\">But...my powers were strong already, strong enough to be real! I didn't need your gift, ya darn weirdo!</span>\" \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ha-ha-ha-ha! Such a naive girl you are...you didn't let me FINISH!!</b>\" Shinda's yell echoed through every inch of the endless expanse, its volume seemly threatening the fabric of Chihaya's mind...Chihaya falls to her knees, still floating, as she slowly rose her neck back up to look at the God. Shinda again grinned at this. \"<b>Goood...one must be silent when ones superiors are speaking. Now, where was I? Ah, yes, the Boons. Before your outburst, I was about to explain that, whether or not these Gifted humans wish to receive our Boon is of no consequence to us...they will accept unto them regardless. And once the conditions in which our Boons serve their purpose are over, the Gifted Humans will have to pay their dues...a PRICE for being blessed by us! And as one of the few remaining Fertility Gods among my numbers, my PRICE is rather unique...ha-ha-haaaaa~</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Chihaya's worries had been validated. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Fertility God?! You mean...I <i>am</i> Pregnant! Wow...</span>\" \"<b>Yes...'wow' indeed. In exchange blessing you with an enhancement to you clairvoyant abilities, you have been given the Gift of life within your womb. Or should I say, Lives!</b>\" Chihaya looked up from her belly...\"<span class=\"cplum\">Lives? How...how many children am I going to have?</span>\" Shinda did not give an immediate response, closing his eyes. This made Chihaya worry. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Hey! I said, how many kids did you put inside me!?</span>\" \"<b>Eighty. You are carrying 80 children within you. One child for every Fortune you gave during the Solstice period.</b> \"<span class=\"cplum\">80...80 children?! That's...that's not possible! You shouldn't be messing with me at a time like this, you know!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I do not 'mess around', Maiden. You will grow within the standard time frame of 9 mortal months. However I must warn you...in the coming months, your stomach will expand exponentially, to a point that by the Summer's end, in a mere 3 months, your movement may become highly restricted...And though you are so gifted with your clairvoyance, I suggest you shut down your Telling Stand for the duration of the Pregnancy, to ensure that there will be no...complications. This is my advice to you, my parting Wisdom. Now...I believe we have conversed for long enough. I shan't keep you any longer...I will now return you to your own reality, though I will continue to monitor your progress as your grow. Farewell, Maiden. Until you're growth is at its end, Farewell.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Shinda's good bye, Chihaya had no time to saying anything back to him before she opened her eyes, back in her Apartment Bedroom...Chihaya stands up from her bed, looking at her surroundings. Based on the light coming in from her windows, it was still morning,  around 20 minutes past 10. She was talking with Shinda for well over 90 minutes! Looking away from her windows, she realized she was still stark naked...walking to her closet, she looked at her selection of dresses. As she chose one, her eyes wondered back to her belly...Chihaya still could hardly believe it that she was pregnant with 80 children...while it seemed unlikely, it had to be true. How else would she have grown this much in only 3 days? Think more on her size, she recalls Shinda's \"parting wisdom\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her business...Chihaya knew she had to make the right choice:</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After staring down at her belly, thinking long &amp; hard for what seemed like an eternity, Chihaya came to a realization. She thought, \"<span class=\"cplum\">Even if that weirdo god has a point about how huge I'll be in a few month, I can't afford to to close down my stand! I'm a small business owner, I don't get Maternity leave!</span>\" A good enough reason as any to continue her days as planned and head out to work. Grabbing a stylish magenta dress with an off-white lining, an embarrassing though crosses Chihaya's mind, brushing a hand on her still small belly. \"<span class=\"cplum\"></span>Even still...I kind of think I want to keep one or two of these little guys once this is all over. The thought of being a mother...isn't too unappealing..\" She chuckled, slipping the dress on and continuing her usual morning routine with little difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading out her apartment door and down the flight of stairs, Chihaya found her dress admittedly a little tight around her belly, but the extra weight was nothing she couldn't handle...right now anyway. She hailed a taxi and made her way to the street of Shinjuku she was set up on, getting stares along the way, even from the cab driver.\"<span class=\"cplum\">Is is really noticeable already? Ooooh...I hope none of my regular customers notice.</span>\" Arriving at her destination, Chihaya propped up the legs of her telling table and set down her chair. Now all she had to do was wait...wait and wait in the intense Summer Heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour had passed and finally some customers were coming. Chihaya adjusted herself, her butt sticking to her chair due to sweat. '<span class=\"cplum\">Really need to invest in a better chair...</span>\" Her attention now on the small line that had formed in front of her, she composed herself and began taking their fortunes. Most of them were new faces, some saying they had heard of the success her place had during the Solstice, others had their neighbors recommend them and one of them just came up out of curiosity. \"<span class=\"cplum\"></span>The curious ones always have the best fortunes, he he!\". By the time all her customers were attended too, it was already evening, around 4 PM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had turned out better than it seemed it was going to, since Chihaya made her way home with almost 70,000 Yen in profits! Fortune was truly smiling upon her. \"<span class=\"cplum\">To think that Ainu freak want me to shut down...Not with these returns!</span>\", Chihaya happily thought as her Taxi arrived at her apartment building. Tipping the driver a little extra, she made her way up the concrete stairs towards her apartment. While going down stairs was no problem, not even a week in and going <i>up</i> them was already proving difficult for the Maiden. Eventually, she made it up the small flight. Catching her breath, the thought of how difficult those stairs would be in a week or a month gave Chihaya a shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her door, she immediately turned her attention towards her stomach. Not her womb, but her actual stomach...Chihaya was STARVING. Never being great at cooking, she normally made herself a salad for Dinner, being enough to sustain her. But tonight, that wouldn't be enough. Chihaya dialed the number for a nearby ramen restaurant. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Yes, hi. Do you think I can get...10 cups of your diakon beef ramen? Yes, I'm sure. No, I just have some company over, that's all!<br>\r\nYes, for delivery, to this address! Alright, I'll see you then!</span>\" Hanging up, the restaurant told her their delivery person would be their in 20 minutes. Returning to her Room, Chihaya slipped off her dress and threw on something more comfortable, a lilac sleep dress that normally reached her ankles, but with her new belly, now stopped at her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter relaxing on her bed for what seemed like ages, Chihaya heard a knocking at her front door. Jumping from her bed, she opened the door with enthusiasm, finding a skinny delivery boy, couldn't be older than 16, hold a huge clear box. \"U-um, hello, eh Miss. Delivery for you, 10 Diakon Beef Ramen Cups\". The boy was stammering over his words, likely because of the heat and weight of the delivery and trying not to stare at Chihaya's...comfortable clothing. \"That'll be 13,450 Yen, p-please\" Trying not to laugh at the poor boy, Chihaya turned back into her home to get the money, \"<span class=\"cplum\">Be right back, Delivery-san, so don't go anywhere!</span>\" After several minutes of scouring her mess of a purse, she returned and received her souped, handing the boy and even 14,000 Yen. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Keep the change now, thank you for the food!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her door, Chihaya took no time opening her box and digging into the first Ramen Cup. So warm and flavorful was it that after only minute, she moved onto next cup, then the next and after 20 minutes, all 10 cups were in Chihaya's stomach, making it surge outward an inch or so more. Her hunger sated, Chihaya made her way to the shower, ready to go to bed early. Hot water rolling over her body, Chihaya caressed her stomach...so full of life and soup, she lost track of time as she continued to rub...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was Shinda's influence or her own realization, a single thought crossed Chihaya's mind as she exited the show...\"<span class=\"cplum\">I'm starting to like this...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

So fair warning, if you still haven't made it past Late November, turn back)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat time of year had rolled around again. The season that everyone in the medical field, from Chiefs of Medicine to small-time local physicians feared. It was Flu Season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, even though her reputation as a Doctor was no longer challenged by her former director, that doesn't mean Dr. Tae Takemi was any less of a hard worker, especially for a doctor of her persuasion. And now that Flu Season was rearing its ugly head, to say that Takemi was swamped with orders for her medicine would be an understatement. To add to her stress, her \"guinea pig\" was currently unavailable, since everyone thinks he's dead...now the punk-rock doc had no one at her clinic to assist her with orders in anyway! Ordinarily, this is what interns would be for...but Takami is a back-alley physician, she could never afford those...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween writing out prescriptions, dealing with the hypochondriacs, dealing with the actual sick people and filling out all the other paperwork she would collect throughout the day....Tae Takemi could barely walk to the subway station in order to make it home, let alone make up the stairs to her apartment. Crashing on the couch at 4 AM was regular occurrence for her. Even if the heavy bags under her eyes somewhat added to her personal Punk aesthetic, Takemi had to admit to herself...she needed a damn break!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was her work schedule, if you can even call a 14 hour day a \"scheduled\" day, bringing her down, but she's so tired all the time that she easily forgets to do what most people do in a regular evening after work...Eating &amp; Entertainment! Worst of all, her perpetual malaise makes it difficult for finding time for fulfilling her...other needs. Don't be mistaken though, Takemi has tried to satisfy her womanly needs in recent memory, but she just never was able to feel right doing it. There was no pleasure in it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Takemi stared at the pitch dark of ceiling her living room, she thought of ways to alleviate her troubles...then it hit her. \"I'll just close the clinic for the weekend\", she thought. She'd use the excuse of taking a few \"personal vacation days\", a reason most people in Japan would view as shamelessly lazy. Yes, it'll be lazy of her and somewhat irresponsible as a doctor, but Takemi reasoned that she can't treat people well when she's under all this stress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she's not going to take the weekend off just to chill in bed all day, no...she has a plan. But first, she needs to make a call, to one of her colleagues. She knows that most of her doctor friends are likely dead asleep at this hour...except for one. Doctor Yaun Lan, a Chinese immigrant living in one of the towns just outside the Tokyo Metro. She knew he'd have something to help her, as some of the medicine he creates makes Takemi's stuff look like Children's Tylenol! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegarding the Call, Takemi decided to...</span></div></div>",

Even if it was currently 3AM, Takemi knew that the old bat would never be asleep at this hour. Not because he would have customers this late, but because Dr. Lan was both too dedicated to making medicine and also a little paranoid...that didn't stop him from being an outstanding doctor, even at his age, so Takemi know he'd have just the right thing to ease her...troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time searching for Dr. Lan's number in her contact book, she finds it, thankful she's kept it after all these years. Takemi also feels lucky that she still has her landline, as she doubts Dr. Lan has a cellphone...Regardless, she splashes some cold water on her face to wake herself up and proceeds to dial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few rings, she's sent to voicemail! Frustrated, Takemi calls again....voicemail again! Maybe he really was asleep...or dead. She really hopes he's not dead. After several rings on the 3rd call, the old loon finally picks up. A hoarse voice can be heard on the other line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Hello? HELLO?</b>\", shouted Dr. Lan, baffled by the insistent calling, \"<b>Who are you and why are you calling me at 3 in the morning?!</b>\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm, Yes, Dr. Lan, this is...um, Doctor Tae Takemi. I was wanted to call you to-\" \"<b>WHO?!</b>\", Takemi being interrupted by the old fossil.<br>\r\n\"Dr Tae Takemi...I collaborated with you 6 years ago on a special blend of medicine, you don't remember?\" \"<b>Ohhhh...Tae-chan!

You're able to synthesize quite well for yourself, no need to buy off me! You know, as doctors, we're obligated to look after ourselves as much as we do our patients, so there's nothing wrong with-</b>\" That's...what I wanted to discuss with you, Dr. Lan...in person. You see, now that it's Flu Season, my clinic has been busier than ever and I...just can't keep up this year. I never have time to unwind, take a breaker. I especially have trouble...tsk\" Takemi clicked her tongue in embarrassment, \"trouble...getting off.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>...Getting off where?</b>\", Dr. Lan asked, \"<b>Getting off the Subway platform? Oh, I know the feeling! I can not tell you how many times I've almost-</b>\"<br>\r\n\"I meant masturbation...Dr. Lan. I am having trouble...pleasing myself.\" \"<b>Oh...well, If I may be reminded...how old are you, Tae-chan?</b>\" \"I'm 34\", Takami shamefully said. \"<b>34...Well, if a women your age is already having nerve degradation in that area, this could proving troubling if left alone..</b>\" Yes...it would...\"<br>\r\n\"<b>However!</b>\", Dr Lan, exclaimed, \"<b>You are not the first women your age who has called me for such troubles, and doubtless will you be the last. I have just the medicine for you!</b>\" \"Really....you do?!\", Takemi shouted, \"How much will it cost?\" \"<b>A mere 10,000 yen. I can pencil you in to meet me around 2PM  tomorrow, at the earliest...now, you remember where my office is, do you not?</b>\" \"Yes, I believe it was somewhere in Machida...quite far from Shibuya, but if I head out early enough, I should be there some time in the afternoon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>\"Good, good...and if you're somewhat late, do not worry.

Thank for your time, Dr. Lan.\" The two doctor's roundabout conversation ended on a high note...Takemi could barely believe it. She needed to get to bed right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwaking at 6 AM, Takemi had to start her day quickly. She put a \"Closed\" sign on her clinic and made her way to the subway line. After exiting the main Shibuya line and making her way through the Station, Takemi had a few options to consider. She could be punctual and make her way toward Machida right away...then again, she hadn't had her breakfast or coffee, as she forgot to stop at Leblanc in her rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakemi decides on a course of action.

Like Dr. Lan said, as a doctor, it's her duty to look after herself just as much as she does her patience, and going on a 5 hour+ journey with no breakfast wasn't going to do her any favors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith breakfast on the brain, Takemi decided to take a bit of a detour to Shinjuku...she'd heard of a wonderful diner that had opened up a few months ago, though she never had the free time till now to go check the place out. She'd heard they even bake their own breads and pastries on site, in the diner! Thinking about it got a very loud rumble out of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Takemi got there around 8:10, she was surprised to see that she didn't have to wait in line to get a table...usually, on any weekend, diners like this one were packed before 10! Still, Takemi was never one to look a gift horse in the mouth and was quickly seated in a booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer selection of buttery, creamy and fruity goods elicited yet another grumble from her tumble...having experienced this, Takemi didn't take long to order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her appetizer, Takemi started off with a Raspberry/Orange parfait, red and orange chunks of fruit, floating in a sea of cream...a wonderfully sweet and creamy tasting treat that delighted her pallet before her main breakfast course arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing said breakfast like Pancakes, and Takemi had ordered the House Special: the Blueberry Explosion Double Stack Pancakes! Each flapjack had to have at least 2 dozen Blueberries cooked into the pancakes and there were Four of these monstrous discs on her plate...Takemi dug right in, not needing even a drop of syrup to go with her hardy meal. After all, she didn't want to risk getting any sticky syrup on her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only 7 minutes, Takemi had eaten every single one of those berry-lescious pancakes. Needless to say, she was stuffed and read for her trip.<br>\r\nAfter paying a surprisingly modest sum, less than what Dr. Lan is charging for her custom medicine, Takemi was back in track and on her way to Machida...thankfully with all those pancakes in her, it was easy to take short naps before she had to go out and transfer. And better she nap now than later, as she is going to have do quite a bit of walking for the first few of these transfers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 4 other Transfers, she was finally on her last train, head right for the modestly sized city of Machida...At around 1:20 PM, Takemi got off the train at one of 2 lines in the fair city and made her way in. She ordered an Uber for the remaining distance on the way to Dr. Lan's clinic.</span></div></div>",

She waits several minutes, hearing Dr. Lan's voice on the other side. \"<b>Just a moment, I'll be right with you!</b>\", he heard him yell, then hearing many loud metallic clangs and bangs, like something you'd hear in an old cartoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakemi was starting to lose her patience somewhat...She had come all this way to get a solution for her problem, she's not about to be kept waiting any longer! She knocked on the door once more, with a much harder impact. \"Old bat was sure to hear that one\", Takemi thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Doctor Yaun Lan finally opened the door, a small, pruned old man, no taller than 5 feet, wide smile on his face looked up to greet his fellow Doctor Tae Takemi, hoping to see a smile on her in return...but her only received a small frown from the much taller and much younger Doctor. This had him taken aback, causing him to remark, \"<b>Tae-chan...so...nice to see you. Please, come in. I, uh...like what you've done with your hair. The eye make-up seems like a little much, however...</b>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakemi, paying no heed to the old man's comment on her style, walked right past him and into the clinic, sitting on a chair in the waiting area. She spotted many magazines spread messily across an end table next to her...almost all of them were horribly outdated, the newest of the selection was from 2002! At this point, Takemi had thought, in hindsight, maybe it would have been better to have ordered Dr. Lan's Medicine by mail...but he likely would have screwed that up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Lan had taken several minutes, but he had returned from the back of the clinic, bag in hand, prescription note on the bag. The packaging on the bag looked very nice, colorful even, which was surprising considering the state of everything else in the this clinic, the Doctor included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Alright then, Tae-chan, I've got your special medicine right here! There are enough pills in this package to last you, eeeeh, about 2 months? Give or take, depending on how often you, ahem, need to relieve stress, so to speak.\"</b>, Dr. Lan remarked sheepishly, as he continued, \"<b>Now I'm going to need you to sign here...and here. And there, you should be right as rain!\"</b>, he said, handing Takemi the bag. \"Thank you, Dr. Lan...now, I suspect you only take cash as payment for your medicine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Oh, Tae-chan, you know me so well!\"</b>, Dr. Lan laughed. \"No\", Takemi said dryly as she exchanged the 10,000 Yen, \"I really don't.\"<br>\r\n\"So, with that all taken care of, can I go now?\", Takemi asked, \"I have my own clinic to get back to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Yes yes, you are free to leave, it was nice seeing you again, Tae-chan...oh! Wait! I almost forgot, be sure to not consume any amount of Vitamin C before taking one of the pills! It could interfere with-\"</b> Dr. Lan's disclaimer fell on deaf ears, as the door to his clinic had just swung shut, hearing the faint clack of Takemi's heels on the concrete outside. And so he was, left alone in his clinic once again...Dr. Lan could hoped that Tae Takemi would be alright. Such a promising young doctor had already been through too much in her career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter many more hours and the same amount of walking and line transfers, Takemi had at long last made it back to her apartment...it was a long trip, both too and from, but it was all going to be worth it. Dr. Lan may have been a cooky old bat, but Takemi knew that he made some gooooood medicine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was giddy with anticipation to give the pills a whirl, so much so that she felt her own common decency was the only thing stopping her from popping open the bottle on the train ride and going to town right there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made herself comfortable, Takemi soon decided that...</span></div></div>",

As she walks about her home, putting away her jacket and keys and slipping off her shoes, she then makes a bee-line to her cozy little bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurn on the faucet to her bathtub, she rolls the knob all the way to the left, to ensure the water is boiling hot. This is just in case the pills fail in providing her stimulation, so if that happend, then at least the water will pick up the slack! As the tub fills, Takemi removes her remaining clothes, tossing them in the hamper. Now naked, Takemi looks herself over in her bathroom mirror...being so busy all the time, she never really gets to take the time to appreciate her body, even visually. Sizable breasts, wide hips and legs that most guys could look at for ages...as Takemi ogles herself, she laments her busy schedule make it hard to find dates. Although, with the pills she's scored from Dr. Lan, Takami isn't that bummed out about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining her excitement at the thought of the pills, Takami seeing that her tub's finished filling up. Grabbing one of pill bottle from her purse, she make her way toward the steaming cauldron. Dipping her toe in, she feels the heat....and it's just right! Dipping her leg further, she places the pill bottle on the counter of the tub before fully submerging the rest of her body. Now fully engulfed by the steaming water, Takemi takes a few moments to simply relax...it had been a while since she had done that...Relaxed...after at least 10 minutes of quiet relaxation, she decided it was time...time to see what Dr. Lan had cooked up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrying her right hand off with a nearby rag, Takemi places one pill in her hand...skimming the handwritten label, Takemi could barely make out the words \"Takes 4 minutes to take full effect\". So she had a few more minutes of waiting time...no matter. Takemi had waited this long to get off properly again...4 minutes was nothing, she thought, popping the pill in the her mouth. In anticipation, Takemi had begun to tense up in the hot water. It felt like an eternity...was this a dud?<br>\r\n Did the old bat really did swindle her? Though just as doubts had begun to enter her mind, Takemi had begun to feel...something! Something wonderful! A warm feeling cascading her nethers, and she was sure it wasn't just the bath water! As the pleasurable feeling intensified, Takemi reaches her hand bath into the water, hoping to rub herself. She's surprised to find that her nether have become so sensitive, even the meager touch of her slender fingers send waves of pleasure all across her tall body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5! 5 orgasms in what seemed like only 20 minutes, THIS...this is all Takemi had hoped for in these pills and so much more! After experiencing two more orgasms, Takemi's nethers seemed to have calmed down for the moment...based on the now tepid feeling of the water, Takemi figured its high time she excite the tub and dry off, though drying her lower half is going to be a treat! Reopening her eyes, she reaches for the tub's plug...as she watches the water move down the drain, Takemi notices something off about the water. She doesn't take baths often, so her drain had to reason to be clogged...and yet the water was still draining quite slowly. Not only was it slow, Takemi also noted its odd color...she was sure she didn't add any bath salts, and yet here was the tub water staring back at her, no longer clear but stained a dark...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stepping away from the mirror for only a minute, Takemi finished drying her body off. As she returned, the shocking sights just kept coming...the skin on her face was turning Blue, starting at her nose and spreading out like a cloud to every corner! Her cheeks, her chin, even her plush lips, now all blue! As it inched up &amp; down to her forehead and neck, Takemi splashes more water on her face, hoping that it would wake her up from what must be a dream...yeah, she'd fallen asleep in the tub...this just <b>had</b> to be a dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five large, cold splashes, Takemi brought her face back to her reflection...but the blue was still there. The dark shade now covered her entire face, no amount of water could wash it away...worse still, the tinted area continued to inch further south, past Takemi's collarbone and towards her delicate breasts. The dark blue shroud widened to dye the skin of her breasts, encompassing both orbs and inching downward still until it momentarily stopped, halting just under her bellybutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing it stop, Takemi exhaled in relief, believing her nightmare to be over...but it was only temporary, as another jolt of pleasure snatched Takemi from her moment of respite. As did everything that had occurred in the past 20 minutes, this confused Takemi...she had only taken 2 of the pills and the effects seemed to have occurred during her bath! Just 2 pills, only 5 milligrams each, was enough to grant her 7 orgasms...was she experiencing an 8th one as a delayed reaction? But no...the previous ones she had felt across her whole body...the pleasure right now seemed to be isolated around her stomach &amp; breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting as she looked down, she saw why...her stomach &amp; breasts seemed to be growing! Her breasts, normally a modest 21 D, had grown to an astounding 45 DD and showed no sign of stopping. Her stomach also displayed noticable bloating, the typically svelte surface had ballooned to possess the curvature of...well, a balloon! In awe of this and still wracked with pleasure, Takemi had failed to notice the cloud of dark blue had now continued its advance further south, moving past her hips and womanly areas and making short work of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the pleasurable feeling had paused,  allowing Takemi a moment to regain her thoughts, the Dark Blue cloud had finished coloring the final areas of Takemi's body...it had been done for over 25 minutes, but it wasn't until now that she regained her sense of time. Standing from her bathroom floor, Takemi had a full view of herself in the mirror...her breasts had grown dramatically since last she looked, burgeoning to a FF Cup, at least. They heaved outward, putting a large weight on her back. But this weight was also contributed by her stomach, its diameter now engorged to the width of a...bike tire. While difficult, Takemi turned around to see that even the sides of her abdomen had surged outward several inches. Further down still, the prognosis was the same. Her backside, her hips, thighs, calfs, even her ankles...almost every inch of Takemi's body was now Bloated and Blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn utter shock, Takemi was still unable to process any of this...why did this happen? <i>How</i> did this happen?! Takemi head was flooded with thoughts and worries, when she felt a rumbling from her stomach...this would only exemplify her worries, but she had to calm down and think...she couldn't afford to be pacing at her current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a calm head and a gurgling belly, Takemi chose her next course of action:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Takemi thought about her options, \"No, it's too late to give Lan a call...even if the old bat were awake, he wouldn't be able to get to Tokyo at this hour\". With this in mind, still blue &amp; bare naked, Takemi resigned to attempt to move to her bed. Potentially due to her panicked state of mind, she was hoping a good nights rest was all she needed to let this odd swelling down...just have to sleep it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her thick thighs, Takemi started to waddle from the bathroom mirror to her cozy Queen sized bed. It would ordinarily be no problem, but with her thighs in their thickening state, it was now quite the trek. Slowly but surely, Takemi inched forward, taking her time, as the last thing she wanted to do was fall down. \"That's it, girl, easy does it\", Takemi thought. \"It's like that old claymation cartoon that gets aired in the Winter...' <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/music1.png\" alt=\"*Music1*\" title=\"Music1\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> You just put one foot...in front of...the other.

As she became lost in her own reassuring thoughts, Takemi had failed to notice her gait becoming more awkward, her motion slower...heavier. Just as she had reached the doorway to the bedroom, the melody in her head came to a halt...as did her movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakemi was now wedged in the doorway. Her middle had ballooned in all directs, even her back had begun to arch outwards. Her legs were be spread further apart, pressing firmly against the white-painted door, azure feet being lifted off of the ground due to the pressure of her widening midsection. Meanwhile, further up, Takemi's arms were starting to become plumper, making it impossible to grasp the door frame. Takemi couldn't even push herself out, she was truly stuck! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooah!\" Takemi moaned in frustration and a small amount of pleasure. She wriggled her arms as they became further engulfed by her encroaching middle. \"Daaaaaamn it! This wasn't how it be! Why...why am I still getting turn on by this?! Are the pills actually still working?\" As if to answer her question, Takemi felt surge of pleasurable growth, her breasts catching up to the rest of her body, filling outwards from her chest to the size of two couch cushions. Worse yet, her breast were now leaking...something! Some kind of fluid, she wasn't sure what, but it was blue...like everything else on or inside her at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...it's getting everywhere!\" Takemi watched in horror as her breasts blue juices leaked and spray all over her the floors, stain the bedroom carpet in the front, and forming a pool below her. The juices were soon dripping off of Takemi's bloated form...which gave her an idea. \"Wait...if I can get myself wet enough from my own juices, I could squeeze myself from the door frame!\" She looked down and observed the state her arms and legs were now in, almost entirely swallowed up by her midsection, \"What I'd be able to do once I'm free, I'm not sure...\" Be she still had to give it a try!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking hard, Takemi's mind soon filled with all manner of naught images, all the standard thoughts she used to get herself hot...soon, more juice began to flow, from top and down below. Soaking the floor and drenching herself like a fountain, Takemi's dirty thoughts also triggered another growth spurt. Covered in her own juices and growing bigger by the second, Takemi finally popped out from the doorway, rolling directly into the side of her bed. \"Yes! I-I did it! I'm out!\", Takemi cheered, waving her stubby hands out from her spherical body. Her victory was short lived, however, as now the was free, Takemi finally got a chance to take in how big she had gotten \"Oh...good god. I'm enormous!\" Yes, she was. Takemi's bulbous form had a diameter of at least 7 feet and her body was lifting itself up by 4 feet, ever since her feet had been engulfed. Takemi was now huge, helpless, horny and naked, in her apartment, alone at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollecting herself, as hard as that was right now, she had to get some help. Had to her phone. Rolling back and forth. Takemi now needed to get herself onto what was left of her feet. Again and again, she rolled left and right, back and forth, sloshing all the juices she's keeping inside her. However, try as she might...</span></div></div>",

She put each piece down recalling her match with another, her 'Queenly' style of thinking kicking in. Only not the way she liked it. She recalled the boy who she taught to play so that she could come up with new moves. Akira. Handsome young man she had to admit. She was rather aggressive with him. \"Can you hear them screaming in pain?\" Taunts as if the pieces were actual soldiers, but this time SHE was the one being destroyed. She kept replaying the game trying to find a way, to slip through her opponent's strategy. But no matter what she did the outcome was the same. She'd lose. She felt as if she was losing more than a match but a part of her. \"Hey...\" She felt a hand on her shoulder. Akria smiled to her. \"Not looking too good there.\" Her face turned to one of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHifumi let out a sigh. \"Yeah...I just don't get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked like you were...um...defeating yourself, a lot. Is that some kind of Shogi punishment?\" Hifumi shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's-\" She looked at him, he was joking. \"Oh...no no it's um...I met someone who was good, REAL good, but nothing I did worked.\" Akira had a flashback to the video game cheater in Mementos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the feeling.\" He muttered. \"So who was this person, some kind of Grandmaster?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I...\" Akira tilted his head. \"I feel like I dreamed it all, I've been so out of it lately and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your soldiers depend on you My Queen.\" Hifumi thought he was mocking her for a moment, but by the gentle smile on his face he clearly was just trying to appeal to her play style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I failed them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\" Akira said looking over the board. \"I'm not on your level but wouldn't this work?\" Akira pointed to a peice then traced his finger along the board. \"Here let me just.\" He played it out. \"Maybe?\" After six moves Hifumi's eyes widened. \"I mean this other person likely sees three moves ahead but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't I see that?\" Hifumi whispered she felt a tingle inside herself. An odd one, she wasn't sure why, Shogi wasn't THAT arousing to her. Not on an intensely pleasureful feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likely due to stress, I tend to make mistakes a lot in P&amp;P if I get too stressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P&amp;P?\" Hifumi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Places and Phantoms, it's a role playing game based on the Phantom Thieves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes...they're an interesting topic actually, I've been meaning to ask you something.\" Akira tilted his head hiding his worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they use tactics like in Shogi?\" Akira thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likely so, I mean how else would they steal someones heart, Now how they do it is anyone's guess.\" Akira sat down and put his hand on Hifumi's shoulder. \"Look you're clearly stressed out, why don't we take a walk or something, at least get a little fresh air.\" Hifumi nodded and got up. Akira was puzzled by what he saw next. Was Hifumi always like this, it seemed like she had gotten, taller. Her uniform looked tighter, not by much but being 'Joker' he noticed even the smallest things. Hifumi was sweating too. \"Once they got outside Hifumi felt hotter. Why though? Did Akira have some kind of effect on her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Akira, random question but how many peices did you capture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...three, I think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A: Akira's Star Arcana persona(s) are mixing with his desires to see Hifumi grow taller and stronger<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B: Due to Hifumi's 'Queenly mindset' she tapped in to an unknown power, she grows for each peice taken in any shogi game from now on.

Due to the fact Shiho doesn\u2019t show any other emotion than being miserable, that\u2019s what Shiho will start out as till someone grows her over time. However, Shiho doesn\u2019t seem like the type of girl who be happy of having enormous breasts.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d A Shujin Academy student sits alone on a bench in a school\u2019s courtyard. She is wearing the Shujin Academy uniform, eyes looking at the floor, looking miserable. Her eyes are a little vacant, and her breathing is a little heavy. She must be not be getting a lot of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho Suzui sits next the soda machine on the first floor of Shujin Academy. She is tired, exhausted from Volleyball practice. She sits there, waiting for her friend Ann to join her. Though, Ann is running late. They were going to go to the Underground Mall after school to shop for some more comfortable casual clothes for Shiho. Shiho has been experiencing some chest pains which she blames on her clothes and has been requesting a new uniform for school and gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho\u2019s phone buzz in the pocket of her skirt. She reach for her phone and notice a text from Ann. \u201cSorry, my modeling shoot moved to today and I couldn\u2019t get them to change it back. We\u2019ll go tomorrow after school, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho sighed and grab her chest. Her bra is too small now even though she picked it out two months ago. Her small bra can\u2019t cover her breasts properly anymore and her nipples keep peeking out, which is a bother when they get hard after coming of shower when Volleyball practice is done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho noticed since the beginning of the semester started, that her breasts seemed to hit another growth spur, probably, growing from her perfectly fine C cups to D cups in a couple months. They aren\u2019t getting in the way of practice but her coach is telling her to change up her form as she is preforming worst over time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting away her phone, Shiho got up from the bench. Since Ann isn\u2019t going to meet up with her, Shiho might as well head out.</span></div></div>",

The Golden sun shine through the windows as the evening drew nearer. Shiho didn\u2019t realize how late it\u2019s getting. Volleyball practice did take a few hours, she suppose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho reach for her locker and open it up for her books. She didn\u2019t have any plans for the rest of the day. She could do school work but had mostly caught up and freed her plans for the rest of the evening, but now she isn\u2019t sure what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Shiho collected her books, she headed for the stairs when another student was coming down from the third floor. Lost in thought because she was contemplating on what to make for herself at home, Shiho bumped into the fellow Shujin Academy student. Surprised, Shiho dropped her bag and all her papers fell out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d Shiho shuttered in embarrassment. She crouch down and began picking up her scattered papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s quite all right. It\u2019s my fault for not looking where I was going.\u201d The female Shujin student got on the floor with Shiho and helped her pick up her scattered papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all the papers were collected, the students got up off their knees and on their feet. Shiho looked up at who she bumped into. \u201cY-your the student council president.\u201d Shiho now got a little scared. She\u2019s always been weak to those with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto Niijima laugh softly at Shiho\u2019s reaction. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be on edge. That little accident just reminds me that I need to be more careful when walking down the stairs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto took a better look at her fellow peer. \u201cYou are Shiho Suzui, correct? Friends with Ann Takamaki?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t Volleyball practice is over? Why are you still in school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho couldn\u2019t meet Makoto\u2019s strong gaze. \u201cI was waiting for my friend Ann to arrive so we could go to the underground mall to shop for new clothes. She couldn\u2019t make it so I decided to home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto\u2019s eyes traveled up and down Shiho\u2019s figure when Shiho brought up new clothes. Her eyes stop when they reached Shiho\u2019s chest. Those breasts... Makoto grew conscious of her own breasts. Makoto has a decent size but just looking at Shiho\u2019s, Makoto could tell she was bigger than her. Which is strange, cause Makoto recalls seeing Shiho at the beginning of the year with a smaller bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto shook the thoughts out of her mind. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any plans, why not study here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho is surprised by the invitation. \u201cB-but isn\u2019t the school closing soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, normally yes, but staying late are some privileges in being the student council president. I just got out of a council meeting and was planning to head home myself and study but i\u2019d be happy to tutor a lower classmen. If you are free, that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho thought about this. Her grades aren\u2019t very high and she could use some help. Ann is only good at English and they both struggle on the other subjects. An  opportunity to study with the smart student council president isn\u2019t something easily pass up on. \u201cO-ok. I do have free time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto kindly smiles. \u201cI do my best to further your education. Let\u2019s study in the library. Lucky, I already have my own books on me so we don\u2019t have head to the first floor first.\u201d She turn back to the stairs and walk back up the stairs. Shiho hesitates for a moment, hoping to not make a fool of herself, and follows.</span></div></div>",

Shiho couldn\u2019t see the inside of the library, only see the back of Makoto\u2019s short brown hair and that French-braid styled headband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto rub her hand on the wall till she found the light switch. \u201cAh, here it is.\u201d *click* The room lit up and Shiho could see inside better. \u201cWell then, we better get started.\u201d Makoto said, picking out the closer table and neatly bring her bag on the table. Shiho followed and sat down on the opposite side. Shiho also set her bag on the table and took out her books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she let Shiho settle down, Makoto asked, \u201cNow then, let\u2019s get down to business. What is your weakest subject?\u201d Her red eyes focused on Shiho. Shiho thought Makoto eyes were very pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, i\u2019m not sure. Math, I guess?\u201d Shiho is still a bit nervous. Student Class President taking the time to help her out? Shiho doesn\u2019t understand why. Perhaps Makoto is just a good person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto perceived Shiho\u2019s lack of understanding herself. \u201cW-well, that is a place to start. I did excelled in math during my second year so I can qualify being your tutor.\u201d Makoto took out her own books and a water bottle she was carrying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto and Shiho spent a couple hours studying. Shiho\u2019s gains two points social stats, Knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Social stats work in this story from here on as story progress. As in, what Shiho can willingly do. The stats are Knowledge, Charm, Guts, Figure and Lewd. Gaining Knowledge helps Shiho take in charge of things, Charm increase Shiho ability to attract others men and women, Guts give Shiho Courage, Figure increase\u2019s Shiho\u2019s sex appeal and Lewd Increase the sex activities of the story. This is still a pornographic interactive. Five points upgrades a stat.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of studying, Shiho finally closed her book. \u201cOh wow. So that is what that means.\u201d Shiho relaxed. Makoto is actually pretty nice. Shiho already knew that Makoto was smart but she didn\u2019t know she make a good tutor too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto smiled. \u201cSee? It\u2019s easy when you look at the the problems that way.\u201d Makoto look at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. The last trains will be leaving soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho also looked at the time. It\u2019s that late? \u201cOh! I got to get home.\u201d Shiho began clean up her papers. Makoto help Shiho collect her papers. She reach for the math book and hit her water bottle. The water bottle fell and splash on Shiho\u2019s clothes, on her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho jumped in surprise. The water soaked through the fabric. \u201cShiho!\u201d Makoto grab the water and set it up right. Most of the papers got wet and Shiho got drench. The cold water reached the skin of her breasts, causing her to shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto stood up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I-I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho sighed. She\u2019s used to this. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I just need to dry this off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto, already standing up, volunteering herself. \u201cThe girl\u2019s bathroom is close by. Let me go grab some towels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-alright.\u201d Shiho said. Makoto turn to leave the library and close the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho tried to clean a little before Makoto returns, noting again how nice Makoto is. If only more girls at this school was like that, Shiho thought, feeling her black leg brace on her right leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho feels a sharp pain on her breasts. Shiho shot up and grab her breasts. It hurts! She feels like her breasts are suffocating. Cries in pain. W-what is going on? It hurts, Shiho thought. She collapse. It feels like her clothes are strangling her. Which is strange because they were fine just a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho clenches her teeth as her beige sweater finally gives out and rips! Thud! The table shook. Shiho falls back on the chair as relief washes over her. After Shiho takes a moment to recover, she investigate what happen. First, she noticed the water bottle fell on the floor. Then Shiho looks up. To her own horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts! They are huge. No, impossibly big. Shiho has seen this size before, on the internet. Size MMM! \u201cNoo...\u201d Shiho whisper in shock. Shiho grab her breasts with both hands. The size MMM could only be from plastic surgery but as Shiho\u2019s hands touch and press into her naked breasts, she can feel these are definitely feel real. Her nipples betray her horror as they stood up. Shiho feels like she is going to go in a panic attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoot steps are getting closer from the hall. Makoto is coming back. What is Shiho going to do?</span></div></div>",

Shiho wonders if Makoto is allowed to modify her school uniform because of her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto clicks a few times before shutting off the monitor.

Makoto was excellent as a tutor and had Shiho have a better understanding on chemicals, as Shiho has trouble understanding the connection between numbers and letters. Neither of them could notice the sun setting down passed the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Looks like we are done with this chapter. Do you have a better understand of the human brain?\u201d Makoto asked.

I still feel like I\u2019m missing something, but I do have a better understanding now.\u201d Shiho\u2019s body groan. She\u2019s been sitting down unmoving for a very long time.

Oh! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Makoto recovered, slightly embarrassed, looking back at Shiho in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho is a little concern. \u201cMaybe we should stop. We just had a long school day, and you had a council meeting right before studying with me for a hour, you must be tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I was just... thinking about something. Also, I\u2019m not Class President but Student body President. But please call me Makoto.\u201d Makoto lean over off her seat to reach across the table. Her butt hover over the chair by an inch, before grabbing the text book and bringing it closer to her but still in view of Shiho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto felt a bit flustered and move the conversation on.  \u201cS-so, let\u2019s move onto the next page while the trains are still running. We can still study for 2, maybe 3 more hours before it\u2019s too late.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho nodded and Makoto began turning the pages to the next chapter. Makoto read it a loud. \u201cThe Inner Workings of the Human Female Body and How to Control it... what is this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho is surprised by the title and Makoto being the one saying, that she blushed her face red and stifle a giggle. Makoto pulled the book close to her and examine it. After reading a few lines, she said \u201cWait... this isn\u2019t part of the  curriculum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d Shiho is surprised. She was sure that the teacher from Ann\u2019s class, Ms. Kawakami, gave it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto is sure of her memory. \u201cUnless the material was changed since I moved to 3rd year, then this text book is wrong.\u201d Makoto examine the book. The first 10 chapters were the same as her\u2019s from last year. But this Chapter 11, and on, are different. With a hint more perverted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho is offset by Makoto\u2019s reaction. It\u2019s different, is that bad? The title is a bit strange but there must be a reason for that. Perhaps the new material was just an update from last year because new research became available to the public. \u201cMakoto, let\u2019s continue. Like you said, we are running low on time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto looked up at the sound of her name. \u201cW-well, yes, I did say that. But Shiho, this might not be material for our school. You might have gotten the wrong text book, if this even is a text book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto could possible be right. The text book could be a joke to fool students and lead them to failure from trusting it by a grumpy teacher. But what if this is the text book Shujin Academy is using? Then Shiho missed out on more study time with Makoto and get more than average scores. What would Ann say if she knew Shiho missed out an opportunity to better herself? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Shiho do?</span></div></div>",

Finding her key and opening the sliding door, Shiho approaches from behind right against Makoto\u2019s short brown hair. There is a French-braid styled headband on top of her head that matches her hair color. A nice smell is coming off of Makoto. It smell really nice, and naughty. Shiho squeezes her thighs together, as a quiet passion builds up inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto brushes the wall, looking for a light switch. Finding it, she flips it on.  Upon the lights turning on, Makoto blinks for a second and  gasps. Shiho looks over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library is a mess. Books are scattered on the floor. Some shelves are standing on a slant. The computer is on the floor, with its screen cracked. Tables and chairs, except for one, were thrown across the floor. Even the lights flickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho did this?\u201d Makoto asked herself, walking over the books on her black-brown ankle boots. \u201cWho could have gotten in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho also followed, picking up a couple books as she went. Makoto stood, by a table, thinking. She had place her thumb on her mouth, on her soft lips, trying to figure out her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho spoke up. \u201cUh, Miss Class President?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Shiho\u2019s voice, Makoto snapped out of her daze. \u201cOh, Shiho, I\u2019m sorry but it looks like I need to put our studying on hold. Perhaps we could do this another day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho nod. \u201cI understand. We can do this some other time. But at least let me help clean up.\u201d Shiho can see this would take Makoto awhile to clean up by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto\u2019s vibrant red eyes grew wider. \u201cAre you sure? I won\u2019t want to impose. You are just a regular student.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho smiles. \u201cI don\u2019t mind helping out my senpai.\u201d She drops her books on the table. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto smiles. \u201cAlright then. Let me go grab some equipment first, like a ladder and some trash bags.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto and Shiho spent the next hour cleaning up the Library. Makoto set up the computer as Shiho picked up books. Makoto and Shiho help each other move the tables back. Makoto accidentally hit Shiho\u2019s breasts when moving the tables. Makoto apologies but oddly for Shiho, she didn\u2019t feel any pain. Only the sensation of something swishing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so goes by and Makoto check the clock. \u201cShiho, what time do you need to get home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho looks up. \u201cAnytime. As long as my grades don\u2019t get worst and I stay committed to Volleyball, i\u2019m allow to stay out as long I want. Well, before the trains stop at 1Am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto is thankful she isn\u2019t causing Shiho any unnecessary trouble. \u201cRight, I guess it\u2019s the same for me as well. Though, perhaps a little different.\u201d Makoto got a little quiet after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho stabilized the shelves, setting them back up. Makoto categorize the books and they both start stacking the books up. Whoever messed up the library was through. But why? And how did they get in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, last one. Shiho!\u201d Makoto called. The shelves are too high to put them back by themselves, so they need each other to support themselves. Shiho grabbed the ladder and brought it against the shelf. The shelf seemed sturdy enough so Shiho braced the ladder against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto grab a couple few remaining books and climb the ladder. Shiho looked up to watch Makoto. Staring back at her is Makoto\u2019s thick, round  ass. Shiho gripped the ladder tightly. She didn\u2019t notice earlier because Shiho was the one climbing the ladder. Now she wish hadn\u2019t been the one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto\u2019s black and red pleated plaid skirt wasn\u2019t covering anything, letting Shiho see Makoto\u2019s round cheeks. She gets a better vision when Makoto bends her legs to climb higher. Her black pantyhose covering her legs and ass didn\u2019t cover that bear panties Makoto is wearing completely. Shiho has a clean view, and those panties look small and tight on Makoto\u2019s butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShiho, can you pass me more books?\u201d Makoto said, not turning around and still is filing away the books she is carrying. Shiho reaches behind her, not breaking eye contact, and reaches her hand up to pass up the books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto reaches back and makes a grab for the books. Shiho didn\u2019t reach high enough and Makoto lost her balance. \u201cWoah!\u201d Was all Makoto could mange to say before tumbling backwards. Shiho watched as Makoto\u2019s ass grew rounder as Makoto bended her knees and closer as Makoto fell on top of Shiho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho breaks Makoto\u2019s fall and both girls fall to the floor. Shiho lands on her back, the wind being taken out of her. She feels dazed and a bit confused. She hears a groan and realize Makoto is above her. Shiho opens her eye and finds her view obscured by white fabric cover by black fabric. Shiho feels pressure being weighed down her face, finding her not be able to move it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmg, Shiho realizes, Makoto is sitting on my face. Shiho is having trouble breathing. But her nipples had again slipped out of her bra and are again noticeably pointing hard out of her beige sweater. Shiho\u2019s body is getting excited, even by Makoto\u2019s new smell coming from her ass as Shiho sniffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto collects herself and realize she is sitting on Shiho. Also that Shiho\u2019s large breasts are looking a little pointy. Two round circles are on Shiho\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will Makoto react?</span></div></div>",

She walked out the front door and down the stones steps, her feet a little sore from Volleyball practice and her growing extra weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shiho reaches the school gate, she stops when she hears whispering. She hears her name \u201cShiho\u201d and she moves behind the pillar of the school gate. She is a bit self-conscious and constantly wonders what people think of her. The whispering continues, not noticing Shiho nearby, listening in. Two boys are standing in front of the school, talking about the hottest girls of the school. They don\u2019t seem concern about being overheard. The boys had a list they made and now they had moved on to Shiho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShiho? Yeah, I saw her. Those tits, man. They\u2019re huge! Earlier, she was standing around a corner and I was walking down the hall and all I could see were her round jugs! How does that girl get tits like that?\u201d A boy from her class said. Shiho, silently hugged her boobs as she listened in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, Shiho\u2019s breasts are very big. But i\u2019m pretty sure they only seem big. I\u2019ve seen a lot of boobs.\u201d Said another boy from a different class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. Boobs on the internet don\u2019t count.\u201d The First boy scoffs. As insecure as Shiho is right now, she wonders where on the internet are they looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does too! But that\u2019s not my point. Shiho is only at D. She only seems bigger than the rest of the girls is because she might be developing faster. She could have reached her peak already. As for her friend Ann who unquestionably has the better body, she will easily surpass Shiho.\u201d Ann bigger than a D? Maybe but do these boys even understand how a girl\u2019s body develops? Shiho wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d The first boy says, \u201cI didn\u2019t think about. It must be her small clothes. You saw her when we went to talk to her about the assignment? Her shirt was straining to keep those jugs in. That\u2019s hot! But now that i\u2019m thinking of it,  she must be doing that to trick all the boys in an attempt to make them follow her. A lonely girl like her is always trying get people to look at her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho is crush to hear that. She isn\u2019t trying to seduce anyone. Her breasts are just growing on their own. As Shiho thought that, her nipples again slid out of her small bra, becoming noticeable again, making prints on her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho adjusted her bra. She can\u2019t hear anymore of this. After she psyched herself up, she walked out from behind the pillar and walked pass the boys to take the trains. The boys silence their whispers as they noticed her and Shiho controlled herself not to run so she can continue pretending that she wasn\u2019t listening in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho stopped a few blocks down. After crying a bit, she looked down  at her breasts. They were right, her shirt is tearing itself apart. Ann wanted to hang out with her tomorrow but there is no way Shiho could go with the clothes she has. As for what those boys said about her... no, she shouldn\u2019t let that bother her. Much. All she needs is Ann.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho boards the metro and decides to head to the Underground Mall herself to buy better clothes.</span></div></div>",

Her chest slightly swings whenever she turns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone is always in a hurry though and someone elbows Shiho\u2019s breasts. Shiho winces but the man continues running ahead without a second glance. Shiho rubs her tit in the sore spot. She looks down her cleavage, the crack which has grown with her breasts. She looked around and hid behind a pillar. Shiho took a closer look on her right boob. Yeah, there is a bit of a bruise forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat rotten luck. Shiho sighed. She adjusted her shirt again. She\u2019ll have to wait till she get home to put ice on her breast. \u201cWhy?\u201d Shiho wonders. Shiho recalls earlier, at school, that one of her teachers that Shiho is fond of, is leaving school because of family issues. This teacher was very supportive of Shiho when Shiho started getting bully over her breasts. But now that teacher is leaving. It just made Shiho feel that much lonelier. This bruise just reminds her that maybe her misfortune has only started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho got from behind the pillar and headed for the Underground Mall. When she entered, she was greeted to the familiar vibrant stores. Shiho misses this place. Ann and her used come here all the time when they first started becoming friends. The music store, Babel Records, has the latest tracks they both enjoyed, TSURUKAME diamond had a lot of pretty jewelry, and Shiho laughed how fascinated Ann was with the Japanese Sundries Shop. Ann had lived so long outside of the country, these things excited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho wonders why Ann and herself haven\u2019t return her since. Perhaps they have been too busy with school or... As Shiho walked, she felt more eyes on her then before. She turned around to find a lot of male heads turning away. Some of them were starring at Shiho. Remembering the two boys by the school gate, Shiho began to feel a bit uncomfortable, bringing her bag up to a semi-casual level to obstruct her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho turns a corner and arrives where she wanted to be. The Clothing store was right there, two shops down between Funny Face, a bag store, and Beauty Feet, the second shoe store with more stylish shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho stops at the Clothing stores and looks around for more clothes of her choosing. Shiho can\u2019t shake the feeling several pairs of eyes on her, especially at her breasts. Ignoring that feeling, she looks over her options, what she wants and what she needs. Definitely gonna pick a better size bra, and just in case, a couple of them, several size up and also...</span></div></div>",

She kept her head down for most of the trip. She stares at her white, running shoes over the crevice of her breasts. She is still thinking about those two boys, wondering if the rest of the school saw her in the same way. Could Ann also...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train stopped before Shiho could finish her thought and got off the train. She scan her card, making a little beeping sound, and walked through the gate. Shiho made a beeline to the Underground Mall. She is focusing on getting her clothes and going home. Possibly see a doctor about her breasts. Shiho doesn\u2019t feel like hanging around too long today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she climb the steps, she notices a pretty blond hair girl walking ahead of her. It was Ann! Shiho smiles happily as she saw her friend. She changed her plans and followed Ann up the stairs and pass the entrance to the Underground Mall. Shiho called out to Ann, hoping to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ann finishes walking up the stairs, into Station Square, she hears someone calling for her. She turns around and finding an out of breath Shiho. \u201cShiho? What are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho took a moment to catch her breath. \u201cHuff huff, I... uh... was going to do some shopping on my own. However, I wasn\u2019t sure what to get.\u201d Shiho stood up. Was she out of shape? No, that can\u2019t be. She is a regular on the Volleyball team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn hugs Shiho, their breasts squishy together, with Shiho over taking Ann. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s a special shoot by my sponsor that I couldn\u2019t say no to. I didn\u2019t mean to cancel our shopping.\u201d Ann said apologetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho hugged Ann back. Shiho loves Ann\u2019s scent from her ash blond, wavy hair in bushy pigtails, with parted side bangs on the right side of her face, and the warmth of her body. Truly, Shiho believes everything is fine in her life if she is with Ann. \u201cIt\u2019s ok. I know how much modeling means to you. We definitely shop together later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey back up form each other, Ann\u2019s warmth leaving Shiho\u2019s side. Ann smiles. \u201cThanks.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho looked over Ann to see if she has changed her clothes. Nope, she is still wearing the standard black blazer over a white varsity-like hoodie worn long to cover most of her short plaid skirt. Shiho looked down at her friend\u2019s long legs, cover in red tights and wearing her brown boots with yellow laces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho just realize something. \u201cBut wait a minute, why are you here? Aren\u2019t you going to your modeling shoot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn groan. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m taking a connecting line to Shinjuku.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho is surprised. \u201cShinjuku? The Red light district?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn looks sour. \u201cYeah. I can only imagine we are going there so the crew can have me in more lewd poses.\u201d Ann looked at Shiho\u2019s concern face. \u201cOh, it\u2019s not going to be that bad. It\u2019s fine. I already mentally prepared myself for this. Models do tend to offer fan service to their audience every once in a while so it\u2019s ok.\u201d Ann said in a light hearted tone, to make Shiho doesn\u2019t feel so concern for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho blush. Ann, in lewd poses? Shiho could feel her heart beating faster. But in Shinjuku? \u201cBut students aren\u2019t allowed to go to Shinjuku in the evening.\u201d The sun is setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn scoffed. \u201cThat\u2019s a rule made and enforced by the Student Body President. We don\u2019t to listen to everything Makoto says.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho contemplates. She can\u2019t let her best friend go alone. \u201cLet me come to the shoot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn is surprised but then quickly smiles. \u201cYou never visited me at my modeling shoots. Now you want to come? Score!\u201d Ann threw her clenched fists on the air in triumph. Then she composed herself. \u201cBut wait, why do you want to come? Are you perhaps worried for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No! I just haven\u2019t been to your modeling shoot before and I thought, as a friend, I should be there to support you.\u201d Shiho said. She is worried. Shinjuku is filled with adult XXX. Ann could be drag into a situation that she could be taken advantage of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Ann expression was unreadable for a moment before smiling joyfully. \u201cThen come on, let\u2019s go!\u201d Ann gently grabs Shiho by the hand and pulls her to the connecting train line to Shinjuku.</span></div></div>",

Probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho hears a faraway whistling approaching. She stood prepared and looks down the tracks to watch it arrive. The train\u2019s light appear out of the darkness.

Shiho brace herself by grabbing the door in front of her as the train starts up and begins moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho stood there, lost in her thoughts. Ann said she would buy clothes with Shiho tomorrow but since Shiho is going to do that anyway, they might as well do something else. Maybe they can go to Harajuku. Shiho has a sudden urge for some candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho reaches for her phone. She open it up and texted \u201cAnn, I\u2019m heading to the Underground Mall myself. Sorry, but I don\u2019t think I can wait till tomorrow. I will tell you why later. How about we go to Harajuku tomorrow? It\u2019d be fun and we can share some of that delicious candy together.\ud83d\ude18\u201d Was that kissy face too much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho hit send and waited a bit for a reply. No reply came and Shiho sighed. Ann can\u2019t respond if she is stuck at a Modeling Shoot. Shiho put her phone back in her pocket. She is sure Ann will text her back as soon as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand brushes Shiho\u2019s ass and Shiho froze up. What was that? Maybe someone behind her was moving around, Shiho rationalized. Her thoughts are interrupt when the hand return and rested on her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nW-w-w-w-w-what?! Shiho\u2019s thoughts raced. She is confused. Someone\u2019s hand is on her butt. And she can feel it\u2019s palm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand moved slowly on Shiho\u2019s ass, never backing off. More like, testing Shiho. Shiho hesitates to react. The right hand gets bolder and squeezes its fingers on Shiho\u2019s right ass cheek. Shiho screams in her head but doesn\u2019t move. Too scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand moved more, rhythmically. It grabs Shiho\u2019s ass several times, rubbing evenly on both cheeks but favors her right side. Another hand lifts Shiho\u2019s black and red, checkered skirt and the right hand is directly against her panties. Shiho just stares at the window, hoping no one would take notice. The right hand continue its rubbing, as the left hand wraps around Shiho\u2019s waist. It slips under Shiho\u2019s beige sweater, directly touching her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho closes her eyes as bits of water leak out. \u2018Oh no, I\u2019m getting molested! P-please stop!\u2019 Shiho thought. She kept her eyes closed as the right hand slips into her panties and touch her ass directly. She can feel the right hand get more bolder, as she flinches when the hand\u2019s pinkie touch her asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man moves closer to Shiho. She can feel his chest on her back. It\u2019s like he is giving her a hug. His left arm slid up her torso and his hand grabs at her bra and tears it off. Well, it was already weakened by the strain of keeping Shiho\u2019s large breasts intact. Shiho\u2019s breasts bounce a bit before sagging a little. Her breasts may have looked large before, but the bra had kept most of it hidden. Not anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man couldn\u2019t hold onto his excitement and his left hand grabbed Shiho\u2019s right tit. His hand only covered half of Shiho\u2019s breast, even as he try stretching his fingers. Her flesh melted between his fingers, with her nipple peeking through his middle and ring finger. Shiho tried to grab for the man\u2019s wrist to pull him off, without attracting any attention, only for the man to push against her, mushing her cheek and breasts against the glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man\u2019s hands became more active. His right hand now took its index and middle finger together and rubbed Shiho\u2019s pussy and his left rub Shiho\u2019s right, firm tit aggressively. Shiho cried softly, begging the man to stop. Maybe out of annoyance, the man pull out his right hand out of Shiho\u2019s panties and put his two fingers in Shiho\u2019s mouth, silencing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho frantically moved her tongue against him and realized a taste of something strange on the man\u2019s fingers. Something sweet and salty. It took a second to realize she\u2019s tasting her own juices! The molesting is turning her body on to her horror. His hand on her breasts are feeling good to Shiho\u2019s surprise. Really good. Some liquids are appearing out of her nipples. Only the man could tell, waiting for the right moment to take them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man squeezes Shiho\u2019s breasts and pulls on her nipples. Shiho moans. \u2018A moan? No,\u2019 Shiho thought, \u2018I am not enjoying this.... noo...\u2019 As the man still rubs her breasts, he began inserting and exiting his fingers in and out of Shiho\u2019s mouth. Shiho\u2019s breath is getting heavy, as her body responds to the man\u2019s foreplay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho, lost in her fear and growing pleasure, almost didn\u2019t notice the man\u2019s cock on her ass cheeks. It\u2019s not hard to tell that it\u2019s free, as it lays all across Shiho\u2019s butt. This is bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho, what will you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After making her way out of the courtyard to her locker and avoiding a classmate coming down the stairs, Shiho was ready to leave. \u201cWell... since Ann is busy at her modeling shoot, I could go to Central Street.\u201d Shiho talked to herself as she took a moment to stop at the front doors. She could see the sun set between an alley but most of it was blocked by other buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho yawns. She\u2019s a bit tired from school and a couple hours of volleyball practice. Still, she doesn\u2019t get a lot of free time after school normally so this is a good time to take advantage of it and spend some time in Central Street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho is a little sad that Ann couldn\u2019t make it but she understands. It\u2019s important to Ann and Shiho is very supported of her friend. Ann often talks about work, the hopes and love she has for the job. Shiho enjoys listening to her about them. Lately, Shiho has notice how Ann has been saying less positive things about modeling. Shiho tried not to worry about that too much. Ann must be under stress from her new competition. Ann will pull through because she is the best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing where to go, Shiho slaps her cheeks to psych herself up and walk down the steps. Shiho heard two boys were talking about some pervy things about her classmates around the corner, like the gym clothes the girls wear or how they catch looks of their panties when standing lower on the stairs. That isn\u2019t nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Shiho called out nervously. It doesn\u2019t sound so loud but it\u2019s sounds fierce for Shiho. \u201cShouldn\u2019t the both of you be heading home right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys jumped and saw her. Realizing they might be in trouble, they took off in the opposite way Shiho was heading to. Shiho smiled, feeling a bit proud of herself. Ann has been trying to teach her to be more confident in herself. It might be working. Or today is just a nice day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho left the alleyways and and scanned her ticket to enter the underground. There were a lot of people, as usual. Long lines, people of all ages, going home or heading to work. Shiho wonders sometimes if people in this city even sleeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while, Shiho manges to enter the Metro. Cramp! Of course, this isn\u2019t unusual either, but lately she\u2019s been find less room. Maybe her breasts have been creating a bigger personal space for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho drown out the chatter of the crowded train, waiting for the train to reach her stop. Next to her are two older women, gossiping a short distance away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman with short black hair said, \u201cDid you hear about the recent incidents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman in long blond hair replied uninterested, \u201cAbout the trains crashing incidents? Yes, they were all over the news a few months ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not those. I\u2019m talking about the sexual incidents.\u201d The short hair woman whispers lower. Shiho, who was trying not listen, now was a bit curious. Sexual incidents? She looked over at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long, blond hair woman was caught by surprised. \u201cSexual incidents? Like rape?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short hair shook her head. \u201cI have a friend who is a doctor at a general hospital. They have been keeping this a secret because of how strange it is but apparently women have been coming in with strange... medical problems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat problems? Like a disease?\u201d The other woman sounded a little concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. They don\u2019t know. All I heard is  women have been coming in with strange modifications. I heard one woman came in with a huge ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The long blond hair woman was confused at the first woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that she has a huge ass. It\u2019s that she had a flat ass the day before. That is not only her,\u201d The short hair woman was getting excited over her gossip, \u201cI even heard a famous model came in all fat. Big potbelly, chubby arms and legs! The dumb thing I heard about that is she still has her model-like beauty with guys saying they still want her.\u201d The woman frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond haired woman became skeptical again. \u201cThis all sounds far fetched. Who can even believe that women are getting their bodies change that quickly on their own? And big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I heard, sweetie.\u201d The short black hair woman lean over and kiss the blond hair woman on the cheek. Shiho blush and turn her head away. Luckily for her, this is her stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train halted and Shiho walk out before being found out that she was listening in. As she walked up the stairs, exiting the metro, she thought about that little gossip. From what it sounds, women are having their bodies changed. Voluntarily? Or is it happening randomly against their wishes like the train incidents?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho stopped herself from thinking about this anymore. What does have to do with her? Nothing. At that moment, her nipples again slipped out of her bra. Shiho frown. No way her breasts are related.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she adjust her bra, she walked across the road  to Central Street. Now that she is here, she can finally do what she came here for. Which is...?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shiho turns a corner and enters Central street. The crowded street was filled with students, some from her school, shop owners, some working men and even some of the criminal element. As crowded as it is, Shiho doesn\u2019t stand out in any way. There is all sorts of different people here. Even her breasts doesn\u2019t cause her problems when walking on this street. Not all locations are like this, she heard. Her concern classmates did warn her about entering Shinjuku at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho steps into the book store, Taihodo. \u201cWhat shelf was it under again?\u201d Shiho wonders to herself as she passes a employee putting books away with her eyes on the books. Shiho scans the shelves, looking for the book she wants. Shiho wants to learn how to impress a boy she likes and have been going to Ann for advice. Ann wasn\u2019t much help. She wasn\u2019t interested in dating, really. But Ann did suggest to go read a book about it. Another classmate also suggest to a book too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching a bit, Shiho found the book. \u201cPlaying the game.\u201d Shiho relax her toes and went tip toe on her white running shoes. Her breasts bounce a little with the sudden ascent. As she pull out the book, she noted how much bothersome her breasts would be in weight if she didn\u2019t already gain muscles from her Volleyball practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho open up the book and read the first few pages. This... seems more like a book for boys. Shiho looked behind the book and read the synopsis. Yep, definitely for boys. The pretty girl on the cover should have given it away. However, the few pages she read were understandable and sort of relevant to her. She might get it to get a different point of view. The bottom of the book says +3 Charm but Shiho doesn\u2019t understand what that means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Social stats work in this story from here on as story progress. As in, what Shiho can willingly do. The stats are Knowledge, Charm, Guts, Figure and Lewd. Gaining Knowledge helps Shiho take in charge of things, Charm increase Shiho ability to attract others men and women, Guts give Shiho Courage, Figure increase\u2019s Shiho\u2019s sex appeal and Lewd Increase the sex activities of the story. This is still a pornographic interactive. Five points upgrades a stat.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho heads to the cashier. \u201cI would like this book, please.\u201d Shiho says politely to the nearby employee busy putting books away, slightly hidden by lower shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long, purple hair female shop worker with black ends stops what she is doing and walks the the cash register. She took a breath, a seemingly  exhausted one, and smiles at Shiho and says \u201cHello! How may I help you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho places the book on the counter. \u201cI like to buy one \u2018Playing the game\u2019 self help book, please.\u201d Shiho feels a bit silly being casual about buying a book to pick up women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Employee smiled. \u201cResearching a way to pick up that special someone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho blushes. \u201cW-we\u2019ll, actually I\u2019m just trying to find way to better get men to notice me. A boy, really.\u201d Shiho mumbles a bit at that last point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Employee looks her over. She, of course, notices Shiho\u2019s large proportions. \u201cA boy? Are you a high schooler?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Employee smiles and shakes her head. \u201cFrom I can see, you aren\u2019t going to have any trouble charming men.\u201d Shiho is confused for a moment then realized she is talking about her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-men are\u2019t like that. S-sure they get get their heads turn when seeing... my breasts. But boys aren\u2019t just going to stay around after that. I\u2019m sure they are interested in other things.\u201d Like a girl more confident in herself, Shiho thought. Shiho feels like she is getting heated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Employee has a sly smile and looks over the rest of Shiho\u2019s body. \u201cYou know, you might be on to something. Wait right here.\u201d The Employee squats down, supporting herself on her feet and away from Shiho\u2019s eye sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of searching, the Employee stood up again. \u201cPut out your hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do it.\u201d The Employee reach out her closed fist. Shiho hesitantly reaches out her hand. The strange, purple head Employee releases her hand and drops a pendent in Shiho\u2019s hand. Shiho retreated her arm and looked at the pendent. It was red and black and looked a little like a top hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Shiho asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s a little something I got from a friendly fortuneteller. It did a lot of favors for me in my relationships. Now i\u2019m just passing it along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho looked at the pendant and slipped it into her skirt pocket. \u201cO-ok, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Employee smiled. \u201cYou won\u2019t be disappointed. Here,\u201d The strange Employee grab the book and put it into a bag. \u201cYou can take this for free. It\u2019s on the house.\u201d She says, handing over the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho grab the bag and wonders what just happen. \u201cUh, thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. Have a great rest of you day!\u201d The Employee said enthusiastically. Shiho turned and left the shop with her book and the pendant. What she didn\u2019t see is the mysterious Employee slapping her enormous, fat butt that was hidden from Shiho\u2019s view. The ass was very large and somewhat firm, but didn\u2019t fit with the Employee\u2019s thin torso. The Employee slyly smile at Shiho, watching her leave the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho exited the shop and arriving back on Central Street. \u201cThat was... strange.\u201d Shiho said. That Bookstore Employee was... well, weird. Shiho hopes she wasn\u2019t a shady person and not up to no good. She still got the book she was looking for so it turned out well. Where to now?</span></div></div>",

Volleyball practice did work me out a lot harder than normal today.\u201d Shiho ignores her pleading stomach and was make her way to the bookstore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind blew and Shiho shivers. She rolls down her beige sweater sleeves in order to keep herself warm. Winter is getting closer. Soon, Shiho is going need to buy a jacket. Perhaps Ann would be able to join her next time and then they can both pick out each other\u2019s jackets. Red naturally works  the best on Ann.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho\u2019s stomach growled louder, and being mean, causing her a bit of hunger pain right as Shiho reached the doors. Shiho bit her lip. Maybe she can stop by here on the way back. She won\u2019t be long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho head further down Central Street. She was about to turn into the Diner but stopped when she notice a big sign in front of the stairs. \u201cWe are sorry to inform you but the kitchen is currently being renovated due to compilations. We are still open and are serving beverages.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Growl.* Shiho groan. She can\u2019t satisfy her stomach with coffee. Shiho continues down the street to find Big Bang Burger. Shiho frown. She doesn\u2019t like this place. She would much rather go somewhere else. But this is the only place she could go that is near the bookstore. Shiho rocked back and forth on her feet before entering in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Big Bang Burger worker looked up from her cash register and noticed Shiho. \u201cHello, welcome to Big Bang Burger. How many I help you?\u201d The Burger worker girl said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho cranked her head up, effectively pushing her chest out more noticeably , looking at her options. They are all... greasy. Shiho never liked this kind of food. How could Ann happily eat one is beyond her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho looked back at the Burger worker. \u201cDo you have anything else?\u201d Shiho said. Probably no but it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The Burger worker asked politely. Now that Shiho got a better look at the Burger girl, she notice the worker  looks... a little too good looking. Very attractive. Big breasts (bigger than Shiho\u2019s), thin waist, wide hips and a nice smile. Shiho imagine a person with those looks wouldn\u2019t take their job at a fast food style restaurant seriously. But she is, waiting patiently and politely for Shiho\u2019s response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she is staring, Shiho collected herself, blushing shyly. \u201cI-I mean, do you have anything non-greasy? Something \u201chealthier\u201d I can eat.\u201d Ann teases her sometimes for being a picky eater, poking Shiho\u2019s stomach when they go out to eat. Shiho can\u2019t help it, she doesn\u2019t trust food to not have a negative effect on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Burger girl demeanor got a little serious. \u201cMay I ask where our \u201chealthier\u201d options are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm,\u201d Shiho is getting a little confused, \u201cFrom a side menu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if Shiho said a code word, the burger girl got polite again, but she seemed a little excited. \u201cPlease sit at the table in the back, Miss. I\u2019ll bring the side menu shortly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho did as the Burger girl said and sat at the table. She looked around the restaurant. Nobody else is here. Weird but not unusual. One time, Ann and Shiho gets the diner to themselves for 15 minutes. It can happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho didn\u2019t have to wait long. The Burger girl came out, carrying a large menu. \u201cHere you go, Miss. Our selection for newcomers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho grabs the menu. The menu even has pictures next to the names. She looks it over. \u014ckina mune, which is a veggie burger. \u014ckina o shiri, which seems to have quality meats. \u014cgazumu, seems to have fish. And lastly, Taij\u016b no z\u014dka seems to have the combination of all 3. Looking over the price, they don\u2019t seem that expensive. Though, Shiho has never heard of any of them before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre these...?\u201d Shiho began to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Burger girl understood what she was asking. \u201cYes, our private options. We are hoping that they are to your liking.\u201d The Burger girl seems misinformed that Shiho knew about the special menu before hand. But Shiho isn\u2019t going to pass up on the opportunity. Maybe she\u2019ll like these new foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like the \u014ckina mune, please.\u201d The other three are not an option. Shiho is trying not to her breasts any bigger than they already are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Burger girl nodded. \u201cAlright miss. Are you eating it for here or to go?\u201d</span></div></div>",

You know what I'm talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2- Additions must be at least one paragraph long. A chapter that only has one sentence will be deleted (There are exceptions to this rule like making an addition for a new character's route and how they should grow.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3- Stay in character as much as possible. There are exceptions, such as the character enjoying the growth even though personality-wise they shouldn't, but you can't have an exceedingly nice character like Haru suddenly acting like a jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4- There isn't any limits to how big the girls can get other than your imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5- No scripts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6- Only the girls are allowed to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7- I'll allow sex but no Justine, Caroline, and the spoiler character having sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n8- Let's keep the story light, okay? Absolutely no killing off characters or extremely dark plots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9- Any further rules will be added if they come up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, thank you to anyone who adds a chapter. Let's go and make the amazing girls of Persona 5 grow as much as possible!</td>",
