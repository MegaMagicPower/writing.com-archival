But, nobody explains to her how caloric intake worked, that you needed to exercise, or even the concept of \"fat\" and \"weight gain\" As such, Aelita, finally able to eat food and joyous at the wonderful flavors, becomes a major glutton. And even when she starts to gain weight, she has no clue what \"fat\" and \"weight\" are, so when she finds her stomach starting to spill, and everything getting softer, she doesn't know what it is or how to stop it. No one has to guts to tell her she's getting fat, (or what fat is) so she has no reason to stop.<br>\r\nStart at the beginning, when she first eats food. Keep it slow and realistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Caloric Coding Chaos XANA installs a virus into Aelita that causes her to slowly gain and become gluttonous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither of these could also be slightly modified for a slob story.<br>\r\nPerhaps in the first plot idea, nobody told Aelita how hygiene or manners worked, so she never cleaned and farted freely.<br>\r\nIn the second one, XANAs virus </span></div></div>",

However, this time X.A.N.A was looking over all its past attempts to destroy the Lyoko Warriors, and had come up with a different plan. It theorized that the Warrior's abilities within Lyoko were linked to their physical states in the real world, and by weakening them there it would become easier for itself to fight them in Lyoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDedicating more of it's processing cycles to explore this line of thought, X.A.N.A soon deduced that turning the Lyoko Warriors into lazy, crude, stinking piles of barely mobile fat would be the most optimal outcome for itself. Transforming them into utterly disgusting slobs essentially. Why if it was lucky they would be too busy stuffing their faces to interfere in its other plans!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet such a course of action would take time, and a measure of stealth and tact that it hadn't utilized before in its previous encounters with its enemies. If it simply singled out any one of the Warriors it would be obvious even to them. If it was prematurely detected, that annoying Jeremie would simply reset time again. While the boost in processing power would be welcome, having yet another avenue of attack blocked off would be incredibly frustrating. The slobbification process needed to seem as natural as it could be, and extend over such a time frame such that they couldn't reverse time to undo all of its effects at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmm.... Perhaps if it influenced the entire student body to become slobs it would be less likely to be detected. Humans did so easily take on the attributes of their peers and environment. Place a well mannered person in a group of slobs and soon that person's manners would disappear in a storm of burps and farts. If everyone was a slob, then they would have a much harder time determining if it was just the result of a recent trend to determine it was caused by itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it seems that the security in the boys dormitory had been recently secretly upgraded by the Lyoko Warriors. Meaning that any attempts there would be rather difficult. Thankfully for X.A.N.A.'s plans, the girls dormitory was as susceptible as ever, partially due to that Sissi human and partially due to some of its previous plans. Half of the students becoming slobs wasn't all of them, but it should still suffice as a cover for its actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes... This could work.</span></div></div>",

That new menu change is great!\u201d Aelita laughed as she happily dug into her dinner. School was over and she and Yumi were grabbing dinner at the dorms before meeting up with the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUggggghhhhh\u2026 All this food is going to go straight to my thighs! Why is the school food so fatty?! I\u2019m seriously going to lodge a complaint later!\u201d Came the rather bratty tone of one Elisabeth \u201cSissi\u201d Delmas as she complained about the food she received for the dinner. Served on a plate was a greasy looking piece of pizza absolutely covered in toppings, paired with a side of fries and large soda she wasn\u2019t wrong about it being a rather unhealthy meal. Unfortunately for the girl, her whining was completely ignored by those around her due to continuous exposure to similar rants throughout their schooling with her. That and the fact that most of the other girls were too busy enjoying their meals to pay attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop eating then Sissi? No one\u2019s forcing it down your throat after all.\u201d Yumi plainly stated as she took a long and slightly obnoxious sip from her own soda cup just to annoy the other girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh well\u2026 That\u2019s because it would be a waste of food!\u201d Sissi blushed as she bit out a quick retort, turning away and focusing on her own meal in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you do that then.\u201d Yumi sarcastically stated as Aelita let out a giggle next to her. \u201cAny way Aelita, about our next trip to Lyoko\u2026\u201d Yumi continued as she resumed her conversation with Aelita, completely unaware that this was but the first step of X.A.N.A\u2019s plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days ago, the malicious super computer sent out a spectre to infect the food management system of the dorms to change the serving menu for the foreseeable future. Nutritionally balanced meals or healthy combinations were deleted in favor of tasty, and more importantly fattening, options instead. Of course, X.A.N.A hadn\u2019t directly overwritten the menu to just serve junk all the time. That would make it way too obvious and would probably close that avenue off once it was discovered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, subtly was the name of the game and X.A.N.A had made the changes such that from a glance the meal plan would still be acceptable. Fruits and vegetables would still unfortunately be included, but X.A.N.A made sure that they would be drenched in sauces and condiments to the point of pointlessness. That or they would be prepared in the most unappetizing way for the students, so that they could be easily discarded by the girls themselves and foster a dislike of healthy choices. After all, it couldn\u2019t be anyone but their own fault if they threw out their veggies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pity that Sissi\u2019s complaints hadn\u2019t be heard. In the weeks to come the weight would slowly be added to all their frames, and by the time it would be noticeable it would be too late to stop X.A.N.A\u2019s plan. But that was for the future, for now it was time to execute the next step.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>{All characters are aged up to at least 18 years old}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A few days had passed since the dorm menu had changed, and things were going about as per normal. Sissy continued to complain, students continued to learn, and the Lyoko Warriors continued to fight against X.A.N.A. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for the warriors in question though, they had just finished another battle with X.A.N.A yesterday and were looking forward to enjoying their well-earned Saturday. Jeremie was busy coding up some new programs for their next inevitable battle with the malicious A.I, while Ulrich and Odd headed off campus to have some fun and run a couple of errands. As for Yumi and Aelita, the two girls were currently trying to finish some of their chores before they enjoyed the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf there was one good thing about living in Lyoko, it was that I didn\u2019t need to do laundry.\u201d Aelita good naturedly grumbled as she and Yumi walked down to the laundry room with baskets of their dirty clothes in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, got to take the bad with the good.\u201d Yumi rolled her eyes with a smile on her face, basket in one hand and the other tossing a stray piece that fell out back into Aelita\u2019s basket. \u201cAlso you got to make sure you don\u2019t drop anything else it\u2019s gone forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, thanks Yumi.\u201d Aelita blushed slightly in embarrassment, thanking Yumi as she steadied her load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cARRRGHH ARE YOU KIDDING ME???\u201d Their casual banter was unfortunately interrupted by the distinctly shrill shriek of Sissi coming from their intended destination. Exchanging a quick look with each other, the two picked up the pace and quickly arrived at their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they found was a rather more chaotic scene than they expected. A couple of dryers had malfunctioning signs on them, the floor was flooded with water, and a few washing machines seem to have exploded in a wave of fluffy bubbles. \u201cMY CLOTHES ARE RUINED NOW! UGH WHY DID MY DAD GET SUCH CRAPPY MACHINES\u201d Standing right in the epicenter was Sissi screaming her head off at anything and everyone, absolutely drenched from head to toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAelita and Yumi felt kind of bad for their pseudo-antagonist, but they also were just the slightest bit amused. \u201cMs Delmas, I understand your frustration but please calm down. Screaming isn\u2019t going to help matters.\u201d \u201cEASY FOR YOU TO SAY!\u201d Behind the mass of bubbles, they saw Ms Yolanda the school nurse trying to gain control of the situation. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you change out of those wet clothes first, I\u2019ll help gather up what remains of your clothes in the meantime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSissi huffed at the bad fortune she had, but relented towards the nurse. \u201cUgh fine. IF ANYONE TALKS ABOUT THIS THEY\u2019RE DEAD!\u201d She departed with a final scream towards the other girls within the room, though her threat was rather severely undercut by the fact she was still half covered in bubbles, a trail of soapy footprints left behind her furious escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head at the girl, Ms Yolanda spotted Aelita and Yumi peaking from the entrance of the area. \u201cAh it\u2019s you two. Well it seems you\u2019ve both chosen a rather poor time to wash your clothes. I\u2019m not too sure about the specifics, but apparently there was a power surge sometime yesterday that fried some of the washing machines\u2019 internal parts. Leaving what you see before you. We\u2019ve been marking the malfunctioning ones, but Ms Delmas got caught in one that escaped our notice.\u201d The nurse calmly explained, waving a hand at the general state of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Aelita and Yumi, the two winced in guilt as they recalled yesterday\u2019s battle with X.A.N.A. Fighting off specters in reality could be rather tricky, and they may or may have caused said power surge in their efforts to defeat their enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the blonde medical practitioner mistook their wince to be one of sympathy instead. \u201cThere\u2019s still one pair of working washers and dryers luckily, but well there\u2019s a rather long queue in front of you.\u201d She stated as she pointed to a line of at least 15 other girls, each looking rather irritated as they waited in relative patience to do their laundry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026 I think we\u2019ll just come back later then.\u201d Yumi stated as she tugged Aelita back towards their room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Thanks for the info Ms Yolanda!\u201d Aelita politely thanked the nurse before the two warriors quickly returned to their room to deposit their dirty clothes, before finding the other warriors to discuss the latest fallout from their unintentional collateral damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to anyone, the accidental power surge was less accidental and more of another step in X.A.N.A\u2019s plan to weaken its foes. It had already tampered with the washing machines before it engaged the warriors yesterday, and all it had to do was have its pawn die in a convincing enough method for the perfect disguise. It didn\u2019t break all of their cleaning machines, but enough that many girls would just keep putting them off more and more until it became a habit. Those that worked would only do so in the most infuriating of ways, never getting completely clean out or drying in a way that would leave terrible wrinkles. Soon, female fashion at Kadic Academy would include a lot more stains and crumpled clothes than they would expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all intents, this phase of X.A.N.A\u2019s plan had gone well. The only question was what to do next\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
