As you get up, you notice there are doors to your left and your right, extending down a hallway that seems endless. You remember hearing a weird voice talking to you about this... you shake your head, trying to maintain your sanity. After brushing yourself off, you try to remember why you are here... but first, who are you?</span></div></div>",

While testing it on some test subjects, the machine goes haywire and hits you, knocking you unconscious. When you wake up, you find yourself in a long, white hall with doors on your left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind each door lies a random place with unknown dangers, let it be insects, animals, or even humans. Try to find the door that returns to the hall in that area... before you get killed trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>~~~*GUIDELINES*~~</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. As mentioned, this is 18+. Feel free to include anything EXCEPT toilet scenes and sex. Otherwise, let your imagination flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Please try to stay on-touch with the story and try not to edit it in any way. If a person is told to be a generally kind person, then don't make them malicious a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. <b>NO ONE-SENTENCE CHAPTERS.</b> The minimum for each chapter is AT LEAST a paragraph (5 sentences). Anything below that will be deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. I know everyone cannot type perfectly, but try to make your entries legible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Don't try to kill off the main character early in the story; keep him/her alive until they go through one door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all!</td>",
