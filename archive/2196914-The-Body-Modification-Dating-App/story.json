(What the hell does that mean? You wonder to yourself)<br>\r\nIn her photos you can see that she is a beautiful brunette with sea/green eyes and in most of them she is with a group of friends, enough to back her claim to being outgoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her is Kassandra:<br>\r\nPersonality - friendly, quiet.<br>\r\nBody mods - private.<br>\r\nShe only has one photo, an unusually framed portrait. She has short black hair with golden highlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie:<br>\r\nPersonality - likes talking to people, energetic, professional vlogger.<br>\r\nBody mods - various piercings, SWB (now we're bringing cars into this?)<br>\r\nYou quickly find she has a number of videos posted of her wearing a GoPro on her hip as she walks around town and talks to random people. Her profile picture looks quite professionally done, she has dyed pink hair and a few noticeable piercings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one is a little more interesting, the username is listed simply as \"come for some fun tiger\" all other details were set to private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you pick first?</span></div></div>",

You hear audible clacking noises when her feet make contact with the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're new to the whole body mods thing huh?\" You simply stand there confused. \"I'll take that as a yes. Come on in I'll get you familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn stunned silence you follow. Once inside you start to notice the other patrons, some are normal like you but by far the majority are modified in some way. You see a woman with purple skin holding her detached head under her arm, a couple at a table the guy having four arms and no legs while his girlfriend had the inverse, several people had their heads simply attached to their lower halves with no torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour date waved down an employee \"Hey Maggie! Table for two.\" You were both seated by a woman with four arms and a fifth arm replacing her head. She waves enthusiastically with her head/arm and hands you both a menu to look over and moves on to a different table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh.\" You finally get the courage to spit out. \"Have you got a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haddie. Kinda like the Greek god.\" Her cheeks rising slightly in a grin. (Which you can barely make out with her wearing that veil.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... So what's the story behind all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you really are a virgin to body modding huh? Well not too long ago people around this area started changing their bodies, either by magic or by science. Anyway a bit of a subculture sprung up around it and some folks set up a restaurant chain and a dating app for people to find love. Also to attract new people like you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. So you just wanted to bring me here to get a rando into this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much.\" At this point you start to realize that something is off with her voice, it sounds as though it was covered by something thick like wood but you don't think much of it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now see \"Maggie\" the waitress return with a pencil in her head hand ready to take your order. Haddie asks for the soup special, and you order a triple grilled cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you should try one of the drinks, they're a lot of fun.\" She says winking.</span></div></div>",

Order me up that scrambler's rum then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see the outline of a smile on your date's face again. \"I had a good feeling about you. That's one of my favourites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie took your orders and left you to continue your evening. You continue to break the ice chatting about your lives, you tell her about your job and she tells you she used to be a software engineer, in fact she did a lot of the programming for the app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now I make a passive living off the app and advertising for various body mod related products.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive. So when did you get into the body modding community if you're this involved?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I've been like this for a while. Well at least mostly. When I became 18 it turned out I was actually descended from a family of half demons and changed into this. Again mostly.\" She motioned to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait demons? Do you have like magic powers or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda. But I never really bothered to learn how to use them my real power is with a keyboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that your food arrives. Maggie hands you a plate with a thick cheesy sandwich and a side of fries, a bowl of Haddie's seafood soup, and a bottle of rum and two shot glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both thank your waitress and you pour a shot. Then you lift the drink to your lips and down it. As the pleasant burning hits the back of your throat the next thing you know is...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You\u2019re finally giving into what you\u2019ve resisted doing for so long: downloading and using a dating app. You\u2019ve never much liked the idea of meeting through a screen, but you\u2019re really missing the feeling of being with someone, and that\u2019s the quickest most efficient method. To your initial dismay but eventual delight, you\u2019ve accidentally stumbled on a very special dating app called \u201cMod Love. \u201c You soon find out that the women you\u2019re swiping through have very...special qualities that drive you crazy with intrigue. So, who\u2019s going to be your first date?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcceptable morphs and tf\u2019s include: Body part swapping, rearrangement, and detachment (Would love to see high volume of foot related morphs). Body parts can be mismatched, ie feet replacing hands, arm replacing head, etc. Detached body parts can either be living while disembodied, or lifeless to be treated more like realistic sex toys. Multiple limbs, so girls with six arms, four legs, eight breasts, etc. Body part removal, so women with no arms who use their feet to interact with everything, or no head but somehow retain their senses. Body part birthing, ie a woman who can push out of any orifice a brand new living detached penis, foot, hand, etc. Abilities or excrete food from any holes, ie a woman able to squeeze out ice cream from her butthole, piss out soda from her vagina, etc. Trans, futa, trap, moderate muscle gain, moderate hairiness, anything to make a female have more male qualities. Body from the neck down swaps, ie a beautiful woman\u2019s head on the body of a muscled up hunk. Mind alterations so that everyone thinks strange bodies, or lewd acts using them are totally normal. Clones, conjoinment, moderate absorption/fusing. Very light shrinking and growing, ie a full grown woman becoming only three feet tall, or growing to be eight feet tall. Moderately growing or shrinking body parts, ie morphing a girl to have a butthole three times it\u2019s normal size or shrinking her boobs until they\u2019re less than an A cup. Extreme horniness, ie a woman being dripping wet and can\u2019t control it, or too hard and leaking tons of precum. Celebrity parts are fine ie, a normal girl who morphed her head into Gal Gadots, or one who morphed her ass to be Jennifer Lopez\u2019s. Elastic qualities, being able to stretch a woman\u2019s neck down so she can eat herself out. Strange skin colors and patterns, ie a woman with purple skin and maybe zebra stripes. Tattoos and piercings as natural or as morphs work too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot allowed: No furries, actual scat or piss, loli, under 18, extreme expansions, extreme shrink, extreme weight gain, extreme muscle gain, extreme hairiness, death, vore, torture, pain, hate, or ending the story!!</td>",
