Indescribably insidious sensations contradict the soft security of your exposed socks with each stride against the unforgiving asphalt.  The early afternoon sun attempts to boil your inner organs, as well as drown your outer organ in its own sweat.  Oxygen stalls its journey to your lungs in an effort to prolong your suffering.  You haven't stopped for a mile and a half.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city is silent, but something is off.  Countless people bombard the streets with chaotic actions.  Cars meld themselves together with imperfect ripples.  Broken glass and rubble line the sidewalks.  There should be sound.  Perhaps your senses are beginning to shut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deafening rumble shatters the silence.  You are unable to keep your momentum, but you stay on your feet.  A mere 80 yards away, a massive bare foot is implanted deeply into the street.  You wonder if it's her, then wish you could slap yourself for asking such a foolish question.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you might as well make sure.  Yup, there's no mistaking it.  That baskingly golden tan.  Those slender, smooth, endless legs complimented brilliantly by those cut off jean shorts she's always wearing.  That firm, tight backside.  That flat stomach serving as a plateau for her well rounded bussoms.  That beautifully wavy shoulder-blade length brown hair.  Those ocean blue eyes and petite nose and mouth.  No doubt about it: It's Lauraine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery other person on this particular block seems to have made the unanimous decision to run in the direction opposite Lauraine.  You have to admit that the sight of a 135 foot tall woman makes you think they may be on to something.  No, you have to keep on.  After all...    </span></div></div>",

She had come to visit you in the city despite you telling her that people would not accept her for who she was but condemn based on her physical appearance. She had not listenened and had grown lonely after you last visit almost a year ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You stop and ponder whether running away from your giantess girlfriend is the best solution to this problem. She loved and destroying a city was not her fault. She had done it out of self-defense. The people had started and she as with all living things, fight when their existence is threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lauraine sat down, her body causing minor tremors as the full weight of it came down.

She wasn;t hurt physically. No weapon available to humans could kill her.

Did what happened years ago count for nothing.\" said Lauraine, tears running down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" No, no, its not like that.

Of course, you have no idea how receptive Lauraine would be to you.  After all, you did kind of stand her up for almost a year.  Lauraine may not be clingy, but even she might have taken offense to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mere five feet away from her smoothly topped ankle, you regather your thoughts and turn all of your attention to Lauraine.  Nestled between her gargantuan index finger and thumb dangles....what is that?  Whatever it is, Lauraine is studying it intently, bringing it inches away from her deep blue eye.  Is it...moving?  You think it might be squirming.  You hear a bone chilling scream from high above.  It couldn't be, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently unable to pass Lauraine's examination, she sends the poor, unfortunate soul across the light crimson skyline at an unfathomable velocity with the slightest flick of her wrist.  Maybe this wasn't the best idea.  Before you can backtrack, however, you are discovered by the titanically terrible love of your life.  A vacuum of wind rips your body in every direction and the sky blackens as Lauraine descends upon you.  You feel yourself elevating off of the safety of the road.  The collar of your shirt weakly strangles you as you are plucked from the ground like a grape from the vine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fear is subsided by your fight to stay conscious during your rapid ascent to...well, you're not really sure what to expect, actually.  Odds are, though, that this encounter will be something less than pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour trip ends abruptly.  You find yourself nose to body with your old flame, though you wouldn't use the terminology to her face (as a matter of fact, your struggling to use any terminology at the moment).  You sway with the wind as you are shifted horizontally, greeted at your new destination by a half opened, glimmering blue eye protected by long, tickling lashes.  A brief moment of observation leads to the swift revelation of the full orb and a swift eye lash uppercut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauraine addresses you,\"...    </span></div></div>",

You swing effortlessly towards Lauraine's smiling face with the smallest of pivots from her mighty wrist.  Was she enjoying this?  No time to worry about that now.  Your momentum is quickly shifted away from your tormentor and towards the vast abyss of the clouds.  The frightfully soothing breeze skids across your body with a calm harshness.  It's rather difficult for you to describe, actually.  It makes you feel as though it may be your time to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're violently jerked back into reality.  Your shirt begins to rip, but holds strong.  Your body once again rests with a weightless stillness in mid-air.  A femininely playful giggle erupts from your rear flank.  An over the shoulder glance exposes the culprit as, you guessed it, Lauraine, her free hand attempting to muffle the product of your humiliation.  Ah yes, you had forgotten that Lauraine was your classic sort of practical joker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shirt gives way and you begin a free fall from grace.  At an estimated twenty feet into the drop, however, you land on a peach colored flabby surface covered in small ripples.  Before you are four small trees of flesh unified in an inclined manner.

Remarkable, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, Jimmy\", Lauraine's deeply soft voice apologizes, \"I just couldn't help myself\".

Besides, Janet was really getting on my nerves and..\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I get it.  I'll look in on you more often\", you interrupt, unwilling to remember a few horrible experiences you've had with Lauraine's roommate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of nostalgia runs thin as you remember some of the sights you had seen on your journey, \"But, what are you doing to the city?  To the people?!  Lauraine, you can't    just treat the city like a playground!  You can't through human beings around like trash!  I mean, what if you stepped on my paper boy?

Plots of concrete, chased by fractured glass, tumble from their structural origins above.  The streets form concave patterns, storing the flattened remains of cars, lampposts, mailboxes, and people who were unable to escape Lauraine's footfalls.  Perhaps this is why real scientists screen their test subjects before experimentation.  It matters little, though.  Lauraine can have her fun for the moment.  You're not here to clean up her messes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if Professor Farnshausen were still around, he would no doubt by in your ear informing you of how irresponsible you were being.  Fortunately, the good professor won't be able to bother you ever again.  It's hard to believe his demise was captured on television, as Lauraine's overpowering sole transformed the professor from a three dimensional being to a two dimensional one.  A sickening sense of glee still fills you each time you recall the scene.  That nagging old coot got what he had coming.  Now, there was no one alive who had any idea what was going on, save yourself and Lauraine, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauraine's rampage continues in full force before you.  Your eardrums focus in on a car engine roaring from on high.  Lauraine holds the undersized model by its top as its tires desperately attempt escape via a nonexistent highway.  Hovering the vehicle in front of her face, Lauraine presents a positively radiant smile to what you can only assume are its passengers.  Without warning, the car sweeps across the sky, leaping from rooftop to rooftop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's hard for you to judge, but you feel a vibe of playful innocence emit from Lauraine.  Could it be possible that she's just a ditz, and not the monster you had thought?  You ponder the thought for a moment, but conclude that the answer is irrelevant.  Whether Lauraine is victim or villain, she will serve your intentions perfectly.  That is, of course, depending on how you approach this situation. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lauraine has taken a couple of lengthy steps since your hesitation, but something seems to have caught her attention.  Leaving her impossibly long legs perfectly straight, Lauraine bends downward at the torso until her body forms a right angle (approximately, of course).  As her derriere pokes at the clouds, Lauraine then proceeds to femininely reach for some unfortunate man desperately trying to evade her grasp, her fingers wiggling in anticipation.  It does little good, however, as Lauraine plucks her target in mid-stride.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntirely engulfed within Lauraine's mighty fist, you can only imagine the terror this stranger must feel as he is forced to ascend.

Also do you remember what led up to this?@<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell for starters you were always into science stuff and while I hate to admit it you always were the smartest out of you, myself, and Lizzie plus Anna is only 5 and you\u2019re the one out of  us that\u2019s an adult and college grad with a career in science. <br>\r\nAs for what I can remember I was on a date with my boyfriend and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Lauraine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I didn\u2019t do it on purpose but I killed Rick and his family\u201d<br>\r\nShe began to sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean you killed them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you see I stayed at Rick\u2019s house last night even tho I knew you and mom would flip. Anyway we made out last night. When I woke up this morning there was a bright flash, I blacked back out, when I woke up I was huge like this and ...and Rick\u2019s house was crushed and in shambles... there was nothing left but debris and I realized I must\u2019ve tossed and turned while I was out\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea you used to do that a lot when I was still at home. It\u2019s sounds like this wasn\u2019t your fault tho\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it was. It was my body and my carelessness and now because of me my boyfriend and his family are dead, their house is destroyed and you\u2019re the 4th person I care about who\u2019s car I crushed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised but who else\u2019s car did you flatten?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell obviously Rick\u2019s moms mini van. My friend Kelly\u2019s moms station wagon since they lived next door to Rick,<br>\r\nand Moms spare car from when dad passed away. I took it to Rick\u2019s place but parked a block away unfortunately I was so shocked, surprised and upset over my size and what I\u2019d done so many cars on Maddison Avenue got crushed or damaged by accident\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like you had quite the day\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou dunno the half of it!

I\u2019m a scientist like your brother it seems. I dunno how you got big but I was curious, wanted to help and wanted to know your intentions.

The man's stomach slams into the impressionable red bottom lining.  The suckers promptly connect, surrounding the unenviable stranger without remorse.  Lauraine's index finger draws itself to the man's exposed bottom, slowly forcing his body to slide deeper into the dark confines within her salivating mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one to enjoy feeling helpless, you speak up, \"Hey!  What are you doing?  Cut that out!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you just say?  You begin to lament your decision to confront the apparently hungry beast.

Luckily (or not) for the man, he is able to grip her bottom lip.  He hangs helplessly at the whim of his potential devourer.  Without taking her eyes off of you, Lauraine's man-sized tongue emerges from the depths of her mouth.  The tongue quickly wraps itself around its prey and disappears within the dark hole from whence it came.  You think you can make out an imprint of the man on Lauraine's left cheek as he is likely trying to claw his way out.

You call for her to wait, but she either doesn't hear you, or she has lost interest in you.  Each collision between Lauraine's bare sole and the ground shutters through you.  It's not so much the power of each step that bothers you (but it is rather intimidating), it is knowing that each stride carries Lauraine to her next victim.  A victim you inadvertently have selected.  Some good you've done today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't let it end like this.  You have to try and stop her again.  However, your feet refuse to move much farther.  You need another mode of...what's this?  A 1999 Dodge Viper, undamaged amongst the chaotic wreckage, with the keys in the ignition and a clear path in Lauraine's direction.  Wow, you couldn't write a better scenario (if you could've, shut up.  My self-esteem couldn't take it).  You jump in the car and take off after Lauraine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwerving around Lauraine's deep foot prints proves to be a bit of a challenge, but it's nothing you can't handle.  It takes you a solid ten minutes, but you do catch up to Lauraine.  Her knees dig into the street, carrying the full weight of Lauraine's body as her upper half stands erect.  Before her lays another man, attempting to backpedal from a sitting position.  Lauraine licks her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've made it in time!  This man's death will not be on your conscience.  You have to convince Lauraine to spare this \"deserving\" morsel.  But first, you have to try something you've always wanted to do.  It may not be the appropriate time, but you probably won't get another chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt sixty miles per hour, you grip the hand brake and turn the wheel all the way to the right.  The Viper spins three times accompanied by smoke and shrieking tires before it comes to a stop next to the potential victim, the nose facing Lauraine.  Wow, it really worked.  Well, you figured it would either work out this way, or the car would flip and you would die.  Needless to say, you are happy with the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump out of the car and confront Lauraine once again.</span></div></div>",

She stops and spreads out her palm so you  can stand. \" Where ,bug?\" she asks. \" The supermarket.\" you reply. </span></div></div>",
