The last time they went was back when Zoe was only 9, and her brother was 10. Three years later and their parents managed to scrape up enough money to have a comfortable vacation. Zoe didn't know about her family, but she was ecstatic! She had been saving money all summer for souvenirs, fake weapons, and maybe a modest dress.  She wanted to meet the Fair's king, watch a jousting tournament, enjoy fashioned food, and camp on the grounds for a week!</span></div></div>",
