Our room, 2nd hallway, room 739\" I said, relieved that we made it after three hours of driving by car. <br>\r\n\"They should move the fair down south more, this is kind of ridiculous.\" Megan said, as she flopped down on the bed. <br>\r\n\"I'll say. Wow, is it me or is it like crazy hot in here?\" I checked the AC unit. \"Wow, they left it off. Well, I'm gonna go take a nice and cold refreshing bath.\"<br>\r\n\"A <i>cold</i> one? Pfft, good luck. I can never manage one.\" she said, checking herself out in the mirror. She and I were often considered the prettiest of the 4. Sierra just uses her body to her advantage. But, we were in no way conceited. \"Wow, I sure do look tired... I think I'm gonna take a nap for a while.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll wake you up when I'm out of the shower?\" <br>\r\n\"Sounds good!\" She said as got on her bed. As I drew a bath, I remember reading an article about strange occurrences at this hotel. I didn't think much of it as I poured the bubble solution into the bath. <br>\r\n\"Reducto-bubbles... Shrinks all your problems away...? Well, I'm not a stressed out person, maybe this will be twice as relaxing!\" As I took my clothes off, and but my favorite dress and clothes on the toilet, I made a large splash in the water, causing the bubbly water to land all over my clothes, both the clean and dirty one. \"Awww, man! Oh, well. Gives me more time to relax in here.\" I got in, and fell asleep for about 15 minutes. When I woke up, I was in much suprise to find out I was...</span></div></div>",

As I reached for a towel, I thought to myself \"Wow, these are kind of heavy...\" I quickly dried myself off, and went to brush my teeth. \"Jeez, this sink is sorta high up. Poor little Rachel probably needs to use a foot stool. I then put on my dress and walked over to Megan. \"Hey, Megan, I'm outta the shower... These beds are high up, aren't they?\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh, you're done? Ok, I'll go take my shower. Ask Sierra and Rach what they wanna do later today.\" We were both in for a surprise when Megan stood up, towering me. \"What the... You're so... Small...\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, that power nap of yours must have really made you grow! You're probably 6 foot something! This must be how Sierra and Rachel feel around us!\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Jess... I didn't grow. Everything for me is the same. I think you shrunk.\"<br>\r\n\"There's no way! My dress fits me perfectly fine!\" I exclaimed, not wanting to admit it.<br>\r\n\"Then go over to your luggage and pull more clothes out and try them on.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok. But I'm telling you, they're gonna fit me fine.\" I go over and pull a shirt out. As soon as I do, the shirt seem twice as large as I remembered it to be. \"Uhhh... what?\"<br>\r\n\"I told you, you shrunk!\" You must be shorter than Sierra. Go to her room and see how tall you are. I'm gonna take a shower.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, if anything happens text me, and I'll text you.\" I told her. I go down the hall 4 rooms, and knock on the door. Sierra opens the door, and is approximately 2 or 3 inches taller than me.  \"Oh my goodness... I shrunk so much! I feel so little!\"<br>\r\n\"What happened Jess?! I'm actually taller than you!\"<br>\r\n\"I know! I somehow managed to shrink! I don't know how this possibly could've happened... I feel so tiny now!\" I said. I heard Rachel's heels becoming louder as I deduced that she was approaching to see what was going on. Boy, was I in for a surprise when I saw her in her 4 inch heels, making her as tall as Sierra.<br>\r\n\"Wow! Jess! You're so little now!\" After abour 5 minutes of nonstop questions making me feel shorter and shorter with each lne, Rachel fianlly said \"One second, let me take off my heels.\" Luckily, I had managed to stay taller than her. \"Aww, I'm still the shortest. How tall are you now, anyways?\" She said, while her, Sierra, and I stood side-by-side trying to found out.<br>\r\n\"Hmm, good question... I would have to guess maybe about... uh 5 feet even?\" I said while looking left and right repeatedly.<br>\r\n\"That's sounds about right! Sorry, Rach, you're still the only legal midget out of us 4.\" Sierra said, making me feel a little better somehow.<br>\r\n\"Ha, good one. You know I'm slowly growing... slowly. I might even be taller than <i>you</i> one day, Sierra. And of course if you either A.) Stay that small, or B.) Shrink more, I might pass you too, Jess!\"<br>\r\n\"Hahaha don't get your hopes up!\" I said, laughing. I was actually afraid of all three things she just had said; Staying this small, her actually passing me in height, and shrinking even more somehow. <br>\r\n10 minutes later, I suddenly, I felt my phone vibrate. It was a text from Megan which had read \"OMG! I have two pieces of news you might or might not like. 1. Charlotte is here...\" Charlotte is our friend who is a soccer freak. She's 6'2\", blonde, and has a crazy nice body, and despite her height, always wears heels. ...\" and 2. I think the exact opposite of what happened to you happened to me! I grew and I must be at least 5'11\"! All my clothes are super small on me!\" At first I was excited about the Charlotte being here thing, and didn't believe her about growing. Then, I realized that Charlotte is going to make so much fun of me for shrinking somehow. Also, Meg sent me a picture of her wearing one of her dresses.<br>\r\n\"Hah... just what I needed... Megan grew to about 6 feet tall, and Charlotte is here... Meg just sent me a text.\" We all just laughed.<br>\r\nRachel was putting on her heels again, and Sierra was putting on make up when someone knocked on the door about 10 seconds later \"I got it.\" I said as I opened the door. When I opened it, I was shocked to find the giantess who just happened to be Megan. As I looked straight up, I couldn't help but let my jaw drop. \"Jess...? You look half as big as you did before! I feel like I'm 7 feet tall!\" She said as she walked in. <br>\r\n\"You might as well be in those 6 inch heels!\" I exclaimed. Her heels fit her perfectly, and it honestly seems like the only part effected was her legs, and her torso slightly. \"How do they possibly still fit you?!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I think my legs grew like 5 inches, and my torso just one because all my shirts and shoes fit fine. But? All my skirts and dresses are too small!\" This was true, she was wearing a pink dress which would normally go up to her knees, but know they hardly cover get thighs with out her having to keep pushing it down.<br>\r\nI moved aside, creating space for her to get in while saying \"Try not to step on me on your way in.\" She just laughed and stated down at my. <br>\r\n\"Wow, I feel like your girls' mother when I'm this tall! You guys seem so little. Especially you, Jess!\"<br>\r\n\"Why me?!\" I asked. <br>\r\n\"Because I'm so used to slightly looking up at you, but not I'm can get on my knees and we'll almost be eye level. My legs are like half your size. You remind me of a Barbie doll; so little and defenseless!\" She walked in the bathroom where Sierra was. All I could hear was her boasting more about how tall she was. I sat down in a chair, and realized my feet weren't touching the ground. I looked down, and just let out a groan. <br>\r\n\"That's so weird... You shrunk half a foot, and she grew half a foot... What have you guys done since you got here?\" Rachel asked. <br>\r\nI thought about it for a minute and then said \"Well I took a bath, and Meg a shower.\" I didn't even think about the bubbles. \"She did take awfully long in her shower though...\" It hit me then. \"Hey, Megan?! Did you take a shower or a bath?!\"<br>\r\n\"She stuck her head out and said \"Well I was going to take a shower, but I'm sure as hell am happy I opted with a bath!\"<br>\r\n\"Did you use bubbles??\" I asked desperately. <br>\r\n\"Why, yes. Yes, I did. Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Quick! What was the motto for the bubbles?!?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I think something like 'It'll make you bigger than your greatest fears!' Because you know how I usually miss out on these because I'm scared, so I thought it would help! And it sure feels like it did.\"<br>\r\n\"What're you possibly afraid of!? A daddy long legs? You grew half a foot and the majority of it went to your legs!\" I yelled. I completely forgot to explain myself. <br>\r\n\"Wait, why does it matter what the motto said?\" Rachel intervened, obviously dying from curiosity. <br>\r\n\"Oh! Um, right. Well I, too, took a bubble bath. Except I used a brand whose logo was 'Shrink all your troubles away' or something of the sorts. That must be it. If yours said it'll make you bigger...\"<br>\r\n\"I guess that would make sense... But who cares?! I'm nearly 6 feet tall barefoot!\" There was a knock on the door, and Meg barely took two long strides with her ginormous legs and was at the door. \"CHARLOTTE! AHHHH!!\" Megan screamed at the tips of her lungs. They hugged each other and, because Char was also wearing heels, they were the same height. Me, completely forgetting about my shrunken stature, runs up and hugs her. She managed to pick me up with the slightest ease, bringing me up to her face, which seemed 2 feet away from mine, and said \"Did you shrink?!? I thought that was like, sci-fi stuff? I didn't know you could actually shrink?\" As she had me suspended in the air, I was kicking my feet, wanting to be put down. In all honesty, it was actually scary being held up about a foot in the air for so long. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess it <i>is</i> possible to shrink. Unfortunately, I found out the hard way...\"<br>\r\n\"Don't feel too bad.\" Charlotte said as she was placing me on the ground. \"Apparently a lot of guys don't ask me out because I'm 6'2\" and I always wear heels. It sucks that most of the guys are like 5'5\". They're so tiny next to me, I feel like I could step on them. Now that you're not taller than the average guy, boys will be all over you.\"<br>\r\n\"You really think so?\" I asked. Megan then came to where Charlotte and I were. She stood next to me, revealing that her legs were about half my size. I put my arm around her (which happened to be her massive thighs. \"Well, I guess there's not much we can do other than take a picture and laugh!\" When we took the first picture (side by side), we then hugged each other while out bodies were facing each others' and I realised her boobs were right in my face. She was never known for having big boobs, but the were most definitely bigger than before. <br>\r\n\"You're so little now!\" Charlotte said, as if I didn't know. \"I thin I finally found a nickname for you... Smurfette!\"<br>\r\n\"Smurfette?? But Rachael is little-er than me!\" The word shorter jus didn't come to mind. Rachael then came out and stood next to me, revealing that she was taller. When I looked down, I found out that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I had shrunk down even more! I don't know how tall I was exactly, just that I managed to make Rachel look tall compared to me.<br>\r\n\"Ha! I <i>was</i> 'little-er' than you! Looks like you shrunk down again!\" She said, bending down to be eye level with me.<br>\r\n\"I have no idea how though! My dress fits me the same!\" But surely enough, I had indeed shrunken down. I went over to the rest of the girls and told them that we need to go to the main lobby to find a tape measure. As we rode the elevator down, I began wondering when I could've shrunken down, and it occurred to me it must've been when Charlotte so effortlessly picked me up. When we arrived to the lobby, Rachel, Sierra and I went to the little seating area. Megan and Charlotte went to the front desk and were talking to the male concierge, who they easily towered over. He was a short guy, maybe about 5'1\" because I remembered I was taller than him when I checked in at normal height, as was Megan and Sierra. Now with the two both being 6'5\" (because of their heels), they dwarfed him. Megan couldn't stop making fun of him, and I could her across the lobby saying \"Wow! You're do petite! How do you mange to see over the desk?!\" But the tiny concierge seemed to be into it, as he got out from behind the desk and stood in between Charlotte and Megan. He kept playing along, saying how tall they were and comparing their height. As we got to the seating area, Sierra was the only one to take a seat. I stood, not wanting to see how much my feet hovered above the ground while sitting, and Rachel kept standing next to me, in 4 inch heels, wanting to see how tall she is. She was the only one obsessed with me shrinking (Megan was obsessed with her growing), but I didn't say anything. I didn't want to be rude or mean, I can imagine what's its like to <i>finally</i> be taller than the tallest girl you hang out with (Charlotte wasn't really best friends with Rachel and Sierra as she was with Megan and I). When the two humongous girls finally came back 5 minutes later, they simply said \"Let's go?\". We all got back into the elevator. <br>\r\nWhen we got to our room, Megan immediately went to the bathroom. Charlotte took the tape measure, and immediatly measured me, finding out that I was 4'6. I accumatively had lost an entire foot. Megan came out, with heels in hand, stood taller than Charlotte, and asked how tall I was. Everyone instead asked what happened to her. <br>\r\n\"How're you taller than her with out heels on and she is wearing inch heels?!\" Sierra asked<br>\r\n\"She's must have had grown again, just like I shrunk again!\" I yelled. <br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness! I am as tall as her! I must be 6'8\" barefoot!\" She quickly put on her heels, which put her well over 7 feet tall. I stood next to her, and her entire waist was above my head. Her extremely long, blonde hair was down to my face, whilst mine hardly got to her knees.<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness....\" I said, looking straight up. \"Megan, you're ginormous!\"<br>\r\n\"I know! I make Charlotte look short!\" This was never done before. No girl ever made Charlotte look small. Megan took off her heels, and Charlotte, with some difficulty, managed to find out she was 6'9 barefoot. I stood next to her again, and her waist was no even with my head.<br>\r\n\"We have to call to company that made those bubbles!\" I said, running to the bathroom, picking up my phone, and searching for the number. Megan quickly brought up lunch, and how it would be a better idea to not go to the fancy restaurant we always go to and just get room service. We all agreed, and while on hold for nearly half an hour, we all changed into more comfortable clothes. Megan had the hardest time finding something big enough, even from Charlotte's clothes, and I had trouble finding something small enough, even from Rachel's clothes. After we got through with the president if the company and explained everything, he told us everything.<br>\r\n\"Well, the effects, as drastic as they are, are not permanent. You two will shrink down an grow to regular height with time. How <i>much</i> time, however, is unknown. Now, the tallest you can grow is two feet. Lucky for you, you're done growing. The increases in height are in parts of two. If I understood you correctly, she grew 6 inches in the first part, and 10 in the second. To the one who is shrinking, you may not be so lucky. You can shrink as little as 4 inches down to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...The size of a little Barbie doll, or anything in between. There is no way of telling how much you'll shrink until you remain the same height for 1 hour.\" He then went on to explain how there was a disclaimer in fine print on the back, and all that. I stopped paying attention, however. I was too worried about ending up the size of a doll. A few minutes after we hung up, room service had arrived. For some reason, it was free of charge. We soon came to find out why. Megan went to the peep hole, even though she had to bend down almost half her height, and found out it was the little 5 foot tall (or so he told Megan and Charlotte when they were comparing heights) concierge. Megan quickly put on her heels, which made her taller than the doorway more than she already was,  and opened the door. The concierge was easily visible through The gap in between Megan's legs, which were as long as I was tall. Megan towered two feet and three inches taller than him, and he seemed to <i>love</i> it. All the girls and I were hungry, so while Megan kept talking about how much smaller the little man was, Charlotte got up, said \"hey, there, little man\" and got our food. Sierra then pointed out that the concierge was erect, and we all concluded that he had a fetish for tall women. I got up to stand next to Megan just to give him an ideas of how tall Megan really became, and I noticed me self shrink when I stood next to her. I was now at about her knees (when she's in the heels that seem to be up to <i>my</i> knees. I was sure I had to have had shrunk down a foot or more. I don't think the concierge saw me shrink because he said \"is that baby playing dress up in one if your girls' clothes?\" Which I promptly replied \"I'm no baby! I'm the oldest girl here!\" Which made me realise that my voice probably sounded as high pitched as when I was in 1st grade to them. <br>\r\nSierra walked on over, picked me up like a little toddler, and said \"Sorry about my little sister. She's very energetic and always wishes she was our age.\" Sierra and I are cousins and we look almost identical, so he bought it. \"Well, thanks for dropping our food off!\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Hey! I wasn't done with him!\" Megan shouted at us. <br>\r\n\"Well, what he probably wants to do with you now is probably illegal, considering you're a minor!\" Sierra said, as we all laughed. After we closed the door, we all began eating. I was shocked at how small I became. Rachel's shirt was now covering my entire body, and Rachel herself was a little under twice my size.<br>\r\nAfter we finished eating, I had shrunk even more, and  we all decided to watch a movie. Megan and Charlotte got on Megan's bed, while Rachel, Sierra and I got on mine. Sierra went to the bathroom to take a shower and everyone else easily got on the bed. I tried scaling it, but I couldn't do it. Rachel offered help, but I refused it. \"I can do this by myself!\" I said. I wasn't sure if I actually could or not. I walked on over to Megan's heels which were about a 1/3 of my height, somehow managed to pick one up, and placed it in front of my bed. I used it as an extra step and managed to get on top of the bed. After I was able to get under the covers, which I felt were gonna suffocate me, we began playing the movie. About 5 minutes in, I began crying. I thought no one saw until one of Rachel's extremely long and slender fingers wiped the tears from my eyes. She then easily slid me over closer to her to the point that our bodies where touching and asked what was wrong. I began breaking down, saying how my life was ruined because I'm inevitably going to end up the size of a doll, knowing my luck. I had already become so small that I was smaller than her torso. I was probably about 18 inches tall. Rachel said not to worry, and that they'll always be there for me. That really made me feel better, and I stopped crying. Sierra finally got our of the bathroom and easily found space on the bed made for two. Rachel put me on her stomach at first. I was small enough that I was using her giant breasts as pillows. Since we both watched the movie playing like 3 other times before, she began playing with me. <br>\r\n\"Aww, you're so little. I could hold you in very two own hands.\" She said, showing me her hands, which just one of them was nearly a fourth of my size. Even still, she could easily make me do whatever she wanted me to do. Since my dress was shrinking along with me, I slipped back into that. She easily pinched my dress, with me in it, with her index finger and thumb and suspended me in mid air with the slightest ease. She then dropped me on her massive legs, which I could easily fit on. After slipped off it, and fell onto the bed which seemed 4 feet down, she easily scooped me up and put my back on her stomach. I could tell this was all to her amusement.<br>\r\nAbout another 35 minutes in, I shrunk down again. I was finally the size of Barbie. I was about the fall asleep on her when her enormous hand easily grabbed me and held me like she would an iPhone, and placed me on a pillow. I didn't think too much of it, mainly because I was so tired, but when I had woken up, I couldn't stop thinking about how little 4'10\" Rachel could almost wrap her hand around me (she held me more like a cup, with her four fingers on one side, and her thumb on the other) and hold me in just one of her hands. I feared she would do that a lot, and she did. Every time she would go somewhere, even if it was from her bed to the sink, she would pick me up like that. I couldn't do anything other than put I tiny, little hands on her thumb and pointer finger and hope she wouldn't drop me.<br>\r\nWe decided not to go to the fair today, and go shopping instead.<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'll go look at Barbie dolls with Jessica!\" Rachel said, with me in hand. Since she didn't want to cause too much attention to herself, she put me in her pocket in such a way that my arms and some of my upper body would be the only things showing. When we got to the toy store, she quickly took me out, grabbed a Barbie and compared my height with the dolls. I was the exact same size as it. \"Oh, goodie! All the cute little outfits will fit you fine. And when we get to my home, I'll have a reason to bust out all my old, little dollies again.\"<br>\r\n\" Sounds... Great...I guess\" she left me alone for about a minute and a half in a doll house as she went around collecting all the dolls with \"cute outfits\". Most of them were dresses. I love wearing dresses, but I had been wearing my pink one since the moment I became too tiny to wear Rachel's clothes, and I just wanted as to wear anything else.<br>\r\n\"Ok, so I know how you <i>always</i> wanted to be a cheerleader like me, so try this on.\" She said, as she handed me an entire doll with a cheerleading outfit on.  What she said was true. Even though I was just 5'6\", they told me I was about 3 inches too tall to be a cheerleader. I then tried volleyball, and they told me I was about 3 inches too small to play. After I finally managed to get the doll undressed, I quickly put on the outfit and stepped onto the Barbie Dream House's third floor balcony to show her it.<br>\r\n\"It looks adorable on you!\" She said. \"Listen, I know you still want to do things by yourself, but it takes too long. I undressed some dolls for you, so take these.\" She handed me at least 20 dresses. The rate it took me to undress a Barbie, put her outfit on, and show her, she did my entire first step 20 times over. I was no worried of her becoming impatient and undressing and dressing me up herself. It went fine until the 11th dress where she began doing just that. When she finally put me down, I ran to hide in the doll house. Once she realised what I had done, she stuck her hand into the house to try end grab me. \"Aww, now don't hide from <i>me</i>, little Jess, you'll just make it worse for yourself.\" Once she couldn't blindly find me, she put her face to the windows looking for me. I could she her giant eyeball scanning the place, while laughing. \"Ok, come out...\" She said while chuckling. After 5 seconds of her not saying anything and me hiding, she said \"<i>now</i>\" loud enough to let me know she was angry, and supposedly yelling. \"Listen here, Barbie. I'm nearly 4 feet taller than you. I could easily squash you with my feet \"<i>or</i> my hands. Either way, this will <i>not</i> end well for you.\" As she finished her sentence, I felt the entire doll house being lifted up and tilted. I started sliding towards the door (I managed to escape to the first floor) and I heard her say \"Ah! Found ya!\" As she levelled the doll house and managed to grab my leg with her giant hand. <br>\r\n\"Rachel! STOP! I'm a human being and I will be treated like one!\"<br>\r\nShe brought me to her huge face and said...</span></div></div>",

Then, back at my place, I have all of my old dolls stored away.\" I picked 9 dresses I liked the most and the cheerleading outfit, while bringing up the regular clothes. She quickly rejected it with \"Well, the dresses are already picked out so let's just take these. Besides, you and I <i>love</i> wearing dresses.\" That is also true. We have entire discussions about dresses some days. After she got the dolls, bought them, and left the toy store. She said she was going to find some dresses for her. We walk into our favorite store and she picks several dresses. She walks on over the the dressing room, takes me out of her skirt pocket, and places me atop the other dresses she got. She puts the first dress on, a blue strapless, and bends over to talk to me. \"So, whaddya think?\" I couldn't stop staring at her boobs, that were now huge, even compared to my entire body.<br>\r\n\"We'll you're gonna have to stand straight up so I can see what it's like!\" After she did, I fell in love with the dress. It was absolutely beautiful. I even told her how much I loved it.<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry! They have your size.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think they do...\" I replied back to her.<br>\r\n\"No, they do. I checked.\"<br>\r\n\"So you're telling me that the beautiful dress you're wearing right now comes in Barbie doll size?\" I said, sticking my arms out, as if to say \"look at me!\"<br>\r\n\"OH! Hahaha, well, no, you're right. They don't come in your adorable little size.\" After several more dresses, each better than last, we finally left the store. She bought 3 dresses, the first blue one, a pink one, and a red gown. Her dresses are usually way to small on me, but now I'm the one who's too small.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachel and I decided to head back early, mainly because she didn't want to carry a ton of bags. When we got there, I changed into the cheer leading uniform because it was the most comfortable thing to wear.<br>\r\n\"Y'know, these Barbie clothes aren't all that bad to wear. I mean, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't switch out normal clothes for these, but they're kinda nice.\" Rachel put me on her boobs to sit while we watch a movie, and I turned around and saw her hold a giant mug, and getting some ice cream out of it. She brought the huge spoon next to me and asked \"Want some?\"<br>\r\n\"No, thanks. Since I'm so little, that much ice cream is probably worth like 1/4 of a gallon.\"<br>\r\n\"Hahaha aww, but you weigh like 3 pounds. I think you can have a tiny bit. But if you really don't want any, I'm not gonna insist.\"<br>\r\nWe were watching movies for about three hours when the rest of the girls came back. Rachel put me on the floor, and I ran over to them. Despite Megan complaining about no clothes fitting her, she had a bag. I didn't get to make out what it was before I ran under it. Megan was so tall that the bag was probably a whole two feet over my head. She didn't see me either, and she kept on walking and kicked me, sending me flying.<br>\r\n\"Jess! I'm so sorry! I really didn't see you! You shouldn't be standing right by my feet, that are your size now.\"<br>\r\n\"It's ok, I'm fine. What in the bag though?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I got some heels and shoes for me. And also, some accessories for you.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Since you're so little now, everything big for you, so we had to get little miniature things for you, like this little brush.\" She picks me up, places me on a table, and hands me a toy brush that seemed ridiculously small in her hand. I picked it up off her hands, and I held it like a regular brush. \"Awww, you hold it like a regular brush! How cute!\" She reached into the same bag and got a huge doll house. \"Since we don't want to hurt you when you're sleeping it whatever, we got you this little doll house as well.\" She placed me in it, and Rachel handed me all my new dresses. I put them in a closet on the third floor. When I finished, I took a step and said to my self \"Ughh, why does Barbie like pink, dresses, skirts, and heels so much?\" When I went to the balcony, everyone was already on a bed to finish the movie. Sierra picked me up, and placed me on her stomach. She also got my brush and started brushing my hair. I turned around at one point and saw how hard it was for her to hold the brush.<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy you decided to dye your hair blonde. You actually look like a Barbie doll because of it.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,  just what I wanted\u2026\" I sarcastically said, as she continued brushing my hair with the doll accessory.<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't mean it like that. You know everyone has been calling you a \"life size Barbie\" since you died it.\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now I'm a <i>real</i> Barbie.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be such a downer!\" Megan said, from across the room.<br>\r\n\"Easy to say when you're almost 7 feet tall\u2026\"  I thought to myself. Instead of retaliating, I just sat there in my Barbie cheer leading uniform, while my giantess little cousin brushed my hair. I decided it was better to stay quiet as opposed to having 4 huge girls gang up on me. After we finished the movie, Sierra and Rachel went back to their room, and Charlotte feel asleep on the bed I was supposed to be sleeping on. I saw Megan make her way across over to me to pick me up and put me in my doll house.<br>\r\n\"Here, I'll put the elevator on the third floor for you, but you won't be able to use is unless someone operates it.\" She placed me on the 3rd floor and stood up, revealing that the doll house was about a 1/3 of her size, whereas I was 1/3 of the doll house's size. \"Aww, you're so cute. You actually look like a little Barbie. Well, good night!\"</span></div></div>",

It'll be better too, because I can see myself growing instead of waking up taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both couldn't sleep. I think we were both thinking about the same thing; how much taller she'd end up. As the hours passed, and I couldn't sleep, despite how tired I was, I went downstairs and decided to play dress up with myself. I tried on all my dresses, put on some cute bows, and make up. Rachel came by at around 5 in the morning and asked what I was doing.<br>\r\n\"I can't sleep for some reason, so I decided to pass the time by putting on some dresses.\"<br>\r\n\"Ohhh\" she said while laughing. \"That's a good idea.

I don't know how tall I'm gonna end up, so I need some clothes.\"<br>\r\nAt 8 in the morning, everybody was awake. Rachel and I promised not to tell anyone. She also said that she was gonna stand by everyone to see how much taller they are before she grows. For Charlotte, she was eye level with her boobs. When she stood by Megan, she was completely under her breasts. Megan also noticed this, and stood over her to confirm it. Her and Sierra didn't have that much of a difference. Everyone, but me and Rachel, went down for breakfast. We, instead, went to my and Meg's room and got the bubbles. She brought both just because she was too lazy to get the right one. As she was taken a bath, she poured out some bubbles.<br>\r\n\"Make sure it's the right one!\" I yelled, from the sink.<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.\"<br>\r\nAs I look at the bubble bottle of the one she didn't grab\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I got out of the tub and noticed everything was bigger than usual.<br>\r\n\"What in the world\u2026?\" I thought as held up my dress against my body. \"What's going on\u2026? I don't remember ever buying a dress for someone 6 feet and a half tall. In fact, I'm pretty sure this dress was already kind of small on me before.\" I remember in the dressing room I put it on, and it was up to my thighs. I put it on and it was down to my shins. \"There's no way\u2026\" I think as I run out to the room. I see the beds being a lot higher than before. \"Megan! Wake up!\" I yell. She quickly jumps off the bed, probably because she's scared, and then I knew that I shrunk.<br>\r\nAs I looked straight up at her, she looked right down at me, and we were in both in disbelief.<br>\r\n\"You\u2026 you're\u2026 shorter than Rachel\u2026\" I was surprised she didn't ask what happened, although I'm not even sure what happened.<br>\r\n\"Should we go to their room?\" I asked in desperation. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she replied, \"you're gonna need clothes. Maybe Rachel can give you some.\"<br>\r\nI nodded my head, but couldn't believe it. I never though that I, being 5'6\" would have to ask tiny, little Rachel, who's 4'10\" for clothes for me to wear. I mean, I'm 8 inches taller than her for crying out loud! She's asked me for some clothes, like hand me downs, several times before, but that was for clothes I owned almost 4 years ago, when I was about 5 feet tall. <br>\r\nI quickly grabbed one of my 2 and a half inch Nike pro compression shorts and my smallest training bra and put them on. Not only where they naturally bigger on me, but they were also looser. It was at this point where I realized that I didn't get shorter, but rather smaller. Megan, who was almost my height, now towered over me. Her thick legs seemed bigger and longer than ever. I could swear just one of her legs seemed about 2/3 of my size. If she wanted to, she could have easily pushed me around with her massive legs just by walking in a direction while I was trying to resist them by going going in the opposite direction.<br>\r\nI was trying to wrap my head around what was going on. I mean, how could I just\u2026 I guess, shrink. I thought that only happens in cheesy sci-fi films like the Incredible Shrinking Woman or as a cop-out episode for TV shows making the main character shrink for an episode or so like Totally Spies, SpongeBob, and tons of other shows. I couldn't get my mind straight. It was like a nightmare. <br>\r\n\"This is unreal. I don't get how you shrunk!!\" Megan yelled down at me while we were walking. I was having a hard time keeping up with her strides. <br>\r\n\"Me neither\u2026 I heard about freak things happening at this hotel but I never imagined it could happen to me!\"<br>\r\n\"Should we call your parents??\" <br>\r\n\"Dear heavens no! No one can find out about this\u2026 we might be able to fix it somehow before we have to leave.\" I could never let my parents hear about this, because they would undoubtedly tell my little sisters. One of my little sisters is 15 and nearly 6 foot tall and still growing. Ever since she surpassed me in height she never let me hear the end of it. But even worse is my 14 year old sister who is already nearly my height. If they find out that I'm\u2026 however short I currently am they'll tease me forever. <br>\r\n\"What about Gabe?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, Gabe might be happy to hear. He never liked the fact that since we started dating 2 years ago I literally \"out grew\" him.\" I had a late growth spurt last year. I was 5'1 when I started dating my 5'3 boyfriend, Gabe. Almost suddenly, in the course of a month, I shot past up Sierra, then Gabe, then Megan. I don't mind dating a shorter guy, but it sucks cause he hates it and I love wearing heels especially around my \"little man\", but understandably he hates it even more. I'm not gonna dump the guy just cause he's a shrimp, and he refuses to dump me even though I \"grew into a giantess\", whatever that means, so now we're hoping he'll have a late growth spurt too.<br>\r\nI put on one of my old t-shirts so I wouldn't just be in underwear and a bra as we made our way to the other girls' room. The original plan was for us to get to our rooms, and get ready to go out eat an extremely fancy restaurant. I highly doubt that we'll go out at all, or at least me personally will leave the hotel. We get to Sierra and Rachel's room, and knock on it. My heart sank when I realized how little I will look compared to Rachel, who was <i>always</i> that shortest of the group. We even joke around saying that despite being one of the oldest, when she was born she was smaller than the average baby and we were born already bigger than her. She always took the jokes well, but I don't think I'll be able to bear them. When the door opened, I immediately groaned loudly as Rachel in 6 in heels opened the door (one thing Rachel loves about being tiny is being able to wear the craziest heels and still being pretty short compared to guys. Which is true, she's only 5'4\" in the heels which isn't as tall as Megan or I barefoot).<br>\r\n\"What the fuck!?\" She yelled out after a second or two of analyzing what was going on. It almost seemed like she believed this the least out of all of us. \"Am I losing my mind?\" <br>\r\nWe walked in as Meg started explaining what we know so far, which is pretty much that I shrunk and we don't know how. Sierra stepped out of the bathroom in her 4 inch heels making her a foot taller than me. <br>\r\nI was getting irrationally angry at them all crowding around me because two of them were in heels. \"Hey guys, can you not stand around me in heels?! It's not that I don't love having your tits in my face, but having my now giant friends just trapping me in this triangle is making me go crazy.\" It only got me so mad cause their boobs were showing because of the dresses they were wearing and Megan just has big breasts in general and I was almost boob height to all of them. <br>\r\nThey gave me some space and I literally climbed on the bed to sit down. It felt super weird having my legs dangle over the side of the bed. I'm sure Rachel didn't mean to, but it seemed like she sat next to me on purpose almost to gloat or (finally) feel big or to compare sizes with me. I refused to look up, but I felt her eyes looking down at me. <br>\r\n\"So\u2026\" Sierra said to break the silence, \"uh, what are we gonna do for dinner?\"<br>\r\n\"I mean\u2026 we have the tradition of going to that one restaurant\u2026 I would hate to break tradition\u2026\" Rachel said. <br>\r\n\"Me too\" Megan chimed in. <br>\r\n\"Are we just gonna ignore the fact that I'm tiny now??\" I said, jumping off the bed. \"I don't have clothes to wear to go! Or shoes to wear! Or anything! \" I was spinning around in a circle to address tall three of them as they were on different sides of the room. I guess over the sound of my yelling I didn't hear Rachel get off the bed and stand up behind me so as I turned around I planted my face right in her cleavage. All three of them tried to stifle their laughs. I knew it would be super rude to get mad at them and I at this point felt sorry for being so rude to them so I backed up, took a few breath and apologized.<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't feel too bad. I don't think I would handle shrinking very well either and I'm only 4'10\". But, I might have some clothes that'll fit you\u2026 I kept them from when I was a little shorter so I could have some\u2026 skimpy clothes to wear if we went clubbing\u2026 it works well for short girls, no one really calls us out for it. I have no shoes for you unless we're the same size or if you don't mind wearing bigger shoes.\"<br>\r\nRachel handed me this bright, pink dress that was still a little too big for me but better than anything I had. Her feet were in fact bigger, so I couldn't wear heels unless I wanted to fall a lot, so while all my giant friends wore their heels (including Megan), I was stuck in flats that were a size or two too big. <br>\r\n\"I look like a little Barbie doll compared to you titans. Can't we just get room service?\"<br>\r\n\"Com on Jes, room service is super expensive, and besides we're all ready to go, and it <i>is</i> tradition.\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh, ok\u2026 no point in trying to change plans now.\"</span></div></div>",

Megan, who now stood at 5'9\" lead us to the restaurant down the street. Thankfully Sierra was thoughtful enough to wait up for me when my little legs couldn't keep up with theirs. <br>\r\n\"You kinda do look like a Barbie. If you hadn't worn pink lipstick, and a pink dress with blonde hair it wouldn't be so bad. Not to mention, well, your height of course.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, matching pink with pink while as a blonde was something I never had to worry about before. I didn't really think about it. I was more worried with how I was gonna see over the sink to do my make up. And luckily I only shrank\u2026 well, I don't even <i>know</i> how much I shrank. But it could've been enough to <i>actually</i> be doll size. But now I'm really curious how small I am. I know smaller than Rachel barefoot, but I kinda wanna know the exact height.\"<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the front, Rachel and Megan were having their own conversation.<br>\r\n\"Even in 6 inch heels I'm not as tall as you or Jessica. You two are so tall, I'm kinda jealous. Just how tall are you in <i>those</i> heels anyways? I've never seen you wearing those before.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, I think 5'9\"? And yeah these are new! I got them a week ago. But, now you technically have Jessica beat in size. Poor girl. I seriously wanna know what happened to her\u2026 I feel asleep for 15 minutes and I wake up and she's\u2026 wait, how tall even is she now?\"<br>\r\n\"Not sure. But even barefoot I was still noticeably taller than her. She must've shrunken a lot. I might be a foot taller than her in these heels. We need to figure it out soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile we were waiting to be seated, we all had to stand since all the seats were taken. I was standing in front of Megan and I could've easily used her boobs as a head rest if I leaned back. Whenever she said something to me and I turned around to see her face, I was meet with cleavage and it made me feel littler every time. I swear I could hear the normal sized folks talking about how little I am. Maybe I was just paranoid. At one point I swear I saw these twins who couldn't be older than 10 or 11 walk by me and be taller than me as well.<br>\r\nWhen we were finally seated, much to my dismay, we ended up a small circular table for 4 towards the center of the restaurant. I was hoping for something more secluded to see/be seen by the least amount of people possible. Just as fate would have it, I ended up in between the two tallest girls, with Rachel directly across from me. In retrospect I realize there was no good seat in a circular table. I was only mildly annoyed when I was handed a kids menu. I think I was already used to being whatever height I was. That, or my feet not touching the ground when I sit was a constant reminder of my new diminutive stature. Despite hinting that I'm not a little kid when asking for an adult menu, I was still brought out a Coke in a kids cup. <br>\r\n\"Excuse me ma'am,\" I started, \"can I have a regular size cup please?\"<br>\r\n\"You want a big girl's cup?\" She turned to Megan, who I guess she assumed was my big sister and asked if its ok. Instead of setting the record straight she played along leading our waitress to believe we were sisters. She brought out my \"big girl's cup\" and   said \"don't drink too much caffeine; it'll stunt your growth!\" While the other giants just laughed. I visually sized her up and concluded that I was at least 3 inches taller than her at full size, and thought to myself \"if only she knew that I'm bigger than her\u2026\"<br>\r\nI was curious as if I sounded like a little girl too, and when I asked they all said my voice was a little higher pitched, which I guess explains why I'm being treated like a 9 year old. But I still have a developed body, so I don't really understand.<br>\r\nMy three full-sized friends all reached for complimentary chips at the center of the table, and I was debating whether I should even try for it. Rachel must've seen me stare at the chips and asked if I want some. I said yes, and reached for them, only to be defeated by the distance from me to them despite my chair being pushed in all the way. Megan's insanely long arms had no problem swooping in, grabbing a handful of chips (which for me would probably be two handfuls) and dropping them on my napkin for me. I thanked her and after eating a few salted chips, I went for the first sip of my drink. The cup was so large that I actually could not grab it with one hand. I put both of my hands around, lifted it, not expecting it to be so heavy, took a sip and nearly spilled it on myself. It must've been obvious that i was struggling, since the waitress, who arrived just in time to see my struggle, asked, in a voice that clearly was meant for a little kid, \"Are you sure you don't want a smaller cup,  sweetie?\" I think her  calling me sweetie pissed me off more than the voice for whatever reason. I didn't snap at her though, there's no way she was doing it on purpose. So instead I said I'm fine, and I was determined to use the regular size cup for the rest of the night. After she took our orders and left, Megan looked down at me and said \"maybe you should invest in using a straw for the night\" and widened her eyes as she easily grabbed her cup with one hand and took a long sip. I <i>hated</i> using straws for whatever reason, but after almost spilling soda on myself again I admitted defeat.<br>\r\n\"Do short girls usually get treated like this?!\" I asked the table. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" Rachel replied. By the time we all shifted our gaze at her she had closed her eyes, eat a chip that was dipped in salsa, and was nodding her head as a follow up to her answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was pretty standard. There were a few conversations that really stood out, and unsurprisingly, they were al about my height. The first was Sierra bringing up me shrinking again. <br>\r\n\"You're like, 'proportionally' smaller. You didn't just get shorter, because you're not the same 'width' as you were before,\" she was explaining to us. \"To you, you're the same size, weight, and everything. Pretty much the world around you got bigger.\"<br>\r\n\"That makes sense\u2026 I saw these twins walk by me when we were waiting to be seated and they seemed 'bigger' than me. They couldn't have been more than an inch or so taller, but they definitely were, uh, 'wider', as you put it.\" This explanation made a lot of sense. If I was just shorter, all my clothes would still fit me, but just be way too long on me. Instead, I can hardly hang one of my shirts on one shoulder. <br>\r\nThankfully they didn't want to harp on the same conversation all night long, so Rachel quickly changed the conversation about what tomorrow's plan is. I'm sure it was to get my mind off of me shrinking, but I just sat there and listened to everything they said and just wondered how they expect me to continue on with tomorrow like this. The next crack about my size came from when our food came out. The plate and serving size of the chicken Parmesan I ordered was insanely bigger than I remembered.<br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026 this is way too much food.\" I said as the waitress sat the food down in front of me. \"Maybe I <i>should</i> have ordered the kid's meal!\"<br>\r\n\"Or split it with your big sister!\" The waitress added. I honestly don't even think we look alike, and we've hardly ever gotten comments of us saying we do, so I don't know how she thinks we could be sisters\u2026 different mom or dad maybe? No clue. I didn't wanna call her out though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ate less than half of my food, when the rest of the girls ate theirs entirely.<br>\r\n\"I feel like shrinking affected my body I'm weird ways. I'm still a normal size, but everything is much heavier, like I feel like I'm weaker. I also think I lost my appetite. I would eat all this food easy. I really in shape too, Megan and I always go to the gym, but walking over to here made me kinda tired too. Maybe I'm just not used to being this small.\"<br>\r\nThe last conversation that stood out to me was I saw a girl I recognized. Rachel and I used to be flyers, when I was still the second smallest girl on the team at 5'1\", before my growth spurt, and we were super into it. After I grew past all the girls, I quit since I didn't want to be a tall cheerleader cause I couldn't be a flyer. Rachel and I saw this one girl who was only 4'7\" and cheers for her school through a viral picture where she standing between the two tallest girls at her school (pic for reference:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.sammielitten.com/uploads/5/8/3/6/58360217/9815535_orig.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sammielitten.com/uploads/5/8/...</a>). I kinda wanted to go say hi to her since I knew who she was and I follow her on social media, so when we paid the check, Rachel and I went together. We introduced ourselves to her and when she stood up to talk to us, my heart sank as I realized I was shorter than even her. I had thought I was 4'8\" but surely enough 4'7\" Sammie Litten had more size on me easily, by a rough estimate of two inches. We talked for a bit but in the back of my mind I was kinda freaking out. Not wanting to be rude, we said bye to her so she could go back with her friends, but before I left I had to ask.<br>\r\n\"Say, are you sure you're only 4'7\"\u2026?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, 4'7\" and a half! How about you?\"<br>\r\n\"I was under the impression I was 4'8\", but clearly not!\" Sammie told us that she is staying at the same hotel as us for the same event and that'd she'd love to meet up so we can talk more about cheerleading.<br>\r\nOnce we left I was really curious how small I became, so I made it our mission to find a tape measure. We made it back to the hotel and Sierra thought of checking the front desk to see if a maintenance employee would have one, and luckily enough he did. <br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026 only 4'6!\" Rachel said. \"A whole foot!\"<br>\r\nSince it was getting late, we talked about it on the way to our room. We decided to head to Megan and my room to talk a little more. Rachel was kind enough to let me borrow some pajamas, which where a little big on me since it was for her size.  We all wanted to talk more, the moment I laid down on that bed, I passed out.</span></div></div>",
