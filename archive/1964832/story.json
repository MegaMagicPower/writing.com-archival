You know the old saying, be careful what you wish for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re too stuffy Chris. Those old sayings are just outdated hogwash. Nothing but a series of coincidences that created them in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI sighed and dropped the subject. I wouldn\u2019t be able to change her mind. I never could. She was too much of what people would call a free spirit. She got a thought in her head and ran with it. Said she wanted to live out her high school life to its fullest. I had forgotten how long I had been here protecting her from the trouble she got into. How long I have secretly loved her. She didn\u2019t see me as a romantic interest and that hurt. She had already rejected me multiple times. But I was just a fool looking for punishment because I still stayed by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI squeezed my fist, staring at it as we walked home from school. I had gotten strong in order to protect her. But it wasn\u2019t enough. It was never enough. There were always stronger people out there. Always those faster than me. I was good, but I wasn\u2019t a god. She didn\u2019t know about all the training I had put my body through, all the fights I had fought for her. She didn\u2019t need to know. She probably wouldn\u2019t care if she did. Probably yell at me for fighting. Because that was just the way she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut I would accept her disapproval. Accept the lies I was living for her sake. If it meant I could let her live. If it meant I could keep harm from coming to her. Even if she didn\u2019t love me, I still loved her. I would be her shield and her sword. I would be the buffer between her and the rest of the world. It was the only thing I could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI smiled wistfully as she hurried ahead of me to smell some pink flowers like she always did. Her long blond hair trailing behind her like a cloak. Her chest almost bursting out of the school uniform and the edges of her skirt flapping in the wind. I tried to sneak a peak at her panties but of course it never happened just like every other time. It was like some unseen hand was teasing me. Lifting it up so much and then holding it down right before the moment of exposure came. Still, at least I got to appreciate her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<b><i>\u201cI will speak with you like this while we watch this story of mortals unfold. Conveying extra knowledge and adding my insights for your pleasure. Already I find these two interesting. They are not like other people though I do not know why. They are not gods, and they are not children that I created inhabiting their body. Yet they disrupt the flow of the world. They are a part of it and yet apart from it, creating ripples with their very existence. Most curious. I did not realize this until I focused on them. It was but happenstance that I chose this spot for our little game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhoops. It seems I have already given away a hint by admitting neither one of these two are gods, therefore they cannot be me. I must be more careful in the future. I cannot make this game too easy for you. Otherwise where would the fun be in it for me? Now, shall we continue to watch this story unfold? Oh and I shall make this kid friendly. In case of foul language I shall use my power to block it from your mind. I will not taint you more than you already are. Now, on to the story!\u201d</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Chris! Hey! Hey! Want to come over to my place? Mom\u2019s making hamburger tonight. She was asking about you the other day too. Wondering why you haven\u2019t come over as often. And my little brother wants to know when you two can play video games again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d like that Chel. But I have a few things I need to do first. How about you run on ahead and I will see you in a little bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you got to do huh? You live alone and you aren\u2019t in any clubs. So where are you always heading off to in secret? I know! You\u2019re like some secret agent in disguise aren\u2019t you? Like in those anime. A high school student by day and a crime fighting giant robot pilot by night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah you caught me. I\u2019m a regular superhero. I work for a secret government agency fighting off aliens from outer space in robots as tall as a house. We wipe everyone\u2019s memories after every attack and fill in all the holes we create when the enemy explodes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSweet! I knew it! Will you take me on a ride in your mech then? Just a quick waltz around the world fighting the bad guys? A little spice to the day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can do that. And have you home in time for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChel whirled around on one foot laughing gaily. Hopping and skipping around me before wrapping her <br>\r\narms around my neck from behind and pressing herself against my back. I felt her weight as she let her knees drop a bit and braced myself so she wouldn\u2019t pull me over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s why I like you Chris. You\u2019re always willing to play along with my wild imagination. You don\u2019t think I\u2019m weird or look sideways at the strange things I say either. You accept me for who I am. I\u2019m glad you are my best friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah friends forever. Nothing more, nothing less.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cExactly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe pushed herself away from me and skipped ahead while I fought down the lump in my throat. Friend zoned again. Sometimes her callous words could really hurt. It was like she didn\u2019t remember my confessions at all. Though in truth she probably didn\u2019t. She waved goodbye as she ran off down the street. I simply waved back until she was out of sight. Once I was sure she wouldn\u2019t come running back on some whim I turned and headed for the group of boys that had been following us since the school building. I knew what they were after, a rematch. I had no problems with giving them all a beat down yet again. Ten or ten hundred, I would protect Chel no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<b><i>\u201cOh now this is quite interesting. We have two divergent paths here. One a boy with unrequited love and a self appointed mission, the other a ditzy girl clueless to the world around her. Seemingly unconcerned with the feelings of the one closest to her. So now then, tell me dear viewer, you are god. Or at least you have a portion of my power. Following both of them at the same time is too much for you right now. But you may follow one or the other. So which one do you chose? Which one shall you follow? The boy? Or the girl?\u201d<br>\r\n</i></b></span></div></div>",

Far be it from me to judge your tastes. Oh I know, it\u2019s the whole driven hero you like huh? That bad boy behind the smiles. Well it was your choice, lets see what interesting things he might get into.\u201d</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t you guys ever give up? This is what, the fourth time now? Just accept the beatings you already got and back off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe got us a secret weapon this time. My brother\u2019s friend goes to another school and he got the meanest, baddest, strongest guy there for us. With him on our side there aint no way we can lose!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGeez. Do you even hear yourself? You sound like a bad TV show. Isn\u2019t it about time you grew up and moved on? We aren\u2019t in middle school anymore you know. Getting someone else to fight your battles for you is like saying I\u2019m going to get my big brother after you. If you want to fight me that\u2019s fine. But do it with your own strength. Otherwise what\u2019s the point?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s strength I use! As long as I get to knock that cocky smirk of your face and ground you into the dust I\u2019ll use any means necessary!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let out a sigh as I pulled the fingerless glove out of my pocket and slid my right hand into it. Once that was done I shoved my left hand back into my pocket, hooking the edge with the web between my thumb and index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right, bring him out then. Let\u2019s get this over with quickly. I\u2019ve got other places I need to be. It\u2019s been a while since I had hamburger steak and I don\u2019t want to miss it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI motioned with my fingers at them after extending my right arm. The leader of this group, Yushihito, grinned and called for someone to come out. A big burly boy who stood at least a head and a half taller then me at around six foot five stepped into the deserted parking lot from the sidewalk. He walked up to me and looked me in the eye, sizing me up and down. I gave him the same once over, assessing his strength and skill like he was assessing mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA runt like you is my opponent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBetter than having my head in the clouds and unable to see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t look so tough to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s just because you are too weak. You aren\u2019t able to grasp just how strong I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe grunted and pulled back his fist. As he let it fly forward I cocked back my own right hand and let fly to meet him. At the last moment we slowed our punches down and gave a fist pound in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood to see you again Richard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSame to you Chris. Thanks again for that help you gave me last month. You were right, Amy loved it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTold you. Girls dig the romantic stuff. A bit of soft music, a fancy dinner. Just make them feel they are the only one in the world and that day was created just for them and they are like putty. But I only helped you patch things up for her birthday remember. It\u2019s up to you to keep it together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know. I might be a bit slow but I aint dumb. I learned my lesson. By the way, got an extra pair of tickets to Rising Zombies next Saturday. Want \u2018em?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I was going to take Amy but she has plans with her folks and I was never big into them like she was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen hell yeah I\u2019ll take \u2018em!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCool. See you tomorrow for our study session?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll make sure you ace that make-up test.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRichard grinned and waved farewell, turning to leave the parking lot. Yushihito put his hand on his arm to stop him. Richard looked at him with a raised eyebrow but the boy was too stupid to back off. That was the problem with these kinds of people. Always feeling they had something to prove. Feeling a need to act bad or cool all the time. To the point that common sense and brains just flew out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait a minute! We paid you! You\u2019re supposed to kick his *** for us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh that\u2019s right. You guys did pay me. But he\u2019s cool. I don\u2019t need your money anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe dug into his pocket and tossed a small wad of bills in the boys direction. Yushihito fumbled it in the air a moment before catching it and looking at Richard in surprise. I began pulling my glove off as I called after his retreating back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou still doing that whole payment for a roughing up shtick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe didn\u2019t even turn as he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course. It shows me they are serious. If I listened to every butt hurt idiot wanting me to fight their battles I\u2019d never get any sleep. See ya tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could see Yushihito\u2019s face getting red at being embarrassed in front of his little gang. It was only six boys aside from him so I wasn\u2019t that worried. I thought he would be smart enough to know when to back down. Even a punk like him had to know when to run and fight another day. But his next words showed just how stupid he really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGet them both! No one plays us like that! Make them regret it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis gang all picked up baseball bats and lead pipes they had been hiding behind the cars and charged at us. One of them swung at Richard as he was turning around. He caught it in his left hand and gave the boy a mighty right uppercut with his ham sized fist. The punk was knocked senseless as he flew through the air straight towards me. Deftly I stepped to the side and timed my blow, doing a spinning jump kick as he came down. My attack hit him in the small of his back and sent him flying into two more punks that were charging at me. As I landed I knelt down a moment before shoving off while spinning on the heel of my foot. I caught a third punk under the chin with my knee before turning to find my next opponent. Richard had finished off the other two henchmen, leaving only the leader quivering in his boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell it looks like the score is tied three-three. That one there is the tiebreaker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRock-paper-scissors for him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNah. I\u2019ve already slapped him around three times already. You can have him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe grinned and cracked his knuckles as I turned and left the parking lot. If I hurried I could stop at the store and grab some cake or something to take over to Chel\u2019s house. I tuned out the screams of pain coming from the lot behind me, whistling a tune I had heard once a long time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe tune caught in my throat as an image of brown eyes flashed through my mind. Eyes that belonged to the singer of that tune. It had been a long time since I had thought about her. I wonder how she was doing now. Did she even still remember me? Did she even remember Chel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shook my head and put those kinds of thoughts out of my mind. History had proven it did no good to dwell on such things. It only made me hurt inside for no benefit. I had chosen my path just as she had. Those paths just happened to go separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter a few more steps the memories faded and I began whistling again. Though not her song this time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThe door opened only seconds after I knocked. Mr. Winter greeted me like a long lost son like he always did and ushered me into the house. I grinned at him as I slipped my shoes off and stepped up into the main hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHoney! I\u2019m home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMr. Winter chuckled at my usual exclamation. I was expecting Chel to come out like she normally did and try to glomp me. Then we would banter back and forth a moment or two and we would all move on with the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBur Chel didn\u2019t appear. That was odd. It had never happened before. Billy did come running down the steps though, launching himself from the last step to squeeze me around the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBro!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ruffled his hair as he grinned up at me. He was pretty tall at fourteen, though he had yet to go through a growth spurt. His head coming up barely to the middle of my chest. Another set of pounding feet on the stairs a moment later and another boy was standing in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBro, this is Sam, a friend from school. Sam this is Chris. He isn\u2019t really my brother but he\u2019s cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe put his hand next to his mouth and whispered loud enough so everyone could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe likes my sister. It\u2019s only a matter of time until he becomes my brother for real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think your sister might have something to say about that squirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ll win her over. And I\u2019ll help. Just tell me what you want me to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ruffled his hair again as we shared a conspiratorial wink as Mrs. Winter came out of the kitchen wiping her hands. She smiled when she saw me as well, opening her arms and inviting me into a hug which I accepted. Everything else was normal about this visit, so why did I feel so uneasy all of a sudden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChel is finishing up in the kitchen dear. Dinner will be ready in about an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSweet! Then you can help us with our homework right? And then we can play Splat after dinner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBilly began tugging on my arm and pulling me upstairs and I let him. I didn\u2019t mind helping with homework but I told him we would have to see about video games afterwards. He didn\u2019t seem to hear me but that wasn\u2019t unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore I knew it I was in his room sitting on his bed while him and Sam plopped down in chairs at his desk. But instead of starting into the papers in front of him he swung around to face me, pulling his feet up onto the seat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI heard you confessed to sis and she shot you down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI heard you wanted me to help you with your homework.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPfft. I don\u2019t need no help. This stuff is easy. I just wanted to hear the dirt on your confession.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLittle busybody aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on tell me please? Maybe give me some tips on what to do? Or not to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat? Got your eyes on someone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMaybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo I told him how it happened. How I had gone with the standard confession in an empty classroom after school. And her just as quick reply. He asked a few questions and I answered as best I could. From the direction of his questions he did have someone he liked and wanted to ask out. I finally just told him to go for it. There was no \u201cperfect\u201d time and place. If he waited to say anything it would end up being too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDinner\u2019s ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced at the door in surprise. Had it really been an hour already? I always seemed to lose track of time while I was here. Everyone just made me feel like I belonged when I came over. But I couldn\u2019t forget myself. Couldn\u2019t get too comfortable. I had to keep my distance if I wanted to keep Chel from getting hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnly half my mind was on my surroundings as I followed Billy down the steps and into the dining room. The other half was mulling over the uneasiness that kept growing inside of me. Chel hadn\u2019t even come upstairs to say hi. She might have been busy with dinner but she would have normally found time to see me, if even for a moment. This wasn\u2019t how things were supposed to be. Had something happened between the time I had left her until now? Had I somehow done something to upset her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPass the potatoes please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter handing over the bowl I cut another piece of meat off and stuck it in my mouth. Why wouldn\u2019t she look me in the eyes? In fact she seemed to act like I wasn\u2019t even here. This was not how it was supposed to be. I needed to get to the bottom of this. Needed to fix this somehow. But I couldn\u2019t worry anyone else. I could already see them all looking sideways at me because I was so silent. I wasn\u2019t acting normal either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"This is good Mrs. W. Been a while since I had hamburger steak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease how many times have I told you to call me mom. I mean you\u2019re practically family anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut I\u2019m not family yet so I don\u2019t feel right calling you mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s never going to be family so you should just drop it mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChel\u2019s reply, while more like her normal retort, lacked the usual vibrancy and cheerfulness she usually had. I dropped the subject and simply finished eating, having a bit of small talk but otherwise keeping quiet. Once dinner was over I helped clear the table before helping Mrs. Winter wash dishes. She shooed me away after only a moment, saying it was her job not mine. That I was a guest. I feigned being hurt by her words but left her to her own devices when she giggled at my theatrics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHeading upstairs I ran into Chel who looked away as she tried to slip past to go downstairs. I snagged her arm before she could go anywhere and forced her to look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you Chel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t give me that line of bull. You\u2019ve been avoiding me since I got here. You were the one who invited me over remember? You haven\u2019t been acting at all like yourself. So spill it. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe pulled her arm out of my grasp. \u201cI said nothing was wrong! Just drop it all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she again tried to slip past me I barred her path with a hand against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot good enough. I\u2019ve known you too long and there is something bugging you. Is it something I said or did? Somebody threaten you? Tell me. I have this uneasy pit in my stomach and I can\u2019t just let this drop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust leave me alone already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t leave you alone! I\u2019m your friend Chel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut you don\u2019t want to be right! You want to be more and I don\u2019t! Everybody wants us to be more. Always saying we should hook up. Making offhand comments about how you are part of the family! It never stops! That\u2019s the problem! Why don\u2019t you all just drop it! I bet you are still acting like my friend because you think it will help you get in my pants!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slapped her across the face before she could go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStop talking right there. I like you. I won\u2019t deny that. You saying you didn\u2019t want to go out didn\u2019t suddenly change that fact. But I\u2019m happy being your friend if that\u2019s all you want. I\u2019ll get over you eventually and I will find someone else. But that doesn\u2019t change the facts. Whether we date or not you are still my friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe reached up and rubbed her cheek while looking at me in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou hit me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I\u2019ll do it again if you keep talking stupid like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI bet you don\u2019t even love me anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was only a mumble but I heard it as she looked away from me with downcast eyes. I couldn\u2019t hold myself back anymore. My emotions were already high and those words were like a stab through the heart. I grabbed her shoulders suddenly, making her look at me in surprise. Before she could react I planted my lips on hers and pulled her in close. I could feel her rigid body in my arms as I tried to convey my feelings to her in that single kiss. Finally I pulled away and stared into her beautiful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat is how much I love you. Even if you forget it I never will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe blinked at me a moment before tearing herself out of my embrace and running downstairs. I watched her pass her mom and dad who were looking up at us around the banister with grins on their faces. She ran to the door and slipped on her shoes before racing into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard a creaking behind me and turned in time to see Billy and Sam opening the bedroom door wider, their faces still peeking around the frame. When Billy noticed me looking at him he whistled and gave me a thumbs up sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAren\u2019t you going to chase after her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I said my piece. She needs time to be alone and sort it out herself. I don\u2019t want to push her too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s my big brother, the ladies man. I want to be just like you when I grow up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo you don\u2019t. You have no idea how lucky you have it squirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI headed downstairs to slip on my shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think it best if I go home now. I doubt she will want to see me when she gets back. Let her know I\u2019m going to drop the matter. I know how she feels about me and I would like to go back to normal tomorrow. I didn\u2019t mean to actually kiss her, but I\u2019m not sorry I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t see any of us complaining do you? Maybe that will wake her up and she will finally admit she likes you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave them a final parting wave before heading off down the street towards my house. Things were about to change. I could feel it in my bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<b><i>\u201cOh yeah, things just got steamy up in here. This Chris is a regular smooth operator. A little rough around the edges but give him a few years and he could have all the women falling for him. I really want to see what happens to him next. But I also want to know what Chel is thinking. Ok, that\u2019s a bit of a lie, I already know what they are both thinking, but you don\u2019t. I can\u2019t give away too much as long as you are around. So I am trying to act more human for you. So you can identify with me more. Is it working? Well what will you choose?\u201d</i></b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI glanced around the block to make sure no one was following me. This wasn\u2019t the day someone was supposed to break into my house but with the way the rest of the night had gone I wouldn\u2019t take anything for granted. Something wasn\u2019t right here. The normal course of events had been thrown off. This was the fifty or sixtieth time I had seen everything unfold now and not once had it unraveled like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slid my fingers over the top of the door frame until I touched the hidden switch. Only after pushing down on it to disarm the explosives did I open the door. Once safely inside I touched the switch on the inside lintel to rearm them, locking the door for good measure. I kicked my shoes off and dug into my pockets, laying their contents down on the stand next to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>Always second guess and never assume. That is the one unbroken rule to staying alive. I can\u2019t stop you from making this choice. I hold no grudge against you so I will give you this advice to do with what you will. If you truly wish to protect her then do it with all your might. Do not feel anything you do is too low to stoop. Become a monster that all other monsters fear to cross. That is how you survive and that is how you will ultimately be able to protect her. If you balk or think something is distasteful to do, that is when you are sunk. That will be the undoing and will end up hurting or even killing her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis words echoed in my mind as powerful as the day he said them to me. I thought of him as a second father. Even though I had not seen him in such a long time I still respected him. I had imagined growing up to be just like him. In all honesty if it hadn\u2019t been for the skills he had drilled into me I would have probably been killed many times over by now. Hand to hand, strategy, knives, guns, speed, strength. He had taught all of that and more to me. And now I could use it to protect Chel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I sat on the couch and flicked on the TV I pulled up my left pant leg pulling out the gun holstered there. Double checking to make sure the safety was still on. Once I was sure it wouldn\u2019t fire on accident and it still had a full clip, I sat it on the coffee table in front of me. I stomped the floor with my boot and the knife flicked out of the tip. I hit the heel again to retract the blade. I had just oiled the mechanism yesterday but you could never bee too sure. Once that was taken care of I slipped the knife out from under my right pant leg and began sharpening it on the whetstone I had left on the table this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTomorrow was the turning point. The time when things would start going to hell in a hand basket. When the alliances would start to form and this city would become a war zone. I would protect Chel just like I always did. I would make sure she didn\u2019t die. And I would become a monster that all other monsters fear to cross in order to do so. Even if that meant I had to disappear from her life. That our carefree days together were coming to a close. I had been down this road before. Seen the outcome a dozen times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFrom day one I had known what her answer would be. I had asked a dozen different ways in a dozen different places and always it was the same. It never changed what was going to happen. But still I couldn\u2019t help but try. Still I couldn\u2019t help but cherish the moments we had together. Cherish the moments she would remember me. I was part and yet apart from the flow of time here. The course of events that would transpire. In the end I would start over and we would meet for the first time again, we would be happy and carefree, and then the war would again break out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe were trapped, her and I. Living our own lives, our own lies. Never moving forward past the last day of school. Doomed to repeat the same days over and over. Repeat the same mistakes, the same words with only little variation. In those times when I was a part of her life we would always be nothing but friends. In the ones where I only followed her from the shadows I wasn\u2019t even a memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt had been so hard seeing her live over and over. Loving her so much but not having her remember me. Not having her remember the passion we had shared. To see her stare at me blankly as we passed each other on the street. I had been told to let her go. Told to move on. But I couldn\u2019t. I was a fool in love. It had been so long since I had kissed her like that. Since I held her in my arms as she molder herself to my body. I could still taste her lips on mine. That taste igniting distant memories. I hadn\u2019t meant to kiss her, but I was glad I had. It reminded me of what I was fighting for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI finished sharpening the knife, testing it on a scrap of paper and nodded to myself when it cut it like soft butter. It would cut human flesh just as easily. Slamming it back home in its sheath I got up, heading to the locked room in the back. My fingers slipped behind the nearby painting to pull out the key. A quick turn and I was inside. As I flicked on the light I looked at the photo on the desk next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEvening mom, evening dad. Uncle Chris. You all probably think I\u2019m stupid don\u2019t you? You\u2019d probably laugh to see me now. Well maybe you wouldn\u2019t. You all went through some amazing adventures together and overcame worse trials then this. You understand these feelings don\u2019t you? Probably better then I understand them myself. Will you give me strength just one more time? Help me bear it once again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was no answer of course. There never was. But their grins said it all. Their static smiles gave me confidence. I nodded my head to them before turning to the room at large. I ignored the far wall that I had covered with a list of all the events that had and would take place. All the pins and strings of interconnected happenings of cause and effect that made up this world up until school ended. The pitfalls, the ambushes, the hotspots that could put Chel in danger. All there for me to keep her from dying. To put an end to trouble before she walked into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tInstead I focused on the other three walls filled with every and any weapon someone could imagine and some that only existed because I wanted them to. I had to be prepared for tomorrow. And for the day after. And the day after that.  I already knew who the big bad was. The great evil I would end up fighting. But simply walking up and killing him would do no good. I had already tried that tactic three times. This world had ways to fix such glitches. Another big bad would pop up and things would continue on like always. So I would play my part and say my lines. Forever and ever. No matter how much I changed the story, it never moved on past that last day..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slipped a giant sword off the wall and swung it around a few times before hitting the switch under the hilt. The blade broke up and folded in on itself until all I held was a small dagger. Another flick of the button restored it to its regular size. I laid it to the side as I reached for a sawed off shotgun. Hefting it in my hand a moment I finally discarded it as too bulky. Maybe save it for next week when the puppet master showed up. Though I could use the spring loaded knife launcher. Many people were going to die tomorrow, but Chel wouldn\u2019t be one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\t\u201cOh interesting. By the sounds of it, it seems like he is a descendant of Conolaunis. Of course you would know him better as Chrono, the god of time. He got my power to travel back and forth through time as he wished. Giving him an ability akin to prophecy. It seems he is quite smitten with this girl, to repeat this time over and over. But even he cannot easily cheat death. Surely he must have tried already and found just how hard it is. If a person is fated to die then they have no choice but to die at their appointed time. Replaying the timeline can\u2019t change that so easily. The only one of my children with that power aside from me is the one you call the grim reaper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \u201cWhy don\u2019t I save this girl from dying if I have such power you ask? Well why should I? What is the life of a mere mortal to me? Everything has its time and place. She is fated to die. In a sense she has already died. Messing with the balance of things isn\u2019t an easy matter, even for a god. That is why it is simply easier for me to observe and not get involved. Well, not get involved until I am bored anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n</b></i></span></div></div>",

So she won\u2019t be going to school today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI understand Mrs. W. Make sure to let her know that I hope she gets better soon. Also to stay away from the church over on Peach for a few days. I heard they have a bit of an asbestos problem and are cleaning it up. I don\u2019t want her breathing any of it in by accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to let her know. Have a good day at school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTurning from the front door I headed off down the street with Billy next to me. He started talking about a video game and I tuned him out with half my mind. Putting that part to work on what I had to do today. In all honesty her not going to school actually worked in my favor. Even though this was not the way things were supposed to go it was just a minor glitch. It wouldn\u2019t affect the course of events that much. But now that she had decided to play hooky from school I didn\u2019t have to start an argument with the class president as an excuse to ditch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat was a pretty bold move last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmm? Oh yeah it was. I didn\u2019t really plan on doing it. It sort of\u2026 just happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey bro. Do\u2026 do you think\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo? What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou were just going to ask if I could teach you how to kiss like that or something along those lines.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2026 I was not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh? My mistake then. What were you going to say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2026I was going to say do you think my sister will want to go out with you now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure that was what you were going to ask. I total believe you. Good recovery though. So I\u2019ll give you an A. But it is a good question. Honestly it could go either way. She could either want to go out or never want to see me again. Besides kissing isn\u2019t something you can really be taught, you just got to learn it on your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe walked on in silence for a bit until we came to the bridge a few blocks from Peach street. Even during the normal course of events Chel would be in school when things went down there. Still I had to warn her away because you could never be too careful. A quick glance at my watch told me I had about half an hour before I needed to be at the church, plenty of time. As Billy turned onto the bridge I noticed a girl waiting there. To most it would look like she had seemingly stopped to look down into the river, but I knew. Even if I hadn\u2019t seen this scene multiple times. She was waiting for Billy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced over at the boy and saw the bit of star struck wonder in his eyes. The whole look of being <br>\r\naround someone you have a crush on. I could see the girl glancing sideways at him as well, the same bit of infatuation glimmering behind her locks of hair. I pulled the boy to the side and knelt in front of him, whispering so only he could hear me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask her to walk home with you today? I\u2019ll be a bit late so I won\u2019t be able to meet up with you like I normally do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cW-what are you talking about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh don\u2019t play dumb. You like her and I bet she likes you too. Perhaps she will let you practice kissing with her eh? But you got to start somewhere. Walking her home will get you a lot of points with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut I can\u2019t do that! I get tongue tied when I am around her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stood up and let him go. As he caught up to her on the bridge and the two of them turned to walk to school I called after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Billy! Aren\u2019t you going to introduce me to your girlfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s not my girlfriend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe was turning beet red as he spun around to face me, his shoulders hunched a bit. I simply grinned at him as the girl also turned around blushing and looking away. Finally he held out his hand as if showcasing her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is Rachael. She\u2019s just a friend from school. Rachael this is Chris. He\u2019s sort of like my big brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a smile and a polite bow, a favor which I returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMay I ask where you live?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOver by the high school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerfect! I need to stay a bit late there today and I usually go home with Billy. His mom doesn\u2019t like him walking home alone you see. So would it be ok if he walks you home today? Then it will be a hop skip and a jump to my school where he can wait for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could see Billy miming frantically behind her and I had a hard time keeping my face straight so as not to give him away. The girl blushed a bit before nodding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t mind. My mom would feel better that I was walking home with someone too. She doesn\u2019t like that I walk to school alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGreat! It\u2019s settled. I\u2019ll treat you both to some ice cream someday for doing me this favor. It was a pleasure to meet you Rachael.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned and jogged off, letting the two of them go on their way, grinning like a fool. Even after all this time I still had the capacity to do things like this instead of simply observing. That was a good thing. It meant I wasn\u2019t too jaded. As I passed the church I scoped out the area, doubling back after a block to sneak up on it from behind. I knew from previous times the front was guarded but the back had almost no one. I knew I probably shouldn\u2019t get involved in all of this. But I was tired of simply watching it all happen. Besides this was one of the key points. If I neutralize this group now, Chel wouldn\u2019t be in danger later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was about to break from cover and make a dash to the back door when two men in ski masks came out. This had never happened before. This was more then just a small glitch in the system. This was altering the timeline completely. First yesterday and now this, just what was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two of them were talking to each other in undertones. As they drew closer to the bushes I was hiding in, one of them turned to the other to laugh. Using this opportunity I sprang out of hiding,clamping a hand on each of their throats, triggering the quick release blades against my wrists to snap open.  I dragged them both into the darkness of the bushes as they gave their last gurgling attempts at sound. Retracting the blades just as quickly as I had inserted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI couldn\u2019t completely trust in what I knew now. Someone or something was manipulating the timelines and throwing them off. I had to be extra careful. For all I knew this church would go up in flames any second now and not in another forty minutes. I made sure my gun\u2019s safety was off before silently opening the back door and slipping inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEmpty. Just like it should be. This was the basement of the church. A big empty room with a small kitchen area. A stage to the left where they had probably held Christmas shows or something and three steps in front of me and to the right leading up to a small walled off second floor. Then two sets of stairs, one right next to me and one on the raised floor leading up to the main part of the church. It all looked normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTo anyone who didn\u2019t know any better. This church had once been part of an underground network that housed refugees and slaves. There were catacombs peppering the  foundation of the building that had been long forgotten about. I made my way up to the raised floor and over to a janitors closet. Ignoring the strong stench of cleaning solution that assaulted my nostrils, I headed straight for the back wall where I turned the emergency water cut off switch. After that I popped the cold water  knob off and shoved in on the exposed metal pin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe entire wall behind the tub inset into the floor swung silently away from me. Allowing me to proceed down the now revealed stairs. When I got to the bottom I palmed my .45, double checking to make sure the silencer was securely fastened. There would be two guards. One to the left and one to the right of the door. Ten seconds was all I needed. Turn, aim, shoot. Just like the last four times I had done this. I took a deep breath and swung around the wall with my weapon raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnly to find the two guards unconscious on the floor already. I lowered my weapon only slightly. This was new. This had never happened before. I quickly moved up on them in a crouch, feeling their necks and finding a pulse. Not dead. Whoever had done this must not have had the stomach to finish the job. I put the gun to the first guys head and fired before moving to the second guard and doing the same thing. They were dead now. No chance of them waking up and screwing me over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        I pushed open the door with the barrel of my gun, ready to shoot at a moments notice. I spied someone standing about five foot tall with black hair in front of the woman I had come to rescue. I aimed my weapon at the back of his head. Friend or foe, I couldn\u2019t take the chance. I had never seen him before and he had never been in this room any other time I had done this.  His back went rigid for a moment and I saw his shoulders tense. He grabbed Robin and threw himself to the floor just as I fired. As I swung my weapon down on him he raised his hands in surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t shoot! I\u2019m one of the good guys! I\u2019m here to rescue the girl. I assume that\u2019s what you are here for as well? Your names Chris right? He said you might come. I\u2019m Yuki Kamishiro. But we can save the explanations for later. Right now we need to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No one was supposed to show up for another five minutes, but with the way things were going I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone jumped out of the ground in front of me yelling happy birthday. Who was this guy anyway? He was no part of this timeline. No part of any timeline that I had lived through anyway. But I could afford to make a temporary alliance with him. I knew I could kill him later if he betrayed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey. Yuki right? How\u2019d you take out the guards anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI just slipped up behind them and hit them on the back of the neck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you know martial arts huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I\u2019m not much of a fighter at all. I just\u2026 know how to effectively defend myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo need. Incapacitating them was all that was needed. Besides, I don\u2019t like to kill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou ever kill anyone before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026 No.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I took care of them for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou mean you killed them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. I\u2019ve learned not to leave potential threats alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced back to see him looking at the floor a moment as he swallowed. I noticed the hand gripping the knife was ghost white from the pressure he was exerting. He hesitated only a moment before cutting the last of Robin\u2019s bonds. She lost no time in pulling the gag out of her mouth and looking at me a bit wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChris! Just what the hell is going on here? I suddenly get kidnapped, blindfolded and brought to this dingy underground room. Where are we and just who are you to talk about killing people so easily?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo time for explanations. Leave it at they want your brother\u2019s power and they kidnapped you to get it. But this place is dangerous. The people who took you are in a war with another group who will send this place up in flames shortly. We need to get out now. So just keep quiet and follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe started to say something else and the Kamishiro fellow silenced her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s right. There\u2019s more to the story obviously but he covered it in a nutshell. This place is going to explode in about ten minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n\tTen? It wasn\u2019t supposed to explode for another thirty. Did he know something I didn\u2019t? I had no time to think of that now. We just had to get moving. I led the two of them out into the hall. Yuki turned slightly green at seeing the dead bodies and so did Robin. I ignored them both, expecting them to stick close, something they had no problem doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou got a weapon aside from that knife?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I don\u2019t need any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat won\u2019t fly with me. I\u2019d feel safer if you had something to defend yourself with at range. Not all enemies will let you get close enough for a karate chop to the neck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grabbed the barrel with my hand and held out the butt of the pistol for him to grab. He put his hands up in the air and shook his head quickly. With a sigh I grabbed his right hand and shoved the weapon into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally easy. Just point in the general direction and pull the trigger. It doesn\u2019t matter right now if you hit anything or not. They will take cover as long as it is pointing in their general direction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFor a moment he seemed more afraid of my contact than the gun itself. He slowly blinked and looked down at his hand in surprise and back at me, his mouth opening and closing but no sound coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re just like him! I can\u2019t see you! You exist but at the same time you don\u2019t! You\u2019re outside the flow of time!\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy insides went cold at his words. How did he know that? And who was this other person I was like? No time for that now. Concentrate on escaping you idiot. Peeking around the corner I saw two men coming down the stairs. This much at least was still the same. I motioned with my hands for them to stay here and they nodded their heads that they understood. Slipping my fingers up under my shirt I pulled out two throwing knives that were laying against my sides. Flipping them and holding the tips gently. I silently counted out the seconds. At ten I sprinted around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBoth of them had their backs to me, pointing off down into the darkness of another tunnel. I let fly with both blades, the first one embedding into the back of the one on the lefts neck. But the second one missed as the other guy suddenly moved. Couldn\u2019t anything go exactly as it was supposed to today? As the first body dropped and the guy who had gotten lucky began to turn I stomped on the heel of my right foot seconds before bringing it up and around to crash into the side of his head. He stared at me in surprise before the life drained out of him. With a slightly wet sucking sound I pulled the blade out of his ear and retracted it back into my boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tQuickly I retrieved my dagger from the first mans neck, wiping it off on his shirt before gathering the other two. They took one look at the bodies on the floor and then looked away, trying to not see them through force of will. Leading them upstairs I peeked through the eyehole to make sure no one would see us exiting. When I was sure it was clear we entered the janitors closet. I could hear sounds of fighting coming from upstairs. The clash of steel on steel and the sounds of gunfire. Thirty seconds. We needed to wait thirty seconds. Slipping my hand up my pant leg I pulled out another gun. This one had no silencer so I needed to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAt exactly thirty seconds the knob on the door began to turn. I shoved on it hard, smacking the woman opening it in the face. As she reeled back I dashed out of the closet and stuck the weapon under her chin, pulling the trigger. Luckily my gunshot was covered by the sound of what sounded like a sub machine gun going off upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan you see the future too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou could say that I guess. Though this is a future I have never seen. Now enough chatter. We aren\u2019t out of here yet. Now we run.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe three of us ran for all we were worth to the door. I easily outpaced them, yanking the door open just as they got there. Yuki suddenly turned around and fired his weapon, clipping the man who was just coming down the far stairs in the leg. He gave a short cry of pain as he fell. As he was getting back up I put a bullet between his eyes. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be there either. Ushering them out the back door I slammed it shut behind me. It only took a few moments after that to get a few blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThought you said you had never shot a gun before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell that was a pretty accurate shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI knew he was going to be there, I saw where I had to aim. It was nothing special.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNext time aim for the heart, head, or throat. Shoot to kill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t want there to be a next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSuit yourself. But that kind of thinking will get you killed one of these days. But now that we are out of the woods for the moment, how bout you tell me just what the hell is going on. Why were you there? Who am I just like? Why is the timelines so screwed up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy phone began to buzz in my pocket and I let out a sigh of displeasure as I pulled it out. I had to do a double take as it showed the tracer I had planted in Chel\u2019s cell phone running straight for the church.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGod **** stupid woman! Can\u2019t she follow just a simple request? Why now of all times!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at Yuki and then at Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGet out of here. I\u2019ll find you later. And when I do I want answers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen Yuki went to hand me the gun back I shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKeep it. You might need it later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I headed off back to the church, making a beeline for the tracer position. When I rounded the corner I saw a woman let go of Chel and begin running off down the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know. She said she was my mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked again at the now empty street, narrowing my eyes in speculation. No it couldn\u2019t be. It wasn\u2019t possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you know her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo\u2026 She just reminded me of someone I once knew. Anyways what are you doing here? I thought I told you not to come around the church for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI could ask you the same thing. What are you doing here? Shouldn\u2019t you be in school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shrugged. \u201cI ditched. Just like you did. But that still doesn\u2019t answer my question, why are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe opened her mouth to answer when the street was rocked by a giant explosion. I braced my feet as Chel lost hers. I looked back quickly to see the church had indeed gone up in flames earlier then it was supposed to. I felt the adrenaline rushing through me. The thrill of battle underway. Perhaps I was a bit mad. Had a bit of what they called battle crazies. But I was ready for this war. This was my element. Where I felt most at home sometimes. But it was also the start of the end. Soon I would disappear from Chel\u2019s life yet again. Then it would start all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cOur friend Chris here is a bit of a killer isn\u2019t he? Puts a bit of a new twist on the phrase: a love to die for, don\u2019t you think? Or perhaps he has some\u2026 killer kisses? I wonder if perhaps he might have\u2026 jumped the gun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk, ok. I\u2019m done. Didn\u2019t think those were funny?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tWith a shake of my head I returned to the task at hand. Chelsea was starting to get to her feet when the sound of running footsteps made me turn around. Richard came upon us at a jog. What was he doing here? Just what was going on? Everything was following the timeline like it was supposed to, just faster then it was supposed to. The church wasn\u2019t supposed to explode for another twenty minutes, Richard wasn\u2019t supposed to come around here until then either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChel saw Richard and pointed at him in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou! You\u2019re the guy from last night! Richard Noel right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAye. And you\u2019re Chelsea Winters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait, you two know each other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah he walked me home last night after\u2026 after dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t know that trouble you were telling me about was Chris! If I had I would have given you better advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLike what you oversized muscle factory?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLike she should stay as far away from you as possible. That you are nothing but trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shook his hand with a smile on my face but inwardly I was grinding my teeth in confusion. Richard and Chel weren\u2019t supposed to meet for another three days. Once everything went to pot and I faked my own death. Then Richard was supposed to meet her for the first time and take care of her. Things were happening too fast and out of order. Just who was messing with the timeline? It was too much to just be coincidence or a few small glitches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what brings you out this way you big idiot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe pulled me off to the side and lowered his voice before telling me everything I already knew. About the Inquisition and them trying to use him to destroy half the town by kidnapping his sister. He didn\u2019t know he was being used to destroy half the town of course, but I did. That was the way this story was supposed to go. Before I altered it the first time and every time after that. I reassured him that his sister was safe , quickly telling him where she had been held prisoner before telling him to head over to First and Peach where I had last seen Robin heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks mate. I owe you big time for this. I don\u2019t know how you knew what was going down or how you pulled it off and I don\u2019t want to know. But you saved my sister so that makes anything you did A-Ok in my book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo worries. And if I don\u2019t see you again soon, keep safe and don\u2019t die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBack at you bro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI watched him run off, figuring this would be the last time I saw him. If things kept moving this quickly I would have to disappear today instead of a few days from now. Finally I turned to look at Chell who was staring up at the fire still going strong while the sounds of fire trucks kept getting closer. Grabbing her by the shoulders I forced her to look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChel. I want you to go home. Run as fast as you can and don\u2019t go outside for anything. For nothing you hear me! I don\u2019t care if someone will grant your every wish if you just step outside. Don\u2019t leave the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll go get Billy out of school and send him home too. Something big is going down. I don\u2019t know what but it is dangerous. I don\u2019t want you getting hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cO-Ok. You\u2019ll come home with Billy then right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course. I\u2019d hate to die and make you cry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head and turned to go. I couldn\u2019t help holding onto her arm, refusing to let her go for just a moment longer. She turned to look at me questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChel. Always remember that I love you. For now and forever. No matter what happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let her go then, turning and running off back towards the flames. If everything was going to happen like it was meant to then the middle school building would be the next to go. In the original timeline before I changed it all up, only a handful of kids would survive and Billy would not be one of them. His body would never be found, consumed in the explosion like so many others. But after seeing the way Chel had broken down that first time I couldn\u2019t bear to see it again. So I had saved him over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I passed the church a few stragglers laid around on the ground, having made it out of the actual blast but getting thrown by the force afterwards. I left them be. I wasn\u2019t interested in these throwaways that would be caught by the police or killed by someone else within the next ten minutes anyway. When one of them reached up and grabbed my ankle I reached behind my back, grabbing the handle of the knife there and hitting the switch under the hilt. As I swung it around the sword expanded out, slicing the mans arm off while making sparks on the sidewalk. I hit the trigger again, returning it to looking like a dagger on the upwards swing. A deft twirl and I shoved it back into its sheath without losing too much time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThough why hadn\u2019t the police station blown up yet? Or the jailhouse?  In fact why wasn\u2019t half the town in flames already? The church going up should have sparked a chain reaction, the Inquisition people had planted C-4 all over town spreading out from the church after all. This was like a completely new story. I didn\u2019t know what was going on anymore. All I could do was follow what I knew and adapt as I went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe middle school came into view before I knew it. The generic white washed fence surrounding the building and the closed and locked gate making it seem more like a prison then a place of learning. Especially with a guard inside the booth next tot the gate. I swerved right, heading for a tree planted near enough to the wall to be of use. As I ran I slid my belt buckle off. Pulling out a length of steel cable along with it. A quick swing of the arm and it looped around the branch. I hit the retract button as I ran up the trunk, jiggling the line loose at the last second to let the buckle snap back into place. Running along the branch I jumped just as it started to bow, landing safely on the flat wall top. From there it was a short hop to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn the normal timeline he would be in history class. But this wasn\u2019t the normal timeline. The church went up twenty minutes early, so I would assume the school would too. What class did he have before history? I didn\u2019t know. Wait! I did know! He had told me once, ten or twelve repeats ago. Gym! Outside sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI made a mad dash around the side of the building, skidding to a halt as the track and field area came into view. Looking around madly I finally found him, running around the track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIgnoring the shouts from teachers saying I wasn\u2019t supposed to be here and the guard that began chasing me with a nightstick in his hand I ran onto the field and caught up to Billy. As I passed him I snatched him up under my arm, ignoring his surprise and heading back to the wall out front. I could go for the walls in the back but  most of the explosion would fly that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cW-What? Bro! What are you doing? Let me go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cQuiet. I\u2019m saving your life. You aren\u2019t safe here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are you talking about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was panting a bit by the time we got to the wall. With a quick shove I boosted him to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat about the others?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t save them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe guard came up on me then as I told Billy to drop down and wait for me. He dropped to the other side as I turned to face my opponent. The nightstick swung at my head so I ducked under it. Kicking him in the back of the knee and shoving his head towards the ground. He instinctively held his hands out so he wouldn\u2019t smash his face into the dirt. I took advantage of that split second to use his back as a stepping stone, grabbing onto the top of the eight foot tall wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce safely perched on the top with the guard waving his stick uselessly at me, I took one last look at the school. Knowing almost two hundred people would die in this explosion alone. I saw a figure in a third story window looking out at me. Slightly graying hair, an eye patch over one eye and a muscular build. He had a commanding presence even at this distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt couldn\u2019t be him. It was impossible. Was he the mastermind behind all of this? First someone claiming to be Chel\u2019s mother and now him? Was that why everything was breaking down from what I knew? I had to find out. I had to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBilly. Go home without me. Stay inside all day no matter what. No matter what you see or hear just run straight home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTrust me. Now go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe ran. With only one last look he ran away. I watched him go for just a second before jumping off the wall onto the guards head, crushing his skull under my foot before running into the school building. I made it to the first stairwell and had my foot on the first step when the first bomb exploded. I heard them going off in order as those who had time to scream did so before being blown to bits.  I saw the far classroom door shoot outwards as the flames bubbled out. A second later the next classroom did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t have any time left. With a growl of frustration I threw myself over the railing and down the flight into the basement, smashing my hand down on the armlet hidden under my shirt up by my right shoulder. All I could do now was ride it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u201cOH MY\u2026 ME! He\u2019s dead! I can\u2019t believe he is dead! Well shows over, lets go check up on someone else shall we?

The fire suit had protected me from the heat of the explosion and the magnetic repulsion shield had stopped the brunt of the building from crushing me. If I had been more prepared for this I could have hunkered down to wait out the destruction better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tClimbing the demolished steps I shoved a bit of broken building out of the way, pulling myself out of my tomb. I was about to head towards the gate when I saw Chel standing there screaming her head off calling my name. What was she doing here? Why hadn\u2019t she gone home? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWait. This was good. I could vanish from her life now. It would make getting around easier. I wouldn\u2019t have to hide who I really was from her anymore. Wouldn\u2019t have to pretend to be just an ordinary high school student. So instead of coming out into the open, I kept hidden until she eventually left. Once she was gone I headed for the back wall, leaving the ruins of the school behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry Chel. It\u2019s better this way. I\u2019ll see you again in a few weeks when we start things from scratch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe couldn\u2019t hear my whispered words of farewell of course, but I imagined they still reached her. A police officer stopped me as I was walking away from the wreckage but I really didn\u2019t have time to deal with him. The time for playing the role of a high school student was over. This was now war. So I brushed his hand off my shoulder and kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        He reached out and grabbed my arm, starting to twist it behind my back saying I was coming with him. With a deft spin I reversed the hold, cranking his arm behind his back seconds before grabbing his neck and snapping it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHalt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked back to see another officer pointing a gun at me and sighed. I really didn\u2019t need this. I put my hands up in surrender as he came towards me. The moment he took his eyes off me to talk into his radio I pulled my own pistol from behind my back and shot him in the head. In all the confusion one or two more dead bodies wouldn\u2019t be noted. That is if this world even cared about throw away characters like this. I\u2019d be surprised if they even had a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI needed to get to City hall. That was the next major key point in this series of events. Everything was happening faster than it was meant to. The church, the school, probably even the police station bombing. Other things were happening out of sequence, such as my faked death, Chel meeting Richard, the escalation of this war. Still, what had to happen had still happened even if the order was messed up. That meant City hall was the next target. I had to make sure everyone in the building was caught in the explosion. Or at least I had to make sure the government officials were killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt took longer then I thought it would, the streets were already awash with mobs of panicked citizens. The military was already trying to restore order but to no avail. Of course they wouldn\u2019t be effective, they hadn\u2019t been given orders to open fire with live rounds yet. The best they could do was shoot beanbags and tear gas. That would only give them breathing room though, a cleared space only as big as the perimeter they could hold. If they started breaking off and venturing out into the streets alone or in packs of two\u2019s and three\u2019s they would be overrun by the mob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI skirted their perimeter around the building, glancing up at the fourth story window of the Beechton hotel, seeing the glint of reflection off a sniper scope. Good, that much was still the same. I would just sit in the shadows and take out anyone he missed. He normally didn\u2019t miss anyone but every so often that variation did happen in the timelines. With the way things were going I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he missed every single one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnother glint from the fourth floor of the Hilington hotel made me pull out my retractable spyglass to check it out. There was someone up there with a sniper rifle as well. There was only supposed to be one shooter, not two. I couldn\u2019t make out his looks clearly because of the reflections in the window but I just knew he wasn\u2019t here to assassinate anyone. This was another glitch to the order of things. I had to put an end to this now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slipped into the ally between the Beechton and an Italian restaurant, pulling bags off the pile of garbage in the dumpster there. It took only a moment to uncover the sniper rifle I had planted earlier this morning. Another moment more to grab the clip from where I had taped it under the giant blue dumpster. Securing the silencer onto the tip I flipped the cap off the scope, hefting it to my shoulder before leveling it at the fourth floor window of the Hilington.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>Shoot to kill. Guns are weapons, not toys. Pull a gun with the intention of firing it. Brother, sister, mother, friend. These words don\u2019t matter when you point a gun at them. Who might mourn their passing, who might come get revenge, these too do not matter. What matters is your commitment. That is why you must think of all of this before you pull out your weapon. Once it is drawn and pointed, that is your commitment. Your intent to fire and to kill no matter who it is pointed at. </i>Uncle Chris\u2019 words reverberated in my head as I let out my breath slowly and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t have time to confirm the kill though as the side door of the restaurant began to open. Quickly I hopped into the open dumpster and covered myself with the black bags full of garbage, shoving the rifle down along the inside of the metal tub. Yet another glitch that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. A rain of half eaten food, old sauce and much more dripped down on my head, the bulk of it being stopped by the trash bags. I resisted the urge to gag at the smell as I waited for the sound of the door opening and closing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tClimbing back out I cleaned myself off as best I could before making sure the rifle still worked. Once I was assured it was fine I waited. I didn\u2019t have to wait long before the City hall building went up like a firecracker. A few bodies flew through the air, flailing their arms wildly before connecting with the ground or denting in a car roof. Hefting it back to my shoulder I used the scope on my weapon to get a better view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe first congressman came out the door. I waited a moment for the sniper in the hotel next to me to do his job. But nothing happened. With a sigh I took the shot. Instead of going through his head like it should have something hit my bullet in mid air, making a small spark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat the hell was that? I shot another bullet, and again I failed to kill my target. I picked another one of the officials running out of the building and fired. It flew right in front of his face because he had suddenly stopped. The reason for his sudden halt was because someone had shot the ground right in front of him. I glanced up to the Hilington hotel quickly through my scope. There in the corner room was the glint of a scope. The angle was bad so I couldn\u2019t get a clear shot at him but I knew he was the cause of this. I fired a round in his direction, hoping to cut him up by breaking the window. But he jerked away before it even broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy interference did allow the sniper in the hotel next to me to take out one of the officials. Well it was no big deal, even if they made it to their cars, the bombs I had planted early this morning would take them out as soon as they fired up the engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though I continued to lay down covering fire, the sniper in the other hotel still managed to stop almost all the shots. To make matters worse, instead of getting into their own vehicles, a group of black armored sedans came barreling out of nowhere for the officials to be ushered into. Soon enough all six vehicles were out of sight and only five congressmen and senators had been successfully killed. All in all a total failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a disgusted sigh I broke down the weapon, throwing the parts into the dumpster and covering it over with garbage. It was untraceable and I could always get another easily. The only thing I could do now was go home and get cleaned up. With a little food in me and some clean clothes I could figure out my next step. Figure out how to salvage this mess and correct the course of time. Because at this rate Chel would end up dead tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe trek back to the house went by in a daze. A few people took one look at me and gave me a wide berth. I didn\u2019t mind. As long as they didn\u2019t try to stop me. The farther I got from the center of things the less it seemed people knew what was going on or that anything was going on. Soon enough they would though and nowhere in this town would be safe or free of panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReaching up above the door frame to hit the button my fingers froze. It was already depressed. The trap was deactivated. Somebody who knew about the trap had been in my house. They might even still be in there. As silently as I could I opened the door, slipping my glok out of its holster as I did so. The house was quiet and dark just as I had left it, but this was just the entranceway. I couldn\u2019t call it safe from just this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo. Not completely quiet. I could hear the faint sounds of the TV in the living room. Step by careful step I slid across the floor, cocking back the hammer before twisting around the frame ready to fire at the first thing that moved. Sitting in the chair with his legs crossed and his fingers steepled in front of him was the person I had never thought I would see again. I blinked my eyes rapidly but the vision didn\u2019t change at all. Slowly I lowered my weapon as I felt tears starting to trickle down my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stood with a smile and opened his arms and I ran into them without a second thought, wrapping my arms around his waist as I buried my head in his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve missed you uncle Chris!\u201d</span></div></div>",

I almost gave up at least a dozen times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut you didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the important thing. Even though no one would have faulted you for letting go, you didn\u2019t. You stayed true          to yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTo correct a mistake I made.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou mean\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. I\u2019m going to give her back her memories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI suddenly felt lighter then I ever had before. The end was in sight. I hadn\u2019t been strong enough to break her out of the loop. But I knew uncle Chris could. He was the one who had placed her in it after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let go of him and took a step back, wiping my eyes quickly. I was a Jarlepian. I wasn\u2019t supposed to be crying like a normal human over every little thing. He grabbed a cane I now noticed was leaning against the chair and headed off towards the kitchen. Try as I might, my third eye showed that he wasn\u2019t using any kind of disguise technology. His blue eye was probably a colored contact. Other than that it didn\u2019t look like he had altered his appearance at all. I followed him, still in a bit of a stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo then does that mean aunt Lexi really is here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAye, how did you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChel, I mean Anna said a woman calling herself her mother had stopped her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh, that. I already berated her for that two cycles ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t. You see I\u2019ve been here for the last two repeats. It\u2019s taken me that long to set everything up. To learn everything I needed to know. Breaking the bonds I placed on Anna isn\u2019t such a simple thing as you have probably long figured out. I made it difficult for even me to do. That\u2019s why it took me so long to implement this plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt was you than wasn\u2019t it! You are the reason everything is happening out of order!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCorrect on the first try. I couldn\u2019t completely break the chain of events. That would either destroy the world or reset it back to the beginning and accomplish nothing. So I had to work within the confines and rules of the world, simply forcing what was going to happen naturally to happen sooner. Remember what I once told you about how to alter an anime world without breaking it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStart at the beginning. A small change can become a tidal wave by the end of it. Something as simple as moving a rock to the left by four inches so someone doesn\u2019t trip over it in the first episode can turn into a building falling down in episode eight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cVery good. And that is exactly what I did. I\u2019ve been following you and Anna since I got here. Making those miniscule changes that you never noticed. That turned into what you see today. It\u2019s why Anna has been acting unusual. Right now she thinks she is an NPC remember. So she reacts as an NPC would. Unlike us she can\u2019t adapt at the drop of a hat, her programming needs to be changed so to speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen was that really you in the school building earlier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes and no. That was me, but not the current me. It was the me of the last cycle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTime manipulation. It would be impossible for me to do everything I needed to do and be everywhere I needed to be. I am still just one person. But what if there were three of me? The me of this timeline, and the two me\u2019s from the last two cycles? Then I would be able to easily jump in and out of all the places I needed to be without any problems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut how is that possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTechnology has advanced quite a bit in the last four years you have been in here. Especially rift technology. Time travel devices are still highly experimental and only work effectively in worlds that have magic like this one, but the ability is still there. Now I am sure you have a lot more questions but they can wait. Hurry up and get cleaned up, I need your help for the last part of my plan. Lexi is following Anna for now so you can rest easy on that point. But if you want her to get her memories back you need to hurry up and help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen after that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I guess it sort of depends on her doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019m willing to let her leave this reality and go back to growing up. Give her the chance to grow older and have kids. You two can work out your relationship or not, since I really don\u2019t know what her mind will be like after this. For all I know she could still be crazy or even farther over the deep end than before. As long as she stays away from me and my family I\u2019m willing to let her be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe pulled out a package of steak from the freezer as I turned to head to the bathroom. I could hear him begin to hum even as I left the room. Things were looking up and beginning to make a lot of sense again. It was no wonder I hadn\u2019t been able to control things like I usually did, I had been up against the very person who had taught me everything I knew. With a smile creeping onto my lips I turned on the shower, pulling off my disguise ring as I stepped inside. Letting the cold soothing liquid soak into my rubbery skin, the suckers on my four tentacles finally opening up to breath now that I was back in real water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you sure this is going to work uncle Chris?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMostly sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow much is mostly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmm. About ninety seven percent mostly? No. ninety eight definitely mostly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd the other two percent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe restart this all over again and think up a new plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRight, then this has to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt felt good working with uncle Chris again. Not like during the Oglian war, but this more personal touch. Like when he had brought me into the Anime Realities for the first time and showed me the ropes. How to pick locks and make the world bend to my will. How to create something out of nothing both with and without magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had missed his sense of humor. The way he could make even the most dire situation seem funny. Or the way he knew just when to put in that bit of sarcasm to lighten the mood. How he could make anything he did look cool, even something as simple as drinking a cup of coffee. I wanted to be just like him. Wanted to have that same kind of air about me. I knew I had a long way to go. And I would probably never be a match for him. But I still wouldn\u2019t stop trying. Because even after everything was said and done, he was my hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was evening now and Anna was inside the supermarket getting food for evening dinner with Billy. It was still hard for me to think of her as Anna again after I had thought and called her Chel for so long. It was the same difficult transition I had made when I had first come to this Reality to protect her. Only at that time it had been in the opposite direction. I could just make out aunt Lexi\u2019s shadowed form standing on the side of the store waiting for her daughter to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven through the store window Anna looked like a dead person walking. As if all the life had been sucked out of her. Each step she took seemed to be automatic more than anything else. I had seen this kind of look before. It was the look of someone who had lost the will to live but had not yet come to the point of taking their own life. Billy took her by the hand as if she were the younger of the two of them, leading her out of the store. Uncle Chris patted me on the back to let me know it was my turn. With a deep breath I twisted my ring to drop my disguise as I stepped out of the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI knew I must look like a monster to them, like an octopus head on a mans body. With four tentacles instead of normal arms. Three eyes blinking rapidly over a small beak and skin a pale orange color. To give him credit, Billy stepped in front of his sister with shaking knees. I tried to smile reassuringly at the boy, forgetting that in this form he would only see me clacking my beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnna. It\u2019s me. It\u2019s time to go home now. It\u2019s time for the dream to end. You don\u2019t have to suffer anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGe-get back you freak! Stay away from my sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnna blinked at me over the boys head, her eyes staring blankly. Finally a little life came into them as she took a slow step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cC-Chris\u2026Cri\u2019sa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nodded my head as I reached out and laid my left tentacle against her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s me. And you\u2019re finally back. Now we need to leave before this world restarts. We can explain things later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cB-but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLater.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUncle Chris stepped out of the shadows where he was hiding, pulling what looked like a pocket book out of his pants and hitting a few buttons on it. The fabric of reality next to me split open as aunt Lexi started towards us as well. I held out my tentacle to Anna who was still looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome with me Anna. Let me take you out of here. Let\u2019s really live our lives this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe hesitated only briefly before taking my outstretched hand and allowed me to pull her into the rift with me. Uncle Chris and aunt Lexi were only a few steps behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u201cSigh. So now you know the truth. Or at least part of it. I knew this time would come eventually. It was entertaining having them both here with me. I remember when that man brought them here almost sixty cycles ago. Asked me to watch over them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmm? What\u2019s that? Oh yes I knew we were all fictional from the start. Always have. I\u2019m a god remember. Even if I am a made up fictional god. Still I get bored, especially when I am the only one who remembers time after time with each reset.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \u201cWould you like to go back in time with me? I\u2019ll let you keep your memories. We can jump through someone else\u2019s memories and see this course of events from every angle. When you finally get bored and you understand everything I will let time resume its normal course. We can go back to doing our usual routine.\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t know what is going on but big brother Chris told me to get home and not leave. I think he was right. I have a feeling things are going to get bad really soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt his hand tugging on mine and let him lead me away. I couldn\u2019t stop the tears from flowing. He was dead. Blown into little bits. Why had he gone into the school? Why hadn\u2019t he left with Billy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe world passed me in a blur. It was all just random noises and flashing moments of darkness and light. It was over. Everything was over. Chris wouldn\u2019t be there in the mornings to greet me. Or make witty one liners with his dry sarcastic voice. He wouldn\u2019t be there to play along with my flights of fancy, or make me feel safe when I was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI wouldn\u2019t hear him tell me that he loved me anymore or see him glancing at me sideways when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking. All the normal days were gone in an instant. Destroyed along with the school. He had somehow known all about this. Somehow he knew it was going to happen. He had been telling me goodbye before. Back before he had left me at the church. I had just been too stupid to realize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI wanted to tell him I loved him too. I knew that now. Funny how I only realized it after he was dead. I wanted to answer his feelings properly. But I couldn\u2019t now. He\u2019d never get to hear those words. Why had I been so stupid? So blind? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI blinked a few times and realized I was standing in the living room. When had I gotten here? When had we left the school? I needed to go back there. He might still be alive. It was possible. He could have escaped. He wasn\u2019t allowed to be dead until I told him how I felt. Please god, just let him be alive! Let him somehow escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned to leave the room, fully intending to walk back to the school when my dad stepped in front of door and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s best if you stay inside honey. Billy told us what happened and I was out there. It\u2019s not safe right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut he\u2019s alive! He needs my help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf he is still alive then the police will handle it. If you go out now you will end up getting killed and he wouldn\u2019t want that now would he? There is rioting in the streets and a lot of madness all over town. It probably won\u2019t reach this section though and the military is already enforcing order. I don\u2019t want you to get caught up in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThen what am I supposed to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard the lost and pleading tone of my voice but didn\u2019t care. The world was ending. Chris was dead and nothing my dad was saying made much sense. This was Gorgon City, where nothing really bad happened. There was no way there could be rioting. No way Chris could actually be dead. This was like what happened in a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat was it! This was all a dream! I would wake up and none of this will have happened! All I needed to do was pinch myself awake. After all, Chris couldn\u2019t cut off someone\u2019s arm or climb trees without using his hands. He couldn\u2019t do any of the stuff I had seen him do. He would never say the things he had said. Leaving me or Billy alone in a real crises and simply telling us to run home. That wasn\u2019t like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pinched my arm but nothing happened except I felt the sharp pain where I had grabbed. Maybe the arm wasn\u2019t a good spot, maybe my cheek would be better. Still nothing. I had to find someplace more painful. I had to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mom touched my arm, shaking her head when I looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not a dream sweetie. Doing that will do no good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt the tears beginning to well up again as she took me in her arms and rocked me back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s ok sweetie. Maybe he did make it out. If he did I just know he will come running over here straight away. When he does I bet he is going to be really hungry. So let\u2019s set a plate for him at lunch ok? You can cry your eyes out and make yourself look nice so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about you when he comes. You know he will worry if you aren\u2019t your usual self, because that\u2019s just how he is. Now why don\u2019t you help me prepare lunch ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slowly nodded my head against her chest and let her lead me towards the kitchen. She was right. He would come running as soon as he could. He always came running. He always found me when I was lost. Always knew the right things to say to make me feel better. And right now I was really lost and needed to hear his voice. Even if it was to make fun of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cPoor girl. She just can\u2019t accept that he is dead. What is it about you mortals anyway? Whenever someone dies you almost always beg me to give them back to you. Yet ninety percent of the rest of the time you are either cursing my name or don\u2019t believe I exist. It\u2019s not all that easy to bring a person back to life you know. There is a natural order to things. Even I can\u2019t mess with that order easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat did you think? I would make light of this situation? I\u2019m not that heartless. I can appreciate such somber moments of loss as well. Even if I can\u2019t completely understand it. Losing something or someone precious is always hard to handle. I hope she can get over this soon.\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI blinked and found myself staring at my reflection in the bathroom mirror. How long had I been standing here? How long had the water been running? Slowly I turned the faucet off and looked at my reflection again. My long blond hair seemed to have lost some of its luster and my blue eyes were rimmed red from so much crying. They had lost some of the life in them as well. Was this really what I looked like? I needed to fix this. I couldn\u2019t let Chris see me like this. He would make fun of me for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ran a comb through my hair, holding it up in a few different positions. Deciding to wear it in a ponytail. He always had liked ponytails. Once that was done I used a bit of make-up and water to clear away the worst of the red around my eyes. When he came for lunch I would waste no time in telling him how I felt. He would like that. But that meant I had to be strong, I couldn\u2019t cry anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter leaving the bathroom I headed for the stairs. While passing Billy\u2019s room I heard muffled sobs through his door. My own eyes began to water again, threatening to undo all the work I had just done. Clenching my fists I walked away. Chris was still alive after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLunchtime drew near and I began to get anxious. What would he say to my confession? Would he kiss me again? Did I want him to kiss me again in front of my family? Would he laugh at how worried I was about him? If he did I would smack him. But that was just like him too. To simply laugh off a serious event like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we sat around the table everyone seemed to be forcing themselves to act cheerful for my sake. I wasn\u2019t worried. I knew he would come. I had set a plate out for him after all. I had piled it with mashed potatoes, some peas, and topped his hamburger steak with mushrooms. He loved mushrooms. It was ready and waiting for him. Now all he had to do was come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe doorbell rang just as I was about to put my first forkful of food in my mouth. I dropped it back to my plate as I bounded out of my chair. He was here! Just like my mom said he would be. I knew he wasn\u2019t dead! I could feel my cheeks stretched to their fullest as I yanked open the door. My grin disappearing in an instant when I saw it was old Miss Haubenaker from across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChelsea dear! What are you doing home? Shouldn\u2019t you be in school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy hand dropped listlessly from the door as I turned to shuffle back to the table. My mom came around the corner and saw who it was while I moved away, all my energy suddenly gone again. I heard the old woman ask to borrow some sugar but I didn\u2019t care. She wasn\u2019t Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLunchtime passed but still he didn\u2019t show up. I refused to let anyone take his plate off the table. He was going to be hungry when he came and hamburger steak was his favorite. Mom put some cling wrap over it but otherwise left it alone. With a sigh I shuffled into the living room and plopped down on the couch. aimlessly picking up the remote and flicking through the channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>\u201cAt eight fifty three this morning Heronus middle school exploded from an attack made by a terrorist group calling themselves the Inquisition. Police and firefighters have been working tirelessly to clear the wreckage. Of the two hundred and twenty three children that attend this school only twenty two are still alive. Those who did not attend school today for whatever reason were the only ones not killed by the explosion. No other survivors have been found. A copy of the official attendance records for this morning are being pulled off an external server and the families of the victims are being notified as we speak. Stay tuned to GCNS for more info.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo survivors. Of course there would be no survivors. It was impossible to survive a blast like that. I had been there after all. I knew there was no chance anyone could survive that. I let the remote drop back to the couch as my hands covered my face and I began to cry. The cushions next to me shifted as Billy sat down next to me. I latched on to him just like he latched onto me, our tears mingling together.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d traded fists with him a few times, so I already knew how strong he was. Come to think of it, he was ahead of me three-two, with one tie. Perhaps he would spar with me again after the test. Though I had to admit, he had style. I held no illusions. I was your average brawler. I had a few moves on me but I took care of business with brute strength, nothing else. I didn\u2019t have the kind of skill Chris had. That ability to assess the opponent and strike at the weak points. But I had stamina to make up for that lack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy phone rang while I was waiting on the bus to head back home. I already knew it was my older sister before even pulling it out of my pocket since hers was the only Rotten Oranges ring tone on my phone. I briefly toyed with the idea of ignoring her but in the end I just couldn\u2019t. She was family. Even though I knew she was probably calling because she wanted to use my strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah what do you want sis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhere are you right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBus stop in Medusa city. Watching my ride come down the street now. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerfect. Come over to the shopping district would you? I\u2019m in a bit of trouble here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLet me guess, trouble of the violent boy kind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault! They just hit on me and I turned them down. They just wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh-huh. And I bet you turned them down in your normal sweet way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI only told them to leave me alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd probably slapped them at least once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow\u2019d you know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m psychic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let out a sigh as I let the bus door close in front of me and turned to head towards the shopping district at a jog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll be there in about ten minutes. Can you hold out for that long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I\u2019m in MayB\u2019s now buying some clothes. They are hanging around outside waiting for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow many?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust four of them. But one of them is a kickback. I\u2019m not sure which one or what his power is but I can sense it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019m almost there, when I tell you to move leave the store and head into the nearest alley. I\u2019ll box them in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks bro. I knew I could count on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeems like the only time you count on me is when you are in trouble. Would be nice to hear from you once in a while when you weren\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat was that? I couldn\u2019t hear you. There was too much noise in the background.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing at all sis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI snapped the phone closed and began pumping my hands, getting serious with my run. So there was a kickback huh? Wonder from what hero, angel, or demon he descended from. If the world at large knew there were still people out there with paranormal powers they would freak out. Or want to study us. I knew I got my freakish strength and stamina from Hercules, though no one else in my family since my great-grandfather had gotten any of it. It was a family secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRobin\u2019s ability to sense when other kickbacks were nearby was passed down by her mother from my dad\u2019s last marriage. It was no wonder we had hit it off so well when she had moved in with us, one kickback finding safety in another of their kind. Our parents were supportive of us, sometimes annoyingly so, but they didn\u2019t understand our unique position or the pain having this power sometimes caused us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cInteresting. This is a descendant of one of my son\u2019s. I even remember Hercules. Good lad. A bit daft in the head mind you but still a good lad. Did a lot of good too. Gave your world hope when you needed it. Wonder who this other one is though? Won\u2019t know what son or daughter spawned him until I see his power. It does make me feel good that some people haven\u2019t completely forgotten their roots and the ones that gave them their abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTell me. What do you think? Did I do the right thing in letting those with power live so long ago? If I had put an end to all of them these people would not have these skills. Would that have altered history? Would these situations and confrontations never happen? Oh I\u2019m just fooling with you! I know they would never happen. I\u2019m a god remember? What? Did you really take me serious for a moment? Loosen up, have some fun.\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ended up across the street from MayB\u2019s Clothing and accessories exactly nine minutes after I started out. Not even slightly out of breath. I grinned to myself as I began dialing my sisters phone. That was one boon I had gotten from my ancient ancestor that I would always be grateful for, rarely getting winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI quickly told her I was here and got her acknowledgement before hanging up again. A moment later she came out of the store laden down with a bag on each arm and a few boxes. She looked around a moment before heading down the street. I saw four guys peel away from the shadows to follow her. One of them sported a red welt on his cheek still. Yeah they were definitely looking for trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let them get a few steps ahead and followed them on my side of the street. When Robin turned down the nearest alley and the four followed I finally crossed quickly to be only a few steps behind them. As soon as the last two entered the mouth I was already stepping up behind them and grabbing the sides of their heads. I smashed them together before they had a chance to realize I was there. Two down for the count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI took a step forward just as the next one in line started to turn at the sound of the falling bodies. His mouth began to open and I grabbed his face in my meaty palm, muffling his exclamation seconds before slamming his head into the brick wall . Three down for the count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI swung at the back of the fourth ones head even while I was dropping the third one. But my fist hit empty air. I looked around quickly for my target. He hadn\u2019t ducked or jumped, he had just seemed to vanish. He must be the kickback..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLooking for me stupid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked up at the guy who was standing on the fire escape grinning down on me cockily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cAh speed. Must be Hemiphisita\u2019s stock. Though you might know her better as Hermes. How you mortals could mistake her for a boy I have no idea. But then again, those Greeks had some funny ideas about things too. Wonder how muscles will handle this one.\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI blinked and he was gone from the fire escape. Suddenly I felt a fist in my gut and then another across my jaw. A rapid flurry of attacks staggered me a moment as I took blow after blow too fast to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo one is as fast as me. A big lumbering ox like you moves like molasses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe blows hurt, but they really weren\u2019t all that powerful. It was just the speed that gave them more force then a normal person. But they had a pattern to them. Two quick jabs then a kick. Then a pause as it seemed he jumped back for a moment before coming in again. I waited until the kick came. During the pause I summoned all my strength and stomped the ground. I saw the cement vibrate as a small earthquake fanned out from my foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuddenly the guy was visible right in front of me as he was thrown off balance. With a grin I curled my fingers into a fist and smashed him in the face.  As he reeled back I caught him with an uppercut that lifted him off the ground. He was unconscious before his chin left my knuckles. Robin came walking up to me, stopping only long enough to kick the guy I had just knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks again bro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grabbed the boxes out of her hands and then the bags, heading back to the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll walk you home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know I don\u2019t. But if I leave you alone you will probably get in more trouble and call me up again when I\u2019m halfway home. Besides, you don\u2019t live all that far from here right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really are a good guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t let that get out, I have a reputation to maintain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat about these guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cProbably wake up with massive headaches in a few hours. Just common trash. They will have forgotten all about you by tomorrow. If anything they will be more focused on me anyway, looking for revenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what will you do if they come after you again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shrugged. \u201cSame thing I do all the other times I clean up your messes. I take care of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow is that exactly? You never will tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to. They don\u2019t bother you anymore do they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen leave it at that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was no way I would tell her the truth. That if I couldn\u2019t run them out of town I killed them. It wouldn\u2019t stop her from acting the way she did. Or being as impulsive as ever. It would only make her worry for no reason. I didn\u2019t like killing anyone. But if it was to protect Robin I was willing to silently suffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe made it to her house without any more problems and I dropped my burden on her table before turning to leave. She quickly hugged me and kissed my cheek, telling me thank you again before closing the door. I smiled a bit as I rubbed my cheek and headed down the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cOh a bit of illicit love going on. Secret crush perhaps. This might prove even better then the whole Chel and Chris line. Something to be said about a steamy romance between siblings. Even parent and child. What? I\u2019m a god remember?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tNow that I had walked Robin home I decided to stop by the arcade for a bit. It wouldn\u2019t take me too far out of my way now. Just a few hours to make sure my sister wouldn\u2019t call me up again out of the blue because she went out again and got in trouble. That would be just like her, see some commercial and feel that she just had to have some item or another. Running out of her house half naked to buy it and provoking more guys to hit on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe neon sign that simply proclaimed Arcade came into view just as the bells began to ring signaling that it was five o\u2019clock. I slipped in the doors just as the last echoes of the towers faded away, changing out a five dollar bill for some quarters at the machine. Looking around I saw most of the popular machines were already taken. Well it was a Friday evening so it wasn\u2019t too surprising. But Dance Dance Jammer Two was open. Not a lot of people liked the game but I found it enjoyable<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPopping a dollar into the machine I stepped up onto the platform. I selected medium difficulty and a random song as I shook out my shoulders and bounced on my feet a bit to limber up. I wasn\u2019t even going to attempt Insanity mode. I had seen professional DDJ dancers tackle that and come out looking like they had been in a war. Rumor was Insanity mode had been thrown in as a sort of troll device by the developers, designed to make you freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe character I had chosen walked onto the stage and turned to face me as the song rolled up the screen. Fighting Fantastic. I had never heard this song before, though from the beat that started in the background it was a fast paced one. It began to beep as it counted down from five until it hit zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLevel one. Begin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let my feet hit the arrows as they scrolled up the screen. I missed a few but that was fine. I was no master after all. I enjoyed the song more then the game itself. I didn\u2019t try anything flashy like other people, there was no need, it was just showing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCongratulations! Level Up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNow the arrows began to speed up and I started missing them more often. Not that much more often but I still noticed. A gauge appeared on the left side of the screen while my avatar danced with me. As I hit notes it slowly filled with fire. When it hit the top it exploded in a shower of electronic ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOn fire! Double points! Level Up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the song wound down I let my feet fly as the arrows sped up again. At the very end I felt like being flashy, crossing my legs and doing a spin before stomping down on the last note. My score came up and the game gave me an A rank with a ninety out of one hundred percent. I heard a few claps behind me and looked to see some of the other kids in the arcade cheering me on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBig man got some moves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore I could answer the guy the screen beeped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIncoming challenger! Progressive battle! Accept?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI tried looking around the edge of the booth to see who was challenging me from the other side but couldn\u2019t catch a glimpse. With a shrug I hit the accept button before putting on the virtual gloves. A few more kids were gathering around as another avatar walked onto the screen  and put up her fists in a fighting stance. The red fist of the attacker popped up in the corner of my screen as a song began to play. It was one I knew pretty well and had danced to quite a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLevel One. Begin. Attacker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I danced and hit the arrows my avatar began to throw punches and kicks based on how well I hit the notes. The longer I could hold a string of them without missing one the stronger my attacks would become. On my opponents part hitting the notes blocked my attacks. The longer he or she kept up the string, the higher their defense. It became a race to see who messed up first. If I could get a near flawless run of notes and they suddenly missed a step, I could potentially one hit K.O. them. But if I dropped the string before them my attacks would be too weak to bypass his defenses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe song switched up halfway through it\u2019s normal course since this was a progressive battle. My red attacker icon changed to a blue shield just as the machine said I was on the defensive. My opponent was good, they hit the right notes and almost hit me with a counter attack on the change up but I countered the counter. Not many people knew about these small periods of vulnerability to get in a more powerful hit by transferring the stored defensive power to attack before it went to zero. The song got faster as the arrows moved to compensate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLevel up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe would go back and forth like this as the notes came faster and faster. Soon hand movements would start coming in to add to the confusion. It wouldn\u2019t stop until one of us lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLevel up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was my turn to attack already? I must have zoned out a bit. So focused on moving my feet and throwing open palms forward that I hadn\u2019t realized. I tuned out the cheering behind me, narrowing my eyes only on the game. We were both at about half health now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAttacker is on fire! Double down! Level Up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWas I the attacker? I looked at the corner quickly and saw I was the defender. That brief moment cost me as I missed a beat and my avatars fists dropped. I heard the collective sucking in of breath as the other avatar hit me with a flaming right hook followed by a left jab. I tried to bounce back but his stronger attacks tore through my blocks. In the space of a heartbeat my toon was wobbling in a dizzy animation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFinishing blow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI watched as a gauge popped up on screen and began filling up with a blue liquid as my opponent danced to fill it up. If he missed just one step I still had a chance. I would recover and go on the attack. I could almost see everyone behind me leaning forward in expectation. Holding their breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally the gauge filled to the top and the enemy avatar did a flying spin kick over and over into my avatars face until he kicked his head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cVictory! Challenger wins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone behind me went aww at my loss but then congratulated me on my skill before dispersing back to other parts of the arcade. That\u2019s why I liked this town, not a lot of people knew me as the bad boy delinquent. If this had been Gorgan city, no one would have been cheering for me. Taking off the gloves and stepping off the mini dance floor I walked around the side to congratulate my opponent. He was a short guy, maybe around five feet tall give or take with distinct Asian features. Unusual to see foreigners around these parts. I extended my hand with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood game man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked at my hand and then at me but didn\u2019t shake it. Simply shoving his hands into his pockets. I felt my eye twitch in anger at the snub but dropped my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what\u2019s your name? You aren\u2019t from around here I can tell that much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI am Yuki Kamishiro and you are Richard Noel are you not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat is my curse. Though some claim it is a gift. I am a kickback like yourself. I am in need of your assistance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd how do you know I am a kickback or that I can even help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI told you. It is my gift. I am descended from Cassandra. The one cursed to see the future and yet never have her visions be believed. Thankfully I am not bound by the full curse. I can simply see the future if I wish to. Though sometimes it comes when I do not. Seeing the future is not as fun as it might sound. It was through one of these visions that I know of you and know that you can help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou could have at least shaken my hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was only a grumble under my breath but he still heard me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI do not touch people if I can help it. Doing so brings on visions of their future. And always visions of their death. Even gloves do not stop them, though they shorten the span of the visions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then what do you want from me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe shook his head quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe time is not right to tell you. I will contact you again. I simply came today to introduce myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe turned to walk away, but only made it a few steps before he looked back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh, you will meet a girl later on tonight in trouble. One with blond hair and wearing a light blue sweater. You should help her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that he turned and left the arcade. Well this had just got interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cInteresting indeed. Now we have a bit of a conundrum don\u2019t we? A prophesied meeting, perhaps a love interest for our strong armed hero? An enigmatic statement hinting at things to come. And a young man with the power to see the future. Who knows what mysteries lay dormant in his head. What knowledge of things to come he might reveal if we follow him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo do we continue to follow Richard to his fateful meeting? Or do we follow this Yuki Kamishiro fellow?\u201d</b></i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tKamishiro huh? Strange guy no matter how you looked at it. I wonder what it would be like, having the ability to see the future whether you wanted to or not. Would make acing tests a snap. But being unable to touch people without seeing how they die. That was a real negative for me. Sometimes having the strength to lift up a car and able to make mini earthquakes was too much for me. Having to hold back your real strength could be a real pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw a pink heart necklace in a jewelry store window and decided to buy it. I wasn\u2019t big on the girly stuff but Amy liked it. Chris had helped me patch things up, but I had to remember to keep her in mind if I wanted her to stay my girlfriend. He had said random gifts would always get me a lot of points with her. I was seriously in his debt. I don\u2019t know where I would be now if he hadn\u2019t knocked some sense into me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI still remembered the day I had picked a fight with him back during my first year of high school. Little more then a snot faced delinquent thinking I was top dog because of my strength. Ruled the middle school and made a name for myself. Had my own little gang of henchmen. Running the streets and claiming the town as my own. He had come waltzing through town for whatever reason and I had taken an instant dislike to him. Cornered him in an abandoned parking lot with eight of my gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe had taken us all out. Even made me use all my power. But in the end he had put me on my backside. Then he had offered me a hand up with a grin. <i>That was a good rumble. Though is this really the best use of your strength? Real strength doesn\u2019t come from how many people you can get to fear you or how many people you can beat up. Names Chris. Chris Wees. What\u2019s your\u2019s?</i> After that we had begun hanging out from time to time even though he was from the next city over. I wasn\u2019t even sure when it happened exactly, I just realized I had woken up one day and I wasn\u2019t interested in fighting as much anymore. More interested in getting my grades up and being a more respectable person. But that stigmata of being a bad boy still stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIf he was a kickback like me, Robin couldn\u2019t tell. She didn\u2019t feel any vibes coming from him. He was just that strong. Maybe not physically the strongest, but he had skill to make up for that lack. I had found myself talking to him about anything and everything, home life, girls, deep philosophical thoughts. He had a way of putting things in perspective or helping me figure it out on my own without making me feel dumb. A fact that made me like him even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I turned the corner I saw a girl with blond hair and a light blue sweater sitting at a bus stop bench crying. I was half tempted to keep on walking. For all I knew Kamishiro\u2019s words had been a lie meant to somehow trap me. But I would give him the benefit of the doubt for now. As I got closer I noticed she had no shoes on and her skirt was ripped up a bit. Her knee was also bleeding where it looked like she had tripped and fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo, What\u2019s the matter girl? You lost or somethin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe glanced at me through her tears before flinching slightly and trying to back away unobtrusively. I was used to this kind of reaction. Even though it could still tick me off sometimes I had gotten better at controlling myself and hiding my initial response to yell at them. With a sigh I hunched my shoulders and stuck my hands in my pockets while keeping a grin plastered on my face. I had found this took the edge off my threatening looks and made people more comfortable around me. Finally she slowly nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I\u2019m lost. And I forgot my cell phone at home. Some guys chased me and I just ran. I lost my shoes someplace and I tripped while running. I finally lost them but I don\u2019t know where I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked to be about my age, so maybe sixteen or seventeen. She was kind of pretty too. Mentally I kicked myself for being such a softie when it came to women. I would probably help her anyways even if I hadn\u2019t been told I should. I couldn\u2019t just leave the poor girl out here all alone. Especially now that it was starting to drizzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you live around here? If so I could walk you home. I know this area pretty well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe sniffed a few times but finally told me her address hesitantly. I silently shook my head. She was too trusting of a stranger. If I had been intent on harming her she would have been in real trouble. As it was I sat down next to her and pulled off my shoes and handed them to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey might be a little big but at least it will cover your feet. Your street isn\u2019t too far away. About a twenty minute walk. I\u2019ve got a friend that lives over that way so I know the general area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe tried to protest but I shot her down gently. She took one last look at me before slipping her feet into my shoes. I pulled off my shirt as well and offered it to her as a makeshift umbrella. Again she tried to protest but I wouldn\u2019t hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not that cold out and I\u2019m not bothered by it. I\u2019m built to not get colds. You know the saying, stupid don\u2019t catch colds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re not stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes I am. I know it. It\u2019s just the way I was born.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWon\u2019t your feet get cold and wet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cProbably. But better my feet get wet then your\u2019s. You look like the type that catches a cold easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you are right kind of, I do catch colds more often then other people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe started walking as she put my shirt over her head to keep the rain off. I could hear the clopping as my over large shoes smacked the cement. I decided to fill the silence with some conversation to keep her mind off her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s your name anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m Chelsea Winters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRichard Noel. Pleasure to meet you. So any particular reason you were out so late?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh, I know that tone. Boy trouble I bet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m psychic. Actually been on the other side with some girl trouble of my own just recently. My friend helped me out of it. Want to tell me about it? Perhaps I can pass the favor on. You don\u2019t know me and I don\u2019t know you. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to talk to a near stranger about this kind of stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis might sound kind of pathetic, but there is this boy that confessed to me and I shot him down. But he is still my friend and acts like nothing has happened. I don\u2019t want things to change between us, but my parents keep pushing me to get together with him. One of my girlfriends said she is going to make a move on him but I don\u2019t want that either. We got into a bit of an argument tonight while he was over at my place and he kissed me out of the blue. I didn\u2019t know what else to do so I ran out the door. I just kept running and ended up lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSounds to me like a part of you wants to be his girlfriend. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be so adverse to another girl taking him. I\u2019m not an expert on relationships. My friend is better at this stuff then I am. But I don\u2019t think it is wrong to want to just stay friends. I mean sure I would feel hurt if I confessed my feelings to someone and got rejected, but I wouldn\u2019t see that as a reason to stop being friends with them either. If that was what she really wanted I would learn to accept that and move on. I mean guys and girls can have a relationship without dating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut it sounds like you don\u2019t want to move on. You want to keep things in stasis so you don\u2019t have to make any decisions. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s wrong, but I don\u2019t think it is completely right either. It\u2019s unfair both to you and to him. I can\u2019t say why he kissed you either, but that sort of tells me that he still likes you and isn\u2019t completely content with being just a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe walked along in silence for a while and the rain finally stopped. As we were turning into the residential area she finally spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks for trying to help me. Oddly I feel better now. You\u2019re right, I really need to think about what I want. I never thought that I was being unfair to him before. Despite what you say, you\u2019re pretty smart. A dumb person wouldn\u2019t have been able to talk like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks. But it doesn\u2019t take brains to have a bit of common sense and just speak your mind. But I will take your compliment with grace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter another five or six minutes we came to her house and she slipped my shoes off, handing them back to me. While I put my wet shirt back on and snuggled my feet back into the sneakers she asked if I wanted to come in and dry off. I declined the offer and turned away. Time I got back home anyway. She gave me one last wave as I opened the gate and started walking back down the street towards the bus stop.</span></div></div>",

Wake up big brother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grumbled a bit but finally opened my eyes, swatting at my little sister half heartedly. She jumped away laughing but continued to dance around the room saying wake up in a sing-song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right already I\u2019m up! Now go away!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNuh-uh! You\u2019re still in bed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI threw a pillow at her as I sat up, catching her square in the face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere you happy? I\u2019m sitting up, now go away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe threw the pillow back, which I caught one handed as she giggled and left the room. I had to wonder what went through her ten year old mind sometimes. But now that I was sitting up, might as well keep moving and stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI idly scratched my chest as I began putting on my black school uniform. Who had thought making kids go to school six days a week was a good idea anyway? I knew other places only went five. Leave the weekends to us at least. I noticed the pant legs seemed a bit short. Had I put on another small growth spurt? That was what, the third one this year? I\u2019d have to see if mom could let out the seams. My alarm clock went off as I finished dressing and I hit the snooze button. Couldn\u2019t they have let me sleep those five extra minutes? Ah well, what\u2019s done is done as Chris would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI made my way to the kitchen where the smell of bacon and eggs filled the room. Pouring myself a glass of orange juice and snagging a slice of toast sitting out on the counter. I tried to get away with just that but my mother pointed at the table with her spatula, her \u201cdon\u2019t give me no lip\u201d look on her face. I sighed and sat down moments before she put a plate in front of me loaded up with food. Gina came in and plopped down into a chair across from me waiting for her own food, kicking her feet back and forth happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh Richard, your friend Chris is coming over today to help you study right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah what of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou think he will be staying for dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah probably. He usually does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I\u2019ll make sure to set out an extra plate for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChris is coming over today! Sweet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy are you getting excited runt? He\u2019s not coming to see you. And I can tell you now he isn\u2019t interested in underdeveloped girls seven years younger than him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmph! Shows what you know! I have all the guys at school falling all over me! I\u2019m a ripe fruit that has yet to blossom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBetter check again, I think you\u2019ve already gone rotten if you\u2019re talking like that. Quit trying to act grown up and using big people words.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMom! Richards being mean to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cQuit being mean to your sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not being mean. There\u2019s a whole lot more I could say if I really wanted to be mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe says he isn\u2019t being mean to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned across the table at my sister who stuck her tongue out at me. Our mother hadn\u2019t even turned around or sounded interested at all in our back and forth. This was a normal morning and her replies were almost absentminded and automatic. She sat a plate of extra bacon on the table between us so we could both pick at it before wiping her hands and sitting down at the table as well. She looked at me a moment as if studying me intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was just thinking. Becoming friends with Chris has done you a world of good. You seem more <br>\r\nsettled. Happier. He\u2019s been a good influence on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re just imagining things. I\u2019m the same person I always was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo you\u2019re not. You were a mean big brother before. Scary. Now you aren\u2019t so scary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m still mean and scary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah but not to me anymore. Only to other people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI lowered my head and continued to eat. I felt uncomfortable having them say those kinds of things to me. I knew I had changed. They didn\u2019t need to point it out to me. It felt weird. My cell phone rang as I was finishing up breakfast. When I checked the number it came up unknown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe have your sister. If you want her back then you have to do a small job for us. I know you possess great strength. Almost god like strength. If you let anyone know about this we will kill her. Come to Laurel Street in Medusa City right now. You will get your next set of instructions there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI moved away from my mother and sister to talk in a lowered voice without being overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho are you and how do I know you aren\u2019t bluffing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe are crusaders. We have been given the mission of purging this city of its corruption. And eventually the world. We are the Inquisition. As for how to prove we are not lying, well check your phone in a moment. You have one hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe voice that sounded like someone had used a synthesizer hung up. I stared at it for a moment, dreading what might happen. It vibrated to say I got a text from an unknown caller. I hit the receive button hesitantly. A picture of Robin tied up to a chair and gagged met my eyes. Under it the words tick, tock; tick, tock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI headed for the door while shoving the phone back into my pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOff to school already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh yeah. I want to get some extra studying at the library in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk be safe then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was already running towards the bus station before the door finished closing. Halfway there my phone rang again. A quick glance told me it was another unknown number. Angrily I hit the talk button and put it to my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI swear to god if you hurt her I am going to rip your lungs out through your throat and feed it back to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood morning to you too. Though I\u2019m not your enemy. I\u2019m simply someone wishing to help. I already have someone saving your sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I suppose you want something from me as well in exchange for her safe return?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope. All I want is for you to head to the rendezvous point and find out what they want you to do. Then tell me when I call you back. After that head over to Peach Street and pick her up from Yuki.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow that I know where she is, what makes you think I\u2019ll even go to Laurel Street?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause I know. You could say you have already gone there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou got that future seeing ability like Yuki?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSomething like that. But you strike me as the kind of man that likes to repay a debt as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow do I know you aren\u2019t lying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bus stop came into view just as the inter city bus was pulling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine! But you better not be lying to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain the click as the mysterious person hung up the phone. He at least had offered me a name I knew and a place to find Robin. It made me inclined to trust him even though I had no clue who he was.. Jumping onto the bus I dropped a few coins in the machine for my toll and sat in the back, wishing the twenty minute ride to Medusa City was already over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cOh now this is a bit of excitement in the morning. Not one but two mysterious phone calls. Just wait until you see what happens next! Oh yeah, sorry. I kind of cheated and looked into the future a bit. I had to find out what was going on. I know, I know. I promised you I wouldn\u2019t cheat like that. That I would be with you every step of the way, but this is just so juicy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait, what? I didn\u2019t make any promise like that? Are you sure? Hold on let me check back through time a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I\u2019ll be colored a purple people eater! I was thinking of another timeline entirely. One of the many possibilities that exist out there. Simply not the possibility we are in right now. Good at least now I don\u2019t feel so bad\u2026 Oh who am I kidding? I didn\u2019t feel bad about it to begin with!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s that?

Simple enough for someone like you to break. Inside this locked fence is a triple reinforced steel case. There is a door on this case. Your mission is to break into that case. That is all. How you get inside is up to you. But once you have broken in you may leave. Others will come around later and finish the job. You have one hour to complete this mission. When you are done await my next call on Follier Road. If you fail you know what happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe mysterious man hung up the phone and I started heading for the police station. It was on the way to Peach Street anyway so it wasn\u2019t too bad. About two minutes later the phone rang again and I answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell what was the mission?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI told him while jogging down the sidewalk, wondering if one or both of these mysterious people was watching me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks for the info. You helped save a lot of lives today. Don\u2019t worry about doing that job. Your sister should be seeing daylight right about now anyway. If everything went according to plan she should be around Peach and First by the time you get there. Have a good life, this will probably be the last you hear from me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe phone went silent as he hung up on me. I saw the sign for Peach right in front of me just as a loud boom filled the air. The ground shook and I spread my legs to keep from falling over. A pillar of flame rose like a pennant into the air right around where I remember the old church stood. Seconds later I felt a blast of hot air from the shockwave and smelled the smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRacing around the corner I saw Chris standing over a girl looking up at the tower of fire like he was ready to wrestle it bare handed. As I got closer and the girl began to get to her feet I recognized her as the one from last night. Chris turned to look at me and seemed surprised that I was there. Then again, I did live an entire city away and go to a different school. The girl was just as surprised, pointing at me when she saw my face, her jaw dropping a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou! You\u2019re the guy from last night! Richard Noel right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAye. And you\u2019re Chelsea Winters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait, you two know each other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah he walked me home last night after\u2026 after dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t know that trouble you were telling me about was Chris! If I had I would have given you better advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLike what you oversized muscle factory?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLike she should stay as far away from you as possible. That you are nothing but trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned as I shook his hand and looked  up at the flames of the building just out of sight. They were beginning to spread to some of the nearby houses and I could hear fire trucks in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what brings you out this way you big idiot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced over at Chelsea before pulling him off to the side and whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy sister. Someone kidnapped her and tried to use her to force me to do a job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh must have been the Inquisition. I heard they are becoming really active around these parts. Had your sister holed up under the church. No worries me and a fellow named Yuki got her out before it turned into that giant bonfire you see before you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou mean she was in there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAye. Yuki is escorting her away right now, heading towards First street last I saw. If you hurry you can still catch them. Careful though, he has a gun. Don\u2019t want you getting shot on me now. You might be an idiot but you\u2019re still my friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks mate. I owe you big time for this. I don\u2019t know how you knew what was going down or how you pulled it off and I don\u2019t want to know. But you saved my sister so that makes anything you did A-Ok in my book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo worries. And if I don\u2019t see you again soon, keep safe and don\u2019t die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBack at you bro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI began running off  towards Peach and First, assured that I would find my sister safe and sound. I made it a few blocks before his words actually sunk in completely. I stopped running and looked behind me. He was long out of sight of course, but I felt like I could still see his ghost image. That had been a long term goodbye. Not a \u201cI\u2019ll see you later today\u201d type. What was he planning? What was he going to do? And was he expecting to die? I was torn. I wanted to see my sister and make sure she was safe, but I also didn\u2019t want to let Chris go off to do whatever he was going to do alone. I owed him. He had saved my bacon more times than I could count. The least I could do was watch his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally I turned and continued to run. He could take care of himself. He wouldn\u2019t die that easily. I wouldn\u2019t forgive him if he died that easily. Right now my sister was more important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI spied the back of Yuki\u2019s head as I came up on the intersection, standing next to the bakery. There was no one else around, which seemed a bit strange. With the recent explosion and this being a busier part of town I would have thought the roads would be crawling with people. At least a random car or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuddenly Yuki turned around pointing a gun at me, his hands shaking so much I thought they might vibrate right off his body. When he saw it was me he let out a sigh and dropped his arm. Robin turned just as I was almost on them, saw me and ran into my arms. I returned her embrace quickly, telling her it was all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you came like he said you would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe? He who?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe guy that convinced me to fly halfway around the world. He calls himself Mr. Nobody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSlightly deep voice? A bit gravely, like his throat was messed up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s him. How\u2019d you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe called me this morning and told me to come here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know what his full game is since I can\u2019t see his future, but I could use the help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are you talking about? He didn\u2019t say anything about helping you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah? Well I doubt he planned on me being surrounded either. Or perhaps he did and that\u2019s why he sent you here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSurrounded?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah check the rooftops and watch the windows of the buildings. I\u2019ve looked into the future as far as I can and I\u2019ve seen around twenty guys in all. But every future I saw ended up with me and the girl dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy haven\u2019t they opened fire yet then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know. I can only see what\u2019s going to happen, not the reasons for things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat about now? You said in the futures you saw both of you died. Does that change now that I am here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI watched his eyes take on a slightly blank expression as his breathing suddenly slowed down. As his body stiffened his eyes rolled up into his head and began to twitch around rapidly. I heard him begin to mumble and strained my ears to catch the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on. Come on. One more minute farther. Show me. No. No. No. No good. Not that one. Hurry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBlood began to run from his nose as his head shook slightly. Finally he seemed to pop out of whatever trance he was in, his body giving one final convulsion before he wiped the blood away and looked at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t see past my normal five minutes no matter how hard I tried. Most of the futures you died too and the ones where we didn\u2019t I can\u2019t say what happens after.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll take it. Tell me what to do. Read the future on the fly if you can. We will go down one of the routes you saw where we didn\u2019t die and just change things on the move. If we end up dead then so be it. But at least we won\u2019t just sit here waiting to be slaughtered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ll never figure out anything if you sit around doing nothing huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s something Mr. Nobody told me. When I was too scared to leave my house back in Japan. Too afraid of my power. He stood there with his hand out, looking down on me like some god from heaven. He said, what do you wish to accomplish? Are you content to hide away from the world doing nothing? Wasting away into oblivion? You have a gift. A gift not many other people have. With it you can do a great deal of good if you so choose. Whether your power really is a gift or a curse is up to you to decide. But how can you decide if you don\u2019t use it? You will never figure out anything if you sit around doing nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI took his hand, afraid to see what visions would come. Afraid to see how he would die. But nothing came. It was the first time I had seen nothing at all when I touched another person. When I asked him how that was possible he grinned and said that he was a man that was part and yet apart from the flow of time. That I could not see his future because his future had not yet been decided. And now that I am here I have met someone else just like that, who is part and yet apart from the flow of time that I cannot see the future of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cInteresting. I\u2019d like to meet them both. But in order to do that we need to move. Tell me what to do and where to go. I\u2019ll follow your lead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut what if I end up killing us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I\u2019ll never forgive you for it. Now tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe clenched his fists and looked at the ground for a moment before sucking in a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cInto the bakery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grabbed Robin and opened the bakery door.</span></div></div>",

What can I get for you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOut the back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pushed past the backer, ignoring his words. When he turned to say something to me I saw Yuki chop him on the back of the neck, making him crumple to the ground. The back of the shop was full of the craft of bread making. Ovens, flour, dough, salt, utensils of all shapes and sizes. There was a woman making bread at one of the tables and she looked up in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are you doing back here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIgnore her. Go to the back door and count to twenty before opening it. As soon as you do there will be a man standing with his back to you on your left. Take him out and go that way to the end of the alley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ran over to the back door and began counting. When the woman lifted a rolling pin and started to get angry Yuki pointed his gun at her, shutting her up immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe will be gone in a moment ma\u2019am. Just be quiet and go about your day. We mean you no harm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t. Just forget you saw us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs soon as I got to twenty in my head I twisted the knob and pushed on the door. The man was there to the left just like he had said. I brought my arm around and smashed him into the wall from behind, making him drop to the ground unconscious. It was only a few quick steps to the alley mouth after that where I plastered myself against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait until my signal. When I say go, run across the street into the opposite alley. You have five seconds to do it. Think you can manage?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEasy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grabbed Robin around the waist with one arm and Yuki around the waist with the other. I saw his eyes had the glassy look I had seen before. Though he wasn\u2019t as stiff as a board this time. When he told me to go I lifted them both up and dashed for all I was worth for the designated spot. I was already setting them down after only three seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tContinuing to follow Yuki\u2019s directions we went in and out of buildings, some occupied some not. Ending up on rooftops and making jumps to other buildings like action heroes. Our route wasn\u2019t without danger of course. I had to knock four more people out and Yuki shot one in the arm when he jumped out a window at us. He was looking a bit green in the face but otherwise was holding up well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk. We\u2019re safe. I don\u2019t see anyone following us anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let out a sigh of relief as Yuki slid to the ground and leaned his head against the side of the building behind us. I glanced up and saw we were standing between the jailhouse and the police station and I began to grin stupidly. Seems I ended up here anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Yuki. Care to tell me exactly what\u2019s going on? You said yesterday the time wasn\u2019t right, well if this time isn\u2019t right I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWar. That\u2019s what it boils down to. There\u2019s this group called the Inquisition. They consider themselves some sort of holy crusaders. They think this world needs to be reformed. Humans are a disease to them. Something that has infected this world and needs to be purged. They believe they have been given a divine mission by god to cleanse everything. The only ones worthy of living are the \u201cevolved\u201d humans. Kickbacks like us. Though only if we share their ideals. If we don\u2019t want to join them we are considered \u201cinfected\u201d by the lower humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThough from what I know they don\u2019t want all humans to die. Only most of them. They hunt down those with latent kickback powers, intent on activating them or at the least breeding them into existence. They think if two kickbacks with different powers have a child that child can obtain both abilities. There is proof of this, since their leader has two abilities that Mr. Nobody knows of. The rest of humanity that they spare will become little more than slaves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd why exactly are they starting their fight here of all places? I mean Medusa City might be big, but it\u2019s not exactly the center of things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFrom what I know it is because of a prophesy of some sort. I think they have someone on their side with the ability to see the future like I can. But I think theirs is stronger than mine. This area is a place where a large number of kickbacks tend to gather for some reason. Though I don\u2019t know why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what? You are running around playing at a superhero all by yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHardly. Mr. Nobody is pulling together everyone and anyone he can get and trust to fight them. Police, kickbacks, regular people. Not everyone can know of course, and we have to be careful who we trust even among those we tell. People just aren\u2019t ready to accept those like us. Even among the non kickbacks helping us we are still held at arms length. They fear our power, fear we will switch to the other side. That\u2019s why we need to be careful what we say. There are corrupt cops that the enemy is using as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere are kickbacks in the ranks of the cops?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope. They are hypocrites. Claiming to detest regular humans yet still working with and using them. Don\u2019t ask me to figure out the minds of these people. All I know is they have started a war and they won\u2019t stop if we ask them nicely with sugar on top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo that\u2019s this Mr. Nobodies game huh? He wants me to join you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot at all. He gave me no such instructions to try and recruit you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you tell me all of this yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause he said it had to happen this way. If your sister hadn\u2019t been captured they would not contact you. Then he wouldn\u2019t have known what they were planning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis Mr. Nobody seems like a bit of an A******. Putting people in danger like that for his own selfish reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve seen humanity. That\u2019s all they are is selfish. Everyone is like that in some way shape or form. Manipulating and using others to get what they want. He might be a bit of an A****** like you say, but there is no questioning that he is effective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis body went ridged for a moment and I somehow knew he was having another vision. As his shoulders slumped he lifted the pistol in his hand and pointed it at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe fired a shot and I flinched instinctively. I could still feel the wind as the bullet whizzed past my ear. I turned quickly to see someone falling to the ground, blood flying out of the back of his head. The machine gun he was holding dropping from his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI killed him. I killed him! I didn\u2019t mean to, I just\u2026 killed him. There was no other way. You got to believe me! I didn\u2019t see another way! But I knew where to aim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYuki\u2019s eyes were wide with shock as he stared down at the weapon in his hand. He looked up at me as if looking for confirmation that he had done the right thing. As if he could find the answers in my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou did good. If you hadn\u2019t killed him he would have killed us right? And you can\u2019t do anything to stop these Inquisition people if you are dead right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah\u2026 Yeah. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s just\u2026 that was the first time I killed anyone. It seems worse because it was the first time I used my visions to do it as well. People die all the time right? And this is a war right? I mean people die in wars so this is only natural right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRight. Now pick yourself up and get moving. We can\u2019t sit here all day. Did your Mr. Nobody tell you where to go once you were safe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah. Yeah he did. There is a safe house. He told me to go there and lay low.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen let\u2019s move it. I\u2019d feel better if we weren\u2019t out in the open. I can take care of myself but I don\u2019t want my sister in any more danger if I can help it. I don\u2019t know about joining your little resistance or anything but right now these guys are trying to kill me and you aren\u2019t. So I\u2019ll stick with you for now until I get a better idea of just what the hell is going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah. Yeah. That\u2019s a good plan. Follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYuki still seemed to be in a bit of shock but was slowly snapping himself out of it. He headed off towards the man he had shot and past him quickly. Turning and walking down the road at a speed walk. On my way past I picked up the machine gun and the extra clip that I spied at the mans waist, cocking back the handle to make sure it was loaded as I followed behind my sister. I had no clue how to use it of course, but I was sure I would learn quickly. Just point and pull the trigger, it couldn\u2019t be that hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cI\u2019m liking this Richard fellow. Got a bit of brains in him. More than I can say about Zeulecus, the one who gave him that strength of his. I think your ancient Greeks called him Zeus. Shows how smart they were if they thought that idiot son of mine was wise. Who do you think taught the cavemen how to chose a woman? Yep Zeulecus. Just bash them over the head and drag them to a corner of the cave. Bet he hurt his head coming up with that idea too. I really should go check on him after this. I left him happily fighting the undead armies over on another world I created. Haven\u2019t heard from him in the last hundred years or so. Wonder if he is bored yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell enough of my musings. What do you want to do? Keep following our muscular man here or listen in on the mind of  our shocked seer? I mean really, getting so worked up about killing someone. It\u2019s not that hard and it\u2019s nothing to get upset over. Well to each his own. It\u2019s why I created you humans after all, to have free will and such varied personalities.\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Same with you Mrs. Robin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe got someone on our tail I take it? Someone with abilities?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. And if you look back you will trip and fall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nodded my head slightly as I continued to run next to Yuki and my sister. I didn\u2019t know what it was he saw but he had proven himself to me already. I would trust him with my life, even if anything he said might not make much sense to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI sidestepped to the right while running seconds before a line of what looked like black lightning shot forward and struck the air to my left. It would have hit me square in the head if I hadn\u2019t moved. I wanted to turn around to see who my opponent was but Yuki had said not to. I had to resist the urge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRichard, dodge to the left and Robin to the right in five\u2026 four\u2026 three\u2026 two\u2026 one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe split apart just as another bolt cracked the air between us. It was close enough to my arm to not only raise the hairs but also leave a lingering phantom of pain. I had a feeling if I got hit directly by one of these bolts I would either die or be withering on the ground in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe three of us continued to dodge the black whips being sent our way as we ran. Not once looking back. After only a few moments a guy that was almost as big as I was came charging like a bull down the street towards us. He was wearing a pink frilly dress and had his hair done up in twin pigtails. The eyeliner and lipstick making his already manly face and square jaw look even manlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYo! Cindy! What\u2019s up girl! What are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMa petite peche! I was told to come here by Nobody. Told you might have a bit of a pest problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI do. As you can see it\u2019s a cockroach that just won\u2019t leave us alone. Mind stomping it out for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFor you ma peche anything! I\u2019ll hug him and squeeze him and rip his cute little head off just for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis voice was a bit high and sweet up until the moment he said he would rip the guys head off. Then it became deep and dark like he had suddenly become possessed by a demon. Yuki nodded his thanks and mimed a high five while passing at a run, their hands never once coming close to touching. We left the big man behind to take care of our pursuer while Yuki led us farther away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho was that guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat was Cindy and she is a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo way! He had a six o\u2019clock shadow! His arms were bigger then mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s true. And don\u2019t let her hear you call her a him. She is very sensitive about her looks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI left it at that but privately I still though she was ugly as sin. Looking like she could scare the red out of the devil himself. Having taken one too many hits with the ugly bat. But if she was willing to fight on our side I wouldn\u2019t complain. Though I would still like to know who had been shooting at us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe finally made it to the hideout, a large three story house smack dab on the outskirts of the residential area. This was a case of hiding in plain sight. There were at least four or five house that looked exactly like this one within a one block radius. Even right down to the yellow coloring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYuki led us inside quickly, letting out a sigh of relief before sitting on the stairs. Robin was bent over panting heavily as well, at the limit of her endurance. It wasn\u2019t that we had run all that fast, but she wasn\u2019t used to this kind of distance running. Built more for shopping and doing her normal job of being a secretary. Yuki began to laugh a bit hysterically but I didn\u2019t know what was so funny. Perhaps the stress had just made him crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA tall distinguished man standing about six feet tall walked out of the back rooms, his cane tapping the floor to herald his presence. He had a white eye patch over his left eye and his right was a piercingly blue orb. It seemed to see deep into my soul as he came towards me. His beard was clean cut and squared off, revealing the edge of a cut that had healed on his chin and a faint line across his throat. His chest seemed to naturally puff out as he walked and his arms were well muscled and defined. I could instantly tell he was a brick powerhouse and could probably match me strength for strength easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMr. Nobody I take it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe gave a slight nod to me at my question, both for confirmation and greeting. Without warning I swung my fist at his face. He had made me jump through so many hoops and used me for his own ends I just had to punch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t even see him move. One moment he was in front of me, the next my fist was hitting empty air and he had a thin sword laying against my throat. I slowly opened my fist and held up my left hand in surrender. Almost nonchalantly he pulled the sword away and slid it back into his cane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI hope your anger is spent now. I\u2019m sure you must be ticked at me and that\u2019s understandable. But like it or not things had to happen the way they did. Even if you can\u2019t understand the reasons why. I\u2019d prefer not to get violent if we can at all help it. We might not be allies or friends, but we are all on the same side at the least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah fine. But next time you put my sister in danger like that I won\u2019t stop until you kill me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI would hope there not be a next time. I am trying very hard to prevent such a thing. Yuki. I\u2019ve got another job for you if you are willing. An easy one that won\u2019t involve much danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs that why you are here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOne of the reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure, what\u2019s the job?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI want you to go back up Willis. He\u2019s in room 404 of the Hilington hotel. The one a block away from City Hall. No need to rush, he won\u2019t need you for another three hours and no one will bother you on your way over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKamishiro nodded his head a moment before waving and leaving the house again. Mr. Nobody shook his head while he watch the boy go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe never was one to put things off. Even though I told him there was no rush. But he seems a bit different now. I guess throwing him into that situation on First street was the right call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait you knew about the ambush!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd you still sent him into it with my sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt was the one of the only surefire ways of making his power grow with little risk. Besides I had already planned to send you after them. I knew the three of you could escape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI really want to punch you right now. We are not some sort of chess piece you can move around as you wish!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course you are. In war there are generals and there are soldiers. Everyone can\u2019t be a general, the same as everyone can\u2019t be just a simple soldier. It is up to the generals to move the pieces most effectively to capture the opposition with minimal danger and losses to his side. Sometimes pieces have to be put in danger and risks taken to gain the advantage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a growl I threw another punch at his face. This time he didn\u2019t even move. My fist connected solidly with the side of his head. It was like punching a steel wall. His head didn\u2019t even move an inch but my knuckles were on fire. When I pulled my hand away I saw the skin along one of them had busted open to reveal the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFeel better now? If so can we move on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe pulled out a small jar of cream and motioned for me to give him my hand and I did so reluctantly. He pulled the cap off and spread a bit of the cream on my wounds. Almost instantly my flesh closed up and my hand was as good as new. The salve had even taken away the pain. I looked at it in surprise before looking up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m Nobody. Mr. Nobody. Nothing more and nothing less.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd what do you want from me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing. You already gave me the information I needed and you got your sister back. I would like you to join our cause of course, but I won\u2019t ask it of you. All our members have joined of their own free will. Only a few of them have I directly asked. Most ask us to join instead. You are free to go if you wish, or stay and we will shelter and hide you and your family without any obligations. Today is the start of a war. This town and the adjoining one will not be safe soon. We already have over three dozen families of members and non members under our care.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy go that far? Especially for people who won\u2019t fight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause we are all human. Fight or don\u2019t fight. We all still deserve to live. Those with power have an obligation to protect those without it. If I were to throw out everyone who was unwilling to fight, or unable to because they were weak, or old, or children, how are we any better then the Inquisition? We are named the Knights. That means more than just a name to me. Knights are defenders of the people. Swords and shields for the helpless. Beacons of hope and a light for the oppressed. We are everything the Inquisition is not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe walked past me and started up the stairs, his cane like a drumbeat on the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere is food in the kitchen if you are hungry. If you can wait a bit the cooks will have something ready for lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe only took two more steps before I called after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Mr. Nobody!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stopped at looked at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI really don\u2019t like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI get that a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut putting that aside, you need a strongman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure I could find use for one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned as he turned and continued up the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       <b><i>\u201cHey look over there! Another one of those rifts! Or is this the first one we\u2019ve seen? I forget. I think it is the second. No, no. definitely the first on Richards line. Last one was on Yuki\u2019s I think. It\u2019s your fault for not being able to see in the fourth dimension!\u201d</i></b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThis really wasn\u2019t all that bad. I needed to figure out a way to get my mom and sister to come over here for a bit without alarming them too much, but I had already seen how this city was starting to go to pot. Mr. Nobody and the rest of these Knights were doing a decent job of holding things together, and the other families under their protection seemed happy. Almost normal in their everyday lives. Treating this a bit like a vacation while at the same time knowing the seriousness of the situation. Those that couldn\u2019t fight or do anything directly beneficial to the cause helped how they could. Such as cooking and cleaning. When I had asked around unobtrusively I found they did it of their own free will, no one was expected to pay for their keep as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn fact these Knights were like one big messed up family. Some of them had powers, some of them didn\u2019t. There was bickering and a bit of distrust but also a sense that even if two people hated each other they would have each others backs. Robin was already starting to integrate herself with these people, well I suppose I should think of them as my people since I was a Knight now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI leaned back in my chair after finishing off some of the best spaghetti I had ever tasted. It had been a long time since I had been able to eat as much as I wanted until my stomach felt like it would explode. There were four others around the table aside from me and Robin. I didn\u2019t know them all that well or what their powers were but they seemed to be a pretty tight knit group the way they bantered with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMr. Nobody walked in, his eyes locking on our group a moment before heading in our direction. The other four saw him and gave a slight wave but didn\u2019t bother coming to attention like I had seen a few others do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh Jean! I finally found you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah right. I bet you knew where to look from the get go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMr. Nobody\u2019s lip curled up slightly. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what do you want boss? Got a job for us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI do indeed. One I think is suited to your teams unique skill set. I got word that the Inquisitions leader is going to go out recruiting. I\u2019ll be leaving to try and stop him. But this does open up an opportunity for us. My sources say they are having a celebration tonight and will all be gathered in one place. I want you and your team to go party crash. Force them to relocate and set them back a bit. They have prisoners they are using as breeding stock being held there as well. If we can put them on the run, there is a chance to save many of them. Perhaps even capture a few for information.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSounds easy enough. I take it you are going to leave Myste in charge while you are gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWith you as second if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAn honor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at Mr. Nobody a moment narrowing my eyes in speculation before speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThese are the people that kidnapped Robin right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMind if I go too then? I want to get a bit of payback.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUp to Jean here. This is his mission now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t mind. I can get a chance to see what the rookie can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMr. Nobody nodded and walked away, leaving the six of us still sitting at the table. Jean wasn\u2019t a big man like me but he had muscles. Not the gross bulging muscles of a bodybuilder that did nothing but lift weights all day. His was the muscles of a hard working man. And his slightly weather worn face showed it. He was probably pushing forty but his hair was already starting to turn grey. I found it a bit fascinating though that his hair wasn\u2019t one color like most peoples, it was three shades that I could see. Black, brown and red intermingled with the white, giving him a very odd first impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLike the hair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy hair. You were staring at it so intently. You like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I just thought it looked a bit strange.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I get that a lot. It comes from using my ability. I\u2019ve just grown used to it so it don\u2019t bother me anymore. So rookie, what is your power anyway? Or don\u2019t you have one? It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t I\u2019m not like some of the others that got a problem with it. In fact Mac here aint got a lick of it but we haven\u2019t booted him from the team for that yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOne of the guys to the left with black hair and glasses raised two fingers in greeting before going back to sipping his coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStrength. Insane strength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCool. Can\u2019t wait to see it in action. Joker over here is an illusionist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t call me Joker! My name is Johnathan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRight, right. Sorry I forgot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou did not! You did it on purpose!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust a slip of the tongue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJoker\u201d was a flame haired boy who couldn\u2019t be more than thirteen or fourteen. Scrawny and gangly, he hadn\u2019t grown completely into his body yet. His freckled face turned beat red until it almost matched his hair before he folded his arms and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnyways Jok\u2026. Johnathan as I said is an illusionist and Mary over there is\u2026 well its kind of hard to explain what Mary is exactly. Her power isn\u2019t exactly like ours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe means my power doesn\u2019t fit into a single category like the rest of yours does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked over at Mary sitting next to me. She too was a surprise. When I had first seen her I had thought she was a grade schooler. A misconception she quickly dismissed when she lit up a cigarette and told me she was twenty three. She had the body and looks of an eight year old, barely topping four feet tall with big childlike eyes. Her pure white hair was long and curly, almost dragging the floor. Her green eyes seemed to be able to look into your very soul when she stared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy power comes from a Nine tailed fox spirit. So I do a bit of illusion and a bit of trickery but mostly I am energy. That\u2019s the best way to describe it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEnergy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ll see later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked back at Jean, raising my eyebrow in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what\u2019s your power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMetal. I can bend metal at will. Iron, copper, refined, raw. If it\u2019s a metal from the periodic table I can manipulate it with my bare hands and my will. Melting, smelting and reforming it within the space of a few seconds. I\u2019m a descendant of Hephaestus, the Greek god of the forge. As such my body is my forge. My breath my bellows, and my will the fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe picked up his fork and held it up for me to see. He sucked in his breath, letting it out slowly. As I watched the fork melted as if by an incredible heat, reforming into a tiny silver colored rose. He passed it across the table for me to inspect. Upon examination I could see it was really a rose and not just an illusion over a fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlready refined metals are easier to control, most of the impurities have already been pulled out of it. When I pull raw stuff from the ground it takes a bit longer because I have to refine it myself. It was a great skill when I worked in the steel mills before they shut down. And like all abilities, it comes down to stamina. The bigger and stronger the thing I make, the more stamina it takes. It\u2019s a good balancer, makes you invested in working out if you want to make your power stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJean pushed his chair back and stood up, looking around the table at each of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I\u2019m going to go see what information I can get out of Mr. Nobody about the lay of the land for this mission. Also talk to Sara and the other seers, see if they can tell me anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone waved farewell with a good natured insult chasing him out of the room. Once he was gone Mary looked at me with an grin plastered on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t let him fool you. He may act all meek and mild like that but he is a real monster. Probably the strongest of us after Mr. Nobody and Myste. He has the nickname The Diamond Knight for a reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \tStaring off at the door where Jean had left I began to wonder just what I was going to see later on today. Just what had I gotten myself into? Robin put her hand on top of mine and I absently covered it with my right. She was telling me to be careful without saying anything. A fact I already knew but it was good to be reminded of it by her. I loved her, but I knew it would never work out. So I would hide my feelings and continue on like normal. We were and could only be brother and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cOh an epic battle! A showdown of kickback versus kickback! Five against an untold number! This is so exhilarating! Exciting!

Take things as they come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo we wing it just like we usually do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow is that any different than my plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe walk into it instead of run.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI feel so much more confident now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHa! Welcome to the Knights rookie. Where we have no clue what we are doing but we pretend we do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJean took the lead, pushing open the mansion gate and heading down the gravel path towards the house. I hadn\u2019t even known there was a mansion around here. It had been so well hidden by the trees in an out of the way corner on the outskirts of town. We didn\u2019t make it far in when the gates closed on their own behind us and a giant eight foot tall monster stepped out of the wood line cracking his knuckles. He looked like a cross between a man and a bear, the way his skin was covered in brown fur and he had beady black eyes over a small snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLooks like I\u2019m first pick here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCareful rookie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease when it comes to pure strength no one can beat me. Besides, I fought him before. He just looks big and scary. His strength comes from taking on animal attributes. It\u2019s not his own. Isn\u2019t that right Harry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe snout opened in a snarl, showing pointed teeth, but a very human voice came out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRichard. This won\u2019t be like last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll beat the snot out of you faster this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bear-man lumbered towards me as I cocked back my right fist and ran forward, letting out a growl of challenge. He swiped his right paw in my direction just as I skidded to a stop and twirled on my foot, letting the strike swing harmlessly in front of me. Around his exposed side I went, throwing all my weight into my first punch. The blow hit him solidly in the kidney making him roar in pain. Bending my knees I jumped into the air, catching him squarely under the chin with my left fist. As he spun around dizzily I jumped again to grab him around the neck, shoving his chin into my right shoulder as I slammed back to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let his unconscious body fall at my feet as the bear form began to shrink and return to his normal five foot ten inch stick figure frame. Dusting my hands off I turned to the rest of the group giving them a small bow and putting out my hand to beckon them forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe mansion awaits. Please enter as you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot bad rookie. Not bad at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe names Richard, not rookie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot bad Richard. I like you. I think you will fit in just fine with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe continued on our way, almost making it to the front steps when we were met by an army of what looked like zombies. Mary stepped forward with a sweet innocent smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll handle these guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs you wish milady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJean and the others stepped back a few steps. I  just stood there wondering what she was going to do. Mac grabbed me by the collar and pulled me back, standing on the tips of his toes to whisper in my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt aint safe to stand so close. You might get burned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAhead of us the zombies began to shamble forward. Out of nowhere a white fox tail appeared, sliding out from under Mary\u2019s shirt. Then a second and a third. All three of them looked as soft as clouds as they waved back and forth in an invisible breeze. Soon there was a fan of nine tails all waiving as one, and a visible aura of blue energy in a bubble around her that caused us all to back farther away. She began to grow as well, turning from a short four foot tall girl into a five and a half foot beauty with a chest to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNine tails huh? She must be showing off for you rookie, sorry, Richard. She could easily finish this with two. They are just dead things after all. Mary didn\u2019t even raise her hands or anything, simply walked right towards the army. When the blue bubble around her touched a zombie it turned to ash. Within seconds there was nothing but a pile of dust around her. She turned and gave me a wink with eyes that were now more fox like and whiskers growing from her cheeks. I felt my jaw beginning to drop as I stood entranced by her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shrunk down into her normal childlike body as the tails disappeared and the rest of the group started laughing at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGo easy on the kid Mary. Even a hardened veteran could get caught up in that enchantment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey don\u2019t call her the ethereal vixen for nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat? I couldn\u2019t get shown up by the newbie now could I? Besides I can\u2019t help it my natural enchanting power increases the more tails I pull out. You should all be thanking me for the free show. I should make you pay for the dreams you are going to have tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnything but that! I\u2019d be broke in a heartbeat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe four of them laughed and continued on into the house as I shook myself out of my stupor. As I hurried to catch up I thought they were nothing like I was expecting them to be on a job like this. They acted like this was just some walk in the park, not an important mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we walked Mac would periodically launch little mechanical flies into the air. Each one sent information back to him which he picked up on a sort of radar he wore over one eye like a broken pair of sunglasses. Their dark surface making it almost look like he was wearing an eye patch. With his guidance he directed us towards the back of the house and away from any obvious traps. When we got to the back door Jean cracked his neck and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRight. Now we run in and smash everything. I don\u2019t know who or what we will find out there but be on your toes. Mary, think you got it in you to shoot a cannonball?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease who do you take me for? Those zombies weren\u2019t even a warm up. I\u2019m still bursting with energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust what I wanted to hear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJean clenched his fist a moment before throwing them out to the walls on either side. When he brought them together metal of all shapes and sizes came flying towards us. Steel beams ripped out of the walls, pipes and bars came from the floor, even pulling in silverware and mirror frames. He rotated his hands while inhaling deeply. Quickly breathing in and out. With each breath the metal began to turn red hot, melting and fusing together into the shape of a cannonball as big as I was. He finished making it in only a minute, its exterior surface glossy and shiny like it had just come from a forge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJean backed away, the large black ball sitting on the ground in front of Mary who grew out two tails. She too inhaled a deep breath, her head thrown back as if she was about to yell at the ball with all her might. She did yell, but no sound came out. Instead a giant blast of blue energy smashed into the ball and sent it flying like it had been shot out of a cannon. The ball smashed into the door, taking the entire wall with it, shooting out into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI began to run forward, suddenly realizing there were now at least a hundred people running all around me. I looked around and saw Joker giving me a thumbs up and a smirk. I knew then that these men and women were all illusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOff in the distance I thought I saw Yushihito getting to his feet and helping a woman to hers. No. That was impossible. He might be a bit of a dirt bag but he would never join a group like this. I didn\u2019t have time to get another look to make sure though as I dodged a projectile someone threw at me. A rock came flying at Mary\u2019s head and I leapt forward, stopping it in mid flight with an open palm and shoving it back towards the enemy.  She threw a ball of energy at it, turning it into a dozen or more smaller chunks which struck like bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEveryone fall back! Johan! Get us out of here! Take us to the secondary base!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes Lady Mirror!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe ground in front of us rolled like water seconds before splitting and rising like someone had made two giant hands to lift it as easily as a rug. It rose ten feet over our heads, curling over us and blotting out the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGather together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJoker dropped his illusions as we all packed around Jean who was already breathing heavily. I saw liquid metals rising out of the ground and falling from the earth right over our heads. Even as the dirt began to fall in an attempt to crush us the molten metal formed a bubble around us and began to cool. The stones pummeled the shield as Jean stood there with his legs braced and his hands cupped in a dome shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe grumbling of earth settled and everything was quiet outside. I couldn\u2019t hear cheers of celebration or anything. Jean turned his hands up like he was praying before parting them. The top of the dome split and parted in time with his moving hands, the metal almost a living thing under his manipulation. After boosting everyone up and out of the hole I jumped up myself. Mary grabbed my arm one handed and lifted me up like I weighed nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking around, the place was empty. The enemy had retreated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell not quite how I was expecting to end things, but a win is a win. Lets go find those prisoners.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe all agreed to that plan, making our way back through the giant hole we had created.</span></div></div>",

I had already long since dropped my disguise, I had no more need for it after all. Though I still had the cane, I kind of liked it actually. Made me look more gentlemanly. Anna's full head of blond hair bounced up and down as her mother shook her back and forth. Both of them were crying enough tears to raise a river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweetie I missed you so much! I never gave up on you! I searched for so long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blue eyes turned to see Cri'sa who was standing a slight distance away, letting her have her time with her mother.

Sometimes that knowledge was the only thing that kept me sane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let go of Cri'sa's neck and turned, taking the few steps needed to stand right before me. Her eyes met mine as if searching for something. Finally she lowered them to the ground while taking a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Reesin. I had a lot of time to think while trapped inside my head. I spent a lot of time hating you and Renna and everybody. But I've come to realize I got into this position because of my own actions. You had every right to kill me for what I had done but you didn't. You spared my life. I know it was mainly because of the past you shared with my mom but I'm still grateful you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither Renna nor I were completely right or completely wrong in the way we handled things. I was a bit crazy, I realize that now. Renna even tried to make up with me but I was too far gone in my own fear to listen. I guess what I'm trying to say is, thank you for giving me this time to think and for helping break me out of it. Also I'm sorry for the way I acted and I hope you can forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at the girl, still only sixteen on the outside, though almost twenty one on the inside. Laying my hand gently on her head I gave it a little rub. She smiled tentatively back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna. I've lived a very long time. Almost a hundred and twenty years now. I've spent more time inside these realities then I have in the real world. Sometimes I still get surprised when I go out there and see my daughter isn't even twenty years old yet. I've learned the value in letting go. Holding onto grudges does no good and only hurts myself more in the long run. I've had a lot longer than you to work out my feelings on the matter. And I forgave you a very long time ago. I simply did not return you to normal before this because of my principals and the fact that it was your mother's punishment to find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you uncle Chris!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped her arms around my waist, planting her face in my chest before beginning to cry all over again. I folded my arms around her and stroked her hair gently while she cried herself out. Finally she pushed away slightly and looked up at me while still holding on tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you think Renna will forgive me too? I did such horrible things to her and said some really nasty stuff. Do you think she would be willing to be my friend again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But I'll help you talk to her if that's what you want. I'm sure she feels just as guilty at being unable to make up with you. She's nineteen now you know. And an intergalactic idol with three hit songs currently topping the charts. Plus she has a little four year old girl of her own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to meet them.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tYuki meaning snow. Kami meaning god or lightning and shiro meaning white. Yes my name certainly fit me. Though how much of a god I really was could be questioned. I had received these visions ever since I could remember. The terror of the things I had seen had scared the color out of my hair. I had to use hair dye just to look halfway normal. Even then it started turning again after only a few days. I really detested this power. To know what was going to happen and rarely being able to change any of it. It made me feel so powerless. It was better not knowing. Better to think it was all random chance. Not a cascade of events that had started hours or days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stood in the shadows alongside the police station. I was no hero. But when I saw a vision of something I could change I had to try my best to change it. To make up for the million other times I could do nothing but watch. Thirty seconds. I silently counted down in my head, hearing the door creaking open at twenty seven seconds. Three seconds to let the officer walk away before I slithered around the corner, my back pressed against the wall. The cop was right in front of me, so close I could spit on him but he never turned around. I knew he wouldn\u2019t turn around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let my foot slide back a fraction to stop the door from locking on me. But enough to make a clanking sound, fooling the cop into thinking the door had locked like it should. Quietly I stood there in the open until the cop walked away, oblivious to my presence. Once he was gone I backed into the door and entered the weapons shed. My hand snaked up and quickly entered the disarm code on the alarm. Once that was done I turned to face the empty room at large. There were three cameras in this room, the only blind spot was right where I was standing inside the door. There wasn\u2019t normally a blind spot here but that crooked cop had altered the angles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTwo minutes. Just stand for two minutes and wait. Let the visions guild you Yuki. You are a god. The snow white god. No one can touch you. You followed the visions halfway around the world and they haven\u2019t let you down yet have they? I concentrated, focusing on the mental image of a window like my mother had taught me. Opening the window let the visions in like a cool summer breeze. I focused my thoughts, seeing visions of the next five minutes to know exactly what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGod had a really messed up sense of humor. Giving both me and my mother this ability. Other kickbacks had the power lay dormant for generations. Yet without fail every generation of my family had someone with this curse. I had seen how my mother would die every time I touched her. It was my earliest memory of her. Not a smile or anything happy, it was the knowledge that she would be hit by a car when I was five years old. And she had known how I would die the moment she held me seconds after I was born. Truly a horrible joke. Having her afraid to even touch me for fear of seeing yet more visions. Being afraid to touch her for the same fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had warned her about the car. But the next time I had touched her the vision had changed. This time being hit by a train. I could hold it off for a little bit with warnings but I had learned death was an inevitability. You couldn\u2019t cheat it. If you are meant to die on a certain day then you will die on that day. So I had learned to keep my mouth shut. No one wanted to hear how they would die. They found happiness in their own ignorance. A happiness I could give them by saying nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe lights suddenly went out as the power was cut. Quickly I dashed  across the floor and slipped through the door the cop had left unlocked. I ran to the back of the warehouse and hid behind a large pile of empty boxes. I just got under cover when the sound of the door opening and three bodies entering. In my minds eye I saw what was happening just like in my vision. They began to plant C-4 all around the room. Hidden under the counter and behind stands of weapons. Stealing wasn\u2019t their mission, though a few of them would pocket a few guns. It was to simply plant enough explosives to take out this police station and a city block or two. Enough to start a war. The door opened and the three entered the warehouse area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey would be here for another three minutes and then they would leave. I would then have another ten minutes to disarm all the bombs and leave before the power came back on. All I had to do was sit and be quiet. They would never find me. I had to trust in the visions. So I sat quietly. A few footsteps came close as the three silently worked but none of them found me. So far so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSilently counting the seconds off in my head I waited for the three minutes to be up. At almost exactly one hundred and eighty seconds the footsteps all began to move away. My visions had proved true once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuddenly the boxes in front of me were shoved out of the way and a hand grabbed me up. What the hell was going on? This wasn\u2019t in the vision! I looked around frantically and saw there were four men and not three. Where had this fourth one come from? Why hadn\u2019t I seen him in my mind? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLooks like we caught a little rat just like the boss said we would. Hello little rat. Sorry you can\u2019t scamper back into your hole.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe began to laugh as I grabbed his arm wildly in an attempt to get out of his grip. Visions flashed into my head. He was holding me like he was now and suddenly a bullet went through his brain, splattering me with blood seconds before the other three went down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe vision ended just as quickly as it had started and I blinked rapidly to pull myself back to the present. He began to turn his head when it jerked to the side. Just like in my vision the side of his head exploded outward as the bullet ripped through his skull. I felt blood and brains splatter my face just as I heard three more whizzing sounds that dropped the other three masked men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo what you have to do. You still have nine minutes. I\u2019ll clean up afterwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked around wildly for the source of the voice. But it seemed to echo from everywhere. I could try to get a vision of who it was but if he didn\u2019t show his face the vision wouldn\u2019t show me anything. I stood there wondering what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEight minutes child of the seer. If you can\u2019t do it then leave. It will mean more work for me but I\u2019ll disarm the bombs myself. Though it is supposed to be you who disarms them in this flow of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked around one last time before finally running to the first bomb and yanking out the wires. I went about my task with single minded intensity. Guided by the visions I knew every place to look. Finally the last bomb was disarmed and I was slipping out the door just as the outside lights started coming back on. I let out a bit of breath as I jogged back to the small apartment I lived in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat was going on here? My visions were never wrong. They were always accurate. Yet they hadn\u2019t revealed the fourth man. Nor the shooter. Hadn\u2019t revealed me getting found out either. Could the enemy already have gotten a hold of the power of prophesy? Somehow countering my ability with his own? If that was the case I needed to up the time table as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat strange man with the eye patch over his left eye had given me this chance to change the world. He had been the only one who\u2019s future I couldn\u2019t see. It was like he existed outside the flow of time. I had been able to touch him and not see his death. Not see anything at all. Yet he had saw me. He had saved me from death. He must have the same power as I did just stronger. He had asked that I live. Asked that I help him change the world with him. It had been the first time I had really thought I could so such a thing. That\u2019s why I had been willing to fly here from Japan. He had even given me some sort of translation magic as well because he believed in me. I had to believe he knew what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\t\u201cThe plot thickens. Isn\u2019t that what you mortals say? Or perhaps it would be more apt to say the games afoot. Who were these masked men? This mysterious shooter? Even this one eyed mystery man for that matter. What devious plots brought this \u201cSnow White God\u201d to these lands? What is it he sees and knows that you do not? Shall we continue following him to find out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOr perhaps you are worried about one of the others. Are their stories even related to this one? Well we can guess that Richard's is, but is Chris or Chel related to this story in any way? I don\u2019t know. Well I do but I am not going to tell you. I mean don\u2019t you find this exciting? Don\u2019t you wish you could go back in time to find out? Or have the ability to see into all their minds at once?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you don\u2019t! And don\u2019t even think I will give you that power either! Well, if you figure out who I am hiding in perhaps I could give you that power if you wished for it. Though why would you wish for something like that when you could have anything at all? So what do you want to do?\u201d<br>\r\n</b></i></span></div></div>",

Will you be ma petite peche?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI quickly dodged out of the way as a six foot two hairy man built like a weight lifter in a blue frilly dress and high heals tried to grab me up in a bear hug. He came at me again with his lips puckered and again I dodged under his embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right. I don\u2019t think he appreciates your hello.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh no, no, no! I am heartbroken!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMr. Nobody came out of the living room scratching the skin under his left eye absently. The white eye patch he was wearing today beating lightly against his knuckles. I quickly went over to him and nodded to the guy in drag with my head, lowering my voice to a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho is this guy? I assume he is another member of our growing group. But what\u2019s his deal anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMr. Nobody grinned and held out his hand to the man who was now standing politely in front of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYuki Kamishiro. Please meet Cindy Santala. She is the newest member of out group and she will be very important to our cause.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait, this is a girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWoman actually but yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut she has a six o\u2019clock shadow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I was born this way ok! I know I\u2019m ugly! I\u2019m horrible! I\u2019m useless! A blight on humanity! No one ever thinks I\u2019m pretty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe turned and ran off up the stairs, her hands covering her eyes as she began to bawl. Each footstep sounding like a cannon going off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow look what you did. You made her cry. She\u2019s very sensitive about her looks you know. You should know by now not to judge someone just by their looks alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026Sorry. I was just surprised.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I\u2019m going out. I need to get a few things done in preparation for tomorrow. Johnny and Samantha are out back. There is another guy named Willis that\u2019s out on a job right now. You will meet him later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right, later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe shoved on his shoes, grabbing his cane from next to the door before leaving. He didn\u2019t need the cane, but it gave him the air of a refined gentleman when added to his slightly graying hair. Plus the cane had a sword hidden inside of it. I knew from experience he was quite adept with it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKicking off my shoes I headed for the kitchen, making myself a quick peanut butter sandwich to stave off the small bit of hunger. I tried to clear my mind and listen to the news on the radio but I just couldn\u2019t concentrate. After the third time of having the ticking of the clock intrude and break my meditation I gave it up as a lost cause. I knew what was wrong. It was that Cindy woman. I needed to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh I headed up to my room, opening my dresser drawer and pulling out the box of cookies inside. These were special chocolate ones I had brought from Japan with me. I hadn\u2019t found anything like them anywhere around here and their taste was heavenly. With my peace offering in hand, I quickly found what door was hers by using my powers and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCindy? Mind if I come in for a moment? I\u2019d like to apologize!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGo away! You\u2019re a big meanie! A big fat poopy head!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMeanie? Poopy head? What was she, like six years old?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease? Look, I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have judged you. I know what it\u2019s like to be judged and I know I don\u2019t like it either. I brought some special cookies from my home country as a peace offering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was silence a moment before the door opened a crack and a red rimmed eye peeked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally? You won\u2019t say mean things to me anymore? Or make fun of me anymore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally. I\u2019d like to talk and get to know you a little better if we will be working together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe door opened the rest of the way and she stepped back to let me in. Inside was like stepping into a war zone where cute had taken over everything. Pink covers, fluffy pillows with lace, teddy bears and stuffed animals everywhere. Pictures of boys on the walls. It was like an adolescent girls bedroom gone wild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe sat on the bed with her shoulders hunched, looking dejected and alone. Silently I handed her the box of cookies and sat in the chair at her desk, spinning around to watch her thoughtfully. She opened the box and took a bite of one of the cookies, her eyes lighting up as a look of bliss crossed her face. She still looked like a butch guy in drag wearing a dress but I could now make out the more feminine aspects. I had encountered a lot of strange people so far and she wasn\u2019t even the strangest. It was just her looks had caught me off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAgain sorry about what I said. It was really thoughtless of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer hand stopped with a cookie halfway to her mouth. She looked at the floor a moment before lowering the snack back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou think I\u2019m strange don\u2019t you? Now that you have seen my room. You probably think, what\u2019s a grown woman acting like a little girl for. But I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s sort of part of my power. I can\u2026 control things. I put a little bit of myself in them and make them move. But because it activated in me when I was so young my body grew faster than my mind. Now even though I am always me I switch between Old Cindy and Young Cindy. It gets worse when I get emotional.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wasn\u2019t actually thinking that at all. I was wondering though if you were going to eat all those cookies without sharing any of them with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer face brightened up as she offered me the open end of the box. I carefully pulled out a cookie, making sure not to touch her hand. I took a bite, chewing it thoughtfully as I wondered how to proceed. I knew I had to be careful, I didn\u2019t know what might set her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you mind showing me your power? You said you can control things. You mean like people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve never tried it with people, though I suppose it would work. It would just take a lot more effort.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe reached over and grabbed a giant stuffed teddy bear. Her hands glowed for a moment before the bear began to move on its own. She continued to go on talking while the bear did cartwheels and mimed kung-fu moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDepending on how complex the thing I control is depends on how much of my power I have to use. Something like this uses very little. But something with gears or lots of moving parts takes much more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan you make things talk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf they have a working mouth yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs there a range to it or any limit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOnce I posses something I can go as far as I want with it. Though my control over it will become weaker after about half a mile. I can put a bit of myself into something without activating it and just let it sit there until I want to use it. But once I call the power back or the possessed item is destroyed I need to touch it again. What\u2019s your power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can see the future. Only about five minutes into the future though when I do it myself. But sometimes they just come to me out of the blue and then it could be what will happen seconds from now or days from now. Longest I saw was two weeks into the future when I get those attacks. I also see peoples personal futures when I touch them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWill you tell me my future!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. Because I also see how they die when I touch them. I don\u2019t like witnessing that. It feels like a part of me dies when they do. Because I don\u2019t just see it happen I feel it happen. It is the only time I feel what happens in my visions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan\u2019t you tell them how they are going to die and then they can change it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I tried. Many times. It never works. The only thing that changes sometimes is the manner in which they die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou have it rough in your own way too don\u2019t you? Not being able to touch people. Must be hell trying to get in a relationship with someone. Knowing how they will die, seeing visions of them being unfaithful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a grin which I returned. I hadn\u2019t actually meant to say it like that but it seemed to make her feel better. Validation that she was a woman I guess. I got up and gave her a wave goodnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEnjoy the cookies. I need to get up early for a job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh? Where to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI need to go to church.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t seem like the praying kind of man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not. But I\u2019ll still talk to him while I am there. Perhaps a few choice words will reach his ears for the crappy life he dumped on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll see you around then. And thanks for cheering me up ma petite peche.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks for letting me in to cheer you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I was closing the door on her she blew me a kiss. I made sure the door was firmly shut between us before I let go of my shudder. I could get used to her looks in time, but that still looked too much like a guy blowing me a kiss for my comfort.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tJust like Mr. Nobody had said the back of the church was completely unguarded. I used my power just in case, but found the back entrance and the basement room inside completely empty. Five minutes from now Mr. Nobody would begin his attack, covering our escape with the other members of the Knights. He hadn\u2019t been able to guarantee a route free of opposition but he had guaranteed very little of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI liked the sound of our name. The Knights. Mr. Nobody had said if the enemy wanted to call themselves the inquisition it was only right we take a page from their book and name ourselves after a group that opposed them. I wasn\u2019t sure what group that was but it didn\u2019t matter to me. It still had a nice ring to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ran to the back door and into the basement without a sound. Raised stage to the left, a staircase going upstairs to the right and a raised floor ringing half this room. Up the three small steps to that raised balcony area and into the janitors closet. Quickly turn the hidden switch and push the button to make the secret door swing out so I could dash down the steps. The small grating sound as the door closed again behind me was both reassuring and ominous. Three minutes before it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI navigated the catacombs quickly, making a beeline for the secret room. So far Mr. Nobody had been spot on about everything. So I had no doubt I would find Richard\u2019s older half sister Robin tied up and gagged in that room. I hid against the wall right before turning the last corner. I let my mind go blank and called forth the visions, seeing the two guards in my minds eye. I played out every scenario in the space of a few breaths. Most of them got me killed. Of the ones that didn\u2019t I got seriously hurt. I kept shifting through the possible futures until I found the one I wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI wished my ability to see the future wasn\u2019t so confusing and headache inducing like this when I called it up myself. Opening the window in my mind showed me every possible outcome of every possible choice at every possible time. When they came unbidden or when I touched someone it was only a single timeline that then became set in stone. Did I make that timeline a reality by touching them? Or was it some action that would happen no matter what? I didn\u2019t like to think about it too hard. I had a hard enough time staying sane with the parts of my power I could control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI counted to three and ran out of cover as fast as I could. Heading straight for the two guards. For this brief few seconds both of them had their backs turned to each other looking off into the darkness of two adjoining tunnels. As I got between them I raised my hands and chopped down hard on the backs of their necks. Aiming for and hitting the knot of nerves there. Any higher or lower and they wouldn\u2019t be knocked out. Both of them crumpled to the floor and lay flat on their backs, their minds off in La La Land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that out of the way I pulled out my knife and entered the room. Seeing the woman in the chair just like I knew I would. Her eyes went wide at the sight of me and she began to struggle against her bonds. I put my finger to my lip but that didn\u2019t seem to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRelax. I\u2019m here to rescue you. I know your brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat seemed to calm her down a bit as I got closer to her. I was about to bend over and cut her ropes when I was assaulted by a vision of the future. It was seconds from now. There was a man standing in the door right behind me with a gun pointed at my head. He pulled the trigger and the world went black. I knew he had killed me even as the vision let me go. Without thinking, I grabbed Robin\u2019s chair and threw her to the ground with me. I heard the pfft of air as the bullet left the silencer a split second before it struck the opposite wall. Quickly I got on my knees and raised my hands in surrender as he trained the weapon on me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t shoot! I\u2019m one of the good guys! I\u2019m here to rescue the girl. I assume that\u2019s what you are here for as well? Your name\u2019s Chris right? He said you might come. I\u2019m Yuki Kamishiro. But we can save the explanations for later. Right now we need to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter a moment where I could feel every bead of sweat on my brow he swung his weapon away with a grunt. As he turned to the door to watch for any enemies I began cutting the ropes on the girl. He was silent a moment before asking me how I had taken care of the guards. I told him as simply as I could. When he asked why I hadn\u2019t killed them I deflected a bit, telling him it hadn\u2019t been needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou ever kill anyone before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026 No.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I took care of them for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou mean you killed them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. I\u2019ve learned not to leave potential threats alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI took a quick breath as I gripped the knife tightly for a moment before sawing through the last bit of rope. The woman wasted no time in getting to her feet and ripping the gag from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChris! Just what the hell is going on here? I suddenly get kidnapped, blindfolded and brought to this dingy underground room. Where are we and just who are you to talk about killing people so easily?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo time for explanations. Leave it at they want your brother\u2019s power and they kidnapped you to get it. But this place is dangerous. The people who took you are in a war with another group who will send this place up in flames shortly. We need to get out now. So just keep quiet and follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s right. There\u2019s more to the story obviously but he covered it in a nutshell. This place is going to explode in about ten minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe seemed to know quite a bit about what was going on. Did he get visions like me? Whatever the case he slipped out into the hall and I followed him along with the woman. I felt a bit nauseous at seeing the bodies but I tried to ignore them as best I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou got a weapon aside from that knife?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I don\u2019t need any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat won\u2019t fly with me. I\u2019d feel safer if you had something to defend yourself with at range. Not all enemies will let you get close enough for a karate chop to the neck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen he held out the weapon in his hand to me I put my hands up while shaking my head. I didn\u2019t want that thing. I had never touched a gun before in my life. He let out an exasperated sigh and grabbed my hand, shoving the hilt into my palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally easy. Just point in the general direction and pull the trigger. It doesn\u2019t matter right now if you hit anything or not. They will take cover as long as it is pointing in their general direction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI winced, expecting to see visions. But none came. I stared at my hand and then at him in surprise. This was the second time this had ever happened. I had found another one. He was safe to touch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re just like him! I can\u2019t see you! You exist but at the same time you don\u2019t! You\u2019re outside the flow of time!\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe turned as if ignoring my words, continuing back towards the stairwell. He halted just before we rounded the corner and motioned for us to wait quietly. I activated my visions, seeing the two guys just out of sight. When he ran around the corner in my minds eye I shut it down. I knew he was going to kill them, I didn\u2019t need to see it happen. Seconds later he ran around the corner for real. Coming back in less than a minute to have us follow him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe made it back into the janitors closet without incident. I could hear the sounds of fighting in the main area upstairs. Chris pulled out another pistol and waited at the door without doing anything. The moment the handle began to turn he slammed the door open, knocking the woman outside back. Shoving the weapon under her chin he pulled the trigger without hesitation, the sound of the shot being covered by the sudden onslaught of a sub machine gun being fired upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan you see the future too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou could say that I guess. Though this is a future I have never seen. Now enough chatter. We aren\u2019t out of here yet. Now we run.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll three of us made a mad dash for the door. Chris outpaced us and had it opened by the time we got there. A vision popped into my head right as I was about to go through. It lasted only a second but it was enough. Without thinking I swung around and fired at the man just coming down the steps, hitting him in the leg just above the knee. Chris finished him off as he started to get up. After that we simply ran. It didn\u2019t take long to get away, just a few blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThought you said you had never shot a gun before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell that was a pretty accurate shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI knew he was going to be there, I saw where I had to aim. It was nothing special.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNext time aim for the heart, head, or throat. Shoot to kill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t want there to be a next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSuit yourself. But that kind of thinking will get you killed one of these days. But now that we are out of the woods for the moment, how bout you tell me just what the hell is going on. Why were you there? Who am I just like? Why is the timelines so screwed up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis phone began to buzz then and he quickly glanced at it before gritting his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGod **** stupid woman! Can\u2019t she follow just a simple request? Why now of all times!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked at me and then at Robin before motioning with his head for us to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGet out of here. I\u2019ll find you later. And when I do I want answers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen I tried to hand the pistol back to him he shook his head seconds before beginning to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKeep it. You might need it later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that he ran off, leaving me and the woman alone again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tGo to Peach and First and wait there. That\u2019s what Mr. Nobody had said. There is a bakery at that intersection. Take the girl there and simply wait. It won\u2019t be long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI snuck a peek around the corner yet again just to make sure, but the snipers on the roof and the ones in the windows didn\u2019t magically disappear. Had he known about this too? He couldn\u2019t have. He wouldn\u2019t have let me walk into a trap like this. This ambush only confirmed my suspicions that the enemy had someone able to see the future just like me. That was the only explanation as to why I hadn\u2019t seen this coming. Their seer was more powerful than me or at least more skilled. Able to hide the manipulating he did from other seers like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI kept sneaking a peek at the future after every minute it seemed but it was always the same. No matter what I did or what route I took right now both me and the woman ended up dead. The only future where we stayed alive was the one where we simply waited here in the shadows. I was sure the enemy knew we were here. It wasn\u2019t like there was much cover for us to hide behind. But for some reason they weren\u2019t attacking or trying to capture us. Content to simply stay in hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard a scraping sound behind us and whipped around, leveling my weapon at whoever was there. I didn\u2019t know if I could actually pull the trigger and kill anyone or not, but I was on edge right now. Both from this hopeless situation and the deserted streets. Luckily it was only Richard. I wasn\u2019t sure why he was here but I was glad he wasn\u2019t an enemy. I dropped my arm just as Robin turned at my sudden movement, running into her brothers arms with relief all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you came like he said you would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe? He who?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe guy that convinced me to fly halfway around the world. He calls himself Mr. Nobody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSlightly deep voice? A bit gravely, like his throat was messed up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s him. How\u2019d you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe called me this morning and told me to come here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know what his full game is since I can\u2019t see his future, but I could use the help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are you talking about? He didn\u2019t say anything about helping you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah? Well I doubt he planned on me being surrounded either. Or perhaps he did and that\u2019s why he sent you here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSurrounded?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah check the rooftops and watch the windows of the buildings. I\u2019ve looked into the future as far as I can and I\u2019ve seen around twenty guys in all. But every future I saw ended up with me and the girl dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy haven\u2019t they opened fire yet then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know. I can only see what\u2019s going to happen, not the reasons for things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat about now? You said in the futures you saw both of you died. Does that change now that I am here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI took a deep breath. Calming myself down and summoning the window in my mind like I had been taught to do under any circumstance. I pushed myself harder than I had before. Trying to see just one more second farther. See one more possibility. I felt the headache beginning to pound in my head as I went past the few seconds I normally left the imaginary window open for. Blood began to run down my nose, I felt it with a small part of my mind that was anchored to the real world. Soon blood would start to come out of my eyes and ears if I didn\u2019t shut it down. I was almost at the point of no return. It was a struggle but I finally slammed the window shut and came back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t see past my normal five minutes no matter how hard I tried. Most of the futures you died too and the ones where we didn\u2019t I can\u2019t say what happens after.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll take it. Tell me what to do. Read the future on the fly if you can. We will go down one of the routes you saw where we didn\u2019t die and just change things on the move. If we end up dead then so be it. But at least we won\u2019t just sit her waiting to be slaughtered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ll never figure out anything if you sit around doing nothing huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s something Mr. Nobody told me. When I was too scared to leave my house back in Japan. Too afraid of my power. He stood there with his hand out, looking down on me like some god from heaven. He said, what do you wish to accomplish? Are you content to hide away from the world doing nothing? Wasting away into oblivion? You have a gift. A gift not many other people have. With it you can do a great deal of good if you so choose. Whether your power really is a gift or a curse is up to you to decide. But how can you decide if you don\u2019t use it? You will never figure out anything if you sit around doing nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI took his hand, afraid to see what visions would come. Afraid to see how he would die. But nothing came. It was the first time I had seen nothing at all when I touched another person. When I asked him how that was possible he grinned and said that he was a man that was part and yet apart from the flow of time. That I could not see his future because his future had not yet been decided. And now that I am here I have met someone else just like that, who is part and yet apart from the flow of time that I cannot see the future of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cInteresting. I\u2019d like to meet them both. But in order to do that we need to move. Tell me what to do and where to go. I\u2019ll follow your lead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut what if I end up killing us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I\u2019ll never forgive you for it. Now tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI clenched my fist as I stared at my feet. He would trust me with his life on so little? I couldn\u2019t even guarantee that he would live. But I couldn\u2019t just stand here doing nothing. I had to believe in myself. Like Mr. Nobody believed in me. Like Richard seemed to believe in me. I had the power to see the future. That meant I had the power to change it right? I had already changed the future. I could do it again. I just had to believe in myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cInto the bakery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe grabbed Robin\u2019s hand and opened the bakery door without an ounce of hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Oh now this is really getting good! Can you pass the popcorn? Oh wait, never mind, you don't have a body right now do you? Ah well. Not like I really need to eat anyway. Besides all that butter and salt would go right to my hips!

What can I get for you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOut the back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRichard ignored the man behind the counter, heading for the door in the back. When the man turned to say something to stop him I smashed the butt of my pistol on the back of his neck, leaving him snoring on the floor. I had never done this before, opening the window in my mind a crack and changing things as I saw them. Trying to focus only on a few timelines and not all of them. My head hurt but I pushed that annoyance to the side. I couldn\u2019t let them down. They were counting on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI only barely noticed what was going on around me, the future being superimposed over my visions. I saw a woman getting hysterical and tried to calm her down. When she raised a rolling pin I pointed my gun at her almost automatically, reassuring her yet again that we would be gone in a moment. She set the rolling pin down and backed away as I told Richard about the single henchmen just outside. He waited until the twenty seconds I had given him was up and opened the door. By the time I followed him out and to the end of the alley the guy was already knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait until my signal. When I say go, run across the street into the opposite alley. You have five seconds to do it. Think you can manage?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEasy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt his arm wrap around my waist with a dim part of my mind. I made sure to keep my hands clear of his touch. I didn\u2019t need yet more visions overlapping everything. Though having him pick me up and run me across the road was a good idea. I wasn\u2019t sure if I could have made it even if I wasn\u2019t constantly seeing the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe sensation of being lifted and carried under one arm was weird indeed. Especially when my senses were fading in and out of reality. But soon enough he set me down and we continued on our way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTen seconds from now that door ahead will open up, the person coming out is just a worker so don\u2019t harm her. Slip inside. There is a stairwell to the left, go up it to the roof.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe was already reaching for the door as it began to open. Another vision superimposed itself on the one I was seeing and I fired a shot without thinking. Tagging a goon jumping out of a window farther down the alley. We were already inside as the woman began to scream hysterically at the man who had hit his head against the ground when I shot him. At least he was down for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe got to the roof and jumped across the alley to the next one. A quick run across the roof and another jump which Richard again grabbed me around the waist for. I warned him in time to take out three more henchmen as they burst out of the rooftop door we were going to take down. There was no way around this. Any other path lead to use dying or getting captured. At the bottom he took out the last guy that I warned him about and we were home free. We ran as fast as we could until my side began to ache. I had to tell him to stop before sliding down the brown brick wall we were standing next to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Yuki. Care to tell me exactly what\u2019s going on? You said yesterday the time wasn\u2019t right, well if this time isn\u2019t right I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWar. That\u2019s what it boils down to. There\u2019s this group called the Inquisition. They consider themselves some sort of holy crusaders. They think this world needs to be reformed. Humans are a disease to them. Something that has infected this world and needs to be purged. They believe they have been given a divine mission by god to cleanse everything. The only ones worthy of living are the \u201cevolved\u201d humans. Kickbacks like us. Though only if we share their ideals. If we don\u2019t want to join them we are considered \u201cinfected\u201d by the lower humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThough from what I know they don\u2019t want all humans to die. Only most of them. They hunt down those with latent kickback powers, intent on activating them or at the least breeding them into existence. They think if two kickbacks with different powers have a child that child can obtain both abilities. There is proof of this, since their leader has two abilities that Mr. Nobody knows of. The rest of humanity that they spare will become little more than slaves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd why exactly are they starting their fight here of all places? I mean Medusa City might be big, but it\u2019s not exactly the center of things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFrom what I know it is because of a prophesy of some sort. I think they have someone on their side with the ability to see the future like I can. But I think theirs is stronger than mine. This area is a place where a large number of kickbacks tend to gather for some reason. Though I don\u2019t know why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what? You are running around playing at a superhero all by yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHardly. Mr. Nobody is pulling together everyone and anyone he can get and trust to fight them. Police, kickbacks, regular people. Not everyone can know of course, and we have to be careful who we trust even among those we tell. People just aren\u2019t ready to accept those like us. Even among the non kickbacks helping us we are still held at arms length. They fear our power, fear we will switch to the other side. That\u2019s why we need to be careful what we say. There are corrupt cops that the enemy is using as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere are kickbacks in the ranks of the cops?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope. They are hypocrites. Claiming to detest regular humans yet still working with and using them. Don\u2019t ask me to figure out the minds of these people. All I know is they have started a war and they won\u2019t stop if we ask them nicely with sugar on top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo that\u2019s this Mr. Nobodies game huh? He wants me to join you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot at all. He gave me no such instructions to try and recruit you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you tell me all of this yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause he said it had to happen this way. If your sister hadn\u2019t been captured they would not contact you. Then he wouldn\u2019t have known what they were planning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis Mr. Nobody seems like a bit of an A******. Putting people in danger like that for his own selfish reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve seen humanity. That\u2019s all they are is selfish. Everyone is like that in some way shape or form. Manipulating and using others to get what they want. He might be a bit of an A****** like you say, but there is no questioning that he is effective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I closed the window in my mind  another one came in unbidden. I was already weary of the constant double and triple sights overlapping the real world. My head was killing me and I wasn\u2019t in the mood to see anything else. It didn\u2019t last long but I still saw every possible outcome of this one moment. As soon as the vision let me go I raised the gun and pointed it just to the left of Richard\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI counted to three and fired. He flinched but only after the bullet was past him. It slammed into the head of the man who suddenly swung around the corner with a machine gun in his hands. I stared down at the weapon in shock as the full import of what I had just done hit me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI killed him. I killed him! I didn\u2019t mean to, I just\u2026 killed him. There was no other way. You got to believe me! I didn\u2019t see another way! But I knew where to aim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at Richard as if trying to make him believe me. I wasn\u2019t a killer. I had wanted to live. That was all. I didn\u2019t want to die. He had to believe that was the only reason I had killed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou did good. If you hadn\u2019t killed him he would have killed us right? And you can\u2019t do anything to stop these Inquisition people if you are dead right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah\u2026 Yeah. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s just\u2026 that was the first time I killed anyone. It seems worse because it was the first time I used my visions to do it as well. People die all the time right? And this is a war right? I mean people die in wars so this is only natural right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRight. Now pick yourself up and get moving. We can\u2019t sit here all day. Did your Mr. Nobody tell you where to go once you were safe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah. Yeah he did. There is a safe house. He told me to go there and lay low.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen let\u2019s move it. I\u2019d feel better if we weren\u2019t out in the open. I can take care of myself but I don\u2019t want my sister in any more danger if I can help it. I don\u2019t know about joining your little resistance or anything but right now these guys are trying to kill me and you aren\u2019t. So I\u2019ll stick with you for now until I get a better idea of just what the hell is going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah. Yeah. That\u2019s a good plan. Follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI got a bit unsteadily to my feet and motioned for them to follow. He was right. Find someplace to hide. Keep moving. This was no time to have a breakdown. They were still counting on me. I passed the man I had shot, trying not to throw up as I saw my own handiwork. This wasn\u2019t as easy as it looked on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<b><i>\u201cFirst kills are always memorable. Though why you humans put so much stock on the importance of it is beyond me. What\u2019s a dead body or two? Wars are what founded nations. Your pasts are littered with the bodies of the fallen. You would not have civilization without it. Yet you treat it like it is some sort of sin. Just get Grimalius to give them back if you are so concerned about it. She might have a bit of a morbid sense of humor but she really isn\u2019t that bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmm? Who\u2019s Grimalius? I told you about her before didn\u2019t I? The one you call the grim reaper? Who escorts the souls of the dead and collects them? Oh right. Never mind. I bound my children not to interfere didn\u2019t I? She is only allowed to escort the souls now. Not that she was much for socializing with others to begin with. So I guess you can\u2019t ask for her help. Well you can, but she can\u2019t do anything. So it would really do no good. She might appreciate someone talking to her though. Let her know people still know she is alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll shut up now. Moving on!\u201d</i></b></span></div></div>",

Same with you Mrs. Robin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe got someone on our tail I take it? Someone with abilities?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. And if you look back you will trip and fall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though I was already tired from all the other visions they were still coming into my head like I hadn\u2019t closed that imaginary window. I still didn\u2019t feel right about having killed that man but I was quickly getting over it. Oddly though, in this heightened state of emotion my head wasn\u2019t pounding like it normally did. I didn\u2019t see hundreds of possible outcomes, I simply saw one. As if it was the only possible timeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRichard sidestepped closer to me and Mrs. Robin, the black lightning puttering out in the air right next to his head. I didn\u2019t know who exactly was chasing us, I had never seen him before but I knew his power was dangerous. It somehow embodied pain, debilitating and excruciating pain. If we were hit by it we would be withering on the ground helplessly. That is if it didn\u2019t outright kill us first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI continued to issue orders, allowing us to evade the lightning strikes. When he shot another bolt at my feet I jumped to avoid it, almost stumbling and falling when I landed. But I recovered quickly and kept running, my side beginning to hurt just slightly. The woman was beginning to pant as well. She could go on for a bit longer but not forever. We didn\u2019t need to go on forever, our salvation was just turning the corner farther up the street now and barreling towards us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYo! Cindy! What\u2019s up girl! What are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMa petite peche! I was told to come here by Nobody. Told you might have a bit of a pest problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI do. As you can see it\u2019s a cockroach that just won\u2019t leave us alone. Mind stomping it out for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFor you ma peche anything! I\u2019ll hug him and squeeze him and rip his cute little head off just for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer voice became almost demonic as she talked, a drastic change from the slightly low sweet sounds she normally made. Her grin and the slight craziness in her eyes was also a surprise, making me glad she was on my side. I raised my hand as we passed each other and we mimed a high five pass off, our flesh never once coming close. It seemed she had already adapted to my no touch policy and understood how to handle it. I had a feeling I could come to really like her and we could become good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho was that guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat was Cindy and she is a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo way! He had a six o\u2019clock shadow! His arms were bigger then mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s true. And don\u2019t let her hear you call her a him. She is very sensitive about her looks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe left it at that as I led them both into the outskirts of a residential district. The hideout was an unassuming yellow house that looked just like four others on the block. It\u2019s three stories standing like a sentinel against the street. Once inside I sat on the steps to catch my breath, winding down after all the adrenaline I had been working off of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI began to laugh a bit hysterically as I thought back on the last hour. Never would I have thought I was capable of any of that. My head hurt a bit but I realized I had more control over my ability now. I would never have been able to do any of that before. Being thrust into that situation had forced me to expand my vision seeing ability. Had Mr. Nobody expected this to happen and put me in this position on purpose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard the tapping of a cane on wood and knew Mr. Nobody was coming out of the back rooms without even looking. I didn\u2019t even need to use my power to see him. I just knew. There was no other sound like that distinctive clicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMr. Nobody I take it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked over in time to see Mr. Nobody nod his head to the side at Richards question. Richard gritted his teeth and swung his large right fist around in a haymaker. My eyes were too slow to see exactly how it happened, just catching a faint glimpse before I blinked and it was over. It looked like Mr. Nobody shifted his weight to the right and slid around the big man in a circle. Pulling his sword out of his cane and laying it against Richards neck in a backhand swing. He didn\u2019t cut the flesh, simply held it there with his back straight. Richard unclenched his hands and held up his left one in surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI hope your anger is spent now. I\u2019m sure you must be ticked at me and that\u2019s understandable. But like it or not things had to happen the way they did. Even if you can\u2019t understand the reasons why. I\u2019d prefer not to get violent if we can at all help it. We might not be allies or friends, but we are all on the same side at the least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah fine. But next time you put my sister in danger like that I won\u2019t stop until you kill me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI would hope there not be a next time. I am trying very hard to prevent such a thing. Yuki. I\u2019ve got another job for you if you are willing. An easy one that won\u2019t involve much danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs that why you are here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOne of the reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure, what\u2019s the job?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI want you to go back up Willis. He\u2019s in room 404 of the Hilington hotel. The one a block away from City Hall. No need to rush, he won\u2019t need you for another three hours and no one will bother you on your way over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nodded my acceptance, leaving the house with a wave. My father had always said to never put off what you can do right now. I knew I had time, but I wanted to think. I did my best thinking while walking around. Mr. Nobody had already assured me I wouldn\u2019t run into any trouble and I believed him. He hadn\u2019t steered me wrong yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had already done so much since leaving Japan that I had never in a million years thought I was capable of. I had friends! Real friends now. There were still people that feared me and my power. Even a few that threw proverbial rocks just like the kids back home had thrown real ones. But now I had people who stood up for me. Who weren\u2019t put off by my power and still wanted to hang out with me. Who made me feel normal. People I wanted to protect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis world was ugly, there was no doubt about that. Humans were creatures that couldn\u2019t easily adapt to changes or things they didn\u2019t understand. Tending to get violent against such things. Willing to destroy things that did not fit into their knowledge of how the world worked, even if it was beneficial to them. But they also had the capacity to accept if properly shown how. Not all people were bad. Even those who senselessly destroyed anything different had the capacity to regret and have their mind changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe weren\u2019t trying to change the world though. Even if it would be beneficial for all kickbacks in the long run to do so. People needed to want to change on their own, we couldn\u2019t force it upon them. If we forced it upon them we would end up with a worse rift between kickbacks and regular people than when we started. But like it or not, despite what Mr. Nobody said, regular people would have to be forced into accepting our existence, otherwise they would all stay willfully blind with nothing ever really changing. The Inquisition wasn\u2019t completely wrong in some of their views, they were just going about it the wrong way. There would always be people that feared and hated us because we had something they didn\u2019t. That was just human nature. But I still believed Mr. Nobody was right in saying most of them would come around eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMa petite peche!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced up as Cindy came barreling down the street straight for me. When she got close she grabbed me up in a giant bear hug and swung me around like a rag doll. My arms were trapped under hers and it was all I could do to keep from accidentally touching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPut me down please! You\u2019re crushing me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe sat me back on the cement, grinning at me like a fool. Straightening my clothes out I looked up at her, reminded again of my short stature. Why did Americans have to be so tall? Or us Japanese have to be so short? Even at five feet one inches tall, I was small for a Japanese person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat does that mean anyway? Ma petite peche that is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s French for my little peach\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe turned and began walking next to me as I started off down the road again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd why do you call me that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026.No reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s a lie if I ever heard one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPromise you won\u2019t get mad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPromise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy horoscope said so. It said the first person I met after reading it would be the one I was destined for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd you believed it. You know those things are a bunch of hogwash don\u2019t you? Just a generalization to make you feel good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know. But a girl can dream can\u2019t she? I always dreamed of calling someone my little peach. My mother was French and she always called my dad that. I always thought it would be nice to do that too. And then you showed up and you are so small. Like an actually little budding peach. I just couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGreat. I\u2019ve gone from being human to being a fruit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re mad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not mad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen can I still call you ma petite peche?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOnly if I can call you Okii momo\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt means large peach in my native tongue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s a deal ma petite peche.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGlad we came to an understanding Okii momo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u201cAww.

The room was a double, though I had a feeling he had taken it more for the position then for the beds themselves. The array of bullets and guns spread out on the far bed and the way he was looking through a scope out the window gave me that impression. Willis glanced back at me a moment before returning to looking out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you\u2019re Yuki huh? Not much to look at but I\u2019m at least glad you didn\u2019t wimp out on me last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re the guy from the police warehouse!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFigure that out on your own did you? Or did you use your power to help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou got a problem with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah. You\u2019re a freak. These abilities you people got is unnatural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why you working with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCause I have to. These Inquisition people have made an attack on my country. I\u2019m not about to let no hair brained scheme of some power hungry freaks take over my country and kill the people I spent twenty years protecting. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh I get it you\u2019re one of those redneck patriots. A hillbilly hick from some backwater town who thinks serving his country is the end all be all. As if this countries **** don\u2019t stink and it\u2019s the epitome of civilization. Land of the free my arse. Land of the ignorant and stupid is more like it. If your country is so advanced then why is it such a s***hole right now? Why you got these \u201cfreaks\u201d as you call us ramming your own uselessness down your throat? If it weren\u2019t for \u201cfreaks\u201d like me and the rest, you regular hicks would be up the creek without a paddle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSod of you Gook. What would a chink like you know anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know I can kick your *** if I have to. I know none of your bullets will touch me. And I know I could kill you right now and no one would shed a tear at your loss. The only reason I don\u2019t walk out the door right now is because Mr. Nobody said I have to work with you. He didn\u2019t say I have to like you. And if you can\u2019t be decent enough to keep your tongue in check I see no reason I have to either. I\u2019ve had it up to here with you ****ing Americans thinking you are so god **** superior when in actuality you are the most ignorant ****\u2019s I have ever seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen he reached in front of him and spun around to point a gun at me I was already behind him grabbing the right hand with the weapon in it and pointing one of the pistols I had silently picked up from the bed at his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBang! You\u2019re dead. Care to try again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tVisions of how he was going to die flashed through my head the moment I touched his hand. But I ignored them like I had gotten good at doing as he swiveled off his chair and swung at me. I dodged the blows easily, knowing long before he even thought of throwing them what he was going to do. Ducking under another blow I put the muzzle of my weapon under his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBang! Dead again. Another try?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain and again he kept swinging at me. I could have knocked him out many times over as I slipped through his guard. I killed him five more times before he finally gave up and sat back down with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGod **** freak. Being able to see the future aint a fair advantage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I am sure you wouldn\u2019t use it yourself if you had it. Because all Americans are such upstanding honest citizens who wouldn\u2019t use every tool at their disposal. Now if you\u2019ve gotten over your little tantrum and butt hurt feelings, let\u2019s move on. What exactly am I supposed to do? The sooner we get this done the sooner I can leave and get away from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe gave a tsk of disgust but turned away, pulling his light military jacket off to reveal arms tattooed from shoulder to wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTell me where and when to shoot. I\u2019m supposed to provide covering fire for some high ranking officials as they evacuate the City hall building. I\u2019m just a regular old sniper. I\u2019m good, but not good enough to react to the speed of a bullet or an explosion. Mr. Nobody wants you to see the future and tell me where and when to fire to stop incoming attacks and keep them from dying. Their bodyguards know to keep them moving already. Just need to get them safely to their cars and cover them until they drive off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWouldn\u2019t their cars be the first thing targeted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAye, if the enemy is smart. That\u2019s why Mr. Nobody is sending some armored vehicles during the escape. No chance of a car bomb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou sure you can trust the words of a Jap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLook I know my job. I might not like you people but we are technically still on the same side. Might not see eye to eye and probably never will. But you are at least trying to protect this nation same as I am. So I\u2019ll trust your word. You tell me to shoot I\u2019ll shoot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen move away from the window right now and pack up your stuff, we are moving to the next room over right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe didn\u2019t even hesitate or question me. Jumping off his stool and moving over to the bed seconds before a bullet smashed through the window right where his head had been. He looked at the hole in the wall up by the ceiling and then over at me with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat would have killed me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut when did you see that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen I touched you. I saw how you were going to die. Depending on your answer I was half tempted to let it happen. Like you said, we don\u2019t have to like each other, but we are still on the same side and fighting for the same cause.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy head suddenly exploded with pain, forcing me to close my eyes and clench my fists against my head. Just ride it out. This wasn\u2019t the first time this had happened. It would only last a second longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt stopped just as quickly as it began and I looked up to see Willis staring down at me stupidly. My body felt like a thousand pounds of lead as I pushed myself to my feet from the fetal position I was in. I didn\u2019t even remember dropping to the floor. Staggering over to the stand between the bed I grabbed some tissues to wipe the blood from my eyes, ears, and nose. Trying to make the ringing stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat the hell was that! Why are you suddenly bleeding all over the place!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause I saved your life. I altered the course of your destiny. Now you have a future you didn\u2019t have moments ago. Because I meddled with the natural order of things and stole you out of the claws of death I pay the price. A sort of overload if you will. It\u2019s why I don\u2019t save people very often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut surely you can tell people how they are going to die and they can avoid it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour right. But it doesn\u2019t do any good. I told a woman how she would die and she didn\u2019t step out in front of the car like she was supposed to, instead deciding to take the train. That train derailed and smashed my mother into a wall, killing her instantly at the exact moment when the car was supposed to hit her. Right down to the millisecond. You can\u2019t change moments that are set in stone like that so easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why am I still alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause you were willing to listen without question. If I had tried to explain it to you, you would be dead. If I simply said move or die, you would want to know why and again would die. That\u2019s the problem with humans, always wanting to know why. I know why but it still does no good to tell anyone. Because of ignorant people thinking this power is so great. Like I wanted to be born with it. Like I wanted to be unable to touch people without seeing and feeling their deaths. Thinking that I don\u2019t want to be normal like everyone else. In the end you saved yourself just as much as I did. Now hurry up and pack up, we need to start soon right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe began gathering all the magazines and assorted ammo. Making the room look as clean as it had been originally. As we worked Willis kept glancing over at me speculatively before finally speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo\u2026 your power. Do you see the future all the time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I can control it to an extent. My mother taught me how before she died. But that only lets me see a short time into the future. Sometimes it comes on its own and then it can be anywhere within a two week time frame. They always come when I touch someone. I see fragments of what is to come and then I see and feel how they die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess you people have your own problems just like us normal folk don\u2019t you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSometimes more of them. Especially since we have to try that much harder to fit in. It\u2019s not always easy. Like having to purposefully get answers wrong on tests so no one catches on to your power, or so you don\u2019t get made fun of. Trying not to be too noticed so people don\u2019t ask questions. It\u2019s worse for some people who can\u2019t fully control their powers or their power physically alters their appearance. How do you go to school when your skin is green? Or covered in scales? Or even having hyper sensitive senses that turn on and off whenever they please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe reached for the door after hiking the pack farther up on his shoulder. He turned the knob but didn\u2019t open it, staring at the wood silently for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks again for saving my life. I guess you aren\u2019t so bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI still don\u2019t like you though you freak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe feelings mutual you redneck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe nodded his head before walking out the door. I followed behind, silently smiling to myself.</span></div></div>",

Start as enemies and end as friends! Coming to an understanding through common goals and shared hardships! Feelings of love, admiration and respect blossoming inside from some offhand comment! This is why I shouldn\u2019t destroy humanity! This is the special something about it I was searching for! These moments of bonding! It makes me so happy! It makes me want to rip my clothes of and go hug the first person I see!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 come to think of it isn\u2019t that what I did after that drinking match with my son Cthulu? Yes I really think it is. That\u2019s how the whole Christianity thing started.....I think I better not do that again. We don\u2019t need another fiasco like that. I\u2019m still cleaning that whole mess up today.\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\t\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLet\u2019s just carry on shall we?\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh I pushed open the hideout door. Today had been exhausting. Every moment seemed to bring something new. Definitely not a dull day. I was tired, hungry, and at the limit of my stamina. I had overused my power, abusing it like I had never abused it before. I had only ever drained myself like this twice before so I knew I was playing a dangerous game. I was in need of a long rest while I gave my ability a break. If I pushed myself too much farther I would end up passing out and not waking up for a day or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t even want to think about the prophecies I might spew while unconscious. The last time I had done that it had caused widespread panic. Turning parent against child and letting utter chaos reign. It had taken the military almost a week to quiet things down and our family had had to flee the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI headed for the kitchen, thinking it was still weird not to hear someone say welcome back when I got home. American culture was so different. They didn\u2019t put emphasis on the same values. It wasn\u2019t exactly bad, just weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOpening the fridge I ransacked it for some leftovers that would be easy enough to microwave. Deciding on some beef stew to fill my stomach. I hit the buttons and turned around, nearly jumping out of my skin at the shrouded man before me. The only thing I could see under his deep set hood was a pair of purple eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJeez Myste! Make some noise would you! Give a guy a heart attack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe bowed politely in apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI am sorry. I simply wished to tell you welcome home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that he turned into smoke, clothes and all, wafting out of the room on an invisible wind. Even though he was a kickback, the guy gave me the creeps. He didn\u2019t talk much and he was always shifting in and out of his fog form. He was only two heads taller than me, yet he always seemed taller. And though I couldn\u2019t prove it, I had a feeling he had two abilities, not just one. Since he seemed to always know what was on peoples minds, telling them exactly what they needed or wanted to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSoon enough I was sitting alone at the table inhaling the food. I barely tasted it even though I knew it was good. I was just that hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMa petite peche!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHuge arms wrapped around my neck, threatening to strangle me as I was rocked from side to side. I tapped the table in surrender until she finally let me go, sitting down across the table from me and smiling like a fool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s with the grin okii momo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019d be amazed at the things I understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe suddenly went from being a mature, if slightly happy go lucky woman into a bashful little girl. Red coloring rose to her cheeks as she fidgeted in her chair and looked away, unable to meet my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t say it! I\u2019m too ashamed! It\u2019s just so embarrassing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou embarrassed? I would think you crushed embarrassment with one hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe twiddled her thumbs while hunching her shoulders. Her lips moved and I strained to hear what she said but couldn\u2019t, asking her to repeat it for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou are the first person to really treat me like a woman and not some freak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDoesn\u2019t Mr. Nobody do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes but he is different. He treats everyone the same way. And I don\u2019t think\u2026.. You.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe blushed an even deeper shade of red while hiding her face in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI said I don\u2019t think he is as cute as you! Oh my gosh I said it! I actually said it! What do I do! What do I do! What if he doesn\u2019t like me now? What if he thinks I\u2019m some kind of weirdo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou are talking out loud you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAck! I am! Oh no! Now you must think I\u2019m even weirder!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t even begin to wonder what it\u2019s like to be you. Looking like you do and having lived the kind of life you did. But I\u2019m sure it was hard. I\u2019m flattered though. No one has ever said I looked cute before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI took a few more bites of food while Cindy kept glancing at me and looking away like a girl with her first crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre\u2026 are you not afraid of my power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy should I be? I think it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMost people think I am some demon in human skin as soon as they find out about my power. Afraid I\u2019ll somehow curse them with my knowledge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan you curse someone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOnly if you consider telling them their future and how they are going to die a curse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe linked her fingers on the table and rested her chin in her hands, tilting her head to the side as if in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess that might be kind of bad. But it\u2019s not like you cause it just because you tell them right? It\u2019s going to happen one way or another. So it\u2019s not your fault. And you don\u2019t seem like you would tell people such things just to be mean.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMost don\u2019t see it like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDealing with this sudden personality switch wasn\u2019t as hard as I thought it would be. It was actually sort of calming. Take away her manly figure and looking only at her actions made it feel like I was talking with my little sister back in Japan. I felt a bit guilty that I hadn\u2019t thought about her in all this time. I hoped she was doing well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound rude or anything but how old are you anyway Cindy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s no secret. I\u2019m not like most girls that are afraid to tell people their age. I\u2019m twenty three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGet out. You can\u2019t be a year younger then me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow you\u2019re the one who is pulling my leg. You don\u2019t look more than sixteen or seventeen. I mean you sort of remind me of my little brother! And he is taller than you! And where is your facial hair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI began to chuckle a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell first because I was just thinking how you reminded me of my little sister. Second, I get the whole baby face comment a lot. That\u2019s why I rarely say anything about my age. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just the way I was born, or if it has something to do with my powers or what. My mother looked years younger then she actually was too. As for my lack of facial hair, that really is something that runs in my family. All the men in my family are as smooth as a babies backside. Well all except for uncle Yuu. But we are all pretty sure he glues it on anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe began to laugh along with me, her demeanor changing slightly and I somehow knew she had changed back to the older version of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI must have looked like a bit of a fool. Clinging to you like I would to my own brother. Since everyone around here is a bit older I thought you would feel more comfortable with a big sister type around. I thought you were just acting more mature for your age so you wouldn\u2018t be taken lightly or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo more foolish then me treating you a bit like I would my own sister because I thought it would make you more comfortable that way. So then I guess you really don\u2019t think I\u2019m cute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe blushed again while lowering her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I really do think that. When I go into young me mode I tend to say whatever\u2019s on my mind. You really don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird? The way I switch back and forth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held out my hand to her across the table, making my mind up on the spur of the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you like me to tell you a bit about your future? I won\u2019t tell you how you die though if you don\u2019t want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked from me to my hand and back into my eyes, searching for some trick. Finally she extended her massive hand and took mine. I felt my eyes shake back and forth as my mind was assaulted with snippets of her future. Finally I let go and pulled my hand back, giving her a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell what did you see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI saw me and you going out for dinner and a movie sometime soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer eyes widened in surprise as my words sank in before a slow smile spread across her face as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think I like that future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u201cHey I created an epic poem to commemorate just how awesome Yuki is!

I braced my feet as Chel lost hers. I looked back quickly to see the church had indeed gone up in flames earlier then it was supposed to. I felt the adrenaline rushing through me. The thrill of battle underway. Perhaps I was a bit mad. Had a bit of what they called battle crazy. But I was ready for this war. This was my element. Where I felt most at home.

I wouldn't have locked her memories away, taken her to some out of the way corner of the Anime Reality, wasted so much magic on turning her into an NPC and binding her, you, and dozens of other people including myself to make it near impossible to break her out of it! I would have just put a bullet in her head from the start! If you hadn't interfered the shock of the explosion would have loosened and eventually broken the bonds I placed on her when combined with everything else I have planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why didn't you tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I knew you wouldn't like it! You aren't thinking straight right now. You are thinking with your emotions, not your head. You trusted me once. Following every crazy plan I came up with even though you didn't understand a fraction of it most of the time. Trust me once more. I said I would help you get Anna back and I will. But you need to stay out of it. I won't kill her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Do what you have to do. I won't interfere anymore.And Chris, for the record, I don't hate you.

That gorilla worked you over good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShut it! This is nothing! It don\u2019t hurt at all! I\u2019ll be good as new by tomorrow just like always, you\u2019ll see. Now get out of my sight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs soon as they were gone and I was sure they wouldn\u2019t see me, I touched my puffed up face with my right hand and sent my power out through my fingers. Soon enough all my wounds were gone like they had never been. Such a useless power. The ability to heal was for people that wanted to help the world. Not for someone like me. What had this world ever done for me lately? Why should I ever want to help anyone? And why had my grandmother given me this power anyway? Why couldn\u2019t she have given me something cool, like the ability to control fire or earth or make explosions with a snap of my fingers? Those I could have used. I could have become somebody much sooner. Not have to scrape my way to the top like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I left the parking lot and headed off into town I grimaced silently. People were scum. Rotten filthy parasites that needed to be controlled and tamed. Needed someone to cull them and discipline them. That\u2019s what they all wanted anyway. Someone to tell them what to do. To make their decisions for them. They were worse then sheep. Yet they never stopped bleating. Whenever anyone tried to step up and lead them they balked against it. Pounding their chests like an angry gorilla proclaiming to the world that they were their own person. That no one could tell them what to do. Then turned around and complained in the next breath that they didn\u2019t know what to do. They were truly despicable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA dog came up wagging its tail. Nasty creatures. Dogs, cats, humans. They were all the same. Only friendly when they wanted something. Food, money, sex. I knelt down and put my left hand on his head as he looked at me with those so trusting eyes. I released all the pain I had siphoned off from my face right into his skull and left his corpse on the sidewalk. On less piece of trash to dirty this already filthy world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked down at my left hand and clenched it a few times. This at least was semi useful. When grandmother had taught me how to control my power this was not how she had meant for me to use it, I knew that much. My right hand could heal wounds and take away pain. My left hand could send out any pain and wounds I accumulated and put them onto another person or thing. She had called it the law of balance. She had spent her life healing other people, transferring their pain into things like rocks. And how had she been rewarded? By getting lynched for showing her power in public. Some of those in the mob had been people she had healed with her power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat had taught me the most important lesson of my life. Don\u2019t help other people. Take what you want and **** everyone else. But I was weak. I knew that. I had to manipulate and scheme to get what I wanted sometimes. Had to rely on the strength of others. But they were all throwaway pieces anyway. If they weren\u2019t me they could all die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I turned the corner I saw a car coming from the distance. Right in front of me a boy dropped his ball. As he tuned around to pick it up I kicked it into the road. He went chasing after it like the little idiot he was. His mother screamed at him to stop but he ignored her. Unfortunately the car stopped before it hit the boy. A pity. The boy deserved to die for such a stupid act. I continued to walk on as the mother ran out to grab her son. She should die too. For giving birth to such a moron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven spending some time in the Arcade didn\u2019t put me in a better mood. If anything it ticked me off more. Seeing all these people with smiles on their faces and laughter in their throat. Content to be scum. Content to live their dull lives. It was the duty of those of us with vision to lead them. To tame them and send them off to conquer for our benefit. And ultimately, to discipline them and remind them of their place. I was special. I knew I was. Grandmother had told me so. She had said this power of mine was far greater then I knew. **** the mob anyway for taking her from me before she could finish teaching me everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut I had showed that hick town. Those unenlightened maggots that had taken my family from me. They had never stood a chance. I had taken the opportunity presented to me. You had to always seize the opportunities. I bet they had felt so smug as they all gathered into the town hall for their town meeting. Probably discussing what a great job they had done in ridding the town of a witch. I bet the hadn\u2019t felt so smug after I locked them in and burned the building down around them. Their screams of fear and pain as they burned alive were like music. Those that jumped out the windows I stabbed personally. Watching the life drain out of their eyes as I took revenge for grandmother\u2019s death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSome survived. Not everyone had gone to that meeting. But I hadn\u2019t been satisfied with the hundred I had charred. Every single one of them were responsible. Even if they hadn\u2019t participated they had allowed it to happen. They had silently agreed with it. They hadn\u2019t come to her rescue. So I killed them all. One by one I slipped into their houses, their workplaces. They knew me. They trusted me. So they never saw it coming when I placed my left hand on them and shocked their hearts or brains with pain. I spared no one. Old, young, men, women, children, babies, they all deserved what they got. A town of only a hundred and fifty people, never to be heard or seen again. Such a sad story, it made you want to vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHow I wish I could just go on a killing spree here as well. But this city was bigger. I would get caught. I had almost gotten caught for the arson, until I had killed the police. I had to lie low for a while. Pretend to be one of these people. Fit into this society until my chance came. Then I would show them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI left the Arcade around four thirty. Once my desire to stab people became almost too much to bear. While walking around the shopping district four of my henchmen came out of an alley to meet up with me. I glanced inside and saw a woman with her panties around her ankles and bruising all over her body. I kept walking with a shrug. Served her right. That was all she was good for anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey boss. I heard you got worked over pretty good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou heard wrong. Do I look like I was worked over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right then. So drop it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe stopped for some pizza at a small restaurant over by MayB\u2019s. Leaving only when I felt like going home. I was sick of this town for now. They were probably glad to see us leave But I would come back, just because I knew they didn\u2019t want us there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Boss. Isn\u2019t that what\u2019s his faces girl? You know, the one you are always fighting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked where he was pointing and saw a girl with blond hair in a light blue sweater and a skirt ending just above the knees walking ahead of us. I felt the grin slithering across my lips as I ran my tongue across them in anticipation. Yes that was definitely Chelsea. I would know that hair and that walk anywhere. She was alone for a change. Chris wasn\u2019t around acting as her ever present bodyguard. I was going to enjoy this. I would capture her and rape her and beat the snot out of her. Perhaps even kill her. Make her boyfriend hurt.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tWe followed her. Slowly closing the distance between us. As I turned a corner I saw she was running away. I let out a yell of surprise and chased after her. She tripped and fell, making me grin. She would be mine. It was only a matter of time. Then she ran out into the middle of the street and crossed the road. A sea of cars suddenly blocked our ability to chase after her. I let out a tsk of displeasure at being thwarted and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was met by a man almost six feet tall. He wore an eye patch over one eye and had a thick head of black hair. He was well built and wore the signs of many battles on his face and hands. My four goons were littered on the sidewalk around him either unconscious or dead. I hadn\u2019t even heard him come up behind me or take out my crew. He held out his right hand as his single eye bore into me. Seeming to grow larger until it was all I saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou are a kickback and you don\u2019t know how to fully use your powers. I can teach you. I can give you power beyond your wildest dreams. The power to make everyone bow before you. I will make you a king. All you have to do is follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis words were irresistible. That gaze couldn\u2019t be denied. I could feel the power emanating from him and knew how insignificant I was standing there. He could kill me as easily as squashing a bug under his foot right now if he so desired. He was like a god who had come down to earth and said I could become one to. My knees began to shake as my hand seemed to rise on its own to meet his. I was afraid like I had never been before. But he didn\u2019t take his hand away. He grasped mine and shook it firmly. His lips curved up in a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLet\u2019s start a war.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tHow had I never thought to use my powers this way? He made it sound so simple and easy to understand. Only one night. That was all I had needed. Now much of what grandma had said made more sense. Some of the things she could do wasn\u2019t so puzzling. I had almost been there. I could have even figured it out on my own. But he had helped. He saw more with his one right eye then most people saw with two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe had seen the potential in me. Seen that I was somebody. That I could do great things if given the chance. Not as great as he was, I knew that. I could get nowhere close to how great he was. But he had offered me light. A way out of this hellhole of a life. A way to get rid of all these scum calling themselves humans by the thousands instead of simply by one or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe called us crusaders. Called us the Inquisition. Mr. Ghost said it was our divine purpose to reform this world. Our god given mission to wipe out the disease in the world and start over from scratch. Only us kickbacks deserved a place in this world. We deserved positions of power. Deserved to lord it over those without. To guild them. It was our sacred duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe had already given me a mission. He already trusted me and my god given power. He knew I could handle it. Even gave me twenty men. A simple mission maybe, but I knew it was a test. To make sure I could be trusted with tougher missions. He had already sent someone else out to abduct that muscled idiot\u2019s sister. Robin I think her name was. She was being held in a secret room under a church on Peach Street. All I had to do was guard it with my men for one hour. Nothing I couldn\u2019t handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHow I wished I had been the one to capture that ***** of a woman. I would have given her a good working over. Screwed her head off too. Just to shove that Richard\u2019s helplessness in his face. Show him just who was the one with the power now. But I hadn\u2019t. Perhaps if I had time I would do that later while she was my prisoner at the church. If I couldn\u2019t find the time to make that happen perhaps Mr. Ghost would give me a few minutes alone with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned to myself as I pulled up my pants and looked around at the sparse room I had been given in this hideout. A window, four blank walls, a dresser and a bed where one of the women with the Inquisition was even now waking up. She wasn\u2019t my woman, she was everyone\u2019s woman. She knew her place. She was only good for birthing the next generation of Inquisitors. She knew if she could manage to give her child both hers and someone else\u2019s power she would be treated like royalty. Mine or someone else\u2019s child, it didn\u2019t matter. So she made the rounds just like the other willing women, sharing a different man\u2019s bed every night in hopes of being the lucky one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI preferred the unwilling ones though. There was something about making them submit. About pinning them down while they screamed and hurting them before ravishing them brutally. Their tears of despair. I had wanted one of them last night, but all of them had already been taken. But I would have my chance. I would make them all my slaves. Bending to my every desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI left the room while buttoning my shirt, already imagining the things I would do. Imagining the torment I would inflict. I checked the clock on the wall and saw I had an hour to get to the church. More than enough time to get there early and set up my troops. They would all die before I let them fail me. Slipping on my shoes I left the house and got in the car, telling my chauffer to drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was on the fast track. Only one night and already I had my own personal driver. Perhaps not my own personal car yet but that would come in time. I let my mind wander to everything Mr. Ghost had taught me last night, staring intently at my left hand. The hand that I had only ever been able to transfer pain into others with. I could see the faint traces of black aura that coated it and grinned foolishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had known how to send that pain out through my hand, but it hadn\u2019t taken much more effort to simply send it to my hand without releasing it. I could turn anything I touched now to char. Instead of killing something by instantly unloading it all into their body, this aura could kill them slowly, tormenting them in agony every second. It was limited of course, would last only so long as I had some of that pain energy stored inside. The longer I used it the more was drained away from that invisible tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though she didn\u2019t teach me about it, I was sure grandma had known about this application of the power too. How to create this aura. I had seen it around her hand before. But unlike me she had never harmed anyone with it. I would avenge her with this power others had killed her for having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe\u2019re here sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nodded to the driver as I got out of the car. That was more like it. Being called sir. Being shown the respect I deserved. As the black vehicle drove off  I climbed the front steps to see just what I had to work with. I pointed and gave orders and they all jumped to do my bidding. Just the way it should be. They all feared my power. Feared me like they were supposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo one gets in here do you understand! All of you will die before you fail!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes sir!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey began to pull out guns, slapping them around until clicks were echoing all around the chapel. I saw the cross with Jesus nailed to it back by the podium and flip it the bird. There was no god in this world. No god would have taken my grandmother from me like that. No god would be so cruel as to make human beings so evil. But the model Jesus kept smiling at me. Like he forgave me for disliking him. His face ticked me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a growl of frustration I threw out my left hand, sending that pain power I was storing up out like a bolt of lightning. It struck the crucified false god square in the face, causing it to explode. I let the grin spread across my face as I felt better. This was something my grandmother could never do. It was something Mr. Ghost had taught me. I had already surpassed my grandmother in this respect. I already knew how to send the pain into people while I was touching them, and forming it around my hand like a protective barrier was almost an extension of that. So shooting it out by focusing it into a compact ball, holding it back on an invisible spring until I released it to erupt forward was just a natural next step. It was power. It was the destructive force I had been searching for. No one could stop me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut now I needed to recharge. My little fit, while satisfying, had drained my reserves. I could feel the emptiness inside. The emptiness Mr. Ghost had taught me to identify. I needed to learn how to hold back. Learn to make it last and portion out how much force I used. That\u2019s what he had said. But why should I? There was ever renewable resources everywhere. If I drained myself I could just go out and fill up again. These human waste were all nothing but battery packs to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m leaving for a bit. Don\u2019t anyone dare slack off! If you do you are the next one I target!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes sir! I mean no sir! I mean we won\u2019t slack off sir!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI smirked as I left the church. Perhaps that demonstration of my power had been more beneficial then I had thought. They might have thought I was some snot nosed kid who didn\u2019t know anything because I was younger then them. But I had just put them in their place. Perhaps I should kill one of them. No. Not yet. That would come in time when they failed me. Instead I stalked the streets, looking for a good target. One that wouldn\u2019t be missed too quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey there handsome. Care for a little fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI licked my lips as I turned to the hooker standing on the corner. Yes, she would do nicely. Her blond hair reminded me of that whore of Chris\u2019. What was her name again? Chelsea. She motioned to the alleyway next to her before slipping into the shadows. I followed her in with a swagger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what will it be handsome? A Quickie is fifty, and oral is twenty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned even wider as I cupped her cheek in my right hand and shoved her into the wall. She faked a look of pleasure at my touch as I sent my power out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wouldn\u2019t stick it in you for all the money in the world. Wouldn\u2019t know what diseases you would infect me with. What I want from you is your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer face went wide in shock as I grabbed her by the throat with my free hand. I watched her skin begin to wither and shrivel as I literally sucked all the life out of her. Healing away wounds and pain with my right hand was all I had known how to do before. But the way Mr. Ghost had explained it, all I was doing was speeding up the healing process the body naturally possessed. But even cells in the body died naturally. They all had a life span. By speeding up that lifespan I could suck away the power as the body ate itself trying to correct the imbalance. I was literally healing her to death and sucking away the pain before she even felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen I was done I let the husk fall to the ground, kicking a few bags of garbage over it before leaving. I was filled to the brim now. I could feel that imaginary tank of energy sloshing over with power. As I walked back towards the church I looked at both my hands, clenching and unclenching them with a smile. I was a god. I would rule this world. Everyone would bow down to me eventually. No one could stop me. No one would dare oppose me ever again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe church came in sight as I refocused on the task at hand. The sound of gunfire penetrated my ears as I got closer. I began to run. What was going on? I made it to the steps right in front of the building when I was suddenly lifted off my feet and thrown across the street. I felt my head smash into the brick wall and darkness begin to take me. Through blurred eyes I saw the church was on fire. What had happened? Why had it turned out like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I slipped into unconsciousness I thought of the hostage. I hoped she burned slowly in this blaze.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tMy head was pounding as I came too. I heard noises, lots of them. Blaring whistles and screaming sirens. As I blinked my eyes a bit against the blurriness I saw Chris run past, taking the arm off one of my men in a negligent swipe of a sword. No wait it was a dagger. But how could he do that with such a small dagger? His slut chased after him a moment later like a dog in heat. Prancing through the carnage as if it made her all hot and bothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHow dare someone blow up the church I was supposed to guard! It was probably that pain in the *** Chris. He was probably running away from his actions. I wouldn\u2019t doubt that b****** Richard had helped him. I\u2019d make them pay. Make them whither under my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI tried standing up but couldn\u2019t seem to find my feet to begin with. They just wouldn\u2019t work properly. I looked down to see what was the matter and saw both my legs were broken, the bones sticking out of the skin. Funny, it didn\u2019t hurt at all. Must have pinched the nerves or something. Well no matter, I could fix this. I reached down with my right hand and laid it on my right knee, sending the healing magic out but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat the hell? Why wasn\u2019t my power working? Oh yeah, my tank was full from that whore earlier. One of my men across the street moaned like the pitiful trash he was. His charred face staring at me, begging for help as he reached towards me with his hand. I released a bolt of black lightning into his face, causing his body to explode and rain his gory bits down on the other corpses and dying. Now my tank was empty and I could fill it again by healing myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSoon enough I was on my feet and looking around. I so wanted to follow that ***** whore. But the sound of sirens was too close. I needed to get out of here. I couldn\u2019t be caught by the worthless police. My men had failed me. Chris had sabotaged my mission. None of this was my fault. Mr. Ghost would see that. I had done what I was supposed to. It wasn\u2019t my fault that trash was still trash. I needed better minions. He couldn\u2019t fault me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHobbling down the sidewalk, I used the buildings next to me for support. I was still a little woozy and my tank was full again from healing my legs. I didn\u2019t want to waste anything right now to take care of my head. I could just deal with it. A boss like me should be able to handle a bit of pain no problem. I slipped between two buildings moments before a fire truck came around the corner and passed me. Get away, get my head on straight and then get revenge. It was a good plan. A flawless plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cMy my. This Yushihito fellow is a bit loopy don\u2019t you think? And has a bit of a mouth on him. Keeping me on my toes bleeping out his foul words that he is. Does he even know how much money it costs each time I do that? Well ok it doesn\u2019t cost anything but still, it\u2019s the principal of the matter! Though his mouth isn\u2019t as foul as this sailor I once knew. That old saying about drunken sailors\u2026 well it has some truth to it. He was a really drunken sailor though\u2026 kept mistaking me for a wench. So I finally gave him a bit of a romp. That sobered him up right quick let me tell you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait\u2026 what were we talking about again? Oh yes! Yushihito! He\u2019s an interesting character to say the least. But I rather like him. He has a certain charm to him. Quite entertaining to listen in on his thoughts. Perhaps you could take a page out his book for a bit. Having two crazy people around would be quite enjoyable. Perhaps go out on a killing spree together with me? Make it a bit of a night on the town as you would call it. Just a god and two mortals having a good time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot interested? A pity. But I still have time to change your mind. Perhaps continuing to follow him would change it for you. Oh! Oh! Here\u2019s a thought! Perhaps Yushihito really is you! How would you feel about that? What if the twist is I am secretly hiding in this body mimicking you! What would you think about that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing? Not even a rise of indignation or negation? Man you really are no fun. It\u2019s like you have no personality or something. Like you are just some random person reading a book! No investment at all! You won\u2019t even talk back to me! Do you hate me that much! I just want to be loved!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026 Wait I didn\u2019t give you a voice did I? You are basically just a pair of eyes floating in an unformed nebulous of energy jumping from mind to mind. Well butts\u2026. Forget I said anything then. Lets return to our anti hero shall we? Or would he be more of a villain? Hmm.\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI really was a chosen one. There might be no gods in the world but someone was looking out for me. Someone knew I deserved everything. There ahead of me was that B****** Richard and some black haired freak. And they had that whore Robin with them! Where the hell did they think they were going with my property! Who did they think they were to try to steal from me! I would make them pay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI threw out my hand to send some lightning their way when I held back for just a second. Wait Brian. Not all at once. I couldn\u2019t refill quickly right now. Portion it out. Remember what Mr. Ghost said. I concentrated and sent out just a little power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSomehow they knew what was going on without looking back. At the last moment Richard dodged out of the way and my strike zapped harmlessly next to him. Again and again I fired. Each time they moved as if by magic. Never once breaking stride or looking back at me. This was beginning to tick me off. They should just stand still and get beaten like the dogs they were! They should feel honored to be destroyed by me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA giant of a guy who was almost as tall as that piece of trash Richard came barreling down the street wearing a pink frilly dress. Someone like that deserved to be put out of his misery. Someone like that was worse then a dirt grubber. He was an abomination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey yelled something back and forth but I was too far away to hear more then the bleating of sheep. In the end the cross dressing man ran past the small black haired guy and they slapped hands like they were tagging off. Who did they think they were? Defy me will you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI fired another bolt their way as they ran off, leaving the faggot behind. He whipped his hand behind his back and threw a teddy bear into the line of my blast. A god **** teddy bear! The bear exploded into little bits, the stuffing flying everywhere. Teach him to throw toys in my way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe swung his big meaty fist at me and I rolled under it. I was half tempted to grab one of his pigtails and send him a bit of my love but decided against it. If I did that he would hit me for sure. Only after I put some distance between us and was turning to face him did I realize I wanted to get hit. Maybe not a full body blow but if I could get clipped it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. I could siphon the energy off from my own body. An ever renewable source. I would never be defeated ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe burly guy pulled out a purse while grinning at me. A purse! Was there no end to his obscenities? He opened it up and dumped out the contents on the ground. I was half expecting to see make-up and other girly things. Instead, dozens upon dozens of teddy bears, stuffed octopus, giant nutcrackers and even a few oversized toy cars spilled out. How had he fit them all into that little thing? And what did he expect me to do? Sit down an play house with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTo my surprise all the stuffed animals got up and took fighting positions, some of them jumping onto the cars which were moving on their own. He charged at me again and his army of cute things followed him. I began firing off blasts left and right but there were too many of them. When I shot at the faggot a stuffed squid jumped in the path and he kept on coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI threw out my hand yet again but I was out of juice. I had used it all up and there were still too many. I batted away a stuffed rabbit that launched itself at my face even as a bear somersaulted off a car through the air to land a kick to my stomach. The breath was knocked out of me but it did no damage that I could heal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked up in time to see the ham hand hurtling towards my face. I would surely die if that connected. So I threw myself backwards, landing on my butt but not having my head knocked off. The little power I got from siphoning off the pain in my backside wasn\u2019t enough. It was best to make a tactical retreat for now. Using what I had gathered I planted my hand on the ground and sent it all out, making the road explode upwards in chunks and allowing me to run while the cloud of dust obscured the gay guys view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNext time I would be better prepared. Next time I would kill them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\t\u201cYes this guy is certifiably bat **** insane. Oops! Had to bleep myself there! That\u2019s so meta isn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about? Oh well. He also seems to be a real coward. But I guess that\u2019s what makes him so loveable. All he needs is the crazy eyes to complete the deal. You know, like on TV when one eye is like three times bigger then the other one. Maybe a laugh that gets annoying when he uses it all the time. Like kekekekeke. Or ishishishishishi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh look I spy another time rift over there! Do you want to chase after this loveable coward? Or do you want to check out the rift? I promise I won\u2019t ask you to cos-play for me this time\u2026\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come give me some love!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy ears were assaulted by the annoying woman\u2019s high pitched voice as soon as I opened the door. The whore slid to a halt as I came through the portal with a look of disappointment on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh. You\u2019re not Mr. Ghost. Get away from me you creep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSomehow I couldn\u2019t let that pass. I knew I was inferior to Mr. Ghost, but I definitely wasn\u2019t inferior to this mere woman. I was going to be the next boss. She should be throwing herself at my feet. Begging for me to bed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKnow your place woman. How dare you say I\u2019m lower than you! I might be inferior to Mr. Ghost but I am still worlds above you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease you creep. That oily hair, that pale sickly skin, those deep sunken sleep deprived eyes and that twig of a body. You are inferior in every way! Worlds away from Mr. Ghost with his black hair peppered with white streaks making him look so dignified. That single blue eye staring out at you from under a brow that always seems to be brooding and in deep thought. The way his black eye patch gives him a more dangerous look while also conveying the softness underneath his cold exterior! That chest that sticks proudly out like a beacon and a demand for obedience, coupled with his rock hard arms that can hold you so gently. Even his cane gives off the stature of his gentlemanly ability! Ah Mr. Ghost! Hold me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe woman with an overlarge rack went dreamy eyed, hugging her chest and twisting back and forth as she described Mr. Ghost. I could almost see heart bubbles popping around her it was so sickening. I\u2019d teach her. I reached out with my right hand to suck the life out of her. Maybe I would stop once she was old and grey, her boobs sagging. Not kill her outright. She could still be useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore I could touch her though a skeleton hand suddenly clamped around mine. I looked down and saw a black hole opening up at her feet. Out of the hole the rest of the skeleton crawled into existence, reaching out to grab the disconnected arm still attached to me. It popped the bone back into the socket joint and stood there while I rubbed my suddenly icy flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSkelly won\u2019t let a disgusting creep like you touch such beautiful skin. Who knows where that hand has been. Mr. Ghost might have picked you up last night but you aren\u2019t one of us. You\u2019re little better then one of these lackeys. I\u2019m ranked number three here you know. Know your place worm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gritted my teeth, grinding them back and forth in vexation. How dare she! I felt a pain in my right hand and realized I had clenched it so hard I had broken the skin. I grinned as she began to turn and walk away. I\u2019d show her. Siphoning off the pain as I healed the wound I shot a bolt of black lightning at her. The skeleton stepped into the line of fire and exploded as she turned back to face me. The skeleton began to reassemble itself as she raised her eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt seems the scum needs to be taught a lesson. Minions! Arise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMore black holes opened up in the floor and dead bodies started crawling out. Some little more than skeletons, some looking almost human save for bits of missing flesh and organs. One was missing the top of its head but was otherwise a healthy looking man. I heard noises behind me and turned in time to see more rising up. I was surrounded by a good thirty zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWork him over. A good beating should put him in his place. Don\u2019t kill him and don\u2019t eat him though. You might get indigestion and I don\u2019t want him as another toy. I suppose you shouldn\u2019t tear any of his limbs off either, Mr. Ghost probably wouldn\u2019t be happy about that. Go to town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe walked away as the zombies began to converge on me. I punched a few of them but they felt no pain. Nothing seemed to hurt them. One of them hit me in the back before another punched me in the side of the face. I healed myself and shot lightning but it wasn't effective. One of them swept my legs out from underneath me right before another stomped on my balls. I curled into a ball to try to minimize the damage. **** that woman! **** her all to hell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>Hmmm. She must be one of Grim\u2019s brood. Though I didn\u2019t know that she had sired any children in her time. I thought she was more interested in simply ferrying the souls of the dead and watching quietly like me. Poor boy. If only he was smart enough to realize he could use his right hand to turn them to dust. Decomposition is just the process of time. Same principal as his healing ability. But, there is no accounting for crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d like to see a match up between zombie girl here and the stuffed animal user wouldn\u2019t you? That would probably be pretty funny. Who do you think would win? My money is on the stronger one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat that wasn\u2019t funny? I thought it was. Sigh. Well lets get back to Yushihito shall we? Now that he has had the snot kicked and beat out of him.\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI\u2019d teach that slut yet! Who did she think she was cheating like that! That wasn\u2019t a real fight! That didn\u2019t count! I\u2019d make sure she withered and screamed under my hands one day. I\u2019d turn her into my toy. I was going to be the boss someday after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \tI finished healing my broken legs, discharging the excess into the ground. When I went to fix my broken arm the healing magic wouldn\u2019t work. What the hell? My tank was on empty! My power should work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIdiot. You might have the power to heal but it\u2019s not infinite. It uses up stamina. Run out of stamina, run out of your ability. It\u2019s the way all our powers work. It\u2019s the great equalizer. That\u2019s why sometimes the only way to win a fight is to outlast the enemy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI clenched my teeth while looking up on this intruder to my helplessness. I didn\u2019t know who he was or what his power was, but he was looking down on me as I laid curled up on the floor. I didn\u2019t want to ask for his help. Someone like me shouldn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help. Holding back my tears of frustration I raised my hand in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease. Help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHelp yourself. You chose to pick a fight with the princess. Serves you right for not backing down. Perhaps this will teach you that you are far from top dog around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that he walked off, leaving me alone gnashing my teeth and my anger boiling. Even  though I had lowered myself into asking for help. Even though they were kickbacks like me. They were still humans. Still worthless trash that deserved to die like everyone else. I would bide my time though. That\u2019s what I had always done. I would get past this and pretend to be one of them. When the time was right I would destroy them all. I had been a fool to think these Inquisition people were any different because they had powers like me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA hand touched me on the head and I looked up in surprise to stare into the face of an unassuming woman wearing glasses. Her long brown hair fell off her shoulder and dangled just above my face. She smiled softly at me like some goddess before her eyes rolled up in her head and jumped back and forth like she was reading. It lasted only a second before she looked at me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh, healing. A nice power. One that can be used for both good and ill. A very handy one for our cause.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gently laid her right hand on my broken arm after squatting down beside me. I watched in amazement as my bone shifted back into my skin and the flesh sealed itself up. She continued to heal me, expelling the power into the floor like I had been doing. She had the same power as me! She was just like me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSoon enough I was completely healed and she offered me a hand up which I took hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cW-who are you? And how do you have the same power as I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe smiled at me, her white teeth seeming to dazzle the eyes. A light seemed to come from inside of her and I couldn\u2019t help but grin foolishly in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe name is Carla, though everyone around here calls me Lady Mirror. I\u2019m the second in command. As for having your power, I sort of borrowed it from you for a bit. That\u2019s my real power, to borrow the powers of other people. I can hold two powers at a time but have to give one up if I want to carry a different one. When I take someone\u2019s power, I know what they know about it. How to use it like it was my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen does that mean I don\u2019t have any powers anymore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot at all. I just mirrored them, nothing more. I don\u2019t know why you joined us or how you got that way, but you should be careful. You are an important member of our group now. It might take the others a while to warm up to you so don\u2019t push yourself too hard. I hope you don\u2019t think too badly of some of us, we all have our reasons for being here. Will you continue to work with us to change this world? Will you continue to follow us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI-I\u2019ll follow you to the ends of the earth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me that sparkling smile again before nodding and walking away, waving without turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI look forward to working with you. I hope we get along and I can count on your powers when I need them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe rest of these mud suckers could go screw themselves but this Carla was all right in my book. She had the same feeling as Mr. Ghost. I wouldn\u2019t mind following her anywhere. I could tell she was special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cI see a bit of lovesickness in Mr. Crazy pants here. Even a crazed unbalanced psychotic coward like him needs to feel loved. Perhaps that\u2019s all he needs to fix his case of the loonies. I bit of attention, a bit of a kind touch and a good woman to worship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen again maybe such a thing is too late. Right now he seems pretty insane.

I don\u2019t know exactly what was being celebrated but I wouldn\u2019t turn down unlimited food, beer and women. Looking around there had to be at least twenty to twenty five kickbacks milling around staring at Mr. Ghost who was standing on a raised platform. To his right stood the beautiful Carla and to the left that slut who controlled dead people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe have had a few setbacks recently. Today being one of the worst. The group known as the Knights that oppose us are a formidable foe. But although they thwarted our plans, they did not completely stop them. We still managed to destroy that institution the lowly humans call a school! Where they teach their young to live in ignorance and promote their false sense of superiority. Where they brainwash the next generation into hating and reviling us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe also had some success in destroying the city hall. Unfortunately some managed to escape but it is a good start to a war! If we continue like this there will be no one to stop us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a wild cheering all around and I grimaced in disgust. Even though he didn\u2019t say anything I knew he was disappointed in my failure. I had no reason to cheer with everyone else. He raised his hands for silence and got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut we can\u2019t get too excited! With the Knights already opposing us, they too are growing stronger even as we speak. Forming alliances with the powerless humans! But what we lack in numbers we make up for in power and quality! We are the superior race remember. To this end I am going to be leaving for a while. I am going to go seek out others of like mind to join our cause. I will send them back to join our ranks as I recruit them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI will take only one other person with me, to carry on my work if I shall fall. while I am gone I leave the running of the Inquisition to my left and right hand ladies. Lady Mirror and Lady Shale. Treat them and follow them like you would follow me! Their orders are to be taken as my orders! Does anyone have any problems with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI aint going to follow no woman! I joined because of you not some skirt that should be spreading her legs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMr. Ghost lifted his cane and pointed it at the seven foot tall monster of a man with scales all over his pale skin. I didn\u2019t see what or how it happened but a small hole suddenly appeared between his eyes as the skin began to bubble outward. He even had time to blink once before dropping to the floor dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnyone else have a problem with this arrangement?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo one else said anything. If they disagreed they made sure to keep silent. I didn\u2019t care. If Lady Mirror was in charge I would follow her without question. The people nearest to the body moved away quietly, distancing themselves from being thought the man\u2019s friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan I have him? Can I please? I don\u2019t have a toy that big yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMr. Ghost waved his hand and the zombie girl jumped joyfully off the small stage and ran over to the dead body like a little school girl. She reached down and touched the corpses leg, causing dozens of necrotic arms to rise out of the dirt to clamp onto the body. A black pit opened up beneath it, the hands pulling it into the depths before closing up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTe-hee! I got a new toy! I\u2019ll make sure to give it lots of love tonight! Chop, chop! Sew, sew! A little power and away it goes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe twirled around a moment before skipping back onto the stage to stand behind and to the left of Mr. Ghost again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cContinue to follow orders and we will prevail! Remember! We are chosen crusaders! We have been given these powers by god himself! Given this power because he saw how corrupt and tainted by evil it is! He gave us this duty to cleanse the world of that taint. To rule over the unenlightened and to bring forth a new era where our power is not shunned! Where all shall have a place and those who cannot understand our ideals shall serve us. We are divine rulers! We are gods! We are the Inquisition!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnother cheer went up as everyone went crazy, throwing bottles of beer and food into the air. An orgy of gyrating flesh that made me want to vomit. They were acting like the trash we were supposed to rule over. Gods such as us should not act like rutting pigs. We should act more dignified. But in the end that\u2019s what separated us even in our own ranks. Not all gods are created equal. I was proof of that. My reservation in the face of this celebration was proof that I was better then all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI watched as Mr. Ghost waved farewell to everybody and simply disappeared. He didn\u2019t fade away or sink into the floor, one minute he was there and the next gone. No one else seemed to realize it at first except me and the two on stage. When they did they looked around in confusion before going back to their celebrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two new leaders left the stage and began mingling with the rest of the kickbacks. I was content to simply stay in the shadows by the house. I didn\u2019t need to mingle with losers like this. I was here for only one reason, to destroy everything. To make all the people who had looked down on me pay. To destroy this system that had taught its children to hate. Taught them to fear people like me and my grandmother without cause to the point of killing us out of hand. Now I would teach them why they would really fear us. I would make sure their fear was justified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t like parties?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked over at Lady Mirror who was sitting down next to me, showing off that dazzling smile of hers. Suddenly the world looked a bit brighter and I found myself telling her the truth before I could stop myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t mind parties, I just don\u2019t like people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause people are all worthless trash. People are what killed my grandmother after she spent her life helping them with her power. People are what is wrong with this world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSurely not all people though. I mean you are a person too and so am I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you anyway? I\u2019ll still follow orders and do what I have to even if you don\u2019t ask these questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy not? Knowledge is power. Knowing how someone thinks is important in deciding how to make best use of them. Plus it makes my power stronger. The more I know about the person I take a skill from the stronger that ability becomes. A sort of affinity if you will. Even though I might have your healing power right now, you could heal with it longer then I could and heal more serious injuries then I could right now. It\u2019s a strong power, but it isn\u2019t unbeatable or without its flaws.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026. Not all people. But I haven\u2019t found many that I am willing to leave off the list.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAm I one of them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned again and I felt light in my chest. I slowly smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy are you so nice to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause I save my scary side for my enemies. You haven\u2019t made yourself my enemy yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you smile at your enemies too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course. It\u2019s only proper that they get sent off to the afterlife with a smile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt a rumbling in the ground seconds before everyone else noticed it. They all turned to look back at the house the same as I did. I don\u2019t know what caused me to grab Lady Mirror around the waist and into my chest while throwing myself away from the wall. Or what made me send my black aura out around our bodies like I did. I hadn\u2019t even known I could do that until this moment.  But when the wall exploded outward and a giant cannonball smashed into my back I at least wasn\u2019t crushed. My aura took most of the blow, disintegrating the ball of iron even as the two of us were launched through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe aura cushioned our fall but puttered out right afterwards. My tank was at zero again from just that one burst. But at least we were both alive. Carla looked up at me in shock, her beautiful crimson colored eyes blinking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou saved my life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I suppose I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWelcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI got slowly to my feet, helping Carla to hers. When I turned around I saw what looked like hundreds of people swarming through the hole and the yells of the other kickbacks saying we were under attack. As if it wasn\u2019t obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEveryone fall back! Johan! Get us out of here! Take us to the secondary base!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes Lady Mirror!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA man who looked like he was part Indian the way he had beads braided into his hair and his dark skin planted his hands on the ground. I saw thin white lines begin to spread out like spider webs from his position. While he was working Carla stepped forward with a smile spread form ear to ear. But it wasn\u2019t the sparkling smile she gave me, it was one full of evil. Though none of that evil ever touched her eyes, which made it look even more sinister. She put her hands behind her back a moment before raising them up in a forward arc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe ground bubbled in front of the people running towards us, finally breaking and rising into the sky, first five, then ten feet into the air. It curved over the enemy, their yells of bravado turning into screams of fear. Those screams were abruptly cut off as she dropped her hands back down, dropping the tons of earth on top of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a bright flash of light as the white cracks Johan had made seemed to engulf us. I blinked away the white blindness and found myself in an empty hall of another mansion. But I had no clue where this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood work on the teleportation Johan. All right! Everyone lets get this place set up! Parties over. Time to get back to this war! And remember! Do it with a smile!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Yes Lady Mirror!\"</span></div></div>",

I needed to figure out a way to get my mom and sister to come over here for a bit without alarming them too much, but I had already seen how this city was starting to go to pot. Mr. Nobody and the rest of these Knights were doing a decent job of holding things together, and the other families under their protection seemed happy. Almost normal in their everyday lives. Treating this a bit like a vacation while at the same time knowing the seriousness of the situation. Those that couldn\u2019t fight or do anything directly beneficial to the cause helped how they could. Such as cooking and cleaning. When I had asked around unobtrusively I found they did it of their own free will, no one was expected to pay for their keep as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn fact these Knights were like one big messed up family. Some of them had powers, some of them didn\u2019t. There was bickering and a bit of distrust but also a sense that even if two people hated each other they would have each others backs. Robin was already starting to integrate herself with these people, well I suppose I should think of them as my people since I was a Knight now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI leaned back in my chair after finishing off some of the best spaghetti I had ever tasted. It had been a long time since I had been able to eat as much as I wanted until my stomach felt like it would explode. There were four others around the table aside from me and Robin. I didn\u2019t know them all that well or what their powers were but they seemed to be a pretty tight knit group the way they bantered with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMr. Nobody walked in, his eyes locking on our group a moment before heading in our direction. The other four saw him and gave a slight wave but didn\u2019t bother coming to attention like I had seen a few others do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh Jean! I finally found you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah right. I bet you knew where to look from the get go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMr. Nobody\u2019s lip curled up slightly. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what do you want boss? Got a job for us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI do indeed. One I think is suited to your teams unique skill set. I got word that the Inquisitions leader is going to go out recruiting. I\u2019ll be leaving to try and stop him. But this does open up an opportunity for us. My sources say they are having a celebration tonight and will all be gathered in one place. I want you and your team to go party crash. Force them to relocate and set them back a bit. They have prisoners they are using as breeding stock being held there as well. If we can put them on the run, there is a chance to save many of them. Perhaps even capture a few for information.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSounds easy enough. I take it you are going to leave Myste in charge while you are gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWith you as second if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAn honor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at Mr. Nobody a moment narrowing my eyes in speculation before speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThese are the people that kidnapped Robin right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMind if I go too then? I want to get a bit of payback.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUp to Jean here. This is his mission now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t mind. I can get a chance to see what the rookie can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMr. Nobody nodded and walked away, leaving the six of us still sitting at the table. Jean wasn\u2019t a big man like me but he had muscles. Not the gross bulging muscles of a bodybuilder that did nothing but lift weights all day. His was the muscles of a hard working man. And his slightly weather worn face showed it. He was probably pushing forty but his hair was already starting to turn grey. I found it a bit fascinating though that his hair wasn\u2019t one color like most peoples, it was three shades that I could see. Black, brown and red intermingled with the white, giving him a very odd first impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLike the hair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy hair. You were staring at it so intently. You like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I just thought it looked a bit strange.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I get that a lot. It comes from using my ability. I\u2019ve just grown used to it so it don\u2019t bother me anymore. So rookie, what is your power anyway? Or don\u2019t you have one? It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t I\u2019m not like some of the others that got a problem with it. In fact Mac here aint got a lick of it but we haven\u2019t booted him from the team for that yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOne of the guys to the left with black hair and glasses raised two fingers in greeting before going back to sipping his coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStrength. Insane strength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCool. Can\u2019t wait to see it in action. Joker over here is an illusionist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t call me Joker! My name is Johnathan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRight, right. Sorry I forgot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou did not! You did it on purpose!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust a slip of the tongue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJoker\u201d was a flame haired boy who couldn\u2019t be more than thirteen or fourteen. Scrawny and gangly, he hadn\u2019t grown completely into his body yet. His freckled face turned beat red until it almost matched his hair before he folded his arms and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnyways Jok\u2026. Johnathan as I said is an illusionist and Mary over there is\u2026 well its kind of hard to explain what Mary is exactly. Her power isn\u2019t exactly like ours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe means my power doesn\u2019t fit into a single category like the rest of yours does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked over at Mary sitting next to me. She too was a surprise. When I had first seen her I had thought she was a grade schooler. A misconception she quickly dismissed when she lit up a cigarette and told me she was twenty three. She had the body and looks of an eight year old, barely topping four feet tall with big childlike eyes. Her pure white hair was long and curly, almost dragging the floor. Her green eyes seemed to be able to look into your very soul when she stared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy power comes from a Nine tailed fox spirit. So I do a bit of illusion and a bit of trickery but mostly I am energy. That\u2019s the best way to describe it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEnergy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ll see later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked back at Jean, raising my eyebrow in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what\u2019s your power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMetal. I can bend metal at will. Iron, copper, refined, raw. If it\u2019s a metal from the periodic table I can manipulate it with my bare hands and my will. Melting, smelting and reforming it within the space of a few seconds. I\u2019m a descendant of Hephaestus, the Greek god of the forge. As such my body is my forge. My breath my bellows, and my will the fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe picked up his fork and held it up for me to see. I sucked in his breath, letting it out slowly. As I watched the fork melted as if by an incredible heat, reforming into a tiny silver colored rose. He passed it across the table for me to inspect. Upon examination I could see it was really a rose and not just an illusion over a fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlready refined metals are easier to control, most of the impurities have already been pulled out of it. When I pull raw stuff from the ground it takes a bit longer because I have to refine it myself. It was a great skill when I worked in the steel mills before they shut down. And like all abilities, it comes down to stamina. The bigger and stronger the thing I make, the more stamina it takes. It\u2019s a good balancer, makes you invested in working out if you want to make your power stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJean pushed his chair back and stood up, looking around the table at each of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I\u2019m going to go see what information I can get out of Mr. Nobody about the lay of the land for this mission. Also talk to Sara and the other seers, see if they can tell me anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone waved farewell with a good natured insult chasing him out of the room. Once he was gone Mary looked at me with an grin plastered on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t let him fool you. He may act all meek and mild like that but he is a real monster. Probably the strongest of us after Mr. Nobody and Myste. He has the nickname The Diamond Knight for a reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \tStaring off at the door where Jean had left I began to wonder just what I was going to see later on today. Just what had I gotten myself into? Robin put her hand on top of mine and I absently covered it with my right. She was telling me to be careful without saying anything. A fact I already knew but it was good to be reminded of it by her. I loved her, but I knew it would never work out. So I would hide my feelings and continue on like normal. We were and could only be brother and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\t\u201cOh an epic battle! A showdown of kickback versus kickback! Five against an untold number! This is so exhilarating! Exciting!

The fire suit had protected me from the heat of the explosion and the magnetic repulsion shield had stopped the brunt of the building from crushing me. If I had been more prepared for this I could have hunkered down to wait out the destruction better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tClimbing the demolished steps I shoved a bit of broken building out of the way, pulling myself out of my tomb. I was about to head towards the gate when I saw Chel standing there screaming her head off calling my name. What was she doing here? Why hadn\u2019t she gone home? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWait. This was good. I could vanish from her life now. It would make getting around easier. I wouldn\u2019t have to hide who I really was from her anymore. Wouldn\u2019t have to pretend to be just an ordinary high school student. So instead of coming out into the open, I kept hidden until she eventually left. Once she was gone I headed for the back wall, leaving the ruins of the school behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry Chel. It\u2019s better this way. I\u2019ll see you again in a few weeks when we start things from scratch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe couldn\u2019t hear my whispered words of farewell of course, but I imagined they still reached her. A police officer stopped me as I was walking away from the wreckage but I really didn\u2019t have time to deal with him. The time for playing the role of a high school student was over. This was now war. So I brushed his hand off my shoulder and kept walking.<br>\r\n He reached out and grabbed my arm, starting to twist it behind my back saying I was coming with him. With a deft spin I reversed the hold, cranking his arm behind his back seconds before grabbing his neck and snapping it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHalt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked back to see another officer pointing a gun at me and sighed. I really didn\u2019t need this. I put my hands up in surrender as he came towards me. The moment he took his eyes off me to talk into his radio I pulled my own pistol from behind my back and shot him in the head. In all the confusion one or two more dead bodies wouldn\u2019t be noted. That is if this world even cared about throw away characters like this. I\u2019d be surprised if they even had a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI needed to get to City hall. That was the next major key point in this series of events. Everything was happening faster than it was meant to. The church, the school, probably even the police station bombing. Other things were happening out of sequence, such as my faked death, Chel meeting Richard, the escalation of this war. Still, what had to happen had still happened even if the order was messed up. That meant City hall was the next target. I had to make sure everyone in the building was caught in the explosion. Or at least I had to make sure the government officials were killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt took longer then I thought it would, the streets were already awash with mobs of panicked citizens. The military was already trying to restore order but to no avail. Of course they wouldn\u2019t be effective, they hadn\u2019t been given orders to open fire with live rounds yet. The best they could do was shoot beanbags and tear gas. That would only give them breathing room though, a cleared space only as big as the perimeter they could hold. If they started breaking off and venturing out into the streets alone or in packs of two\u2019s and three\u2019s they would be overrun by the mob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI skirted their perimeter around the building, glancing up at the fourth story window of the Beechton hotel, seeing the glint of reflection off a sniper scope. Good, that much was still the same. I would just sit in the shadows and take out anyone he missed. He normally didn\u2019t miss anyone but every so often that variation did happen in the timelines. With the way things were going I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he missed every single one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnother glint from the fourth floor of the Hilington hotel made me pull out my retractable spyglass to check it out. There was someone up there with a sniper rifle as well. There was only supposed to be one shooter, not two. I couldn\u2019t make out his looks clearly because of the reflections in the window but I just knew he wasn\u2019t here to assassinate anyone. This was another glitch to the order of things. I had to put an end to this now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slipped into the ally between the Beechton and an Italian restaurant, pulling bags off the pile of garbage in the dumpster there. It took only a moment to uncover the sniper rifle I had planted earlier this morning. Another moment more to grab the clip from where I had taped it under the giant blue dumpster. Securing the silencer onto the tip I flipped the cap off the scope, hefting it to my shoulder before leveling it at the fourth floor window of the Hilington.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>Shoot to kill. Guns are weapons, not toys. Pull a gun with the intention of firing it. Brother, sister, mother, friend. These words don\u2019t matter when you point a gun at them. Who might mourn their passing, who might come get revenge, these too do not matter. What matters is your commitment. That is why you must think of all of this before you pull out your weapon. Once it is drawn and pointed, that is your commitment. Your intent to fire and to kill no matter who it is pointed at. </i>Uncle Chris\u2019 words reverberated in my head as I let out my breath slowly and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t have time to confirm the kill though as the side door of the restaurant began to open. Quickly I hopped into the open dumpster and covered myself with the black bags full of garbage, shoving the rifle down along the inside of the metal tub. Yet another glitch that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. A rain of half eaten food, old sauce and much more rained down on my head, the bulk of it being stopped by the trash bags. I resisted the urge to gag at the smell as I waited for the sound of the door opening and closing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tClimbing back out I cleaned myself off as best I could before making sure the rifle still worked. Once I was assured it was fine I waited. I didn\u2019t have to wait long before the City hall building went up like a firecracker. A few bodies flew through the air, flailing their arms wildly before connecting with the ground or denting in a car roof. Hefting it back to my shoulder I used the scope on my weapon to get a better view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe first congressman came out the door. I waited a moment for the sniper in the hotel next to me to do his job. But nothing happened. With a sigh I took the shot. Instead of going through his head like it should have something hit my bullet in mid air, making a small spark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat the hell was that? I shot another bullet, and again I failed to kill my target. I picked another one of the officials running out of the building and fired. It flew right in front of his face because he had suddenly stopped. The reason for his sudden halt was because someone had shot the ground right in front of him. I glanced up to the Hilington hotel quickly through my scope. There in the corner room was the glint of a scope. The angle was bad so I couldn\u2019t get a clear shot at him but I knew he was the cause of this. I fired a round in his direction, hoping to cut him up by breaking the window. But he jerked away before it even broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy interference did allow the sniper in the hotel next to me to take out one of the officials. Well it was no big deal, even if they made it to their cars, the bombs I had planted early this morning would take them out as soon as they fired up the engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though I continued to lay down covering fire, the sniper in the other hotel still managed to stop almost all the shots. To make matters worse, instead of getting into their own vehicles, a group of black armored sedans came barreling out of nowhere for the officials to be ushered into. Soon enough all six vehicles were out of sight and only five congressmen and senators had been successfully killed. All in all a total failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a disgusted sigh I broke down the weapon, throwing the parts into the dumpster and covering it over with garbage. It was untraceable and I could always get another easily. The only thing I could do now was go home and get cleaned up. With a little food in me and some clean clothes I could figure out my next step. Figure out how to salvage this mess and correct the course of time. Because at this rate Chel would end up dead tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe trek back to the house went by in a daze. A few people took one look at me and gave me a wide berth. I didn\u2019t mind. As long as they didn\u2019t try to stop me. The farther I got from the center of things the less it seemed people knew what was going on or that anything was going on. Soon enough they would though and nowhere in this town would be safe or free of panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReaching up above the door frame to hit the button my fingers froze. It was already depressed. The trap was deactivated. Somebody who knew about the trap had been in my house. They might even still be in there. As silently as I could I opened the door, slipping my .45 out of its holster as I did so. The house was quiet and dark just as I had left it, but this was just the entranceway. I couldn\u2019t call it safe from just this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo. Not completely quiet. I could hear the faint sounds of the TV in the living room. Step by careful step I slid across the floor, cocking back the hammer before twisting around the frame ready to fire at the first thing that moved. Sitting in the chair with his legs crossed and his fingers steepled in front of him was the person I had never thought I would see again. I blinked my eyes rapidly but the vision didn\u2019t change at all. Slowly I lowered my weapon as I felt tears starting to trickle down my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stood with a smile and opened his arms and I ran into them without a second thought, wrapping my arms around his waist as I buried my head in his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve missed you uncle Chris!\u201d</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t know what is going on but big brother Chris told me to get home and not leave. I think he was right. I have a feeling things are going to get bad really soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt his hand tugging on mine and let him lead me away. I couldn\u2019t stop the tears from flowing. He was dead. Blown into little bits. Why had he gone into the school? Why hadn\u2019t he left with Billy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe world passed me in a blur. It was all just random noises and flashing moments of darkness and light. It was over. Everything was over. Chris wouldn\u2019t be there in the mornings to greet me. Or make witty one liners with his dry sarcastic voice. He wouldn\u2019t be there to play along with my flights of fancy, or make me feel safe when I was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI wouldn\u2019t hear him tell me that he loved me anymore or see him glancing at me sideways when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking. All the normal days were gone in an instant. Destroyed along with the school. He had somehow known all about this. Somehow he knew it was going to happen. He had been telling me goodbye before. Back before he had left me at the church. I had just been too stupid to realize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI wanted to tell him I loved him too. I knew that now. Funny how I only realized it after he was dead. I wanted to answer his feelings properly. But I couldn\u2019t now. He\u2019d never get to hear those words. Why had I been so stupid? So blind? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI blinked a few times and realized I was standing in the living room. When had I gotten here? When had we left the school? I needed to go back there. He might still be alive. It was possible. He could have escaped. He wasn\u2019t allowed to be dead until I told him how I felt. Please god, just let him be alive! Let him somehow escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned to leave the room, fully intending to walk back to the school when my dad stepped in front of door and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s best if you stay inside honey. Billy told us what happened and I was out there. It\u2019s not safe right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut he\u2019s alive! He needs my help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf he is still alive then the police will handle it. If you go out now you will end up getting killed and he wouldn\u2019t want that now would he? There is rioting in the streets and a lot of madness all over town. It probably won\u2019t reach this section though and the military is already enforcing order. I don\u2019t want you to get caught up in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThen what am I supposed to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard the lost and pleading tone of my voice but didn\u2019t care. The world was ending. Chris was dead and nothing my dad was saying made much sense. This was Gorgon City, where nothing really bad happened. There was no way there could be rioting. No way Chris could actually be dead. This was like what happened in a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat was it! This was all a dream! I would wake up and none of this will have happened! All I needed to do was pinch myself awake. After all, Chris couldn\u2019t cut off someone\u2019s arm or climb trees without using his hands. He couldn\u2019t do any of the stuff I had seen him do. He would never say the things he had said. Leaving me or Billy alone in a real crises and simply telling us to run home. That wasn\u2019t like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pinched my arm but nothing happened except I felt the sharp pain where I had grabbed. Maybe the arm wasn\u2019t a good spot, maybe my cheek would be better. Still nothing. I had to find someplace more painful. I had to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mom touched my arm, shaking her head when I looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not a dream sweetie. Doing that will do no good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt the tears beginning to well up again as she took me in her arms and rocked me back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s ok sweetie. Maybe he did make it out. If he did I just know he will come running over here straight away. When he does I bet he is going to be really hungry. So let\u2019s set a plate for him at lunch ok? You can cry your eyes out and make yourself look nice so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about you when he comes. You know he will worry if you aren\u2019t your usual self, because that\u2019s just how he is. Now why don\u2019t you help me prepare lunch ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slowly nodded my head against her chest and let her lead me towards the kitchen. She was right. He would come running as soon as he could. He always came running. He always found me when I was lost. Always knew the right things to say to make me feel better. And right now I was really lost and needed to hear his voice. Even if it was to make fun of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cPoor girl. She just can\u2019t accept that he is dead. What is it about you mortals anyway? Whenever someone dies you almost always beg me to give them back to you. Yet ninety percent of the rest of the time you are either cursing my name or don\u2019t believe I exist. It\u2019s not all that easy to bring a person back to life you know. There is a natural order to things. Even I can\u2019t mess with that order easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat did you think? I would make light of this situation? I\u2019m not that heartless. I can appreciate such somber moments of loss as well. Even if I can\u2019t completely understand it. Losing something or someone precious is always hard to handle. I hope she can get over this soon.\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI blinked and found myself staring at my reflection in the bathroom mirror. How long had I been standing here? How long had the water been running? Slowly I turned the faucet off and looked at my reflection again. My long blond hair seemed to have lost some of its luster and my blue eyes were rimmed red from so much crying. They had lost some of the life in them as well. Was this really what I looked like? I needed to fix this. I couldn\u2019t let Chris see me like this. He would make fun of me for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ran a comb through my hair, holding it up in a few different positions. Deciding to wear it in a ponytail. He always had liked ponytails. Once that was done I used a bit of make-up and water to clear away the worst of the red around my eyes. When he came for lunch I would waste no time in telling him how I felt. He would like that. But that meant I had to be strong, I couldn\u2019t cry anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter leaving the bathroom I headed for the stairs. While passing Billy\u2019s room I heard muffled sobs through his door. My own eyes began to water again, threatening to undo all the work I had just done. Clenching my fists I walked away. Chris was still alive after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLunchtime drew near and I began to get anxious. What would he say to my confession? Would he kiss me again? Did I want him to kiss me again in front of my family? Would he laugh at how worried I was about him? If he did I would smack him. But that was just like him too. To simply laugh off a serious event like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we sat around the table everyone seemed to be forcing themselves to act cheerful for my sake. I wasn\u2019t worried. I knew he would come. I had set a plate out for him after all. I had piled it with mashed potatoes, some peas, and topped his hamburger steak with mushrooms. He loved mushrooms. It was ready and waiting for him. Now all he had to do was come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe doorbell rang just as I was about to put my first forkful of food in my mouth. I dropped it back to my plate as I bounded out of my chair. He was here! Just like my mom said he would be. I knew he wasn\u2019t dead! I could feel my cheeks stretched to their fullest as I yanked open the door. My grin disappearing in an instant when I saw it was old Miss Haubenaker from across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChelsea dear! What are you doing home? Shouldn\u2019t you be in school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy hand dropped listlessly from the door as I turned to shuffle back to the table. My mom came around the corner and saw who it was while I moved away, all my energy suddenly gone again. I heard the old woman ask to borrow some sugar but I didn\u2019t care. She wasn\u2019t Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLunchtime passed but still he didn\u2019t show up. I refused to let anyone take his plate off the table. He was going to be hungry when he came and hamburger steak was his favorite. Mom put some cling wrap over it but otherwise left it alone. With a sigh I shuffled into the living room and plopped down on the couch. aimlessly picking up the remote and flicking through the channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>\u201cAt eight fifty three this morning Heronus middle school exploded from an attack made by a terrorist group calling themselves the Inquisition. Police and firefighters have been working tirelessly to clear the wreckage. Of the two hundred and twenty three children that attend this school only twenty two are still alive. Those who did not attend school today for whatever reason were the only ones not killed by the explosion. No other survivors have been found. A copy of the official attendance records for this morning are being pulled off an external server and the families of the victims are being notified as we speak. Stay tuned to GCNS for more info.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo survivors. Of course there would be no survivors. It was impossible to survive a blast like that. I had been there after all. I knew there was no chance anyone could survive that. I let the remote drop back to the couch as my hands covered my face and I began to cry.

It had been stupid to just leave like that. To just run wildly from the house in the first place. I was stupid. Looking around I found I was standing in front of a bus stop bench with clear plastic walls and a roof. I sat down dejectedly, not even caring if those boys found me. I was lost, tired, hurt, and stupid. I wanted Chris to come save me. Even if he kissed me again I wanted him to find me like he always did and take me home. I covered my face as the tears began to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo, What\u2019s the matter girl? You lost or somethin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChris had found me! I was so glad that he was here. I turned to yell at him for not finding me sooner and my voice caught in my throat. It wasn\u2019t Chris. I didn\u2019t even know this guy. He stood at almost six and a half feet tall and looked like someone had condensed down a building and stuffed it under his skin. He had a bit of a mean look on his face to as his deep inset black eyes watched me. I instinctively flinched back before I could stop myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI must have hurt his feelings because he hunched his shoulders a bit, sticking his hands in his pockets and trying to look as unthreatening as possible. But he had the same feel as Chris did. That sense that even though he looked mean on the outside, he was nice on the inside. I felt like I could trust him. So I swallowed once and nodded my head at his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I\u2019m lost. And I forgot my cell phone at home. Some guys chased me and I just ran. I lost my shoes someplace and I tripped while running. I finally lost them but I don\u2019t know where I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you live around here? If so I could walk you home. I know this area pretty well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChris had said not to trust people too easily, but I just wanted to go home. If he was willing to help me then I would accept his help. If he meant to harm me there was nothing I could do. And to top it all off it was beginning to rain lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c113 East Lancer Street.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe nodded quickly before sitting down on the bench next to me and slipping off his sneakers and handing them to me. I tried to protest but he wouldn\u2019t hear any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey might be a little big but at least it will cover your feet. Your street isn\u2019t too far away. About a twenty minute walk. I\u2019ve got a friend that lives over that way so I know the general area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stripped off his shirt as well and handed it to me to use as a makeshift umbrella. When I opened my mouth to tell him he didn\u2019t need to he shushed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t\u201cIt\u2019s not that cold out and I\u2019m not bothered by it. I\u2019m built to not get colds. You know the saying, stupid don\u2019t catch colds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re not stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes I am. I know it. It\u2019s just the way I was born.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWon\u2019t your feet get cold and wet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cProbably. But better my feet get wet then your\u2019s. You look like the type that catches a cold easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you are right kind of, I do catch colds more often then other people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis shoes were really large on my feet, I felt like a clown in them. They clopped along on the wet cement and I had to push my feet back into them every few steps. But I was still secretly glad to have them. I didn\u2019t want to walk home in wet cold socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s your name anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m Chelsea Winters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRichard Noel. Pleasure to meet you. So any particular reason you were out so late?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh, I know that tone. Boy trouble I bet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m psychic. Actually been on the other side with some girl trouble of my own just recently. My friend helped me out of it. Want to tell me about it? Perhaps I can pass the favor on. You don\u2019t know me and I don\u2019t know you. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to talk to a near stranger about this kind of stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was silent for a moment but then hesitantly told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis might sound kind of pathetic, but there is this boy that confessed to me and I shot him down. But he is still my friend and acts like nothing has happened. I don\u2019t want things to change between us, but my parents keep pushing me to get together with him. One of my girlfriends said she is going to make a move on him but I don\u2019t want that either. We got into a bit of an argument tonight while he was over at my place and he kissed me out of the blue. I didn\u2019t know what else to do so I ran out the door. I just kept running and ended up lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSounds to me like a part of you wants to be his girlfriend. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be so adverse to another girl taking him. I\u2019m not an expert on relationships. My friend is better at this stuff then I am. But I don\u2019t think it is wrong to want to just stay friends. I mean sure I would feel hurt if I confessed my feelings to someone and got rejected, but I wouldn\u2019t see that as a reason to stop being friends with them either. If that was what she really wanted I would learn to accept that and move on. I mean guys and girls can have a relationship without dating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut it sounds like you don\u2019t want to move on. You want to keep things in stasis so you don\u2019t have to make any decisions. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s wrong, but I don\u2019t think it is completely right either. It\u2019s unfair both to you and to him. I can\u2019t say why he kissed you either, but that sort of tells me that he still likes you and isn\u2019t completely content with being just a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        His thoughts on the matter all seemed to make sense. They helped me sort out my own confused thoughts and emotions a little and put them in perspective. After he said his piece he was content to simply walk along in silence. I was thankful to that because I wanted to think. Finally things started looking familiar right before we turned into the residential area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks for trying to help me. Oddly I feel better now. You\u2019re right, I really need to think about what I want. I never thought that I was being unfair to him before. Despite what you say, you\u2019re pretty smart. A dumb person wouldn\u2019t have been able to talk like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks. But it doesn\u2019t take brains to have a bit of common sense and just speak your mind. But I will take your compliment with grace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt wasn\u2019t long before we were finally home. I returned his clothes to him and offered to let him come in and dry off but he shook his head. Saying he had to get home as well. I gave him one last wave as he left the yard and headed back the way we had come. I watched him disappear into the darkness for a moment before closing the door on the night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still I had thought it would take her another few years at least. Unless someone told her where to find Anna. I didn't want to believe that though. Only three other people knew where I had dumped her and one of them opted to stay with her because he loved her. Lenna and Fan'sul were the other two. Because Lenna was my wife and Fan' was Cri'sa's father. But I trusted them both with my life. I would hope neither one would betray my trust in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManipulation. I felt that's all I ever did anymore. Ever since I had destroyed not only an entire species of alien but their very planet as well. That was the point when everything just got worse. I had been embroiled in intergalactic politics for a solar system not even my own. Because I was akin to a god to all those alien people. A god in the Anime Realities and a god in real life. I had toppled empires and saved planets. Ended disputes and solved seemingly unsolvable problems for them. In their minds it was only right that I help lead them into a better future. An unofficial adviser on the United Planetary Forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I was going to use that skill in manipulation again. This time to help a woman I had once loved intimately, and a part of me still loved, get back a daughter who had gone a bit crazy. A daughter that had tried to humiliate, rape and murder my own little girl. I had vowed that I would kill both of them if I ever saw them again. I knew I had it in me to do so. I had killed for less in the years I had lived. Yet I had hesitated when I saw her again. Lexi wasn't my enemy. Not really. She was just a parent like me. A woman who had become a bit mentally unstable after her husband died. I knew minds could crack from less stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now it was time to play god one more time. To give back the memories I had stolen to a girl that could very well go after my daughter again. If that happened I would have no choice but to kill her. And then her mother when she turned on me. Perhaps even Cri'sa because I killed the woman he loved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I had to work from the shadows. I couldn't be spotted. Not by Cri'sa, and not by Anna. I couldn't be tied to anyone or anything. If I was I wouldn't be able to break down the interconnected chain of events to the point that the world couldn't repair itself and compensate for the glitches I created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI idly scratched the skin under my right eye, the eye patch beating gently against the back of my hand as I inserted the key into the door with my left.

Picking up the bag of vegetables I headed out the door. Would Chris really come tonight or would he plead some excuse again? What was his problem anyway? Always so broody and going off to do things without telling me. Didn\u2019t he know I worried about him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEspecially since he lived all alone in that house of his. With his mom gone all the time for her work and his dad dead or off who knows where it had to be lonely for him. He put on that tough guy face but I knew deep down he wanted to be a part of a family. That\u2019s why he always came alive when he came over to our house. He had a surrogate mom and dad and even a little brother to play with. Though would I be his older sister or his younger? My birthday was before his but he treated me more like a younger sister then older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy pocket vibrated as my phone went off. It took me a moment of juggling to transfer one of the bags to the other hand but I was finally able to dig it out and answer it before I missed the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey girlfriend!

It\u2019s all over the school you know. How you friend zoned him like it was nothing. Don\u2019t know why he still hangs with you after something like that. But I like that about him. I been thinking of going after him myself. Thought this might be a great time for a double date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy insides went cold and the light carefree feeling I had in my chest suddenly turned into a solid ice block. What did she know anyway? Things weren\u2019t that simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not interested and neither is he.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI hung up on her and shut my phone off before she had a chance to reply.

But I didn\u2019t want things to change between us. I had fun with him and I felt comfortable. He made me feel safe. If I were to go out with him things would just be weird. It would be like dating my own brother. It was easier to just think of him that way. Easier to not think of him as a boy really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDeep down I felt I didn\u2019t deserve to go out with him. I wasn\u2019t big into past life mumbo jumbo, but this feeling of unease; like I had hurt him deeply in another life, came over me when I thought of him romantically. Things were fine the way they were. Nothing had to change. As long as nothing changed we would always be happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy free hand began to tremble for no real reason and I pulled it into my chest to clutch my shirt. Everything was going to be fine. Chris would come over to the house and we would have fun. He would roughhouse and play games with my little brother and my mom would whisper hints that I should get together with him that I would ignore or misunderstand. It would be a normal visit. Then tomorrow I would walk to school with him and act like a kid like I always did. Making up some off the wall story to something he said and enjoying the back and forth we were used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was nothing wrong with any of that. We didn\u2019t need to start dating. He was fine with our arrangement as well. He wouldn\u2019t have stayed my friend or acted like nothing had happened if he wasn\u2019t. But no one else could have him either. No one would take him away from me. Would keep us from having our normal days together. **** Tina for bringing that up anyway! Couldn\u2019t she just leave well enough alone? Couldn\u2019t she mind her own business?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCalm down Chelsea. Don\u2019t get worked up. It\u2019s not worth it. Nothing is wrong. Everything is fine. Chris doesn\u2019t know and he will never know. He will be the same as always. When he knocks on the door he will probably have a cake, he will grin and say something like honey I\u2019m home in a joking manor. I will throw myself at him and he will catch me as I wrap my arms around his neck playfully. That\u2019s how it always went when he came over. That\u2019s how it would go today. Tina\u2019s words wouldn\u2019t change that. So just stay calm Chel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<b><i>\u201cIt seems our carefree girl isn\u2019t so carefree. Isn\u2019t it interesting how such misunderstandings happen because humans don\u2019t speak to one another? It is one of the many reasons I was entertained for so long. At first you mortals were incomprehensible to me. But slowly over the eons as I studied you and observed you I came to understand just a bit how your minds work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot completely mind you. But a bit. You all have your own reasons for acting the way you do. Not that they always make much sense to me. But hey, that\u2019s why I am a god and not a human. But looking into her mind with you I find it even more odd indeed. There is a blockage. As if someone had suppressed her memories. Perhaps she is suppressing them herself. I can\u2019t get past the block to see deeper unless I break it completely. But I will not do that, I am still mainly an observer. All I can get is brown eyes. The same brown eyes Chris was thinking about after taking care of the punks. Curiouser and curiouser.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh wait you don\u2019t know anything about that do you? You can\u2019t see down the multiple paths at the same time like I can. Hmm, I need to get better at this. It\u2019s been a long time since I dealt with a mortal. The last time was what, almost two thousand years ago in Israel? I keep forgetting how limited your minds are. I need to keep that in mind so as not to hurt your brain too much. Ah well enough of my meandering! Back to the story!\u201d</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOpening the front door I was greeted by the soothing sounds of water running in the kitchen down the hall to the right and the TV running in the living room to the left. The sound of pounding feet upstairs told me Billy had one of his friends over. I slipped my shoes off and headed to the kitchen with my groceries. My mom gave me a smile as I unloaded my bounty, washing my hands before picking up a knife and helping her make dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChris said he was going to come over tonight to eat if that\u2019s ok with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course it is sweetie. You know we always love having him over. The poor boy probably doesn\u2019t get many good meals. Because we all know men can\u2019t cook, that\u2019s a special skill only us women have perfected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe chuckled a bit at her joke and I grinned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t let him hear you say that or he might try to prove you wrong. And he would probably succeed too. I\u2019ve tasted his cooking and I\u2019m not ashamed to admit it is worlds better then mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat just means you need to get that much better then doesn\u2019t it honey? Win over a man\u2019s heart by winning over his stomach. That\u2019s what my mother always said. And it\u2019s true too. It\u2019s how I won your father. So when are you going to finally admit the truth and start going out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe are just friends mom. Just really good friends. Like brother and sister. He\u2019s happy with the way things are now and so am I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd pigs fly. I\u2019ve seen the way he looks at you. I know you don\u2019t like to talk about it and you don\u2019t like me harping on it. But sweetie, that boy likes you. I heard he even asked you out and you rejected him. Yet he still sticks around. That\u2019s love right there. You might be happy with the way things are but I bet he isn\u2019t. Take it from someone who knows honey. If you keep waiting around expecting things to stay the same he is eventually going to get tired of waiting and be snatched up by someone else. When he does you will realize how you really feel and it will be too late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI continued chopping up vegetables in silence and my mom thankfully dropped the subject. I lost myself in my work. Feeling a few tears beginning to threaten, I pulled an onion over and began to cut. Using it as an excuse to let my eyes water. Why was I even crying? I never understood when these sudden bouts came over me. It didn\u2019t last long, it never did, so I was able to get over it by the time I was finished with the onion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the doorbell rang and my dad answered it I heard Chris out in the hall making his regular joke just like I had expected. But I couldn\u2019t find it in me to go greet him like I normally did. I heard pounding feet as Billy came downstairs at a run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBro!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI imagined Chris ruffling his hair as Billy grinned up at him, joy written all over his fourteen year old face. The pit in my stomach came back suddenly and wouldn\u2019t leave.</span></div></div>",

Dinner will be ready in about an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSweet! Then you can help us with our homework right? And then we can play Splat after dinner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard the creaking of the steps as Chris went upstairs with Billy and his friend, saying he couldn\u2019t promise any games after dinner. I knew he would make some time to play with my brother though. He always protested like that and he always ended up in a game or two. Secretly I was glad. I didn\u2019t want to deal with him right now. I felt that if I did, everything would change. I didn\u2019t know how it would change but I knew it would. I was regretting inviting him over. But it was too late to tell him to go home. I just needed to get through tonight and things could go back to normal in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMom came back in and picked up her knife again without a word. That didn\u2019t last long though, only long enough for her to cut a potato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can finish up in here. Why don\u2019t you go spend time with Chris.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I\u2019ll let Billy have some time with him. It\u2019s not often that he comes over and I see him every day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe began cutting another potato as I filled a pot with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTwo months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s the running bet I have with the other wives. I told them he would only wait around for two months before finally giving up and looking for another girl. Nelly from down the street thinks he will wait on you forever, but she is the only one. Some thought he would only wait a week at the most, and the longest one aside from Nelly\u2019s prediction is six months. But I think I know that boy pretty well, and I\u2019m pretty sure you only have about another two months the way things stand. I\u2019m not trying to be pushy, but I don\u2019t want you to get hurt sweetie. You two need to work something out. Otherwise something\u2019s going to burst.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe handed me a few cans of pop and pointed at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou should at least go offer them something to drink. It\u2019s only good manners.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh I left the safety of the kitchen and headed upstairs. I heard mumbling from the closed door as I walked closer. I was about to knock when I heard what they were talking about. The voices becoming much clearer. Chris was giving my brother advice on how to treat a girl and how to talk to them. I could imagine my brother sitting in rapt attention. My brother asked him another question and Chris answered him in all seriousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cListen. If there is a person you like then you should just go for it. There will never be a perfect moment or a best opportunity. You can try to set it up, like I did when I confessed to your sister to make it a bit more romantic, but things happen. Words get caught in your throat, they don\u2019t say the words or ask the questions you imagined they would, the timing is off. If you are thinking they are perfect then it won\u2019t work out. If you are holding off for that perfect woman the same is true. People are flawed. you have to accept that. Even if you ask a girl out you barely know you have to expect they are flawed and not get angry or disappointed when they don\u2019t live up to your imagination. All you can do is tell them you like them and hope for the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut doesn\u2019t it feel weird being around my sister after she said no?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChris didn\u2019t answer right away like I thought he would. I was afraid to hear the answer so turned away before he spoke up. I went into my room and dropped the drinks on the desk before heading back downstairs. I busied myself with cleaning the dishes for the remainder of the time until dinner was served.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI kept my eyes down and tried not to look at him all through dinner. The pit in my stomach wouldn\u2019t go away and only seemed to get worse every time I snuck a peek at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is good Mrs. W. Been a while since I had hamburger steak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease how many times have I told you to call me mom. I mean you\u2019re practically family anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut I\u2019m not family yet so I don\u2019t feel right calling you mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could almost feel the eyes on me as everyone waited for me to say the expected denial. So I did. The words feeling like lead in my throat. My heart just wasn\u2019t in it right now, but no one seemed to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s never going to be family so you should just drop it mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs soon as dinner was over I made a beeline for my room and closed myself in. Behind that small amount of safety I slid to the floor and let out a sigh of relief. So far so good. I could do this. Give him a few moments to cloister himself away in my brothers room and then I could slip out the door and into the night until he left. I could apologize to him later if he even said anything. If he even noticed I was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce I gained a bit of confidence I dug through my dresser quickly, tearing off my school skirt and replacing it with a slightly longer one. I threw a light blue sweater on over a plain white t-shirt after replacing my school button up blouse. Listening at the door a moment I couldn\u2019t hear any noise. But he had to be in Billy\u2019s room by now. As quietly as I could I slipped out of the room and headed for the stairs. I started in surprise as Chris met me coming up. I looked at the ground as I moved to go past him but he grabbed me by the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you Chel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t give me that line of bull. You\u2019ve been avoiding me since I got here. You were the one who <br>\r\ninvited me over remember? You haven\u2019t been acting at all like yourself. So spill it. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhy did he have to be so perceptive over the oddest things? Why couldn\u2019t he just drop it like he normally did when I wanted him to? I pulled my arm out of his light grip and tried to get past him again without answering, simply telling him to drop it. But his hand shot out and planted itself against the wall to bar my way. I could have ducked under it but I knew he would continue to stop me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot good enough. I\u2019ve known you too long and there is something bugging you. Is it something I said or did? Somebody threaten you? Tell me. I have this uneasy pit in my stomach and I can\u2019t just let this drop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust leave me alone already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t leave you alone! I\u2019m your friend Chel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSomething inside of me burst. The pit in my stomach seemed to rear up and engulf me and I couldn\u2019t help raising my voice a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut you don\u2019t want to be right! You want to be more and I don\u2019t! Everybody wants us to be more. Always saying we should hook up. Making offhand comments about how you are part of the family! It never stops! That\u2019s the problem! Why don\u2019t you all just drop it! I bet you are still acting like my friend because you think it will help you get in my pants!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe slapped me across the face before I could say anything else. It hadn\u2019t been hard but it still stung. It was the first time I could think of he had hit me. My eyes widened a bit in shock as I stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStop talking right there. I like you. I won\u2019t deny that. You saying you didn\u2019t want to go out didn\u2019t suddenly change that fact. But I\u2019m happy being your friend if that\u2019s all you want. I\u2019ll get over you eventually and I will find someone else. But that doesn\u2019t change the facts. Whether we date or not you are still my friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou hit me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I\u2019ll do it again if you keep talking stupid like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI hunched my shoulders a bit and looked away. I felt my lips moving as they mumbled a few words on their own. I hadn\u2019t meant to utter them. But after hearing him talk to my brother about girls they had just come out. Even I wasn\u2019t sure if I had spoken them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI bet you don\u2019t even love me anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore I even knew what was happening he had grabbed me up by the shoulders and his lips were pressed against mine. I didn\u2019t know what to do. My body simply stiffened in shock. The moment seemed to go on forever until he pulled away and stared at me so intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat is how much I love you. Even if you forget it I never will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt like a fish out of water. My mouth opening and closing just a fraction. I didn\u2019t know what to do or how to respond. Should I slap him? Should I yell at him? Before I knew what I was doing my feet had already taken me down the steps. I had my shoes on and was out the door before my mind finally caught up to me. I needed to get away. I needed to think. So I ran. And all the while the pit in my stomach grew bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cOh yeah, things just got steamy up in here. This Chris is a regular smooth operator. A little rough around the edges but give him a few years and he could have all the women falling for him. I really want to see what happens to him next. But I also want to know what Chel is thinking. Ok, that\u2019s a bit of a lie, I already know what they are both thinking, but you don\u2019t. I can\u2019t give away too much as long as you are around. So I am trying to act more human for you. So you can identify with me more. Is it working?

Mr. Winters greeted me like a long lost son like he always did and ushered me into the house. I grinned at him as I slipped my shoes off and stepped up into the main hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHoney! I\u2019m Home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMr. Winters chuckled at my usual exclamation. I was expecting Chel to come out like she normally did and try to glomp me. Then we would banter back and forth a moment or two and we would all move on with the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBur Chel didn\u2019t appear. That was odd. It had never happened before. Billy did come running down the steps though, launching himself from the lest step to squeeze me around the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBro!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ruffled his hair as he grinned up at me. He was pretty tall at fourteen, though he had yet to go through a growth spurt. His head coming up barely to the middle of my chest. Another set of pounding feet on the stairs a moment later and another boy was standing in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBro, this is Sam, a friend from school. Sam this is Chris. He isn\u2019t really my brother but he\u2019s cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe put his hand next to his mouth and whispered loud enough so everyone could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe likes my sister. It\u2019s only a matter of time until he becomes my brother for real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think your sister might have something to say about that squirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ll win her over. And I\u2019ll help. Just tell me what you want me to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ruffled his hair again as we shared a conspiratorial wink as Mrs. Winters came out of the kitchen wiping her hands. She smiled when she saw me as well, opening her arms and inviting me into a hug which I accepted. Everything else was normal about this visit, so why did I feel so uneasy all of a sudden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChel is finishing up in the kitchen dear. Dinner will be ready in about an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSweet! Then you can help us with our homework right? And then we can play Splat after dinner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBilly began tugging on my arm and pulling me upstairs and I let him. I didn\u2019t mind helping with homework but I told him we would have to see about video games afterwards. He didn\u2019t seem to hear me but that wasn\u2019t unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore I knew it I was in his room sitting on his bed while him and Sam plopped down in chairs at his desk. But instead of starting into the papers in front of him he swung around to face me, pulling his feet up onto the seat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI heard you confessed to sis and she shot you down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI heard you wanted me to help you with your homework.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPfft. I don\u2019t need no help. This stuff is easy. I just wanted to hear the dirt on your confession.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLittle busybody aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on tell me please? Maybe give me some tips on what to do? Or not to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat? Got your eyes on someone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMaybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo I told him how it happened. How I had gone with the standard confession in an empty classroom after school. And her just as quick reply. He asked a few questions and I answered as best I could. From the direction of his questions he did have someone he liked and wanted to ask out. I finally just told him to go for it. There was no \u201cperfect\u201d time and place. If he waited to say anything it would end up being too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDinner\u2019s ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced at the door in surprise. Had it really been an hour already? I always seemed to lose track of time while I was here. Everyone just made me feel like I belonged when I came over here. But I couldn\u2019t forget myself. Couldn\u2019t get too comfortable. I had to keep my distance if I wanted to keep Chel from getting hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnly half my mind was on my surroundings as I followed Billy down the steps and into the dining room. The other half was mulling over the uneasiness that kept growing inside of me. Chel hadn\u2019t even come upstairs to say hi. She might have been busy with dinner but she would have normally found time to see me, if even for a moment. This wasn\u2019t how things were supposed to be. Had something happened between the time I had left her until now? Had I somehow done something to upset her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPass the potatoes please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter handing over the bowl I cut another piece of meat off and stuck it in my mouth. Why wouldn\u2019t she look me in the eyes? In fact she seemed to act like I wasn\u2019t even here. This was not how it was supposed to be. I needed to get to the bottom of this. Needed to fix this somehow. But I couldn\u2019t worry anyone else. I could already see them all looking sideways at me because I was so silent. I wasn\u2019t acting normal either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is good Mrs. W. Been a while since I had hamburger steak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease how many times have I told you to call me mom. I mean you\u2019re practically family anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut I\u2019m not family yet so I don\u2019t feel right calling you mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s never going to be family so you should just drop it mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChel\u2019s reply, while more like her normal retort lacked the usual vibrancy and cheerfulness she usually had. I dropped the subject and simply finished eating, having a bit of small talk but otherwise keeping quiet. Once dinner was over I helped clear the table before helping Mrs. Winter wash dishes. She shooed me away after only a moment, saying it was her job not mine. That I was a guest. I feigned being hurt by her words but left her to her own devices when she giggled at my theatrics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHeading upstairs I ran into Chel who looked away as she tried to slip past to go downstairs. I snagged her arm before she could go anywhere and forced her to look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you Chel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t give me that line of bull. You\u2019ve been avoiding me since I got here. You were the one who invited me over remember? You haven\u2019t been acting at all like yourself. So spill it. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe pulled her arm out of my grasp. \u201cI said nothing was wrong! Just drop it all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she again tried to slip past me I barred her path with a hand against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot good enough. I\u2019ve known you too long and there is something bugging you. Is it something I said or did? Somebody threaten you? Tell me. I have this uneasy pit in my stomach and I can\u2019t just let this drop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust leave me alone already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t leave you alone! I\u2019m your friend Chel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut you don\u2019t want to be right! You want to be more and I don\u2019t! Everybody wants us to be more. Always saying we should hook up. Making offhand comments about how you are part of the family! It never stops! That\u2019s the problem! Why don\u2019t you all just drop it! I bet you are still acting like my friend because you think it will help you get in my pants!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slapped her across the face before she could go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStop talking right there. I like you. I won\u2019t deny that. You saying you didn\u2019t want to go out didn\u2019t suddenly change that fact. But I\u2019m happy being your friend if that\u2019s all you want. I\u2019ll get over you eventually and I will find someone else. But that doesn\u2019t change the facts. Whether we date or not you are still my friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe reached up and rubbed her cheek while looking at me in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou hit me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I\u2019ll do it again if you keep talking stupid like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI bet you don\u2019t even love me anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was only a mumble but I heard it anyway as she looked away from me with downcast eyes. I couldn\u2019t hold myself back anymore. My emotions were already high and those words were like a stab through the heart. I grabbed her shoulders suddenly, making her look at me in surprise. Before she could react I planted my lips on hers and pulled her in close. I could feel her rigid body in my arms as I tried to convey my feelings to her in that single kiss. Finally I pulled away and stared into her beautiful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat is how much I love you. Even if you forget it I never will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe blinked at me a moment before tearing herself out of my embrace and running downstairs. I watched her push past her mom and dad who were looking up at us around the banister with grins on their faces. She ran to the door and slipped on her shoes before racing into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard a creaking open behind me and turned in time to see Billy and Sam opening the bedroom door wider, their faces still peeking around the frame. When Billy noticed me looking at him he whistled and gave me a thumbs up sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAren\u2019t you going to chase after her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I said my piece. She needs time to be alone and sort it out herself. I don\u2019t want to push her too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s my big brother, the ladies man. I want to be just like you when I grow up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo you don\u2019t. You have no idea how lucky you have it squirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI headed downstairs to slipped on my shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think it best if I go home now. I doubt she will want to see me when she gets back. Let her know I\u2019m going to drop the matter. I know how she feels about me and I would like to go back to normal tomorrow. I didn\u2019t mean to actually kiss her, but I\u2019m not sorry I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t see any of us complaining do you? Maybe that will wake her up and she will finally admit she likes you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave them a final parting wave before heading off down the street towards my house. Things were about to change. I could feel it in my bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cOh yeah, things just got steamy up in here. This Chris is a regular smooth operator. A little rough around the edges but give him a few years and he could have all the women falling for him. I really want to see what happens to him next. But I also want to know what Chel is thinking. Ok, that\u2019s a bit of a lie, I already know what they are both thinking, but you don\u2019t. I can\u2019t give away too much as long as you are around. So I am trying to act more human for you. So you can identify with me more. Is it working? Well what will you choose?\u201d</b></i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tHe kissed me! He kissed me! Why did he kissed me? Was I supposed to be happy or angry? I liked him but not like that right? What was I supposed to think? Things were changing and I couldn\u2019t stop them. I didn\u2019t want this. Didn\u2019t want things to change. What was I supposed to do now? I couldn\u2019t face him. I would say I was sick and stay home tomorrow. Yes that was reasonable. Missing one day of school wouldn\u2019t be too bad. Or even two or three. I could just change schools entirely, that would fix everything. I just couldn\u2019t face him right now. Maybe not ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI finally stopped running when my side began to hurt a bit. Looking around I didn\u2019t recognize anything. This was the shopping district, I knew that much from the stores around me, but it wasn\u2019t a part that I recognized. How had I gotten here exactly? I had simply taken turns blindly in my haste and now I was lost. Perhaps I should stay lost forever. Then I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about facing Chris again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat was stupid. Even if I wanted to, Chris would find me. He always found me when I was in real trouble. No matter how hard I tried to hide from him he would search for me and eventually find me. It was like he had a sixth sense. With a sinking dread I slowly turned around in a circle, trying to find some landmark I might recognize. Even if I could find a bus stop I could make it home eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNothing revealed itself though, so I sighed a bit before starting to walk in a random direction. I\u2019d find something eventually. My phone! I could call home when I was ready and dad could come pick me up! Feeling a bit better about myself I slipped my hand in my pocket to clutch that lifeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt wasn\u2019t there. I frantically checked every pocket but I didn\u2019t have my phone on me. A quick flashback of changing and forgetting to pull my phone out of my school uniform zipped through my mind as the anxiety came back. I didn\u2019t even have my wallet on me so I couldn\u2019t even take a bus if I found one. Why was I so forgetful! Why did I have to leave everything at home now of all times?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI continued walking without a real clear direction, making random turns. Looking for a police officer to help me if nothing else. I noticed I was being followed by five boys as I was turning the corner. I hadn\u2019t paid much attention to them to begin with but this was the fourth time they had turned where I had. I didn\u2019t recognize any of them but they looked seedy. Chris had shown me how to spot troublemakers like this. I had thought he was just being overly paranoid at the time but now I was glad he had shown me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen I turned another corner I started running. I didn\u2019t care where I ran to, I just needed to put distance between me and them. That\u2019s what Chris had told me to do. I might not know what to think about him right now but he had never given me bad advice before. I heard the shouts behind me as they turned the corner and saw me flying down the sidewalk dodging in and out of the crowd. As I took another corner I risked a glance back and saw them chasing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy ankle twisted a bit and I fell. An intense pain shot up my leg from where my knee scraped the cement. I could feel the wetness of blood as I stood up and continued to run. Their voices were louder now. I had lost a lot of ground by falling. I noticed the street light turning from red to green and ran out into the middle of the street to get to the other side. I knew it was foolish. Incredibly stupid and dangerous. Chris would have yelled at me for doing something like this if he was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHorns blared angrily but I made it across, putting a sea of vehicles between me and them. But I didn\u2019t stop running. They were still to close. I rounded another corner and then ducked into an alley so I wasn\u2019t on the main street. A hand shot out of a pile of boxes and grabbed my leg, making me shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGot any change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shook my leg frantically, dislodging his hand but losing my shoe in the process. I didn\u2019t care. I needed to get out of here. So I ran to the other end of the alley and into the next street. My running was lopsided with only one shoe so I pulled the other one off and tossed it away. Intent only on getting to safety. I was blinded in my panic, I knew that. All I saw was flashing lights and blurs of color. Sometimes a person as I bumped into them and slowed down, sometimes hearing an angry comment to watch out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stopped when my side began to hurt again. I was no great runner. I didn\u2019t have much stamina. I was just scared. It had been stupid to just leave like that. To just run wildly from the house in the first place. I was stupid. Looking around I found I was standing in front of a bus stop bench with clear plastic walls and a roof. I sat down dejectedly, not even caring if those boys found me. I was lost, tired, hurt, and stupid. I wanted Chris to come save me. Even if he kissed me again I wanted him to find me like he always did and take me home. I covered my face as the tears began to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo, What\u2019s the matter girl? You lost or somethin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChris had found me! I was so glad that he was here. I turned to yell at him for not finding me sooner and my voice caught in my throat. It wasn\u2019t Chris. I didn\u2019t even know this guy. He stood at almost six and a half feet tall and looked like someone had condensed down a building and stuffed it under his skin. He had a bit of a mean look on his face as his deep inset black eyes watched me. I instinctively flinched back before I could stop myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI must have hurt his feelings because he hunched his shoulders a bit, sticking his hands in his pockets and trying to look as unthreatening as possible. But he had the same feel as Chris did. That sense that even though he looked mean on the outside, he was nice on the inside. I felt like I could trust him. So I swallowed once and nodded my head at his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I\u2019m lost. And I forgot my cell phone at home. Some guys chased me and I just ran. I lost my shoes someplace and I tripped while running. I finally lost them but I don\u2019t know where I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you live around here? If so I could walk you home. I know this area pretty well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChris had said not to trust people too easily, but I just wanted to go home. If he was willing to help me then I would accept his help. If he meant to harm me there was nothing I could do. And to top it all off it was beginning to rain lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c113 East Lancer Street.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe nodded quickly before sitting down on the bench next to me and slipping off his sneakers and handing them to me. I tried to protest but he wouldn\u2019t hear any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey might be a little big but at least it will cover your feet. Your street isn\u2019t too far away. About a twenty minute walk. I\u2019ve got a friend that lives over that way so I know the general area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stripped off his shirt as well and handed it to me to use as a makeshift umbrella. When I opened my mouth to tell him he didn\u2019t need to he shushed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t\u201cIt\u2019s not that cold out and I\u2019m not bothered by it. I\u2019m built to not get colds. You know the saying, stupid don\u2019t catch colds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re not stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes I am. I know it. It\u2019s just the way I was born.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWon\u2019t your feet get cold and wet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cProbably. But better my feet get wet then your\u2019s. You look like the type that catches a cold easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you are right kind of, I do catch colds more often then other people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis shoes were really large on my feet, I felt like a clown in them. They clopped along on the wet cement and I had to push my feet back into them every few steps. But I was still secretly glad to have them. I didn\u2019t want to walk home in wet cold socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s your name anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m Chelsea Winters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRichard Noel. Pleasure to meet you. So any particular reason you were out so late?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh, I know that tone. Boy trouble I bet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m psychic. Actually been on the other side with some girl trouble of my own just recently. My friend helped me out of it. Want to tell me about it? Perhaps I can pass the favor on. You don\u2019t know me and I don\u2019t know you. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to talk to a near stranger about this kind of stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was silent for a moment but then hesitantly told him, condensing it down as best I could into just a few sentences. He walked along quietly, staring straight ahead as if deep in thought. Finally he gave a small grin and told me his thoughts on the matter. They all seemed to make sense. They helped me sort out my own confused thoughts and emotions a little and put them in perspective. After he said his piece he was content to simply walk along in silence. I was thankful for that because I wanted to think. Finally things started looking familiar right before we turned into the residential area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks for trying to help me. Oddly I feel better now. You\u2019re right, I really need to think about what I want. I never thought that I was being unfair to him before. Despite what you say, you\u2019re pretty smart. A dumb person wouldn\u2019t have been able to talk like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks. But it doesn\u2019t take brains to have a bit of common sense and just speak your mind. But I will take your compliment with grace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt wasn\u2019t long before we were finally home. I returned his clothes to him and offered to let him come in and dry off but he shook his head. Saying he had to get home as well. I gave him one last wave as he left the yard and headed back the way we had come. I watched him disappear into the darkness for a moment before closing the door on the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So she won\u2019t be going to school today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI understand Mrs. W. Make sure to let her know that I hope she gets better soon. Also to stay away from the church over on Peach for a few days. I heard they have a bit of an asbestos problem and are cleaning it up. I don\u2019t want her breathing any of it in by accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to let her know. Have a good day at school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMom closed the door and I let out a sigh as I slid down the wall just out of sight. She came around the corner into the living room and looked down at me quietly for a moment before squatting in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to go? It\u2019s not to late and I am sure you could catch up with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I can\u2019t face him right now. I just can\u2019t. I\u2019m still just so confused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure you are. I\u2019m sure getting kissed like that out of the blue could throw anyone off. Though you didn\u2018t seem to dislike it from where I was standing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust leave me alone for now mom please? I don\u2019t know what I feel and I already know you approve of what he did even if you lie about it to try and make me feel better. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you put him up to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a slight nod as she stood up, putting her hand on my head before going off into the house to do whatever she did all day. I laid my head on my raised knees, unable to move for the moment. I had meant to go to school today, I really had. But when I had put my hand on the knob I just hadn\u2019t been able to open the door. The thought of seeing Chris waiting there like he was every morning had terrified me. That\u2019s why I had hid from him. Having my mom make such a lame excuse. I was sure he saw right through it. But he was willing to play along for my sake. Willing to give me time. That was all I needed was time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKeep telling yourself that Chelsea and maybe you\u2019ll believe it. I needed more than time. I needed to come to a decision. I needed to make up my mind one way or another what exactly it was I wanted. Figure out what kind of relationship I wanted to have with him. That Richard fellow from last night was right. This was unfair to him. To act like nothing happened and continue to hang all over him like I always did. I wasn\u2019t taking his feelings into account, only worried about my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI wasn\u2019t sure how long I sat there like that. An hour? Ten minutes? I just couldn\u2019t seem to stand up and move. The pit in my stomach seemed to just weigh me down to much. An irrational fear of moving made my body tremble. I felt the lump in my throat and tears threatening one moment and then nothing the next. I was a royal mess. The phone rang, breaking me out of my thoughts and causing me to jump. I heard my mother answering it out in the hall and then a moment later she came into the room holding it out to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s for you. One of your teachers at school checking up on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI took the phone tentatively. Who would call to check up on me? Especially so soon? My mother walked away so I could talk in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cH-Hello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood morning Chelsea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was a male voice but I didn\u2019t recognize it. I sorted through all my male teachers but this voice definitely didn\u2019t match any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho are you? You aren\u2019t a teacher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho I am isn\u2019t important. What is important is your answer to a simple question. Do you want to know the truth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKnow what truth? What are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe truth about everything. About the world you live in, about where Chris goes and what he does when you aren\u2019t around. Who he really is. The truth about your feelings for him. You will never figure out anything if all you do is sit around doing nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was silent, unable to answer him. My fingers gripping the receiver hard enough to hurt. How did he know all this? Who was this person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you want to know the truth then head over to the church on Peach street right now. You will get all your answers there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut Chris said they were clearing out asbestos from that place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I am sure it was just as true as the fact that you are sick. The choice is yours to make. Go or not. If you are happy with the way things stand then do nothing. But if you don\u2019t go you are going to lose something precious to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSomething precious? Like what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDeep down you already know the answer to that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a click on the other end moments before the dial tone began buzzing in my ear. I pulled the phone away and looked at it a bit stupidly, wondering if I could trust anything he had said. The call had been more than strange. Mom came back in then wiping her hands dry on her apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s nice that your teacher was worried about you sweetie. Mr. Jones sounded like a very nice man. I hope I get to meet him at the school festival next week. My! That means the school year is coming to a close doesn\u2019t it? Only two weeks after the festival and you will be home all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe took the phone from my fingers before leaving me alone again. The truth huh. About this world, about Chris, about my feelings. Before I knew it I was pulling on my shoes and my hand was already opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m going out for a bit Mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right sweetie! Stay out of trouble and don\u2019t stay out too late!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let the door close and took off at a jog towards Peach street. The church was actually on my normal route to school so I knew it would take about five minutes to get there at this pace. It wasn\u2019t far from Billy\u2019s middle school as well. Come to think about it, the church was pretty much in the center of the town. A stones throw away from many of the most important places, like the schools, the court house, even the police station. But for all of that why did it always seem abandoned?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could see the tall steeple of the church rising up in front of me. I just needed to go down this road and make a left and I would be there. But before I could take more than another three steps a woman jumped out of the shadows and snatched me up I struggled to get free but she was holding on too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t go there! I don\u2019t know what he said to you but don\u2019t go any farther! Stay away from that church!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cListen to me please! You have to trust me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho are you! I don\u2019t even know you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh baby! I\u2019m sorry! I keep forgetting. This must be very frightening for you. Are you sure you don\u2019t recognize me even a little?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shook my head back and forth quickly, too afraid to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s me, your mother. Please remember! Remember who I am\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe cut off whatever she was about to say, looking over her shoulder quickly at Chris who was just turning the corner coming from the church. She let out a grunt of displeasure and grimaced before letting me go, running off down the street away from him. He jogged over to me in surprise and looked off at the fleeing woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know. She said she was my mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis eyes got a distant look to them as he stared more intently at the empty street where the woman had just been. He chewed his lower lip a moment as his eyes narrowed but he didn\u2019t say anything else. Hesitantly I looked from him to the empty street and back before my curiosity became too great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you know her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo\u2026 She just reminded me of someone I once knew. Anyways what are you doing here? I thought I told you not to come around the church for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI could ask you the same thing. What are you doing here? Shouldn\u2019t you be in school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe gave me an offhand shrug. \u201cI ditched. Just like you did. But that still doesn\u2019t answer my question, why are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore I could open my mouth the world tilted sideways and I found myself laying on the ground. My mind processed the fact that I had heard a loud booming noise, that was why my ears were ringing. I saw a tall column of flames and smoke rising into the air where the church steeple had stood moments before. Above me Chris was standing with braced feet staring up at the flames, his fist clenched tightly with a look that has hard to describe on his face. There was sadness and joy mixed in with a sense of knowing and perhaps a bit of madness. It was a face I had never seen him make before and I never wanted to see again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<b><i>\u201cAll right! A bit of senseless violence to start the day. I remember when I used to do things like that. Smite a heathen or two just for the fun of it. It really brightens the mornings. Makes the rest of the day feel extra special. It was really fun when I flung meteorites down on their cities. But I only did that once, and they deserved it. It really couldn\u2019t be called interference at all really. The meteors were already going to hit the Earth. I just sort of \u2026 tweaked their trajectory a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh, enough with the fond reminiscing. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to hear sordid tales of my youth. You want to know about these fine people. So, what will it be? The bewildered damsel or the enigmatic man?\u201d</i></b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tFor the first time since I could remember knowing him, I was afraid of Chris. That look on his face scared me like nothing else had. It just wasn\u2019t right. There was something off about it. Like he was a bit insane while smiling like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I got to my feet Chris turned at a slight sound behind us. When I looked as well I felt my jaw dropping in surprise. I pointed at the new person almost reflexively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou! You\u2019re the guy from last night! Richard Noel right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAye. And you\u2019re Chelsea Winters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait, you two know each other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah he walked me home last night after\u2026 after dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t know that trouble you were telling me about was Chris! If I had I would have given you better advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLike what you oversized muscle factory?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLike she should stay as far away from you as possible. That you are nothing but trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two of them shook hands, grinning like fools. Seeming to be unconcerned that someone had just blown up the church. When Chris asked Richard why he was here, the big man glanced at me before pulling him off to the side to have a whispered conversation. I tried to make my ears grow so I could hear what they were saying without being obtrusive about it but all I heard was unintelligible mumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust who were these two anyway? That strange voice on the phone had been right. Chris was hiding something from me. Perhaps a lot of something\u2019s. I didn\u2019t know the truth about anything. I suddenly got this insight that I had been in the dark about everything. Living some sort of lie that Chris knew the truth about. Being happy in my ignorance while Chris lived a life I knew nothing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two of them finally finished their conversation and Richard headed off away from us thanking Chris for his help and giving a wave. Chris waved back, calling after him in parting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo worries. And if I don\u2019t see you again soon, keep safe and don\u2019t die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBack at you bro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced up at the fire in fascination. Somehow I knew some of the answers that I wanted was right around the corner. All I had to do was take the few steps and get there. Chris broke me out of my reverie by shaking my shoulders. I looked at him a bit stupidly, trying to shake myself out of the trance those flames had put me under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChel. I want you to go home. Run as fast as you can and don\u2019t go outside for anything. For nothing you hear me! I don\u2019t care if someone will grant your every wish if you just step outside. Don\u2019t leave the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll go get Billy out of school and send him home too. Something big is going down. I don\u2019t know what but it is dangerous. I don\u2019t want you getting hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cO-Ok. You\u2019ll come home with Billy then right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course. I\u2019d hate to die and make you cry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave him a small nod. He was always trying to protect me. I should listen to him. He was worried about me. I turned to go but he held me back, his hand lingering on my arm. I looked back at him puzzled. Did he have something else he had forgotten to say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChel. Always remember that I love you. For now and forever. No matter what happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe turned and started jogging then, heading back towards the fire. Back towards the answers. I hesitated a moment before starting to run as well. Run after him like a fool. Turning the corner shortly after him I saw bodies littering the ground where they had been flung by the blast. Half charred and still smoking, both alive and dead. Some moaning, some screaming. Ahead of me Chris ran past them all. One of them shot out an arm and grabbed him, ask for help. I thought he would stop and help him, that was the kind of person he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tInstead I watched horrified as he pulled a knife from behind his back. As he swung it downward the blade seemed to fold out into a sword which sliced clean through the mans arm at the elbow. He flicked it up, returning it to dagger size and shoving it back into the hidden place on his back he had taken it from and kept running without a backwards glance. I felt my hand rise to my mouth as bile rose in my throat, a scream threatening to erupt from my mouth. Chris shook the hand off his ankle absently as he picked up his pace a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHow could he do that! That wasn\u2019t Chris. It couldn\u2019t be. The Chris I knew was nothing like that. He was a bit of a trouble maker and got into a fight every now and again but he was a good guy. And what kind of weapon was that? I had never seen anything like that before. I hadn\u2019t thought anything like that could exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPicking my way through the bodies, I tried not to throw up at the stench. I couldn\u2019t let him out of my sight. I had to get to the bottom of this. I had to ask him exactly what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut he was fast. He was almost out of sight by the time I managed to maneuver through the road in front of the church. I knew where he was going though. He had told me he was going to get Billy and the middle school was at the end of this street. Running as hard as I could I finally came in sight of the walled in school, the white walls standing a towering eight feet in the air like an impenetrable barricade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was just in time to see him running up a tree trunk without using his hands. It looked like some sort of wire retracted into his belt when he flicked his arm. He didn\u2019t hesitate to run along the branch and jump to the top of the wall within seconds of getting up the tree. He moved so fluidly, nothing like I had seen him move before. He had made scaling that wall seem effortless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ran over to the gate guard demanding to be let in. the guy looked at me like I was crazy as he asked for my name. I was about to give it to him when I noticed him starting to pick up the phone. He was going to call the police on me. I was supposed to be in school. I was playing hooky right now so he wanted my name to give to the authorities. I saw Chris running to the side of the building through the gate and I got angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust let me in god **** it! My friend is in there! He thinks something bad is going to happen and he is trying to save my brother! I don\u2019t know what is going on but I think he is right! So just open the ****gate for me will you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe guard automatically glanced where I was pointing and saw Chris fading into the distance. He gave a shout of surprise as he grabbed up a nightstick and left the guard box to chase after him. I grabbed my head in frustration, banging on the gate as if that would make it budge. What was wrong with these people? Why was he treating me and Chris like some sort of criminal? Had things always been this way and I had just been too blind to notice? And now that I thought about it, why did the schools lock us in anyway? It was like we were prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw Chris coming back around the side of the building, the gate guard yelling right behind him. Plastering myself against the wall so as not to be spotted I waited. Soon enough I heard some scraping and looked around the corner, seeing my brother jumping down off the wall. A second later Chris was on top as well, crouching with his hands between his legs. The guard was yelling and blustering for him to get down but the words were ignored. Chris looked back at the school a moment and stiffened like he had seen a ghost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen I turned to search the school building through the gate I didn\u2019t see anything out of place. But something had spooked him. Then I heard his voice from the top of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBilly. Go home without me. Stay inside all day no matter what. No matter what you see or hear just run straight home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTrust me. Now go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBilly began to run down the street. He only made it a few feet before he stopped and turned to look back. I heard shifting rocks as Chris jumped off the wall and the yells from the guard suddenly stopped. A glance through the bars let me just make out the guys feet laying motionless on the ground. Chris ran into the school building like a bat out of hell. I didn\u2019t notice when Billy came up beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are you doing here sis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t answer him, simply stared at the front of the school building. A pit growing in my stomach like a black hole. Dread sucked at the very core of my being. Just when I thought I was being overly paranoid the school exploded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was like a chain reaction going off. First the outermost windows of the school blew outward on all three floors and then the next set as it worked its way inward. I could hear the screams from here. Screams that were abruptly cut off a second later. With one final heave the top two floors of the school burst outwards, raining rocks, debris and body parts down everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mouth opened and closed a few times as my mind tried to accept what it was I was seeing. This couldn\u2019t be happening. This was impossible. I wouldn\u2019t believe it. A child\u2019s hand landed in the yard just on the other side of the fence. Charred and unrecognizable but a finger still twitching. I felt my hand rising to my mouth in horror. I didn\u2019t realize I was already screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCH---R---I---S!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u201cOuch. Looks like lover boy is dead. I wonder how she will take this. Well I already know of course\u2026 but you don\u2019t. Such a tragic end for boy wonder too. I wonder if Richard could get her on the rebound. Oops I better not spoil anything for you. So\u2026 uh\u2026 yeah\u2026 that was a joke by the way. Richard won\u2019t get her on the rebound\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u2026..<br>\r\n\u2026..<br>\r\n\u2026..</b></i></span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t know what is going on but big brother Chris told me to get home and not leave. I think he was right. I have a feeling things are going to get bad really soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt his hand tugging on mine and let him lead me away. I couldn\u2019t stop the tears from flowing. He was dead. Blown into little bits. Why had he gone into the school? Why hadn\u2019t he left with Billy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe world passed me in a blur. It was all just random noises and flashing moments of darkness and light. It was over. Everything was over. Chris wouldn\u2019t be there in the mornings to greet me. Or make witty one liners with his dry sarcastic voice. He wouldn\u2019t be there to play along with my flights of fancy, or make me feel safe when I was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI wouldn\u2019t hear him tell me that he loved me anymore or see him glancing at me sideways when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking. All the normal days were gone in an instant. Destroyed along with the school. He had somehow known all about this. Somehow he knew it was going to happen. He had been telling me goodbye before. Back before he had left me at the church. I had just been too stupid to realize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI wanted to tell him I loved him too. I knew that now. Funny how I only realized it after he was dead. I wanted to answer his feelings properly. But I couldn\u2019t now. He\u2019d never get to hear those words. Why had I been so stupid? So blind? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI blinked a few times and realized I was standing in the living room. When had I gotten here? When had we left the school? I needed to go back there. He might still be alive. It was possible. He could have escaped. He wasn\u2019t allowed to be dead until I told him how I felt. Please god, just let him be alive! Let him somehow escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned to leave the room, fully intending to walk back to the school when my dad stepped in front of door and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s best if you stay inside honey. Billy told us what happened and I was out there. It\u2019s not safe right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut he\u2019s alive! He needs my help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf he is still alive then the police will handle it. If you go out now you will end up getting killed and he wouldn\u2019t want that now would he? There is rioting in the streets and a lot of madness all over town. It probably won\u2019t reach this section though and the military is already enforcing order. I don\u2019t want you to get caught up in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThen what am I supposed to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard the lost and pleading tone of my voice but didn\u2019t care. The world was ending. Chris was dead and nothing my dad was saying made much sense. This was Gorgon City, where nothing really bad happened. There was no way there could be rioting. No way Chris could actually be dead. This was like what happened in a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat was it! This was all a dream! I would wake up and none of this will have happened! All I needed to do was pinch myself awake. After all, Chris couldn\u2019t cut off someone\u2019s arm or climb trees without using his hands. He couldn\u2019t do any of the stuff I had seen him do. He would never say the things he had said. Leaving me or Billy alone in a real crises and simply telling us to run home. That wasn\u2019t like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pinched my arm but nothing happened except I felt the sharp pain where I had grabbed. Maybe the arm wasn\u2019t a good spot, maybe my cheek would be better. Still nothing. I had to find someplace more painful. I had to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mom touched my arm, shaking her head when I looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not a dream sweetie. Doing that will do no good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt the tears beginning to well up again as she took me in her arms and rocked me back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s ok sweetie. Maybe he did make it out. If he did I just know he will come running over here straight away. When he does I bet he is going to be really hungry. So let\u2019s set a plate for him at lunch ok? You can cry your eyes out and make yourself look nice so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about you when he comes. You know he will worry if you aren\u2019t your usual self, because that\u2019s just how he is. Now why don\u2019t you help me prepare lunch ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slowly nodded my head against her chest and let her lead me towards the kitchen. She was right. He would come running as soon as he could. He always came running. He always found me when I was lost. Always knew the right things to say to make me feel better. And right now I was really lost and needed to hear his voice. Even if it was to make fun of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cPoor girl. She just can\u2019t accept that he is dead. What is it about you mortals anyway? Whenever someone dies you almost always beg me to give them back to you. Yet ninety percent of the rest of the time you are either cursing my name or don\u2019t believe I exist. It\u2019s not all that easy to bring a person back to life you know. There is a natural order to things. Even I can\u2019t mess with that order easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat did you think? I would make light of this situation? I\u2019m not that heartless. I can appreciate such somber moments of loss as well. Even if I can\u2019t completely understand it. Losing something or someone precious is always hard to handle. I hope she can get over this soon.\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI blinked and found myself staring at my reflection in the bathroom mirror. How long had I been standing here? How long had the water been running? Slowly I turned the faucet off and looked at my reflection again. My long blond hair seemed to have lost some of its luster and my blue eyes were rimmed red from so much crying. They had lost some of the life in them as well. Was this really what I looked like? I needed to fix this. I couldn\u2019t let Chris see me like this. He would make fun of me for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ran a comb through my hair, holding it up in a few different positions. Deciding to wear it in a ponytail. He always had liked ponytails. Once that was done I used a bit of make-up and water to clear away the worst of the red around my eyes. When he came for lunch I would waste no time in telling him how I felt. He would like that. But that meant I had to be strong, I couldn\u2019t cry anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter leaving the bathroom I headed for the stairs. While passing Billy\u2019s room I heard muffled sobs through his door. My own eyes began to water again, threatening to undo all the work I had just done. Clenching my fists I walked away. Chris was still alive after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLunchtime drew near and I began to get anxious. What would he say to my confession? Would he kiss me again? Did I want him to kiss me again in front of my family? Would he laugh at how worried I was about him? If he did I would smack him. But that was just like him too. To simply laugh off a serious event like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we sat around the table everyone seemed to be forcing themselves to act cheerful for my sake. I wasn\u2019t worried. I knew he would come. I had set a plate out for him after all. I had piled it with mashed potatoes, some peas, and topped his hamburger steak with mushrooms. He loved mushrooms. It was ready and waiting for him. Now all he had to do was come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe doorbell rang just as I was about to put my first forkful of food in my mouth. I dropped it back to my plate as I bounded out of my chair. He was here! Just like my mom said he would be. I knew he wasn\u2019t dead! I could feel my cheeks stretched to their fullest as I yanked open the door. My grin disappearing in an instant when I saw it was old Miss Haubenaker from across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChelsea dear! What are you doing home? Shouldn\u2019t you be in school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy hand dropped listlessly from the door as I turned to shuffle back to the table. My mom came around the corner and saw who it was while I moved away, all my energy suddenly gone again. I heard the old woman ask to borrow some sugar but I didn\u2019t care. She wasn\u2019t Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLunchtime passed but still he didn\u2019t show up. I refused to let anyone take his plate off the table. He was going to be hungry when he came and hamburger steak was his favorite. Mom put some cling wrap over it but otherwise left it alone. With a sigh I shuffled into the living room and plopped down on the couch. aimlessly picking up the remote and flicking through the channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>\u201cAt eight fifty three this morning Heronus middle school exploded from an attack made by a terrorist group calling themselves the Inquisition. Police and firefighters have been working tirelessly to clear the wreckage. Of the two hundred and twenty three children that attend this school only twenty two are still alive. Those who did not attend school today for whatever reason were the only ones not killed by the explosion. No other survivors have been found. A copy of the official attendance records for this morning are being pulled off an external server and the families of the victims are being notified as we speak. Stay tuned to GCNS for more info.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo survivors. Of course there would be no survivors. It was impossible to survive a blast like that. I had been there after all. I knew there was no chance anyone could survive that. I let the remote drop back to the couch as my hands covered my face and I began to cry. The cushions next to me shifted as Billy sat down next to me. I latched on to him just like he latched onto me, our tears mingling together.</span></div></div>",

What would you like for dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll make you anything you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThings seemed to have calmed down outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI noted my mother heading off out of the living room again but couldn\u2019t find the energy to care. The TV was just a bunch of flashing lights and noise that didn\u2019t make any sense. I should turn it off. I kept staring at the screen where people were laughing for some reason. What was the point of turning it off? They would still be laughing. What was the point of anything? Chris was dead after all. Flicking a channel, eating, bathing, going to the bathroom, even the simple act of moving wouldn\u2019t change that. So why should I bother doing any of that? Better to just sit here and waste away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSomeone grabbed my hand and tried to pull me up. I resisted. I just wanted to sit here forever. I blinked as the tugging didn\u2019t stop, putting energy into turning my head to see who was pulling on my arm. It was Billy. Why was he trying to get me to move? I should tell him to stop. No. Let him tug, telling him to stop was too much effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on sis! Let\u2019s go to the store. We can get some things for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhy even reply? How could he be so cheerful? He had seen Chris die the same as I had. It had only happened less than nine hours ago. Had Chris meant so little to him? That he could just forget him so easily?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stopped tugging on my arm his eyes beginning to well up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on sis please? I know it hurts. I\u2019m doing my best to keep it together because that\u2019s what he would have done. What would he say to you if he saw you right now? Please get up. Please move. Just a short walk to the store ok? A bit of fresh air, a little exercise to get the blood flowing. For me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stared at me so intently. His eyes soft, reminding me of Chris\u2019 green ones. His lower lip quivered as he began tugging on my arm again. I didn\u2019t want to move. But I got unwillingly to my feet anyway. Because those eyes were so insistent. He steered me by the hand to the door, making me sit down again as he put my shoes on for me. What was the point in shoes? Nothing I stepped on would feel as bad as the emptiness inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe were out the door and walking down the street by the time I became aware of my surroundings again. I was useless. Worthless. A coward and a fool. Stupid and blind. There was nothing good about me. If there was he would still be alive. I was just a waste of space. He had known that. That\u2019s why he had left me. Why he hadn\u2019t trusted me. Why I couldn\u2019t save him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI should just end it all. Just kill myself to make up for it. No one would miss me. No one would mourn the loss of such a useless pile of garbage. They would probably cheer me on. Then I could see Chris again. Even though I didn\u2019t deserve to see him he would still find me in heaven or hell or wherever I ended up. Yes that made sense. I would kill myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cARRRRGGGGGHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSomeone was running at us with a baseball bat in his hands. He looked crazy. He looked like he was going to hurt us. That was fine. He could smash my head in for me. Save me the trouble of taking my own life. I felt my feet shuffle towards him even as my brother\u2019s hand tried to tug me back. I wasn\u2019t afraid. I could see Chris again soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA shadow came hurtling out of nowhere. It looked like a woman but I couldn\u2019t be sure. She caught the man running towards me with a clothesline, dragging him off into the night and around the corner before I could stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNOOOO! Bring him back! Let him kill me! Let him beat me senseless! Please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI began to cry in frustration as Billy pulled me after him. I didn\u2019t resist. I would just have to do it myself. I had time. I would find a way. Billy would try to stop me, but he couldn\u2019t watch me all the time. He would look away eventually. Perhaps if I could jump in front of a car. That might work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut no car crossed my path on the way to the store. I still had time. I had all the time in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBilly led me up and down the few isles of the convenience store, trying to get me interested in buying something. Talking about the newest candy like it mattered. Nothing mattered anymore. Nothing except dying. He tugged me up to the cashier and I wondered if he had a gun behind the counter. Didn\u2019t these kinds of places always have guns? Would he shoot me with it if I made a scene? Could I get it and shoot myself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore I could do anything though, Billy was already tugging me out into the evening again. I thought about resisting. About going back inside for the gun but it wasn\u2019t worth the effort. I could still slit my wrists or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA man stepped out of the shadows between the buildings across the street and headed towards us. No. Not a man, a monster. Four waving tentacles and a bulbous octopus head. Sickly orange skin and three eyes over a vicious looking beak of a mouth. The eyes to the left and right were cat eye green while the one in the middle was an almost neon yellow. Billy stepped in front of me as if to protect me. I didn\u2019t want protecting though, I wanted to die. This creature looked like it could accomplish that for me. But there was something familiar about this creature. Was it the eyes? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnna. It\u2019s me. It\u2019s time to go home now. It\u2019s time for the dream to end. You don\u2019t have to suffer anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGe-get back you freak! Stay away from my sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat voice. It was different, but at the same time I knew it. It was Chris\u2019 voice. No. that wasn\u2019t it. There was something more. A long forgotten memory. Brown eyes intruded upon my mind. A voice singing a song. People cheering to that song. The words began to pop into my head as those brown eyes haunted me. <i>A thousand words, I have never spoken. A thousand thoughts, I want to share with you</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA name popped into my mind to go along with the eyes and the words. Renna. That one word began a cascade of memories that threatened to overwhelm me. I looked at the monster in front of me again as if coming out of a dream. No. Not a monster, a Jarlepian. An alien species from a planet called Jrlp. And this was one that I knew very well. It was one that I loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cC-Chris\u2026Cri\u2019sa?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tHe dipped his head in a nod before lifting one of his tentacles and laying it against the right side of my face. It had been a long time since I had felt this touch. I let my eyes close slightly as my throat tightened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s me. And you\u2019re finally back. Now we need to leave before this world restarts. We can explain things later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cB-but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLater.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis arm dropped as uncle Chris stepped out of the shadows between the buildings as well. I took a small step back in fright. Was he going to kill me now? I didn\u2019t want that. I hadn\u2019t told him I was sorry. I had done such horrible things to his daughter Renna. Uncle Chris played with something in his hand and a giant rip opened in the fabric of the world right next to them. Cri\u2019sa held out his hand to me again clacking his beak in the Jarlepian version of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome with me Anna. Let me take you out of here. Let\u2019s really live our lives this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI hesitated. Not because I didn\u2019t want to or didn\u2019t believe him, but because I didn\u2019t know what I was going to say to Renna or my mother or all the people I had hurt. Finally I reached out and took the offered tentacle. I might not know what I was going to say but I would be with Cri\u2019sa again. That was all that mattered right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>\u201cSo now you know the truth. Our story comes to an end. Well at least Chelsea, or should I say Anna\u2019s story in this Anime Reality finally comes to a close after almost sixty cycles. Her and Cri\u2019sa were interesting characters to watch while it lasted for every one of those cycles. Always something new with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh I knew this is how it would all end. I tried to stop you from seeing this though. Not because I didn\u2019t want you to know, but because I didn\u2019t want our time together to end. Our world is going to reset soon and go back to the way it is supposed to play out. Just like it does every twenty four episodes. But I really was bored and lonely. I always am. I\u2019m the only one who ever remembers any of the things that go on. I lost track of how long it has been. Forty, fifty thousand times or more? How many years is that outside of this reality in the real world? The world where we are just figments of someone\u2019s imagination.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWill you come with me back to the beginning? Not like you normally do where you forget all about our world. But with your memories intact. Will you spend a little more time with me as we replay these lives over again? Perhaps this time you can follow someone else and learn more about these people and their story. See just how everything is interconnected. I\u2019d like that. I\u2019d like that a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe choice is yours.\u201d</b></i></span></div></div>",

Just this small bit of my divinity sucks off a lot of life energy from a mere mortal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can find solace in the fact that once you die, I will lose some of my power as well. This disembodied voice of mine and the bit of power I gave you to see into the minds of men will disappear into nothing, never to return to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you happy now!

        "created":1385839980,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">I am god. I am not a god, or a false god, but the God. There are other gods in the world but none are as powerful as I am. That is because I created all the other gods in my boredom. I bestowed upon them a fragment of my power to play with as they would. Some became benign benefactors, others evil tyrants. I created a world for these my children to play with. To test their powers and eventually fight each other in their own boredom.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nBut such distractions can only entertain so long. One of my sons came to me with an idea. A diversion for all of our boredom. A world, populated with creatures without godhood. But with the potential for great things. Even the potential to become demi-gods themselves. They would be given free will, to chose the course of their own destiny. We gods would all simply observe these creatures that would be dubbed mortals.<br>\r\n \t<br>\r\nIt was left up to me to create these things. For I was the only one with the power to create. I did not give this ability to any of my sons and daughters. For I knew what use they might put it to. And so I created the world in a manner that was pleasing to me. I populated it with creatures that walked on two and four legs. My children were given the honor of naming all these animals and plants, though one creature in particular I named myself. Human.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nTime passed as it always does, even for a god. These humans which I had created provided us with no end of amusement. Sometimes we would reveal ourselves to them and be worshiped for a time. Sometimes we nudged them into actions and situations they would not otherwise be in simply because we desired to do so. We watched as they evolved and became more of an individual with each passing era. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMy sons and daughters became attached to this world I had created. Drawing power from aspects of it and changing their form to that of beasts. Legends sprang up about them, the nine tailed fox spirit. The vampire, werewolf,  angels and demons. Creatures of good and bad that continued to pop up throughout what humans called history. And still I simply sat and observed from on high as was my way.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAs is with anything, my immortal children grew bored and decided the indirect interference was not enough. The agreement that they would not get directly involved with this world was broken. First one and then another began to walk among the humans, mating with them and greatly altering the course of their lives more then the little nudges of the past. Blackening the hearts of these mortals a deeper shade then they had already been. Tainting them forever with malice.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMore time passed and the immortal blood of my children coursed in the veins of humans, granting them special powers and abilities. A great war eventually broke out as my children became divided, using these mortals as pawn in their clashing. I saw that the world would be destroyed and the humans I had created would be wiped out and so I acted. I entered the fray and defeated every one of my children. For the first time since I had created them eons upon eons ago, I had raised my hand against them.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMany I stripped of their power of immortality, others I reabsorbed for their deeds. Only a few did I spare. Those who begged and pleaded for their lives and those who had not taken part in the war of their brothers. The humans I left to their own devices as it was meant to be. The blood of the gods still coursing in their veins. Years diluted these skills that had created great heroes. And we gods were mostly forgotten . Becoming little more than a memory.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nBut now I am bored again. Eternity is not an easy thing. Not when you can look upon the world and the animals you created and know what every one of them is thinking. See what is happening everywhere in the world with but a thought. Those of my children that survived my wrath are bound not to interfere with this world. Bound by my power. I could destroy it with but a thought, but I will not. They are all alive. They should not die simply because they no longer entertain.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAnd yet though I cannot see far into the future, no matter how all powerful humans think me, I can still see the state of the world today. The thought of whether humans deserve to live keeps worming its way into my mind. The malice and evil my children tainted their hearts with so long ago has grown infinitely worse. But should they be destroyed for what was done to them by my children? If that is so then am I not ultimately to blame for it all? For creating my children and giving them power. For creating this world and populating it? For simply observing for as long as I did?<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThis I have no answer to. As all powerful and all knowing as I am, still I do not know. That is why I have brought you here. You will observe with me. I will bestow upon you a portion of my powers. That is, the ability to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts and see multiple places at once. You are mortal. You are already biased in your decision true, but as I said, I am bored. Perhaps if you see and hear what I hear you shall change your mind. And perhaps sitting up here on high for so long has biased me as well. So I will take over your body while you  sit up here in my place and live the life of a human. I shall see the world first hand.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nBut that would not be very entertaining would it? So I will temporarily block the knowledge of what you look like from your mind. I will create a mystery for you to solve. Will you be able to find me I wonder? While listening to the billions of mind will you be able to point me out? A little game of cat and mouse. I shall be the mouse and you the cat. If you can figure out who I am before the time is up I shall grant you a wish. Any wish at all. Immortality, money, power. Name it and it is yours. But fail and I shall kill you.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nI\u2019m just joking! Don\u2019t act so shocked. I am not that kind of god. First and foremost I simply observe. But in a game like this there must be a consequence for losing. Is that not how such things are handled? The sense of urgency and the urge to win is not there if there is not a negative action to balance the reward. So what shall it be? Ah I know! I shall wipe your memories at the end of every day when you get your body back. Your friends will become strangers to you every morning. That would be quite amusing to watch for a while.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nNow that the rules are set and the stakes stated, let us commence with our little game shall we? <br>\r\n******************************<br>\r\n\tOh and one last thing before I go. I shall leave a portion of my essence here to continue to narrate this little story for you. To enlighten you on things you don\u2019t understand and try to help you keep all the voices and places straight so your mortal mind does not explode. But I won\u2019t give away who I am. Too bad for you. You\u2019ve got to solve this mystery the old fashioned way. Ok this time for real we shall start this adventure.</td>",
