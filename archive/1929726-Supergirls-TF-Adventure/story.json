There was something odd about the sound, as if was louder.  <i>Must be my imagination</i>, she thought as she blindly raised her left hand to turn off the alarm clock as she had done many times before.  <i>That\u2019s strange</i>, she thought as her hand struggled to find the alarm clock.  <i>I can\u2019t even feel the table</i>.  More annoyed than concerned, she opened her eyes, and instead of seeing the ceiling of her apartment she saw a white sheet that completely enclosed her.  She also discovered her brown wig wasn't on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Linda slowly got up, and looked around her.  There was light on one side of her.  She slowly walked towards it.  A very disturbing suspicion came to her.  She reached the end of the covers, looked around and her heart raced as her fears were confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was standing on her bed.  It was larger to her than a basketball court.  She looked back and recognized the nightgown that she went to bed wearing and just crawled out of.  In front of her was the pillow and her brown wig.  Both objects could now cover her body with room to spare.  Her ears were bombarded by the nearly deafening sound of the alarm clock that was still buzzing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere were two possibilities:  she was still asleep and dreaming, or she had somehow shrunk.  Her eyes searched the now gigantic bedroom.  It was to her both familiar and alien at the same time.  Using the bed headboard as a point of reference, she estimated that she was 3 inches high at the most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was then that she realized that she was naked.  She was a little embarrassed at her current state, but not too concerned.  She was the Girl of Steel, after all.  She tries to fly to the alarm clock to turn it off. <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

This time, instead of soaring into the air, she stayed on the mattress.  She tried again to break Earth's gravity, but again was unsuccessful.  Frustrated, she bended her knees and jumped.  She moved upwards a couple of feet (from her perspective), but then fell to the ground, landing on her rear end.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked up a the ceiling.  Her concentration was impeded by the alarm clock which was still buzzing.  The sound, annoying to her in normal circumstances, was now as loud as thunder to her.  She gazed at it, intending to destroy it with her heat vision.  The expected beams of heat from her blue eyes failed to materialize.  The sound continued in mockery.  <br>\r\n\t  <br>\r\n\tConcern was starting to turn to near panic.  Linda went over to the giant pillow and tried to lift it.  Despite putting her entire strength against it, the pillow wouldn't budge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was then that Linda realized she was in far bigger trouble (no pun intended) than she originally thought.  She had been shrunk before, and there were times she was smaller than the 3 inches she was now.  In those times, she still had her super abilities.  It's different this time.  Not only is she now the size of a mouse, she was just as weak and vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFor the first time in a long time, Linda was truly frightened.   <i>What do I do now</i>?</span></div></div>",

Jess asks her as her boss sets up equipment to examine the blue gem like object found in the most recent of Lex's secret cashes. The artifact had been sealed in a lead lined box and only when inventory was being compiled did it get discovered. Once she heard Lena had it sent to L Corp and more importantly her office ASAP, as well as anything she'd need to properly examine and test the mineral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes Jess it's fine, there is a tiny amount of radiation leakage but it's less than a suntan so it'll be completely harmless' the scientist and CEO explained, hoping to calm her long suffering assistant, especially with all the recent activity that kept happening around here, she almost saw Supergirl more than her own assistant if that were possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes Miss Luthor, just remember that if you miss lunch that reporter will make her frowny face and pout, seriously that pout should be outlawed' despite her complaint the smirk she as wearing made Lena happy her assistant was no longer at odds with her friend, that had been a big problem<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill that wasn't the issue at the moment, now was her newest problem from Lex, this one was actually quite beautiful for a change, sapphire blue and cut almost like a gemstone Lena almost didn't want to damage the thing, so she did the less evasive tests first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe material may not be a real sapphire but it was of a high enough quality to be considered a gem, the material was also highly conductive, which gave Lena some ideas if they ever managed to find more of this stuff in some of Lex's other vaults/ hideaways,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she said to Jess the radiation was extremely low level and on a very low wavelength, it couldn't do damage to any human being, but given her brother was the previous owner there was a chance another species could be harmed by it, after all the Kryptonian's could be harmed by a green rock, why couldn't something else be harmed by a blue gem (Also green lanterns are harmed by yellow so DC is weird when it comes to colours). The radiation signature didn't match anything on record but she did manage to find a few signs the gem had been synthesized which was good news and bad news: On the one hand it being artificial meant she had no way of knowing what the thing could do or if Lex had altered it's properties, but on the other if she could determine it to be harmless she could make enough to test all those ideas she had forming in the back of her head, without breaking this sample/ gem cut piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scans she had taken at least proved it to be a solid structure with no little surprises hidden inside in case of it falling into those her brother and mother would deem the wrong hands (like her own or the DEO's most likely) which was good seeing as one such surprise blew up one of her researchers a couple months back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door snapped her out of her musings and she realized Kara had arrived with lunch, she should probably save Jess from the pout, but first to place the gem back into it's box, Kara may be a good person but she was still a reporter and she can't really say to the blond something is <i><u>'off the record'</u></i> if it's sitting the right in front of her. Ensuring the seal was on tight Lena finally opened the door and Kara scrambled in with bags of food, Jess glaring at her with a face that screamed <i>'You owe me SOOOO much' </i>and it was true, Lena realized she really needed to give that girl a raise, not just for this but for everything else too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow Kara could eat so much and still look the way she did baffled Lena, she didn't even eat half as much as the blond and she has had to add half an hour to her exercise routine since becoming her friend. Curse you Kara with your pouts and ability to find delicious cakes and other sweet treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversation flowed easily between them, some days actually reminding her of days before Lex turned out to be a psychopath, when it was just the 2 of them against the world, wanting to make everything better. Sighing at broken dreams she casts a gaze on her latest bit of recovered strangeness from the man, a gesture which did not go unnoticed by miss Danvers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey Lena what you got there?' she asks, Lena not knowing she had tried to peak into the box, but the lead prevented her from knowing anything but the dimensions of the box itself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You promise not to say anything back at CatCo? Lena asks, knowing Kara would never do such a thing but she was a paranoid woman who people were actually trying to kill, letting her have this piece of mind was the least Kara could do, and the young Kryptonian knew it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not until you either go public or mention it in one of our interview' she replies almost instantly making Lena smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay then' she grins and hops up to her desk 'I don't fully know the full capabilities of this thing myself yet but the possibilities are endless once the tests are completed and we can synthesize more of it' she explains with an near visible passion, she really wanted to turn something Luthor made into a force for good and this was one of many chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What she didn't know was that while Kara had been following her just as eagerly, no doubt feeding off Lena's enthusiasm, the moment the lid was removed she felt a stabbing pain in her brain and acute loss of her usually perfect balance. '<i>Shit</i>' Kara swears internally <b><i>'Kryptonite!' </i></b>she wonders how Lena could be unaware of how dangerous messing with that mineral was, and also what could happen to her if the DEO found out, but when she saw the blue glow coming from the box she understood: Green was the only really widely known color of Kryptonite, which makes sense given it was always green Lex used against Kal-El, the others being too unpredictable as far as Kara knew to be used effectively as a weapon, Lena simply didn't know Kryptonite came in a literal rainbow set, and it was coming back to bite Kara in the ass, hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond known as Supergirl panicked when the world started to both recede from her and shoot up above her, it turned out blue was capable of size manipulation, which was news to her (just because she knew there were many different colors of Kryptonite doesn't mean Kara knew what they all did) so she was forced to just stand a little behind Lena as she dwindled away to 4 inches tall, at which point the disorientation seemed to dissipate, it seemed her smaller body had reached the edge of the limited range of Blue Kryptonite, or at least of a piece that size. Staring up her friend was practically a goddess now, this was not going to be a fun day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The question was, did Lena see any of that? Did she see the effect blue Kryptonite had on Kara?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 1. She had been turned away at the time, so when she turns back to ask Kara that she thought the woman was '<i>gone</i>' or at least that was how it looked (Kara has to try get her attention somehow)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 2. She turned to ask her thought just as Kara began to shrink, the Kryptonian too disorientated to notice Lena watching her disappear, only when she reached a couple inches tall did Lena snap out of her daze/shock long enough to close the lid and stop the Kryptonite effecting her, because she realized what her brother had made, as well as what it does to certain aliens. (Lena has some more fun work to be done now ;D)</span></div></div>",

Kara soon began to slowly black out, as the monster came towards them, but before she could she saw someone enter the battle, a woman, who appeared to use heat vision to blast straight through the beasts chest, killing it.
