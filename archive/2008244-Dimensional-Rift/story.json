The knowledge that he now had this power and nobody gave it a second thought made him feel giddy like he was a kid pulling pranks just for the negative attention they produced. Sure he could have taken Sakura's body for himself and if this was back when they were just starting out as shinobi he'd have done just that in a heartbeat, but when you could have literally any body you wanted why just settle for your first crush?

Because of this, all the women walk around in skimpy costumes as if they are wearing everyday clothes while their everyday clothes are considered skimpy. In extreme cases, shy women would wear only a g-string while women with no sense of decency would wear dresses that completely obscures their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a side effect, women in this universe cannot physically age past their physical peak. Their minds can still age and they can still be afflicted by diseases associated with age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Men and women have swapped reproductive systems and all associated things. For example, Hinata would be flat-chested, wear boxers as her underwear and have a penis and testicles while Naruto would have breasts, a vagina, ovaries and a womb so he could get pregnant while having a bra and panties as underwear.</span></div></div>",

What would you do if you ended up hurting your own daughter while you were her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsshin seemed to flip himself backwards off Ichigo's bed and land square on his feet, standing before Ichigo in one of his sisters' bodies which, for once, made him actually seem just a tad bit intimidating. That was actually a sad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax already will ya. Karen's a tough girl to begin with, what with her soccer and everything. I traded her our durabilities when we swapped. You know your old man can take a hit and keep going for days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grown man turned young child sounded proud about such a contradictory aspect of himself. Ichigo however simply couldn't believe the new levels of stupid his father had reached. A few more moments of bickering between Ichigo and his father turned sister passed before the teenager was able to get his father out of his room once again. With a sigh he shut his door, placing his back against it. Another moment passed and he began to get changed out of his sleepwear and leaving himself in only his boxers with his small but perky breasts on prominent display for nobody else to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, a moment's pause in our story to take an understanding of this new world and the current situation. The battle against Aizen for the fate of Karakura town, Soul Society, and everything that the Soul King's power touched. With Ichigo having proven victorious the world was able to recover, save for the one abnormality that somehow triggered. The laws of reality across the various worlds seemed to have altered, yet nobody seemed to notice a difference. All throughout The World of the Living, Soul Society, and Hueco Mundo the inhabitants had taken on the ability to trade whatever they wanted between each other, from things as simply as clothing and personal belongings to things as improbable as bodies, physical traits and even mental aspects. Some even found they could use this to even trade things like social standings or roles. Since the loss of his Shinigami powers Ichigo was no longer able to travel between the worlds and his Shinigami friends that had been stationed in the World of the Living to assist him had returned to the Soul Society to resume their lives and jobs. As a parting gift Ichigo found Rukia, the girl who had spent most of their time together living in his bedroom closet, trading her body for his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow dressed once again in the male student's uniform of his high school, having been resized to his new body like all of his other clothes once Riku had given it to him, he walked out of his room and downstairs to join the rest of his family for breakfast.</span></div></div>",

However, this time she was able to stand over the stove without standing on a small stool because she had a bigger body than she usually had. Her head remained the same, but her body from the neck below was unusually busty and voluptuous, her new breasts just barely fitting in the middle school uniform she wore. Ichigo thought there was something familiar about the body, but he didn't think about it too hard as he was just interested in getting to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting everything ready to make toast, he heard Yuzu ask, \"Ichigo, please wait. I'm almost done with these omelettes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't have time,\" Ichigo responded. \"I've gotta be at school early today, and you know how much more time it takes with this body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu looked at him and asked, \"Have you ever thought of swapping wardrobes with another girl, Ichigo? It seems like a shame to waste having a body like that and not showing off how cute it can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Ichigo asked, \"I don't know; why don't you swap wardrobes with a woman so you can show off your boobs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu blushed as she instinctively used her arms to cover her chest as she responded, \"Come on, Ichigo! You don't have to bring my breasts up whenever I try to get you a cuter appearance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo sighed as he said, \"I just don't want to be seen as cute. I just want to live my life the way it is. I may have a girl's body, but I'm still a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Yuzu could respond, Isshin burst in, now wearing a middle school boy's uniform over his daughter's body, and said, \"You got breakfast ready, Yuzu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe busty girl smiled as she said, \"Yeah, Daddy! It's all ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Isshin said as he sat down. \"This'll be great before school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to school today?\" Ichigo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah; Karin didn't want to be seen with my body at school, so she forced me to swap occupations and education levels with her,\" Isshin said as he wolfed down the omelette. \"Yuzu, I could eat your cooking all day!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo simply grabbed his toast and said, \"Well, see you all later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ichigo left, Isshin asked, \"Hey, Yuzu, whose body do you have again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She claimed to be a friend of Ichigo's; Rangik...something. Honestly, she just said she wanted me to be pretty, so I swapped bodies with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing the name of whose body Yuzu had now, Ichigo chuckled to himself as he made his way to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around until he caught a glimpse of...</span></div></div>",

It was a good question given that he hadn't seen anyone from the Soul Society since he defeated Aizen and lost his powers. Of course that all just brought about a new series of questions he asked himself such as why she hadn't decided to stop and see him when she had seen Yuzu or even how Rangiku had known Yuzu was his sister to begin with. His thoughts would soon be interrupted however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo! Good morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, the moment Ichigo stepped away from his front door and onto the sidewalk when he heard his name called yet again. Though unlike with his father he seemed to brighten up just a bit, bringing a slight smile to his new face as he saw Orihime Inoue and Tatsuki Arisawa, two of his longest friends, approaching him. The large breasts on Tatsuki's chest bouncing healthily with each step she took, mesmerizing most males she seemed to walk past (even though there weren't many people around his house in general, never mind during this time of day\". Orihime, however, seemed to be a bit lacking in the chest department, her usual bountiful chest seeming to have gotten smaller, almost to what an average high school girl's breasts should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tatsuki, Orihime. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting his bag over his shoulder he put his hand on his hip and took a rather masculine stance while he looked at his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trading breasts with Orihime again Tatsuki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ebony haired girl's face began to glow red from the blush that spread across her cheeks at Ichigo's comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well excuse me for wanting to share the burden of Orihime's boobs with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped back at him. The banter between the two caused Orihime, the silent observer of the situation, to grow a nervous smile before finally stepping in and speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My back was just hurting a bit today so I asked Tatsuki to take them off my hands for a bit. Just to get a break is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explained to Ichigo, covering up the fact that it was Tatsuki herself who had asked Orihime to allow her to borrow her bountiful breasts for the time being. Ichigo simply shrugged his thin, girlish shoulders at the explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter much to me. After all, they pretty much became Tatsuki's once you traded them to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\nAnother moment to explain the new world's workings. Since the ability to swap traits and aspects between people spread across the worlds any actual sense of order and rules about the ability were lacking in the world and it had become generally agreed that once something had been exchanged between two people (not always, as swaps between three or more people tended to happen though just not as frequently) the new recipient basically took over any and all ownership of the newly obtained traits and aspects until it was decided that they would trade them back. Often times it would be heard of that people would trade certain aspects of themselves with others only for their partner to go off and trade away the new aspects for something totally different from someone else.<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, what brings you two this way? Don't we usually meet up closer to the school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you've got that new body of yours Tatsuki and me have been a bit worried about you and your safety. So we decided that from now on we'd just walk with you to school from the start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas the orange haired girl's answer, giving Ichigo a genuine smile of someone who truly cared for his well being. Of course to the once busty idol of Karakura High things like Ichigo's body didn't matter so much as his personality and as such would always look out for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate it girls. I guess I don't mind for today but I don't think it needs to be a regular thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's response was interrupted by the front door of his house slamming open and his father coming bolting out of the doorway, still in Karin's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you kids after school! Ichigo, Yuzu, Karin, daddy loves you all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkward scene of Ichigo's father running off to middle school in his sister's body and uniform took a moment to process, even in this strange world of swapping it had managed to catch not only Ichigo but Orihime and Tatsuki by surprise. Walking out of the house next came the impressively busty and developed Yuzu shaking her childish head as she muttered about how she was going off to school with her father so she'd be seeing him far more during the day as opposed to just waiting for him to get home. Closing the door behind her she greeted Orihime and Tatsuki respectively before saying her goodbyes to both of them and her older brother, reminding him that he had school still himself before she left. Realizing he had spent too much time talking the former Substitute Shinigami turned around and began walking off in the direction of Karakura High.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for now we need to get going. We're probably running late as it is.\"</span></div></div>",

Passing the time by talking about this and that, normal things that just further reminded Ichigo how much his life had regressed to the way it was before he became a Shinigami. Soon enough they were outside the front gates of the high school and that was when it happened. A pair of feminine hands found their way around Tatsuki's torso, through the gap between her chest and arms, and took full grip of the impressively large breasts bouncing on it. Behind the ebony haired girl stood Chizuru Honsho, her own body pressing up against Tatsuki's back for several seconds before she was thrown over the thinner girl's shoulder with a hip-toss where she landed flat on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've told you about that you perverted moron! And cover that thing up already! Next time I feel you rubbing it against me I'm ripping it off and giving it back to the bastard you took it from the hard way!\" Tatsuki could only glare red faced at her assaulter who laid sprawled out on her back, her skirt having flipped up enough in the front to put her panties on display along with the \"tent\" bulging out the front of them in a rather perverted and unladylike manner. Giggling like a fool Chizuru managed to spring back to her feet in seemingly no time flat before she burst out laughing even further. \"Oh my sweet little Tatsuki~ No matter if they belong to you or to Orihime or anyone else, if it means getting my hands on those beautiful boobs I'd endure even hell itself with a smile.\" Tatsuki could only sigh, as did Ichigo, at the unbelievably perverted woman before them. It was almost impossible for them to grasp how she had ever been allowed to progress to their grade in the first place with her obvious mind set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who'd you even manage to get that off of anyway?\" Tatsuki asked while pointing to Chizuru's skirt which continued to fail at hiding her appendage. \"I made a deal with that idiot Asano for his dick. Now it's mine and I'm never giving it up. There's too many lovely ladies that need to feel my powerful thrusts of love!~\" Instantly Tatsuki found herself regretting asking her question and instead of responding she retaliated by simply walking past Chizuru who was still too busy laughing at her own situation. \"Let's go Ichigo, Orihime. Any more time with this pervert and we'll be late.\" With only Orihime giving Chizuru a polite wave the three of them left her to herself and continued on into the school ground.</span></div></div>",

He was grateful Ms. Ochi let him take a seat closer to the front of class so that he didn't have to look over other students' heads. Looking around, he saw his friend Asano walk into the class with a sullen look on his face. As he sat down, Ichigo figured he was regretting swapping genitals with Chizuru, as Asano placed a hand over his crotch and got a little teary-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then saw a woman around 25 years old walk in and calmly sit next to Asano. She had her black hair in a bun and had glasses resting on her nose. The school uniform covered just enough of her legs to appear decent, but she had to leave the top two buttons of her shirt open to accommodate her rather large breasts. Luckily, though, she was wearing a shirt under the school shirt to prevent her from flashing her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo chuckled and said, \"Swap bodies with your newest girlfriend, Kojima?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled and said, \"What gave it away, Ichigo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the fact that your cleavage is covered up.

He then turned to Yuzu and said, \"Are you okay, Yuzu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye...yeah; I'm fine. Thanks, Big Brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing here, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu gave Ichigo a box wrapped in a blue cloth as Kojima, Orihime and Tatsuki arrived to comfort the girl. \"You forgot to grab your lunch, so I was delivering it to you. I was almost through the gates when that girl sprang up and tried to feel me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Tatsuki angrily said as she rose, causing her large breasts to bounce from how fast she rose. \"She's getting castrated right here, and right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Asano pleaded, running forward. \"I'll make her give my penis back; just don't do anything to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Yuzu said as she got up. \"I'll never make it back to my school now! I'll get in trouble for being late; and Dad'll be so worried about me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry; I'll fix everything,\" Ichigo said as he hurriedly wrote down the necessary swaps on two sheets of paper. He gave one to Asano while handing the other one to Yuzu, then quietly said, \"Get ready to swap; I'll try some fast-talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the new world, swaps are conducted by writing what is desired to be swapped on a piece of paper. The involved parties then have to verbally agree to the swaps written on the paper and shake hands while holding the paper. Immediately the swaps will occur and certain aspects of reality will adjust to make the swaps as seamless as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChizuru stirred awake and said, \"Wha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chizuru,\" Ichigo said, grabbing her attention. \"There are a few swaps we'd like you to make. If you do, you can have even more girls to \"have fun\" with.\" While saying the last part, Ichigo added a seductive tone to his voice, hoping that Chizuru would think with her pervert mind than her rational mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Chizuru got hard and starry-eyed and said, \"Then let's do it! I wanna have me a good eyeful of T and A!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Asano and Yuzu grabbed one of Chizuru's hands and shook them. The changes happened immediately, causing surprised reactions from all three people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! My little buddy's back!!\" Asano shouted as he ran back to the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastard! You tricked me!\" Chizuru said as she stood and confronted Ichigo. Not only did she get her old genitals back, but she was also now wearing the girl's uniform for the middle school on the other side of town, where Yuzu used to go. She quickly grabbed her things and said, \"You're just lucky I have to hurry to get to school on time. If I ever cross paths with you again, Kurosaki, I'll feel you up so much you'll never walk again!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chizuru left, Yuzu stood and admired her new high school uniform. She would've liked to have been able to button up her shirt more so that she didn't expose as much cleavage, but she did love how grown up she felt wearing the new clothes. She bent down and hugged Ichigo tightly as she said, \"Thank you so much, Ichigo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo hugged his larger sister back as he responded, \"You're welcome, Yuzu. What do you say we get to class now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu smiled as she followed her brother and new friends toward her new class.</span></div></div>",

I'd love to see that body of yours in frills and lace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'm not doing that!\" Ichigo said, a little louder than he probably would've liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not giving up, though,\" Ms. Ochi said in a teasing manner. She then addressed the roster and saw a name that confused her. \"Yuzu Kurosaki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here,\" Yuzu said, standing up so the teacher could see her. She blushed lightly when she felt the eyes of most of the males on her large breasts. She was put at ease when Ichigo glared at the class, causing them to back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swapped with Chizuru Honsho, huh? Well, it's nice to get a break from that shameless pervert. Just take your seat for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" Yuzu said as she took her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class went on normally, but during one lecture, Ms. Ochi was disturbed by some silent giggling in the back of the class. She looked and saw a bunch of delinquents looking at a book. Focusing on the one holding the book, she walked over and said, \"Is there something you'd like to share with the rest of the class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked up and said, \"Um...no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this is the fifth time you and your friends have disrupted class in the last two days. Perhaps you'd like to focus a little more on class,\" Ms. Ochi said, pulling out a piece of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy in question smirked and said, \"What, you gonna swap out our privates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Ochi gave him a cryptic smile and said, \"Not at all. I'm simply offering you the chance to be free of homework for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hearing anything else, the boy grabbed the hand with the paper in it and said, \"Okay, Teach, I'll call your bluff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he shook her hand, the boy suddenly found himself standing up wearing a dress shirt, black tie and tan slacks. At the same time, Ms. Ochi was sitting in his former chair, now dressed in a girl's uniform that showed off her figure. \"Now, Mr. Teacher, where were we in the lecture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked confused, but then said, \"Um...well, I think we were talking about literature...specifically...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class went on normally after that, with the boy teaching the class while Ms. Ochi, now simply Misato, taking notes and reading the required texts. The bell rang for lunch, with everyone going to different locations. Yuzu approached Ichigo and asked, \"Um, Ichigo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Yuzu?\" Ichigo asked as he got up, grabbed his lunch and started walking out to his usual spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did Ms. Ochi switch occupations with the boy in the middle of the class? What purpose does it serve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes the teachers do it to make the students who don't pay attention in class do just that by giving them the task of leading the lecture. I've seen it happen quite a few times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The teachers in my middle school didn't do anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, responsibility is greatly valued here, so more extreme measures are taken to make sure it gets valued.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo, Yuzu!\" Orihime shouted as she, Misato and Tatsuki caught up with them. \"Do you think...maybe, um...you could eat with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to, Ms. Orihime!\" Yuzu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Orihime is fine, Yuzu,\" Tatsuki said. \"And you can just call me Tatsuki. We're classmates now; there's no need for all that formality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. How about you, Ichigo?\" Yuzu asked, staring down at her feminine brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo sighed as he pulled out his phone from his shirt pocket. \"Okay, Yuzu; I'll just let the guys know I'm not joining them.\" He then put the phone back and joined his cheerful sister, Orihime and Tatsuki for lunch.</span></div></div>",

While they were changing, Yuzu noticed how Tatsuki complained about the weight of her new breasts, with Orihime offering advice on how to manage them.

All around him the other girls were producing simple navy blue one piece swim suits, the same color as his trunks but offering more coverage of their bodies. Of course, despite having an entirely genetic female body he was still wearing his same old masculine clothing and his swim uniform was no different. No matter what he was determined to keep that final masculine feature about himself, even if his gender still being male didn't seem to matter these days. Just as he did while he had Rukia's body he stripped out of his boxers, peeling them off of his shapely hips before stepping out of them and placing them into his locker with the rest of his now resized uniform. He took a moment to separate his gigantic bust and inspect the rest of the body that went with it, finding the fact that he was now sporting black hair on his head and blonde hair under his clothes. As if he didn't have enough problems with people thinking he died his hair before he got Rukia's body, at least after having gotten that everything matched and the jokes had stopped. Now he just supposed this twist was long over due.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he stepped into his swim trunks, his breasts bouncing wildly as he did so since they remained free of any confines. As a male he wasn't expected to wear anything more than the trunks for class and that fact didn't change just because his body from the neck down did. Soon enough the rest of the girls had gotten changed as well, including Yuzu who was now several times happier for having gotten Ichigo's formerly petite body and the, as far as she was concerned, cute swimsuit that was encasing it. Ichigo then simply closed his locker and made his way after them toward's the school's swimming area. Having dealt with his almost non-existent breasts with Rukia's body this whole time, the sensation of what were once Rangiku's gigantic chest melons going whatever way they wanted was a new experience for him. One that he kept reminding himself that he was only dealing with to be a good older brother and help his little sister out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way to the pool he was glad nobody was really caring about his exposed chest cannons. It was times like this that being able to keep his gender despite having an overly obvious female body was a blessing to him.</span></div></div>",

He saw some girls who wore boys' swimming trunks, though most had their breasts exposed like he did while others had male chests exposed. Similarly, he saw some boys wearing a girl's swimsuit, although most had breasts being concealed. However he noticed one boy with breasts, but with a very noticeable bulge in the crotch area of the girl's swimming suit he wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then saw the swimming instructor approach. She was a woman in her mid twenties with large breasts, but her red swimming suit's crotch area also showed off the largest bulge in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, kids, listen up!\" the instructor said. \"We're going to have a free-style relay race. Get in groups of five and we'll start in ten minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked down and noticed Yuzu holding his arm tightly.

Now standing at an impressive six-foot-five her head sat perched on what could only be the body of their friend Chad clad in only a pair of swim trunks. Though the swap between the two seemed to be more extreme than just a simple head swap. While there was nobody else in the school with a body as tall or muscular as Chad's the deeply tanned skin the boy took great pride in was still the same as Misato's skin normally looked, a sight that could only mean they had made it clear in their swap that they would each be retaining their original skins on their post-swap bodies. Continuing with the list of changes it was obvious, though a bit more difficult to tell given her new pectorals, that she still retained her breasts as well. Though like Ichigo and most others in the class they were left on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Misato?! W-what happened to you?!\" Tatsuki stammered at their former teacher's appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just asked Chad to trade a few things for a little bit. I've always been curious about being big and strong like him, I've got to say I really like it.\" Misato smiled at her former student before ending her sentence with a few body builder style flexes. Walking in from the locker rooms came Chad with the reverse side of Misato's swaps with him. No longer his hulking self he walked in with the older and feminine body formerly belonging to Misato. His skin still remained the proud tanned color he was known for. However instead of wearing the boy's swimming trunks like it would be expected of him, just like everyone else who had the \"male\" gender at the moment Ichigo noticed that his friend was now wearing the girl's swimsuit instead pulled tight over a flat and obviously male chest as well as the male genitals bulging out the bottoms of his swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misato. Did you swap genders with Chad too?\" Ichigo asked his former teacher. The brown haired giant gave a nervous chuckle at the question for a moment before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't say \"no\" exactly. I mean, I did include it in the list on the paper. But it was only going to be temporary! I just wanted to see how it felt for a little bit.\" Poking her index fingers together she, no HE, was obviously both sorry and embarrassed by her slyness. \"If she can keep the paper with all our swaps written down safe until after swim class I promise I'll swap right back with her!\" He continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo simply sighed and turned his back on Misato, his new breasts bouncing wildly as he did so. He still couldn't believe how people could just pull these kinds of stunts when it came to swapping with each other. Still his little sister was more important. And Chad, he supposed. She would need some emotional support. With a brush of his black hair behind his ear he turned his head to look over his shoulder, only to find not only Orihime but also Yuzu trying to comfort Chad while Tatsuki continued to lecture Misato about his deviousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let it go for now Tatsuki. With Chad's body and muscles it's obvious we're going to need Misato on our team for now. Plus with the fact that he's over a foot taller than you and that bulked I doubt picking a fight with him is going to be very effective. Now come on, the four of you. We got to get to our lane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word Ichigo turned his attention away from his sister, friends and former teacher and made his way to their group's starting point.</span></div></div>",

To his right, a boy he never really knew well got into position, his breasts mostly concealed by the girl's swimsuit he wore, while being joined by Kojima, whose feminine body filled the girl's swimsuit better than the actual girls did. Finally, Mahana Natsui got into position, not caring about her swinging breasts and boy's swimming trunks she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe,\" the boy chuckled as he stole a look at Ichigo's massive breasts. \"You sure you can swim with those giant boobs?

Swap Magic is a powerful magic, yet anybody can use it. Even the people of Edolas, from what I observed, could perform this magic without tools.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's incredible!\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it shocked me, too.

Certain requirements have to be agreed upon by the two parties involved in the swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it's like a contract between me and my Celestial Spirits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. The contract in this case would involve what would be swapped between the two individuals and for how long. For example, if I was to draw up a contract with you to exchange casual clothes, not only would you have to agree, but we both would also have to settle on a time in which we would keep our exchanged clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I get it! So if you wanted to take my casual clothes, I'd tell you that I'd only be comfortable being without them for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say a week would be perfectly fine for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then what happens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza extended her hand as she said, \"To finalize the contract, we shake hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy reached out and grasped Erza's hand firmly. \"Like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Lucy let go of Erza's hand, she was amazed to see the redhead wearing what she had just put on.

They way she was acting almost made it seem like it was brand new to see swap magic and her asking Erza earlier was kind of strange too. Did she really just forget about it or did she not know about it? She shook her head she shouldn't be doubting her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said, \"Hey Lucy I tried out your whip skills earlier and your athleticism it did work well enough, but it did feel a tad strange with my body and those skills could we switch bodies and voices with each other. My body is a lot smaller then yours, so I tire out quickly. And since you're interested swapping maybe we could do that. Would that be okay with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy thought for a moment Wendy had a point she may have her athletic, whip skills, and magic, but her body may not have the same stamina as she did. And she was interested in trying a few more swaps, so she decided she would go for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled, \"Sure that is fine with me Wendy. Besides I've always kind of wondered what its like being carried by Carla in the air. I mean Happy has carried me before, but it isn't the most comfortable ride. We should also probably switch wardrobes, since my uh...body is a bit more developed then yours.\" She saw Wendy glance down at her chest and frown. Lucy said, \"I'm sorry Wendy its just that well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy shook her head, \"No its fine Lucy I know you didn't mean any harm by it. Let's swap then.\" She held out her hand to Lucy. \"Lucy Heartfillia will you swap bodies,voices, and clothes with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy said, \"I will Wendy Marvell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you swap these traits for the next two days?\" Wendy continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" Lucy agreed and shook the linked hands. After the deed was done there was no flash of light or anything, but Lucy was struck with a bit of vertigo after the swap and put her hand on head by the sudden shock. She saw blue hair fall in front of her face. She looked at where Wendy had been and saw herself there. The only real difference was that Wendy still had her Fairy Tail mark where it used to be. She looked down at herself and saw she was dressed in Wendy's green dress. She definitely felt a lot lighter now due to the swap, but considering Wendy was 13 years that made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy said, \"This is so strange I feel like I've had your body all my life even though I haven't.\" She was amazed she sounded exactly like Wendy. To most eyes she looked exactly like Wendy the only real difference was that she still had the same Fairy Tail mark on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy giggled, \"Yeah I feel the same way. If I remember right you haven't swapped bodies with anyone before have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy shook her head, \"No not really. Have you swapped bodies with someone before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy shook her head, \"No I haven't. Romeo wanted to swap bodies with me before, but I was too embarrassed to agree to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla approached the two as they chatted, \"Indeed this is both your first time having swapped bodies with someone. While with how swap magic works you two shouldn't have any problems I would very much like for you two to practice a bit before we leave for the mission. We have 45 minutes until the train leave, so I advise we make use of that time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Wendy and Lucy nodded and headed to the training yard behind the guild to practice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu in Lisanna's body said, \"Well Lucy if you want to practice lets have a sparring match. Lets see how good of a Dragon Slayer you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisanna in Natsu's body said, \"Yeah Wendy lets see how well you handle that whip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Wendy and Lucy could tell the swapped pair wasn't going to take no for an answer. They took positions across from each other. Carla gave the signal and the match began. Lisanna used her cat take over magic and charged towards Wendy in Lucy's body. Lucy saw Lisanna charging and quickly cast Verneir on both herself and Wendy. Wendy immediately summoned Loke who began with a Regulus Charge attack. She took advantage of the speed boost Lucy had given her and got to Lisanna's side and used her whip to tangle up Lisanna immobilizing her. Loke landed his hit and it pushed Lisanna back quite a bit hitting one of the dummies.<br>\r\nMeanwhile Natsu had jumped into the air and used his Fire Dragon Wing attack to try and hit Lucy who easily dodged thanks to the speed boost. As soon as Natsu landed Lucy jumped into the air and used Sky Dragon Roar and managed to hit Natsu who was pushed back hard into the wall of the guild. Seeing that Natsu was stunned she charged forwards used Sky Dragon Crushing Fang on Natsu knocking him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisanna and Natsu were defeated. Lucy immediately went over and healed them. Thought after healing them she felt drained. Why surely Wendy's body had more magic power then that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy saw this and said, \"You're probably just tired cause your aren't used to my magic and you put a lot more force into those attacks then you needed to. Don't worry though you can just eat some air and you'll be all set.\" Lucy nodded and ate some air. It was strange it was hard to describe the taste. It was kind of sweet probably because there isn't a lot of pollution in Magnolia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu groaned, \"Thanks Lucy, but dang it Lisanna your body can't take a hit from a few Sky Dragon attacks come on. You couldn't even land a hit.\"<br>\r\nLisanna countered, \"Neither could you Natsu. Your body isn't used to my take over magic, so I couldn't do much.\" The two childhood friends continued to bicker with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy turned to Carla who had been watching, \"Do you think that was enough Carla?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla sighed, \"Yes you have cleared my worries. Just be careful Lucy I don't want Wendy's body badly hurt when she gets it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy nodded, \"I will Carla don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla said, \"Very well lets head to the station.\" Lucy and Wendy nodded and head to the station. Once they were on the train Lucy decided to ask, \"So Wendy what kind of mission are we doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy began to answer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The normally happy little girl had returned to her new mother with a frown on her adorable face but nothing else about her seemed out place to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy nobody would agree to swap with me.\" Asuka said with her frown and a pair of slightly puffed out cheeks that made her look cute rather than upset. The blond mage lowered herself to her temporary daughter's height and hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Asuka. I'm sure they all have their reasons.\" She said. But still the young girl frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mommy I wanted to be a big girl like you. I was happy you said I could try swap magic and now I don't have anyone to try it with.\" Asuka replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy thought for a moment about what to do. Surly it wouldn't hurt to loan her own body to what was technically her daughter for a little bit would it? \"Well how long did you want to have a big girl body for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy watched Asuka think about that part for a minute as she clearly didn't before. \"How long do you think I should have one mommy?\" She asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled at her answer. \"I think you should start with an hour to see if you like it and then maybe try again if you still want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mommy I still need someone to swap with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you want to be a big girl like mommy why not just swap with me then?\" Lucy asked with a smile while hoping to make Asuka happy. The young girl's face lit up in a bright smile as it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean it mommy?! I get to swap with you?\" She asked excited as Lucy nodded her head and stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuka do you agree to swap bodies from the neck down with me for the next hour?\" She asked while holding her hand out to her current daughter to start the contract. Asuka reached out and took the hand of who she currently believed to be her mother and agreed happily. Like before with Erza, Wendy and Bisca nothing overly extravagant happened. No flash of blinding light or anything, just a sudden change in perspective as Lucy realized how much shorter she was with Asuka's body. Asuka however was now much taller than Lucy and enjoying every minute of it as she happily hopped up and down with her new body still dressed in her own clothes. This made Lucy notice that she herself was still wearing the clothes she had gotten from Erza earlier today except that they had been resized to fit her current younger body. 'Swap magic really is amazing.\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon however Asuka stopped hopping and starting making small pained ow sounds which caused Lucy to look over at her daughter for the time being. \"What's wrong Asuka?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy your boobs hurt from my jumping.\" She said as she brought her hands to her new chest and cupped her new boobs. From the memories Lucy had gained after swapping families with Bisca she realized the mistake she had made. Asuka wasn't even old enough to start wearing training bras so right now the only thing covering Lucy's old boobs was Asuka's dress that had been resized to fit her older body. Which meant Lucy was still wearing her bra for no reason at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Asuka, I forgot.\" Holding her much smaller hand up towards her now much taller daughter Lucy prepared to use swap magic once more. \"Asuka will you swap my bras with your lack of bras until you swap bodies back with me?\" She asked. It didn't take little Asuka long to realize that had been the problem and that this was her mother's solution. Taking her own hand with a giggle at what she was doing she agreed and Lucy felt the constraining piece of fabric around her childish chest vanish only for it to appear on her own body that her daughter now possessed which automatically lifted the child's new bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more hops and Asuka was easily happy with her situation once more as she dropped to her knees and pulled her mother into a hug that forced Lucy's face between her own breasts. A view she had never expected to see nor a position she ever imagined she'd experience. \"Thank you mommy!~\"</span></div></div>",

He then looked behind him to where Erza was standing, still dressed in Lucy's clothes. \"Think we can handle this on our own, Happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, sir!\" Happy said enthusiastically in Erza's body. Lucy watched in awe as Happy then put a whole fish in his mouth and said, \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Natsu and Happy ran out the door, Erza, in Happy's body, flew by, muttering to herself, \"How could I have lost a gamble against that cat? And I was just getting used to Lucy's clothes, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy and Erza swapping bodies, clothes and magic? That's hilarious!\" Lucy thought to herself with a chuckle. She then turned to Asuka and said, \"We should get going. We don't want to end up wasting all our time watching everyone else, do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I want to wear big girl clothes!\" Asuka cried, grabbing Lucy and dragging her now petite body out the door to the nearest clothing store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy watched as Asuka happily tried on dresses, casual outfits and even a few bikinis. She had to help the girl tie the knots on her bikini, but for the most part, Asuka adjusted well to having Lucy's teenage body. The sight of it made Lucy proud of her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter playing dress up for a while, Lucy paid for the outfits Asuka liked the most and then took her for a walk in the park. This included getting ice cream and sitting in a park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy?\" Asuka asked, having changed back to her normal outfit and sitting down next to Lucy. \"Are you sure you don't mind being my mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I don't, sweetie!\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't you miss going on missions with your friends? I know Miss Bisca goes on missions all the time, leaving me with a new mommy every time. Do...Do you think she hates me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she doesn't!\" Lucy said, standing up. \"Bisca just cares about you and wants to make sure you're safe. I'm sure if no one agreed to swap families with her, she'd just stay with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think that, Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call it a mother's intuition. Trust me, I would do anything right now to make sure you are taken care of and happy. Those feelings are what being a mother's about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka then smiled and said, \"I do feel happy, Mommy! I haven't had this much fun with a Mommy since Miss Bisca took me to a water park in the capital city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucy smiled and wrapped the girl in a hug, the swaps she made with Asuka began to undo themselves. In the end...</span></div></div>",

He ran though, \"Ahh, here you are, I was afraid you weren't coming..\"<br>\r\nHappy said, \"Sorry, Natsu here had some difficulties adjusting, she just swapped this morning, but she's feeling a lot better now.\"<br>\r\nThe director smiled, \"That excellent, now if you would follow me for debriefing,\" he said walking into the prop and preparation room with Natsu and Happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe director sat down on a folding chair, labeled director, \"Now, I have all the actor I need, as before you two accepted the offer we were lacking to young women and no one else wanted to be part of it, so thank you, thank you very much you have no idea how grateful I am for you to even consider accepting the job,\" he said on the verge of tears of happiness. \"Hey it's a job, and it needed doing, and me and Natsu were in the perfect situation,\" Happy said patting his breast as if it was a flat chest. \"Now tell me,\" he said after sorting him self out, \"What magic do you two use?\" Happy quickly replied with, \"I use Aera magic,\" she said spreading her feather wings, \"Perfect, absolutely perfect!\" He said almost screaming, \"What about you?\" the Director said turning to Natsu. Natsu frozen and looked over her body, seeing Mirajane's slender hands and arms, and stomach area to thigh blocked by the protruding mounds of her chest, \"I don't know, I swapped bodies with Mirajane, and I haven't used magic since then.\" Happy tried pointing out what Natsu had over looked, \"Mirajane only swapped bodies, so magic was agreed to have been swapped so you should still have you own, just try using it,\" she suggested. Natsu held out a slightly closed fist, and opened it, and a fire started in her palm. \"See Natsu, you are still the fire dragon slayer,\" Happy said proudly while smiling. <br>\r\n\"Natsu, Fire,\" The director echoed. \"Your salamander, of fairy tail, I must write all this into the play.\" Natsu smiled, with one of Mira's gentle smiles. \"See Natsu this was a great job for us.</span></div></div>",

The director turned around, Natsu, he said pointing to Natsu in Mirajane's body, I trust you can be the princess mage for this performance, and Happy I trust you can be the guardian angel of this story,\" Happy seemed up for it, Natsu hesitated, but looked down, seeing a body that fit the princess role and a personality and skill set to be a powerful mage, and looked to the director and accepted. \"Great, now it all you actor go get changed,\" he said pointing to several dressing rooms, \"While I change the script.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five other actor went to each fo their own dressing room, Natsu and happy had one to share. Inside Happy and Natsu found a wardrobe with two items of clothing, one a white robe which went down to the ankles, but it was without a back, \"I guess this is your angle robe,\" Natsu said handing it over to Happy. But the other worried Natsu a little. She took it out, it was a pink princess dress, in covered all of Natsu's torso and legs, it had slightly puffy shoulders, Natsu frowned at the thought of preforming in it, but she realized, some reason it was alright to wear this, and so Natsu put it on. It took Natsu a while, but eventually got it on, and the 3' hi heels that were hidden by the dress when worn. <br>\r\nShe turned to Happy, who requested help. Natsu walked over, and took hold of the robe, and pulled it down over the female body Happy was borrowing, while pulling it down, Natsu's hand brushed over the breasts which formerly belong to Erza, who she associated it with. Natsu jumped back out of a fear reflex a stumbled back on the heels, apologizing swiftly and in a quaking horrified voice, \"For what Natsu?\" the little tone of Happy's asked, as the robe fell in place.<br>\r\n\"For what just happened,\" Natsu said with the same tone, but slightly calmed down. Happy questioned why he would need apologized for that, Natsu apologized again and Happy just asked them to drop it. Natsu spent a few minutes getting used to the heels, before leaving the room, Natsu still a little shaking but feeling confident. \"Natsu, you shouldn't wear your scarf,\" Natsu looked down, to the scarf he was wearing, and held it in he hand while it was around his neck. The expression Natsu had told Happy everything, Happy smiled, \"We'll talk to the director and see if he will allow you to wear it as part of your costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the director said, holding up the script, \"Finished, now for rehearsal.\" He turned to Natsu, and passed him colours magic, \"Spin your finger on it and think of red.\" Natsu did, and the dress became a fiery red colour. Natsu smiled a little with Mira's mouth, and looked a little happy. \"Hold on a second,\" The director said, taking the scarf in hand, \"This isn't part of the costume, \" and before Natsu could give her explanation, and reasoning, \"It's perfect, I'll incorporate that while you all rehears,\" He said talking of the last couple of pages and giving the rest to the actors.<br>\r\nDid anything happen in rehearsal</span></div></div>",

Without further ado, let the show go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was sat, ready and waiting for the curtains to raise, and they did, as sure as the sun does. The director walked on to the stage, <b>\"Hello and thank you all for coming, I hope you have a wondrous time here at my play, and tonight I will be your narrator. Now the story starts. In a far away land, so distant from Fiore, few know it's name here, and this is where our story takes place, the land of Orifie (Or-Rif-Fie), is this far off kingdom,\"</b> He projected across the stage and audience gesturing to the blurred back drop of the stage, two figure of humans could be seen, <b>\"Here, no one uses magic, not even exchange magic,\"</b> most people in the audience gasped, as the figure doing magic and swaps suddenly stopped, and looked around in confusion,<b> \"Only the royal line, was allowed to use it,\"</b> then a man in a regal uniform walked on, with a women, in an equally regal outfit, the friends of Natsu recognized Mirajanes body thought the burl and dress and cheered, and also did magic, <b>\"However the king did not like that the laws of his Father and his Father's Father that prevented his beloved people from doing magic,\"</b> The king walked up to one of the other people, held his hand, and a fire emerged,<b> \"and looked to abolish that rule, however there were those who preferred the old ways,\"</b> and a shadowy figure crept toward the kind,<b> \"And the king was slayed before he could allow the common folk the right to magic,\"</b> and the shadowy figure planted a knife in the kings back, and as he fell to the floor, the fire diminished, from the commoners hands, everyone fell to their knee and placed their hand on their eyes<b> \"And every one mourned for their king. However from this darkness came one ray of light, which shone on everybody in the kingdom.\"</b> Down came a women with angel like wings, the same people as before recognized the wings of Happy's and Erza's body. <b>\"An angel came from the heavans above, to help the people of Orifie in place of magic. Each night, the princess Natsu would pray in thanks to the angel who helped them, and soon came to be called Happy, for all the happiness she spread.\"</b> Everyone left the stage.<b> \"Enough with the prologue, now into the real story.\"</b> The director then left the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect crew used illusion magic to give the image of a sun rising as Princess Natsu walked with a royal step, but looked upon all the people of castle town, Natsu stopped in front of large pile of fire wood, within a short stone circular wall. As Natsu bent over to the fire wood, and gently exhaled fire to ignite the wood, the director explained <b>\"This is a ritual, each morning, one of the member of the family, will lite the central fire, to signify a new day, their devotion to the people, and that there magic is for the good of the kingdom.\"</b>. A fire blitzed of the small stone wall and darted across the town and kingdom spread fire for many uses such as cooking and wielding among others. The sun light illusion had spread across town to give the image of early morning, to which the angel Happy arrived, and exchanged a pleasant greeting with Princess Natsu.<br>\r\n\"What I fine morning you have started Princess Natsu of Orifie,\" Happy shook hands with Natsu.<br>\r\nNatsu smiled sweetly and returned the compliment, \"All the better wit your presence Angel Happy, but don't let it slip.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not, I wouldn't want to let the people down,\" Happy said gesturing to the crowed, and no one know why, but they took the part and cheered. The effect department altered the light to make the day pass quickly, and slow down to the parts focusing on Happy, showing her role to the people, helping them with whatever they lack the capacity to do themselves, settle arguments, give some the strength to continue, escorting people safety, fending off anything that poses a threat, and much more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe point came where the moon was starting to raise, and the Princess must thank the angel, so Princess Natsu stepped onto the balcony to await the arrival of the angel hero of the kingdom. Several minutes passed and nothing happened. The door behind Natsu opened, and in walked one of the castle butlers, Wonsworth, who spoke, \"Excuse me Princess Natsu, there seems to be a large crowd outside the door, \"Thank you Wonsworth, wait here in case Angel Happy arrives, I have a public to a attend,\" Natsu said rushing by, almost falling over on the hi-heeled shoes of the costume, but Natsu hid it surprisingly well, Natsu arrived momentarily at the large front doors, and opened them, the effects team used illusion magic to make there seem like there was more than just two actors there. \"Princess, where is the angel Happy, she hasn't been seen in hours,\" a worried look covered the face Natsu borrowed from Mirajane,  \"Who last saw her? I need to know!\" Natsu called out, after a few minutes, one person finally confessed, \"A little while ago, as the sunset, I saw her flying here.\" The Natsu mumbled loud enough for them all to hear, \"But she never arrived.\" The moments atmosphere changed, when a smash came from the room she was just in, Natsu hurried back as fast as her legs and shoes could carried her.<br>\r\nThe room was in total disarray, it was torn apart, the bedding in shreds, glass smashed, Wonsworth out cold, to which Natsu called out for help, she then noticed a piece of paper tied to the railing of the balcony, Natsu tread carefully up to it, and took it in hand. \"Don't come for your angel,\" Natsu read out aloud from the hastily written note to the people. \"Who sent it?\" One of the townspeople roared out, \"It's doesn't say,\" Natsu with a quake to her voice. <br>\r\n\"What about the hand writing, surely that will give it away!\" one town person shouted.<br>\r\n\"What about the ink, or even the paper?\" Another suggested quite hopefully.<br>\r\nNatsu with a saddening voice, voice just said, \"I don't know, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\nThe town yelled back, \"You have nothing to apologies for,\" among other attempts to cheer her up. <br>\r\nNatsu cheered up, and got into the moment, and lost the character and got very angry, but she was reminded and returned to character, \"I will do all I can to rescue the angel Happy,\" Natsu said walking back in. <br>\r\nAnother Butler walked in, \"Wonsworth will be fine, and I'm sorry, but I couldn't help but over hear, maybe I could look at this note, and I could tell you something about it,\" Morry suggested holding out his hand, and Natsu passed over the note. One look scared Morry to the bone, \"This writing, it's so familiar but I can't place it, however the ink and paper, by the colour and feel of them, are products of the far south, home of the treacherous and rebellious.\"<br>\r\n\"But I must go, for the good of my people....\" Natsu was interrupted, \"These people aren't to be trusted even with your magic you can't win....\" He too was interrupted, \"And for my dear friend Happy.\" Morry knew there was no stopped her, \"At last allow me to assemble a squad of unit to protect you,\" He pleaded. \"I'm going alone,I'm going to negotiate peacefully,\" Natsu said taker her leave through the gate and left on horse back, to the far south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"It had taken quiet sometime to get to the far south, even on the most prized horse of Orifie.\"</b> Natsu arrived at a bleak, desolate land of the far south, Natsu marched up to the large front doors, and knocked loudly. The only one to respond was a solider that operates the port cullis, \"Why if it isn't my favorite monarch, Princess Natsu, what brings you to our little castle?\" He inquired. \"I have been informed, our guardian angel Happy has been kidnapped and brought here.\" <b>\"The hesitation in the guards voice told Natsu all she needed to know!\"</b> \"No, you've been lied to princess, now would you take your royal leave before the guard are forced to, and you magic won't stop them.\"<br>\r\n<b>\"Princess Natsu acknowledged that this would get them no where, so he needed to get allies to get the information he needed.\"</b> Natsu walked off stage. <b>\"This concludes act one, we will be back after a half hour intermission</b><br>\r\nMakarov sighed, \"At least nothing being destroyed yet.\"</span></div></div>",

Yawning she began to wake up just like any other day, not even phased by the common practice of falling asleep in the middle of a book. Arching her back and stretching her arms up above her head she could feel her chest bouncy with a heavy weight that normally wasn't there. The feeling itself already put her in a good mood. Standing up she made her way to gather her supplies for the baths. A couple of towels, some body wash, shampoo, the basics really. Walking out of her apartment and through Fairy Hills towards the bathing area she hummed to herself, occasionally tucking a stray strand of her blue hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the bath she discarded her clothes and slipped into the hot waters, enjoying the relaxing feeling they had on her curvy shape. Looking down at herself she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love that Lu-chan let me borrow her body again but I'm always so sad when the time runs out on our agreement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that within a few hours it would be Lucy's body once again and the thought saddened her still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wish Lu-chan would let me keep it longer but she's too nice of a friend and I just couldn't do that to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour had passed before Levy finally left the bathing area and returned to her apartment to get dressed. Deciding that she would flaunt it while she had it Levy chose to instead wear one of her dresses for her last day with Lucy's body rather than one of her other outfits. The valley of cleavage the strapless yellow dress showed off made Levy excited as she adjusted the white piece around her neck that kept it from falling down. Sliding on the detached sleeves and a pair of sandals she found herself ready and headed off for the guild.</span></div></div>",

At a relatively brisk pace, she guided Stormfly into a descent onto the sand of the beach with the intention of getting closer to the object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, Stormfly's claws touched the warm grains the sand quickly which allowed Astrid to jump off safely onto the beach. Now metres away from the flashing light, strangely in the shape of a jewel, her instinct persuaded her to walk towards it, as if it's calling for her presence. A small part of her mind was screaming at her, nagging her to step back but those feelings subsided as a new emotion of discovery made her reach out her arm to touch the object. But as fate would have it, the moment her skin connected with the light, she was instantaneously knocked back a few metres, and the flashing light disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, it felt like reality shifted around her, the bright and vast landscape turned a tad more vibrant than usual before everything turned back to normal. Mostly normal anyway. For Astrid, it felt like the sand was slightly less lively, and the temperature was oddly a bit colder as well as the trees being more menacing than she remembered... but there was definitely one change that did not belong with her. She glared at the brown creature in front of her, slowly waking up from its presumed slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I rhink I ate too rany Scooby Snacks!\" the brown creature groaned, \"I guess I imagined that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid blinked several times over what she witnessed.

Her first thought was to relieve herself from the discomfort. To cool down, she jumped into the cold ocean, washing away all the dirt and grime she must've accumulated from the crash. Once she felt more comfortable, she looked around, trying to find where her dragon Stormfly flew off to. It was awfully strange for her to abandon Astrid, making her think that something suspicious was going around. Maybe it was just her imagination but she also swore the beach looked a lot different than the one that she observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid contemplated on what to do next before she was interrupted by a sound of a small boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Astrid!

Immediately, their surroundings changed drastically from a green grassy island to an enormous and circular futuristic room that looked like a secret home base built for some government agency. On the left, right and front sides of the room were various flashing buttons and television screens showing different things from a sword-wielding pre-teen fighting monsters to a bunch of anthropomorphic animals working at a park. There was some control panel on a table near the front, which hosted a large screen directly in front of it. Just behind the screens was a long red bench that looked comfortable to the average person. Astrid, Stormfly, Scooby and Shaggy had their eyes focused on the television screens while Velma and Stan Ford only looked around the room, mentally taking notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few minutes, the man in the suit just allowed them to explore and get themselves immersed, until-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may be wondering why I brought you all here,\" the man interrupted them, greeted everyone with some thick British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am indeed curious,\" Stan Pines was the next to speak, \"Where are we exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sir but that is classified information,\" the suited man replied, \"However, I am allowed to debrief everyone on <i>why</i> we transported are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a start,\" Shaggy mumbled, \"But where are the snacks?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right at the end of the room, on the table,\" the man smiled, pointing towards a table stacked with food, both familiar and peculiar, \"We specifically catered to everyone's tastes, including Stormfly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm seriously confused here,\" Astrid coughed a little, staring at the gizmos and gadgets of various shapes and sizes that were flashing and blinking at her in rapid succession. She sat on one of the chairs situated in the middle of the room, \"How do you even know what I named her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know more than what you even know about yourself, Astrid,\" the man said ominously before changing the subject, \"I have brought you all here because each of you is specialised in a particular skill that can help the various realities from breaking apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Various realities?\" Velma asked, \"You mean like a temporal rift that can break the fabrics of a black hole.

Usually, this is relative safe as the changes from their original and altered world is minuscule to reasonable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm following.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Velma, I have yet to explain the potential problems,\" The man's expression changed into a frown, obviously concerned, but still his tone remained calm and professional, \"However, there are rare instances where they get sidetracked. This includes mental breakdowns, psychotic episodes, hurting bystanders, losing their character, the like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes,\" Shaggy commented, even though he was more concerned about the temperature of the hot dish he was just eating from the food table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your jobs are to observe and use the mechanisms and devices on the control panels to make sure that they don't break the status quo. Just in case it happens. Do you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man received a couple of nods as a response. Satisfied with this, the man took out a remote control from out of his pocket and handed it to the old man with glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stanford Pines, I know how hard it must've been for the last thirty years, but I can tell that you are the most responsible and the most experienced out of everyone. I'm handing you this device which will allow everyone to watch whatever reality they choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suited man smiled at everyone and addressed his final words, \"For now, just enjoy the show. Grab some popcorn and a cola, relax and sit back. You're not going anywhere else for a while so just watch. Also, just be wary of anything suspicious going on in these realities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could answer back or ask any more questions, he snapped his fingers and disappeared without a trace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan looked at the remote and pressed the On button, like any other regular television remote and started watching...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Guess what?

Only a handful of people in each reality remember life like it was; everyone else treats the new reality as the way things have always been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat reality distortions have happened? Well, it could be any number of possibilities. The \"Naruto\" universe might have become one where women don't believe in wearing anything but sexy/revealing clothes; the \"Bleach\" universe might have every character being students in high school; the \"One Piece\" universe might now have body swapping as a regular occurrence. The possibilities are endless!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: No killing off of characters<br>\r\n2: No breaking off into different stories<br>\r\n3: No introduction of parallel universes!! Keep each alternate reality self-contained.</td>",
