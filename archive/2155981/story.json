            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hello, I'm Taprix, a dimension hopper and keeper of balance. Unfortunately, that balance has been greatly shifted. Not too long ago a witch by the name Selena Herin preformed a devastating ritual. By offering 100 souls she was given the power to alter the reality of her world to how she saw fit, the results were catastrophic. She begun by making herself the ruler of her world, next she prevented the chance of a revolt by making men infantile and meek, changing the social norm so that men remain in diapers for life. To ensure that no women could ever overthrow her she eliminated a large majority of the female populous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lust for power didn't stop there, I tried to stop her but my presents only seemed to light an even brighter fire in her, she was no longer contempt with being ruler of her world, she wants to rule the multiverse, she wishes every world in every dimension to suffer the same fate, she wishes to become the god of all worlds and prove her strength as the most powerful witch to ever live. In order to complete this though she must collect the souls of 1000 humans to offer as sacrifice, if she succeeds, no world will be safe from her wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as such, I am calling upon you, my chosen one. I will give you the power to inhabit anyone living in that world, you will become that person, adopting their memories, values, goals and personality. If you use this gift wisely you can stop Selena before she reaches her goal. But be careful, this is a one way trip, once you have chosen your host there is no changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, who will you be? I trust you will make the right choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena Herin: The witch who altered reality. She is a single mother to a son and ruler of the world. She is a sick and twisted woman who's only desire is to conquer all. She has immense magic power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse Herin: Selena's 12-year-old son. Jesse grew up lonely as his mother never showed him any love. This has led him to feeling insignificant and desperate to have friends. He inherited mild magic from his mother but still doesn't quite grasp how to control it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis Jewell: A superhero and arch enemy of Selena in the previous world, although he ultimately failed Selena wanted to make sure he wouldn't be a threat. She wasn't able to take away his powers but instead made him very submissive and a cry baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristine Marley: An aspirating artist who isn't overly pleased with how the world works. She lives a pretty decent life, she has her own apartment which doubles as an art studio, with a mum, dad and younger brother that she visits regularly. She uses a lot of her art to inspire people to live how they want and not follow the 'laws' but down by Selena. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So there you were, called upon by public figures to stand in and stop Selena's oppressive control over the planet and so assuming this would be another effortless task you flew to her luxurious palace where she lounged on her elegant throne. As soon as you flew through the doors you were instantly flung to the floor by Selena and soon enough you found yourself falling through a hole in the floor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt swiftly closed back up as you fell down into what looked like an adult sized highchair! As you landed in the infantile object you were quickly locked in! Looking around you noticed you were in a large glass box surrounded by large cameras that were live-streaming your capture! suddenly a voice came on the loud speakers!<br>\r\n\"Hello there! My little guy, now be good boy and smile for the cameras as I show the rest of all the men that will try to tear me down what will be in store for them!\" Selena tormented as a tv in front of you showed images of various toddler toys and a pair of headphones where strapped around your head, soon enough you had drifted off to sleep. When you finally awoke you found that you had almost no memory of your previous life, all that you knew now was that you were being held prisoner as Selena's baby boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so as you look back on the last memories you have of being Francis Jewell the savior of the world, you realized that your diaper was soaked! So like usual you spat out your pacifier and bawled your eyes out until...      </span></div></div>",
