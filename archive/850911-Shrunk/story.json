She finally stopped moving and realized that her mom was opening the washer door.  She tried one more time to stop her mom from putting her in the wash.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mom!!!!\" she screamed at the top of her high pitched voice, \"i'm shrunk inside the sheets, help!!!\"  Her mom could still not hear her however and it wasn't looking good for Jenna.  She was about to say her final prayers when she saw a small gap between two separate sheets.  There was a chance she could escape, but she didn't know how.  The only quick she could think of was to use her gymnastics skills to tumble and leap out of the sheets.  So she took a running start and tucked her bare legs and feet in and rolled out of the sheets just as her mom picked them up and threw them into the washer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna breathed a sigh of relief as she narrowly escaped death.  She then got to her barefeet and looked around.  She was in the laundry room standing on the tile floor that her mother recently mopped.

There was a small, plastic hamster wheel in the corner, and a... hamster toilet in the other...<br>\r\nIn the front left corner there was a plastic hide box, somewhat shaped like a log cabin. Looking in, it was filled with cotton fluff or something.<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour of looking around, Jenna gave up. <i>Maybe</i> she could convince Sarah to let her go later, but there was no way she'd be able to escape this cage on her own. This small, child friendly, discount store, pet cage...<br>\r\nJenna went up to the cotton fluff, and decided to sit down. Eventually, she started to doze off a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least an hour later, Jenna was loudly awakened by the sound of the door slamming shut.<br>\r\nMaking her way out of the box, she was too late, and Sarah started tapping the wires of the cage.<br>\r\n\"SQUEAKY! COME OUT COME OUT WHEREVER YOU ARE!\" Sarah spoke, before she started laughing at Jenna, groggily covering her ears, just outside the tiny house.<br>\r\n\"Squeaky?!\" Jenna asked. <br>\r\n\"YOUR NAME IS SQUEAKY NOW!\" her little sister said. \"PETS SHOULD HAVE PET NAMES!\"<br>\r\n\"But -\"<br>\r\n\"OH! I'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU!\" Sarah remembered, and raised... an almost empty hamburger box.<br>\r\nOpening the latch, she took out \"Jenna's\" food bowl, and when it returned, Jenna saw it was filled with the remains of a hamburger and some french fries, bitten in (supposedly) little chunks. She was feeding Jenna. Her own baby sister was feeding Jenna food scraps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah leaned closer, looking at Jenna like she was a little pet. \"SQUEAKY NOT HUNGRY?\" Jenna shook no. \"THEN LET'S PLAY!\"<br>\r\n\"Wha- What are we gonna play?\" Jenna gulped, hoping to play along until she could convince Sarah to show her to their mother, or at least sneak away when her \"little\" sister wasn't looking. \"Dolls? Hide-and-go-seek? A board game?\"<br>\r\nHer little sister's face lit up, probably happy about Jenna playing along, and she pointed past Jenna. Pointing to the hamster wheel behind her.<br>\r\n\"Wha- NO! I'm not a hamster!\" Jenna yelled. \"I'm not gonna run in some stupid wheel!\"<br>\r\nSarah frowned, and her hand moved into the cage. Rather than move her out, though, she moved her into the wheel.<br>\r\n\"SQUEAKY, PLAY.\" her sister commanded. \"GO!\"  ... at least she didn't sound too angry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jenna decided sh didn't have much of a choice; she didn't want to make an enemy of her giant baby sister.<br>\r\nShe started running, in  the corner of her eyes she could see Sarah look less angry.<br>\r\nAfter running for about a minute, the wheel suddenly went really fast, Jenna falling over, and getting carried around. Sarah had given the wheel a little push, and was clearly laughing at her \"big\" sister spinning around. Eventually, the wheel stopped abruptly, a giant thumb pressing down on the wheel.<br>\r\n\"THAT WAS FUNNY!\" she had still not completely stopped laughing. \"NOW WERE-\"<br>\r\nThe door flew open, and their mother, walked into the room. \"SARAH, HAVE YOU SEEN JENNA?\"<br>\r\n\"YES, MOMMY!\" Sarah said. Her hand left the cage, and she turned to face her mother, though not before closing the latch. \"SHE'S RIGHT HERE! SHE'S MY PET NOW!\" she turned a little aside to show off Jenna in the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her mother, rolling her eyes, started walking closer towards the cage, Jenna ran up to the edge of the cage and started waving: this could be her way out of here!<br>\r\nMaria looked down, and gasped. Jenna really was there; the size of a hamster and dressed in only her underwear, but definitely there.<br>\r\nShe bent over to get a closer look. Regaining herself, her mother started talking.  But not to Jenna.<br>\r\n\"SARAH? \" her mother turned away from the cage and faced her youngest daughter.<br>\r\n\"YES, MOMMY?\" she seemed actually surprised. After all, she'd already told her about Jenna before.<br>\r\n\"WHY IS YOUR SISTER TINY?\" her mother put her hand on her hips, a display of authority that gave Jenna some hope.<br>\r\n\"DUNNO. I FOUND HER LIKE THAT.\" Sarah answered, puzzled, but, unfortunately, not concerned.<br>\r\n\"I woke up li-\" Jenna wanted to add to the conversation, but  Sarah started tapping the cage again to shut her up. \"SHUSH, SQUEAKY!\" <br>\r\n\"DON'T DO THAT, DEAR, THAT'S MEAN.\" her mother said \"WHY IS SHE IN A CAGE?\" Jenna wasn't sure, looking at the back of her mother's head from below and all, but she thought she could see her raise an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"BECAUSE SHE'S TINY AND CUTE AND MY PET NOW! I'VE NAMED HER SQUEAKY!\" Sarah perked up, obviously finding this all very amusing.<br>\r\nA short pause followed. Their mother looked puzzled; this wasn't and everyday problem, after all. She even leaned closer to the cage to get a better look at Jenna.<br>\r\nFinally, she turned back to Sarah.</span></div></div>",

All Jenna could do was watch as that little hand that was now big enough to hold her with ease clutched at the toilet handle and pulled it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for nothing to happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara toggled the handle over and over with a confused frown, not understanding.

But she still had to get out of the toilet, she still needed Sara\u2019s help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSara!\u201d Jenna called out to her younger sister. \u201cSara, the toilet\u2019s broken, you can\u2019t flush it. Just get me out of here and take me to mom, please!\u201d she was really getting desperate now. This had been too close, clearly she couldn\u2019t trust Sara with her safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara continued to mess with the handle for a bit more before she huffed in defeat, sticking her lower lip out rather cutely. Finally, she looked back down at Jenna, still frowning. \u201c Guess I\u2019ll just have to leave it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna\u2019s panic started rising again. \u201cSARA! Please, get me OUT!\u201d she started splashing more erratically, her arms getting tiered; she\u2019d never been much of an athlete. \u201cSARA!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara looked in at her little big sister. She thought it was funny watching her flail around like that, the fact that she was swimming in Sara\u2019s pee was even funnier. But, at the plea to be helped out, Sara scrunched up her face in disgust. \u201cEw, no, you\u2019re all covered in tinkle. Mom said not to touch that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna couldn\u2019t believe this. Her sister dropped her in here and now refuses to get her out because it\u2019s gross!

Just get me out of here, I\u2019m begging you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then they both heard their mother calling them for breakfast, telling them that if they don\u2019t hurry they\u2019ll be late for school. Before Jenna could try and reason with Sara again, her sister cut her off. \u201c I gotta go now. bye Jenna!\u201d Jenna screamed as her sister shut the lid on the toilet and walked away, leaving Jenna trapped in smelly darkness.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she had asked Sara at breakfast, she had just said that Jenna was in the toilet. Mary had assumed that her youngest had meant to say that Jenna was going to the bathroom, so she had dismissed it at the time. But now Sara was on her way to school and Jenna was nowhere to be seen. Mary had checked the entire upstairs by this point, and she was starting to think that Jenna had just gone to school without a word. That was pretty unusual for her, but maybe that talk they\u2019d had last night about responsibility and getting better grades had had an effect; or maybe Jenna was mad about getting grounded and was retaliating by avoiding her mother, again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking it off, Mary decided not to worry about it anymore. Being in the bathroom at this time, Mary felt the sudden urge to go.

Between giant bugs and huge people, it was a gamble.  However, this new giants feet almost never stopped moving and even if she got her attention, what then?!?! Only if Samantha were still here.... As Jenna checked her options big things were going on above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoard members... who needed them!  Michelle was getting frustrated as today's call was not going well.  As the call wrapped up, she slammed the phone down.  \"I just wish those bugs would stay out of my way!\" she whispered to herself and stomped her foot. She put back on her stiletto sandals, strapped them up on and headed home for a lonesome relaxing weekend, thinking of her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was starting to get nervous, deciding to hitch a ride with her new giantess friend, she began running towards Michelle's right foot.  The ground rumbled as toes seeming wriggled hungrily in anticipation of their new \"friend\".  In a bit of luck they seemed to settle just as Jenna reached them.  She was surprised that even at her small size, the toes were smooth. Using the ridges as hand holds, she began her climb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, about half way up, disaster struck.  The foot lifted and slammed down sending Jenna flying, she landed on a soft slanted surface that smelled of leather and.... peach lotion?  Beginning to realize where she had landed, she stood and saw a huge pillar attached to a huge object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-no\" she thought \"I'm on her stiletto sandal!\"  The ground lurched as a shadow came over her and 5 monstrous objects rumbled towards her.  She closed her eyes and thought this was the end.  The rumbling stopped and she opened her eyes, breathing a sigh of relief. The pillar was thong of the sandal between Michelle's big and second toe and it had protected her from an impending crushing.  But relief lasted only a minute as Michelle began to walk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's Jenna to do? She travel with this giantess and get some help. Or maybe she was better off hopping off and looking for other options.</span></div></div>",

She had waited until Michelle had settled in what looked to be her car to begin the arduous climb up her big toe nail.  Now with some time to rest she tried her situation..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do?!?\" she thought, \"Even if she finds me, I'm stuck like this!\"  She looked across the basketball court sized big toe nail up the sky scraper sized leg trying to figure out any way to get some help.  Exhausted and the size of a speck, she lay safe (for now), began to sob and drifted off to sleep....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle relaxed on her way home.  The 45 minute drive gave her time to unwind and it being the weekend, she decided a quiet night was exactly what she needed.  She pulled into her driveway and walked into her huge home.  Through the front door she slipped off her heels, threw last nights chinese food in the microwave and went to change.  Michelle slipped off her skirt and blouse and threw on a nightie before retrieving her dinner and a bottle of wine.  She plopped in her huge recliner, throwing her feet up and began to enjoy her dinner while overlooking some paperwork completely unaware of her smaller passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna awoke to a whirlwind.  Safely snug between Michelle's toe flesh and nail, she watched the giantess walk around her house and changer her clothes. Her world spun as she was jarred from her sanctuary as Michelle threw her feet up on the recliner.  Jenna rolled down the foot before  sliding to a stop near Michelle's ankle.  Gathering her senses Jenna followed the vast plane of the leg up towards the mountainous upper body of Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a new sense of hope and energy, Jenna thought, \"This is my chance! Maybe I can climb up near her face and get her attention\".  She ran as fast as she could over the shin, knee and towards Michelle's waist.  The giantess she noticed the giantess reading from a side table while forking a piece of food from the bowl in the giantess other hand every few minutes.  This would be the tough part, going up her body.  In a bit of luck however, the nightie Michelle wore gave Jenna a nice ladder for climbing.  This trip was going surprisingly well as she climbed Michelle's body.  After a few minutes of climbing, she reached Michelle's shoulder.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jenna was left with another decision.  She could climb ups some strands of Michelle's hair and attempt to hop in her ear or she could use Michelle's hair as a swing to climb on her face?  To the ear was safer trip but the giantess may not hear her.  Swinging might get her seen but what if she fell into the bowl of food, she'd be done for!</span></div></div>",

She lay there for a moment, reveling in her accomplishment.  \"That was way too easy\" She thought, \"But I made it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked 75 feet inside the ear (at Jenna's perspective) and screamed \"HELLO!!!

I MEAN JENNA\" the giantess boomed with what sounded like a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The right one\" Jenna replied as her landscape suddenly shifted and she began to fall out the ear.  She screamed as she slammed into a huge soft plain and quick got dizzy as the giantess began to move whatever she was on.  The plain had huge ridges and 5 enormous pillars attached.  \"I'm in her palm, I made it!!\" she thought as she smiled.  The hand stopped in front of the giantess' face, with what little energy she had left, she jumped up and down trying to get the giant's attention.  Two huge eyes scanned the plam as the giantess spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT DOT CAN'T BE YOU CAN IT?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes it's me, please help!\" Jenna responded with some futility, there's no way the giantess could hear her at her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle could barely make out a small dot on her plam.  \"There's just no way that's a person.

It's actually a TINY PERSON!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO WAY!\"  she blurted out \"THERE'S JUST NO WAY\".  She shook her head contemplating if this was real or not, she decided to..... </span></div></div>",

Just two huge blue eyes looking back at her through a magnifying glass.  Jenna was about to give up hope when the giantess spoke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M GOING TO SET YOU ON THE DESK\" Melissa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna felt the hand lower and tip. \"Hey easy!\" She screamed and slid down Melissa's palm, landing with a thud on the desk.

Jenna watched as the giantess leaned in close attempting to hear the small girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you hear me?\" Jenna yelled up towards Michelle's face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING, JENNA, RIGHT?

How did this happen to you? And how did you end up in my ear\"  Michelle whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story, but here it goes\" Jenna replied.  She went through every detail from waking in her bed, to being swept, to the fly &amp; the dump, to Samantha to shrinking again, to her foot ride and her big climb.  After a half hour or so, she finished.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle was entralled.  Her company had worked in this area for some time but with little success.  Jenna could put her over the top.  \"Just think they wanted to pull the plug\" Michelle thought, \"This is our big, err little break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite a story little one\" Michelle replied \"You're very lucky because my company is near a break through on size technology.  It sounds like fate that you found me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can make me normal?\" Jenna replied.  She was beginning to tear up.  The thought of being this small any longer made her sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not yet but soon.  The technology isn't perfected yet.\"  Michelle replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well will you at least take me home?\" Jenna responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't do that either my dear, but I'll keep you safe and sound.\" Michelle responded reaching her index finger toward Jenna.  \"Why don't you hop on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was concerned.  She didn't want to be some science experiment, she just wanted to go home.  But what could she do?  Reluctantly, she climbed on the enormous finger nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I set you on the ground dear? I just want to see what you look like down there.\" Michelle slowly lowered her hand.  \"This is amazing!\" She thought, \"A breakthrough and I found it.  Think of the wealth, the power, my dreams!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna didn't want to go back on the floor.  She held on as hard as she could but to no avail.  The finger tipped up depositing her on the ground.  Michelle stood to her full height.  \"She' like a goddess\" she thought.  \"I think I'm in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna screamed as a shadow over came her and a huge pale wall appeared to her side.  Michelle had placed her foot next to the flea sized girl.  Although gentle, Jenna still went flying.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN BARELY SEE YOU JENNA\" Michelle boomed \" YOU'RE LUCKY I LOVE SANDALS OR YOU'D STILL BE ON MY OFFICE FLOOR OR WORSE....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"or worse\" sent shivers down Jenna's spine.  Michelle was right, Jenna could have been squished or eaten by a bug or worse.  She looked over at the house sized toes, again seemingly wriggling hungrily in anticipation of their new friend.

Jenna ran through the last section of slipper and prepared to jump.  Looking down, it was about a 15' drop.  \"I'm so small... What am I doing?\" She said to herself.  \"But I don't have much choice, Michelle's nuts\"  With that she lept off the slipper and onto the hard wood floor.  Landing with a thud, she gathered herself before receiving that tingling feeling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT AGAIN\" Jenna said as her world expanded around her.

Jenna watched as the ring was quickly removed and a titanic finger tip came racing toward her.  Jenna did the best she could to run but it's hard to get anywhere when you're a 1/25\" tall. The giant pad slammed into her, like a 3 ton pillow and it's oily surface stuck her to it like a fly to fly paper.

It was finally Monday morning and she was glad the weekend was over.  The last 48 hours had been horrific.  Michelle had come up with several \"games\" for the two of them to play which included dodging giant feet and teeth, being stuck to various body parts while Michelle went through her day, being trapped in a locket and much more Jenna didn't want to think about.  But now, it was Monday morning, and her plan could finally go into action...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle smiled, walking to her desk and seeing the speck of a girl trapped in her ring.  She didn't even speak to the girl.  Moving the ring, she licked her index finger and lightly touching it to the minute girl and lifted the finger to her face.  She giggled slightly at the sight and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my dear the weekend is sadly over.\" The blond spoke to tiny Jenna, \"And I have to go to work for now. But don't worry, you'll be spending the day with me!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her finger she lowered it towards the pair of pumps she planned to wear today.  As gently as she could, she tapped the small girl off her finger and into the toe section of the pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now keep my feet happy and we'll play later\" She spoke again, sliding her foot into the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna, now soaked in saliva, ran into the toe section of the pump.  She was relieved that she was riding in Michelle's shoe, not because of comfort, but because of the hope of escape.  As the toes entered, she braced herself, and began to move.  During the car ride, she climbed the toes and was small enough to fit between the space between Michelle's foot and the top of the pump.  However, by the time she was out, she realized Michelle was walking to her office.  She clung to the top of the foot as Michelle walked through the door and sat down.  Another bit of luck was that Michelle didn't even bother checking on her, assuming Jenna was snug and safe in her pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanning her next move, the giantess bellowed, speaking into the phone. \"DANIELLE, PLEASE COME IN AND BRING SAMANTHA\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was ecstatic! It sounded as if Michelle had hired Sam and she was here.  Hope filled her once again!  Jenna heard the door open and saw two pairs of feet walk in and sit across from Michelle's desk.  She lifted herself onto the pump and ran towards it's tip.  She jumped off and landed safely on the ground, unhurt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently there is some advantage to being this size\" Jenna thought to herself.  Looking up at the shoe, it was well over 100' tall.  With what little energy she had left she ran towards the two pair of feet.  However, she did not know which pair was Sam's and which was this Danielle's.  On the left was a person wearing pair of stiletto heels and on the right was a person wearing a pant suit and what looked to be Mary Janes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one is she??!\" Jenna said to herself as the 3 giants booming voices spoke high above her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to decide quick, not know which pair belonged to her mother's good friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chose.....</span></div></div>",

She had to move fast, not knowing when they 3 women would get up. If she didn't make it and Michelle found her, who knows what she'd do to Jenna! After several minutes, Jenna reached the left foot and stared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I still can't see who it is\" she said to herself. \"But anywhere is better than with Michelle.\" She walked up to the shoe, looking for a way up. Luckily for Jenna, her small size allowed her to use the scuffs and ridges in the shoe as hand holds and she began to climb. However, about half way up the shoe, all 3 giantess stood. The 3 booming voices above her seemed to be saying their goodbye's for now. Moving faster, Jenna reached the top of the shoe just as she heard Michelle speak to Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU\" Michelle bellowed, \"WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANK YOU SO MUCH\" Samantha replied, \"I CAN'T WAIT\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna watched in disbelief as the huge pair of Mary Jane's began to move away... she had picked wrong.

Samantha was gone for the day and she was trapped with Michelle and her assistant making matter's worse she heard Michelle speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DANIELLE, COULD YOU PLEASE STAY A MOMENT. I HAVE A 'SMALL' THING TO SHOW YOU\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle slid off her shoe and turned it upside down, attempting to shake out the tiny girl but there was no sign of her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's feistier than I thought\" she thought to herself.  \"I bet she tried to get some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danielle please stay still\" she spoke to her assistant.  Grabbing a magnifying glass, she slowly (and carefully) walked around her desk.  Checking the floor before kneeling down at Danielle's feet, she began to scan the carpet for the tiny girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling ok Ms. Smith?\" Danielle spoke to her boss, somewhat concerned. But Michelle did not reply.  She had spotted a small dot on her assistant's foot.  Licking her finger, she pressed the dot into it.  Upon bringing it closer to her face, she smiled, recovering her prize.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are feisty\" she spoke to it (Jenna) \"Danielle... Take a look at this\" Michelle stood and showed Danielle what she was looking for.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated and covered in saliva, Jenna world twisted and spun as she was brought in front of an enormous hazel eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS CAN'T BE\" The new giantess spoke, \"I THOUGHT WE COULDN'T SHRINK THINGS YET\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH WE CAN'T BUT SHE MIGHT HOLD THE KEY. I FOUND HER IN MY OFFICE FRIDAY.  SHE COULD BE OUR SUCCESS\" Michelle bellowed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two continued their discussion, Jenna sat slimy on Michelle's finger.  She knew whatever was in store for her wasn't going to be good.  What was worse is her options were slim especially now that he had tried to escape and was caught. She waited patiently for her fate as Michelle spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SINCE SHE IS PROVING DIFFICULT TO WATCH, I THINK I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP ON THIS ONE, DANIELLE\"  she bellowed.

The blond bimbo slid off her right shoe and placing it under the desk, slid it nervously back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally need a new job\" she mumbled under her breath, \"These people are real losers.\" Signing off her computer, she looked around the corner and not seeing anyone, slipped her right shoe on before heading out the door, unbeknown to her of little companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna's world was thrown into chaos as the enormous foot on top of her quickly slid back and forth.  Before she knew it the rope like nylon strands had tangled her up and she felt her lifted off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOO\" she screamed, \"NO MORE SHOES!!!! PLEEEASSSEE\" Jenna watched as the foot lifted off the ground and zoomed into the awaiting flat.  Jenna was once again at the mercy of another woman's feet but this time, she didn't know she was there.  Jenna desperately tried to get free but the rope like nylon heldher tight.  Doing her best to stay calm, she waited patiently to be free again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was Lizzy headed.....</span></div></div>",

Jenna is then thrust into the space beneath her big toenail, becoming wedged between it and the skin of her toe. The smell and heat are even worse in here, causing Jenna to gag and cry. She is so tightly packed she cannot move. She then hears her captors voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'THAT'S WHERE YOU WILL STAY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY, LEARNING YOUR PLACE TO ME. YOU DISGUSTING LITTLE BUG. She then cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCruella loved the feeling of the tiny girl stuck under her toenail. How degrading. She could feel the pressure from her tiny from pressing against the skin of her toe an knew the smell would be overpowering. Now she planned to make it worse. She put on some tan nylons and slid her feet into some old, worn, mules. She wiggled her big toes and felt the little girl fight helplessly. She then set off to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had a busy day again today, a quick nap, gossip and lunch, then finally preparing for tonight's mixer.  She hurried into the house and quietly stepped into her room.

Her eyes squinted as an enormous reach in lifting the slippers and setting them on the ground.  Rubbing her eyes, she watched her new giantess step into bed and began to look around.  The room was gigantic (even at her own scale) and noticed two other beds in the room too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must be in college,\" Jenna thought looking around the room.  \"I wonder which one?\"  Something caught her eye far above her head.  Looking up, she noticed the Greek letters DDX on a city block sized shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be good...\" Jenna said to herself.  She was in a sorority.  Not only a sorority, the richest, snottiest sorority on her college campus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta get out of here!\" Jenna said, \"But how? Who knows where I am in the house?!

To her left Jenna saw something that gave her an idea.. her mothers shirt buttons in the distance.. if she could head over there and use each one for temporary balance, she would stand a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennas mom continued to gather ingredients from the fridge for her lunch. By the time she finished and approached the counter, Jenna had arrived at her 3rd button. Jenna grasped the side of the button like she did the penny, having this support was relieving. She took a moment to look up: over the white shirt button, over the collar, to the expanse of her mothers upper chest and neck that stretched upwards to her massive head. Jenna teared up thinking that she\u2019d never be found, to only become a flea on her mother completely unaware of her. But she couldn\u2019t give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a surge went through Jenna.. a familiar one at that. \u201coh no!\u201d She squeaked before shrinking down to 1/64th of an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up in a shade. Jenna looked up to see her mothers shirt button above her like a ceiling.. she was so tiny that she had shrunk beneath it. If he mother couldn\u2019t see her then, she was completely done for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother moved once again, and Jenna grabbed the closest thing near her, the strings holding the shirt button in place.. they were as wide as a redwood tree, but she was able to dig her fingers in the gaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no use in screaming, she didn\u2019t know what to do. She looked up to see light protruding through a massive hole in the sky.. it was one of the holes in the shirt buttons.. if she could traverse up the string and out the hole of the button, maybe she could stay safe for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trek wasn\u2019t too hard as the strings became horizontal as Jennas mother bent over the counter to mix ingredients together.. soon she found herself peering out of the button hole of her moms shirt, the world of her home now visible and overwhelmingly huge. Jenna, trembling, held onto the strings that looped through the hole to keep it in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, her mother realized she mixed in a wrong ingredient and out of annoyance, simply exhales out her mouth..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to Jenna:</span></div></div>",

Luckily he was sitting and the lack of his movements made it easy for Jenna to jog through the dark forest of thick black hair. As she got father, the landscape became steeper.. soon too steep to move forward without losing balance. Jenna then grabbed the hair that began to aim downwards and used them to trek lower towards the fleshy monument before her that was her dads ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the ear in view and at a reasonable height, Jenna collected the courage needed and let go of the strand of hair she was hanging onto. In a flash, she landed on top of the ear. Luckily for Jenna, it was wide enough and she was small enough to stand on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201calright, now how do I get into his ear canal?\u201d She said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her father yawned, causing him to flex his ears. The earthquake atop the ear caused Jenna to yelp, reach out and grab one of the hairs on the side of her dads head for support.. but just Jenna\u2019s luck... the hair was loose and she found herself falling. Jenna would have landed on her fathers shoulder hundreds of feet below if it wasn\u2019t for the hair she had gripped. The speck size girl found herself floating with the hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around she could see she was orbiting around her dads face.. and right towards his mustache.<br>\r\n\u201cahh! Dad help me!\u201d She screamed before the rogue hair crashed into a new forest and sending her back into a familiar but much more difficult landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping the hairs of her fathers mustache, Jenna looked down to see her fathers breakfast and above her, his nostrils that flared as he breathed. Those simple inhales were enough to move Jenna upwards which lead her to grip the mustache hairs even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad please! Please feel me!\u201d she yelled once again.<br>\r\nBut to her unaware father, she was just another strand of facial hair above his upper lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna, mind racing suddenly heard a new noise.. a new person.. it was her mom coming into the kitchen<br>\r\n\u201cgood morning, hun\u201d said Jennas mom to her husband.<br>\r\n\u201cMornin\u2019\u201d.

Once she reached the end, Jenna realized the flaw in her plan: the hair stopped just above the eye-brow. She would need to jump to get to his eye. Taking a deep breath, Jenna let go of the hair and went into free-fall. Unfortunately, Jenna's sense of distance was off, and she landed with a thud on her father's nose! She grabbed the bridge of his nose with both arms and legs and began to yell for his attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father began to shift and wiggle his nose. To her horror, Jenna saw the massive fingers coming to her position. Oh no! He must think I'm a bug, thought Jenna. She jumped to her right at the last second and went into free fall.

As you can see, many girls had a similar fate. You see, there is a witch who flies around at night and shrinks random girls. The witch doesn't like teenagers, and female teenagers are the worst to her. Luckily, her spell that was used to shrink us also created a place for us to go when we die. We're all friends here, this is our home now. We all died like this, I tried to get my brother's attention when he was in the kitchen. I stood on his plate and he mistook me for food and ate me. That girl over there was sat on by her friend.\" Tracy said, pointing to someone else. She then asked how you died.

We have special channels only for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to offend you, but is there anyway to come back alive?\" Tracy gets a serious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not offended, but the journey is hard. Basically, you can return to Earth in a new body, but you only get three lives, you already used one. Every time you go back, you start to look more like a toy to humans. If you go back now, you're body will be softer than the first, like a plush toy. It's a little harder to die, but you can't speak English. If you die and go back again, you'll return as a doll. Still can't speak, but there's another downside too. Girls who see you will become attracted to you and will have a harder time listening to you. They'll want to play, . . . or hurt you. If you die again after that, you'll be stuck here with us. I haven't used my extra lives left, but some of the others have.\" You couldn't believe all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this from the witch's magic?\" Your friend nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it might be because she loves to know that we continue to struggle on Earth.

It was Saturday so she knew that her dad was at work and her mom was out shopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her night stand to check her alarm clock it was only 12PM so her little sister was out playing at a friends.

She quickly ran over to her cell phone which to her was the size of a pool table. She climbed on top of the phone and jumped on each button and quickly dial Rachel's number.

Jenna screamed, \"MOM!\" and ran over, about to pound on her mother's shoe to get her attention. But then she realized the futility of it. She was so small now that her mom would never feel it through the material of her shoe and Jenna could likely get herself stepped on. She rejoined Rachel and watched in awe as the human skyscraper carried Justin into the room and put him to bed for his daily nap. <br>\r\n\"All right, you stay here honey,\" she said, \"Mommy has to go to work, but the babysitter will be here any minute now. I'll just wait for her and leave.\" She tucked him in and gave him a goodnight kiss and walked out, closing the door behind her and causing the ground to shake so much that the micro girls almost fell into a crack in the floorboards. As soon as they regained their footing, they rushed toward the crack under the door as quickly as possible, not wanting Justin to find them. Once there, they collapsed under the door in exhaustion as the bracelet had not shrunk with them and they had to drag it along. It was about as big as they were, but surprisingly light. Jenna's tiny doll clothes had not shrunk either, and she shivered as she was once again half naked. Rachel sat there panting and massaging her bare feet. <br>\r\n\"Ooh,\" she moaned, \"I'd say I must have gotten a splinter, but the splinters are all bigger than me now. How tiny are we NOW?\"<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Jenna said tiredly, \"When I shrunk just now, it seemed like you were normal size and I was three inches tall. So...\"<br>\r\n\"So we're about three inches tall compared to what we were a few seconds ago. We're microscopic now!\"<br>\r\nJenna judged them to be just barely an eighth of an inch tall. Too small for anyone to notice unless they had a magnifying glass or unless they got very lucky. What do they do?</span></div></div>",

We're too tiny for anyone to notice us now. We would just look like little specks to them, if they see us at all.\"<br>\r\n\"That's the story of my life,\" she muttered. \"You're saying we're stuck like this forever?\"<br>\r\n\"I think we need to try something drastic,\" Jenna looked disturbed. \"We're way too small to climb on anything and get to a higher place so that someone might see us. That means we're stuck here on the floor. No one will ever see us while we're this size, unless they're three inches tall.\"<br>\r\nRachel's eyes went wide, \"You want to SHRINK someone? The babysitter? Sounds like it might be fun, but... can we actually do that?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think we have any other choice. If we don't get help, our lifespans will look pretty similar to our height. Either we shrink her and take the chance that something MIGHT happen to her or that we won't find a way to unshrink her... or we die. But I'm still wondering if I can make myself do it.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's at least try to get her attention first. We can try that if we absolutely have to. Besides, we don't even know how to shrink her with the bracelet. We might just end up shrinking ourselves even smaller! Gosh, I HATE being this tiny!\" A tear slid down her cheek.<br>\r\nJenna gave her a warm smile, \"Oh, cheer up, you little midget, or I'll squish you!\"<br>\r\nThat got a small laugh out of Rachel. \"I'll try, Thumbelina.\"<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Jenna, \"Being shrunk might not be so bad. I think I'd actually enjoy it if I didn't have to worry about fighting for my life. But I'd much rather be three inches tall than Bacteria Girl. It would be fun if I knew that I could get back to normal size anytime I wanted.\"<br>\r\nFinally, they came to the living room, where they saw Anna, the short fifteen-year-old blond girl next door, sitting on the couch reading.<br>\r\n\"Anna?\" said Jenna, \"I guess she's the babysitter. Let's go.\" <br>\r\nIt was only then that she noticed with a sinking feeling that she was walking from hardwood floor into the carpet. Each strand of the carpet was twice her height, turning the living room into a jungle.<br>\r\n\"This is bad,\" said Rachel. \"We might not be able to see any threats coming, like getting stepped on, if we can't see above the carpet. How can it be taller than us?!\"</span></div></div>",

It was such a strange, surreal feeling walking among the strands, like something out of a dream. Every so often, one of them would climb up to the top of a carpet strand to check their position and make sure they were going the right way.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rachel!\" Jenna shrieked gleefully from the top of the layer of carpet, \"She's wearing sandals! This is wonderful!\"<br>\r\n\"Why is it wonderful?\" Rachel asked, puzzled and exhausted.<br>\r\n\"That means her skin is exposed! If she were wearing real shoes, she would never be able to feel us climbing on her foot. We could never get her attention. But now, when we get there we can both jump up and down on her foot and her skin will be much more sensitive.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Rachel said, \"Will that work? Well, let's look on the bright side. The two of us together make one quarter-of-an-inch tall girl. She's more likely to feel our combined weight.\"<br>\r\nWhen the girls the mountain-sized foot, they were exhausted beyond belief.<br>\r\n\"It's almost over,\" Jenna wheezed encouragingly.<br>\r\n\"We have to climb THAT?\" Rachel said doubtfully, \"I can't believe I'm about to climb someone's bare toes!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, at least she has nice feet,\" Jenna shrugged, \"I wish I had HER toes.\" She looked down at her feet.<br>\r\n\"That's true. At least her feet aren't smelly.\"<br>\r\nThey both climbed to the top of the carpet, and from there jumped onto her one of Anna's flip flops, right next to the pinky toe. It was the lowest part of the foot, but still twice as tall as them. Rachel gave Jenna a boost on her shoulders. Once on top, Jenna lay on her stomach and Rachel jumped to reach her hand so she could pull her up. It took some doing, but they made it. At this point, they walked toward the center of the foot to a safer area and flopped down for a second, catching their breath.</span></div></div>",

They slid around the foot and tried to grab onto one of the middle toes. Jenna thought she was going to be sick as the toe thrust her up and down. She screamed as she lost her grip and ended up lying on the massive toenail. Unfortunately, the nail was very smooth and she slid off of it almost instantly and plunged into the depths between the crushing toes. Rachel joined her and the girls put their hands in the air as the giant toe came down, to stop it from crushing them. Amazingly, they were able to hold it in place. It seemed that their bodies were tougher at this size. They had to be. Like the way ants were able to lift things bigger than themselves. The toe had stopped for the moment, but both girls knew that their strength couldn't hold out much longer.<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Rachel grunted under the strain.<br>\r\n\"We have to shrink her. It's our only choice! She'll kill us if we don't.\" Jenna shrieked.<br>\r\n\"Agreed. But we don't know how to use the bracelet! We can't just read it again, or it'll make us smaller.\"<br>\r\n\"We'll find a different way of reading it. If it does shrink us, we'll be smaller than a grain of sand. So tiny that we'll probably be safe. We have to take the chance.\"<br>\r\nRachel nodded, with fear in her eyes, \"Why don't we try reading the bracelet while we're not touching it. Have her touch it instead of us.\"<br>\r\nThey maneuvered the bracelet across the surface of Anna's flip flop with their tiny feet. They got it to where it was braced against the sole of Anna's foot, but not touching them. The two micro girls read the strange words on the bracelet aloud in unison.

She wanted to explore this exciting new giant world she had found herself in. She had always thought of herself as too tall anyway, and was excited to see what it was like to be Thumbelina. Still being a little tired, though, she smiled and decided and to go back to sleep. She awoke later to the sound of a small voice yelling in her ear. Turning her head to see where the voice was coming from, she froze in shock. Her first thought was that she had gone back to normal size, but when she looked around, her room was still gigantic. She was still tiny. Her mouth hung open. She wasn't big again, there really WAS a girl even tinier than her standing there on the pillow, trying to get her attention. <br>\r\nShe gasped, \"Who are you? How did you get here? And...so...small...?\"<br>\r\nThe incredibly tiny girl was not much bigger than Jenna's thumb. She was very pretty, with light brown hair, and was dressed similarly to Jenna: barefoot, wearing a halter top and shorts. From her clothing, it looked like she had been shrunk in her sleep too.<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she said, \"but I was desperate. I had to shrink you, because I'm much too small for anyone of normal size to notice me. I have to get unshrunk and the only way to do that was by making you tiny enough to see me.\"<br>\r\nJenna sat up and yawned, \"Oh, don't worry about it. I like being tiny. I'm excited to try it out! But how did you get so small?\"<br>\r\nThe girl seemed intimidated and shyly looked down at her bare feet, \"I was shrunk in my sleep just like you were. I can't make myself bigger, but I found the method that was used to shrink me. I tried it on myself, hoping it would make me big again. But instead it just made me even smaller. I used it to shrink you too.\"<br>\r\nJenna looked at the near-microscopic girl and said,</span></div></div>",
