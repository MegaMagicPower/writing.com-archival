He found himself in a strange forest; everything seems dead, some blood on the side, Pit doesn't know why the stains smell so sweet but believed he was being delusional. He then found a lone girl afraid of this place. \"What's wrong?\" Pit said. \"Monster! Go away! You were supposed to be an angel!\" The girl said and ran away. He looked at himself to find that he has blood on his tunic, and some dripping from his mouth. He gasped and wiped some of it off, licked it off, and gasped, looking on in horror. What did he do? What happened? Why did the girl act this way? He just wants to help! And why does the blood taste so good? He then notice a figure on what looks like a dead animal. He went to check it out, but something gave horror far beyond his blood-stained outfit. A monster drinking blood from the corpse? It was not just a monster, but one that looks exactly like him, but with the pale skin and the dark eyes that glared at him. His bloody wings, bigger than Pit's, spread out as he prepares to attack. He tried to ready his weapon, only to find that it was missing. Horrified and at the creature's mercy, he could only watch as the monster's hands lash out at him and grabbed him. \"Who are you?\" Pit asked terrified. \"I'm you...\" the monster whispered in his ear and, without warning, plunged its fangs into Pit's neck and started to feed. Pit tried to break free, but kept losing strength until he finally passed out. \"Lady Palutena... help...\" he said as the world he suffers in fades into darkness.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality...<br>\r\n\"Pit? Pit! Please wake up!\" cried a voice from his goddess. Pit woke up gasping inside a house somewhere in the same village he blacked out at. \"Lady Palutena? Was that... a dream?\" he wondered. \"Probably, you blacked out when something bit you and knocked you to the ground. A human looking creature with sharp fangs. That explains why you had holes on your neck.\" Palutena said. \"F-F-Fangs? H-Holes on my neck?!\" Pit stammered as he got up and felt his neck. She was right, Pit had holes on his neck! He then had a weird sensation in his head. Dark places are much brighter in his eyes. He also had a strange new taste running through his mouth. \"Ugh... what's coming over me?\" Pit thought to himself. \"Leave this house at once, I'll need a closer look at this, AND the monsters that attack the village.\" Palutena ordered. \"R-R-Rodger that...\" Pit responded. He moved to the door in under a second, tried to open the door, and ripped it off by accident. \"What's happening to me? I feel so much stronger and faster.\" Pit said in a startled tone. He tried to leave into the sun and...</span></div></div>",

You know the one with the hands holding the apple?\" Palutena asked. \"Ugh.. Twilight again?\" the glistening angel groaned. \"Say what you want, but the fact that it's about a vampire got me interested in it. The romance is quite unusual.\" Palutena remarked. \"Sorry, I just don't know what that book has to do with what's happening to me.\" Pit responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike real vampires, the vampires in Twilight have golden eyes and skin that sparkle in the sun just like yours Pit\" Palutena explains. \"As if I don't look handsome enough.\" Pit joked. \"You look more attractive, Pit. And another thing, want to know what else vampires have that humans don't? Then run to the farthest metal bar, one that's hard to pick up alone, and bend it! You'll see what I mean.\" Palutena said. \"I hope my back doesn't break...\" Pit sighed to himself and notice a metal bar far away and burst into speed and reached it in a second. Pit recoiled at how fast he moved. He refocused himself and pick up a metal bar as if it were a stick and bent it effortlessly. \"Whoa...\" Pit gasped. \"Lady Palutena, what's happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pit, you have become a vampire angel. You are more powerful than you already were before.\" Palutena said. \"Wait, you mean I have to drink blood to survive!? But we have to protect them, I don't want to hurt them, you'd have to kill me, and...\" Pit cried out. \"Calm down Pit. You don't have to hurt the humans. Your golden eyes are the eyes of a vampire who prefer to drink animal blood. It is believe that those kind are not a threat to humanity. You can consume normal food but you don't take in as much nutrients as you do when you feed. If you want to feed, you'd have to hunt and feed...\" Palutena inquired. \"Hunt and feed?\" Pit repeated nervously. \"...Or you could feed on me. My blood can make you shiny and strong. Why, I'd see myself in bed with you, accepting your blood into me! I will be honored to become the vampire goddess of light, my husband.\" Palutena offered seductively. \"What...? But... I...\" Pit stammered. Palutena laughed and said. \"Don't be scared Pit, I was just kidding. I know you'd never hurt me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit's stomach growled, making him groan. \"Lady Palutena, I'm starving now!\" Pit said. \"Good, just in time, there's a deer over there.\" Palutena said. Pit looked over to see a deer, and gulped. This is his first feeding and he never had to kill for food before. \"I'm a little scared... what if someone sees me or...\" Pit confessed. \"There aren't any humans around and besides, you could just come back, but we'd have to risk you biting one of us. But we can get this sorted out sooner. Your call.\" Pit knew what he had to do and asked Palutena to...</span></div></div>",

A large, fierce wolf appeared, it seems to have cut itself mildly, but enough for Pit to catch its scent. \"What... what is this... aroma...?\" Pit droned. He feels his breath quicken, his stomach growling more ferociously, and his mouth flooding with drool. \"I... can't... control... myyself... any longer...\" he thought to himself as his fangs grew in.

They say a plague broke out.\" Palutena responded. \"Then why am I going there, at risk of spreading it?\" Pit questioned. \"Don't worry it doesn't spread through just some touch. In fact, I heard that it has to be injected rather than merely being bitten. Just in case though, keep your distance, unless the people need something. Like from those poor souls.\" Palutena answered. Pit looked over to a bunch of weak looking people over by the outskirts. \"Why are they out there, shouldn't they be cared for?\" Pit demanded for an answer to the sick's treatment. \"I... I don't know, maybe because to prevent spreading. But what about the visitors that come this way?\" Palutena said. The people's faces look normal, but their skin are as white as snow, and their eyes are shades of orange and red, some pupils are slits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get... get away...! Please, go back to where you came from, or you'll suffer like the rest of us.\" a sickly woman pleaded. \"Why? I just want to help!\" Pit responded. \"The disease is too dangerous, nothing is immune, you'd have to be a god not to suffer such a vile ailment. Don't cut yourself around us! It's one thing to do so with an infected around, but against us you won't stand a chance! Just run away!\" A man cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The disease is obviously severe... I'll pull you out, it's getting far out of hand... I don't want you to suffer too!\" Palutena proclaimed as she pulls Pit back. \"Whoa, wait watch out... *gets a big cut on his left arm* OUCH!\" Pit yelled. \"Pit, I'm sorry! I'll just... the people!\" Palutena reacted. Pit noticed angry faces on the people, hissing as they prepare to attack. \"Lady Palutena, what's going on?\" Pit asked fearfully. The infected humans' claws and fangs grew in (obvious signs of what Pit is up against) and charged into battle. \"Pit, watch out!\" A woman bites him on the cut arm, and a man bit him on the leg, and a young infected dug his fangs into his neck. \"Argh, No no no no no no! Help! Get them off of me!\" Pit panicked. \"How... how dare you attack my angel?!\" Palutena called out, using magical forces to pull the infected off Pit, leaving him in pain. \"Pit! I'll get you out of there! Just hang in there.\" Palutena blared as she pulls Pit out before more infected humans show up to bite Pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Sky World... <br>\r\n\"Ugh! That was close...\" Pit grunted. \"Pit, I'm so sorry! I wasn't careful enough, at least you got out in one piece.\" Palutena apologized. \"You don't say... Ack... those people weren't kidding when... they...\" Pit groaned and slumped to his knees. \"Pit, are you alright? You're suffering aren't you?! This is my fault, I should have watched your flight path!\" Palutena cried in remorse. \"It's not your fault, you were probably distracted by the growing plague.

She smiled and fell asleep, until Pit started screaming in his sleep, waking up the goddess of light. Palutena beamed at Pit with fear and said \"Pit?!\" Pit's skin turned pale, his hands and toes grew vampiric claws, and as he let out another scream, Palutena noticed he grew fangs sharp enough to pierce even the toughest flesh. Then something started to happen to his wings!</span></div></div>",

Pit's struggles was enough to break (but not enough to do so without getting web all over himself). \"Ugh, I just got this tunic washed yesterday!\" Pit groaned pulling the webs off of him the best he could. Little did he know, a spider landed on his right arm. Pit's eyes widen in pure horror as it moves on his arm. As Pit looks over to find a large spider on his arm, it bit him on the unprotected area of said arm. Pit hissed as he grabs the bitten area of his arm after the spider jumped off. The spider doesn't look evil, more like it was looking for something, though it freaked Pit out either way. \"You'll thank me later...\" the spider said as it left Pit staring right at it. \"When did that spider talk?!\" he thought.

Looking back, he saw that his butt became a spider's abdomen, like the one that bit him, except it takes on more of a golden color with a light blue Palutena symbol on it. He feels the light flowing from it. He feels his entire lower body crackling and the abdomen sprouting large bug-like wings that buzz as they flutter rapidly. \"H-Huh?! Wha-What's happening to me?!?!\" Pit cried out and he grunts lightly as he looks down to find bloating legs turn brown and shut his eyes and groan in discomfort and ecstasy at the same time as those two legs split into four spider legs from each of Pit's two legs he had, destroying his sandals in the process. His new spider legs have golden tips on the ends of them and green streaks on the brown/furry area. He tumbles to the ground as he is golden abdomen swells up to fit his new lower body, growing brown fur on the abdomen except the underbelly and the area with the symbol, which glowed slightly. As the feeling go away, Pit opened his eyes and lifted his body. He yelped and groaned as his brain begins to hurt as the new body alters his mind to make him know how to walk, climb, spin web, and eat food, which it shows as animals and fruit. Not only that but in his mouth fangs grew in. As that pain goes, he starts to notice that his body feels a little different. \"Whoa!\" Pit said as he saw that he is a spider from the waist down, and sees that his upper torso, head, arms, and torso are still normal. \"Pit? What happened to you?\" The voice of his Goddess of Light, Palutena, asked. \"I... I don't know. I think it was that spider who bit me! But... how did it do this to me!?\" Pit responded gesturing his bitten arm and his legs replaced by a spider.</span></div></div>",

Though the underworld army had been defeated several years ago, Skyworld had suddenly found itself under attack by a new, mysterious force, catching Pit off guard. He'd been forced to fight his way through the temple without Palutena's guidance, all to reach her and make sure she was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis concern was warranted, as upon reaching her chamber, Pit found Palutena's body slumped onto the ground, a shadowy figure looming over her. It's arm was raised, ready to strike and deal the final blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from her!\" he shouted, raising his bow and firing and arrow at the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure proved too quick, and moved out of the way before Pit's arrow could hit its mark. From within its shadows, a pair of glowing eyes glared at him, before it simply dissipated, leaving Pit alone with Palutena in the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the attacker was gone, Pit threw caution to the wind, dropping his weapon as he rushed to Palutena's side. \"Lady Palutena! Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he had stopped the killing blow, it seemed Palutena had already been gravely injured before his arrival, her elegant robe stained red. \"Pit...\" she said weakly between coughs. She sounded anything but healthy. She gently shook her head. \"It's too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit was panicking now. He could defeat bad guys and monsters no problem, but this was another thing entirely. \"No! You can't die, not like this! There's gotta be something I can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalutena slowly closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if debating whether to reply. \"...There is... one thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? I'll do it, whatever it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must... take my power for your own... and become the new God of Light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late for me... for this body... But I can live on... through you... If you accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit was rather nervous. Taking on the position of a god seemed like a massive responsibility, but despite that, if it would allow Palutena to \"live on\", as she put it, then he knew there was no debate. \"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile graced Palutena's face, and she nodded. \"Close your eyes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit did as instructed, and he felt Palutena's hand press against his chest. Then, in but a single moment, he felt a monumental power rushing through his body. He felt power, energised, ready to take on the world. But once he was completely empowered, and the power stopped entering his body, he felt the hand touching his chest disappear. He had all this power, but at what cost?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly opened his eyes, to find that he was alone in the chamber, a red stain being all that was left of the goddess he once served. With her power gifted to him, Palutena's body had vanished. He slowly stood up, and observed himself; the new God of Light.</span></div></div>",

So he decided to go for a walk in the woods and enjoy his time off. Little did he know, there is a monster watching him. No, it's not an Underworld monster, rather a human-looking monster found in the wild. \"What was that?\" Pit realized, noticing the bush rustling and a soft moan to follow. \"When is there a human in these woods? Are you alright?\" Pit asked the bush. Suddenly a hand lashed out and grabbed his left arm. \"Aah! Let go! What are you?\" Pit panicked. The figure rising as the size of an adult, had F cup breasts, and long hair, and soft hips. It's probably a teen because of the face, though the body is hard to tell, so tall and yet so young. The figure just howled and tried to grab at and tear off his tunic, but Pit was struggling valiantly to the stalker's aggravation. It couldn't let Pit get away, so she bit Pit really hard. \"Ow ow ow ow! Back Off!\" Pit yelled and struck it with the side of his First Blade, knocking back the humanoid freak. While it started to get up, Pit already made a break for it. The creature jumped from tree to tree and sniffing for him as Pit hides, ready to strike. As it figures out where Pit is, he came out and shot it down. Incapacitated, the human-looking creature reverted to normal to Pit's surprise. The creature now looks like a another boy angel, who looks at Pit's bitten arm and said \"Sweet Palutena, what did I do?!\" and ran off. \"How...? What...? Agh,my arm!\" Pit groaned as he clenched his arm, bleeding slightly, though the scabs already formed with a sweet scent. \"At least it healed completely. I should look at this... Full... Moon... *groans*\" Pit groaned as he stared at the full moon in the sky. His head started to hurt, strange things run through his head. Pit could only force out \"What's... happening... to me...?!\" All Pit could do afterwards was...</span></div></div>",

He looked at them to find that they shrunk to girlish proportions and grew long, pretty fingernails. \"Wha... What's wrong with my hands?! What did she do to me?!\" Pit panicked as he slapped on his mouth. \"My voice, too?\" he thought, then his chest throbbed painfully. \"Oooooh! My chest hurts... GAH!\" He yelled as large lumps of flesh popped onto his chest. \"Are... are these breasts? I grew breasts?!\" Pit recoiled as his rear end started to hurt as with the rest of his body. His stomach area lengthened and slimmed, too much for his white tunic to handle, and tore in half revealing his sexy stomach. His butt inflated until it's the size of that of the creature he encountered. During these changes, the pain is converted to a strange pleasure in Pit. Pit's face softened in a relaxed expression and turned his head whipping around his lengthening hair, growing til it reached the middle of his back. Then he suddenly smiled as his face turned girly and his eyes grew bigger and wider. \"Oh... mmmmm... I feel so strong... so sexy... feels so good...!\" Pit moaned, hearing his pretty voice as he feel his body change further, not noticing his wings expanding in size and allure with the same sweet scent as his wounds nor that they were lifting him off the ground all by himself like he dreamed to. \"The power, the beauty, I know it somewhere... I... oh... feels so good... ooohhh... have to do it!\" His transformation is completing itself, and it feels so good! He had this urge within him, he had to do it. \"Oooh... Aooh...Aarooo... AAAAARRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" Pit howled to the night sky, the full moon in full view. The creature Pit became stared forward, mindless from the pleasure it what happened to him brought today, then Pit realized. \"I... I've become a Were-Girl!\" Pit spoke up in shock and looked at him... herself very thoroughly. Her hair is long, silky, and shiny, quite alluring! Her stomach reveals itself, her butt is bigger than it should be, her vision was block by the large, cute mountains on his chest that are F cup breasts. She reached for his groin and gasped in shock. \"It... It's gone!\" She lifted her hands and started to touch her breasts, and started to play with them a little. \"Ugh... ooohh... so soft and squishy... can't stop playing with them.\" He... erm... she finally broke the urge to play with her breasts and felt her butt a little. \"This feels so good, I must be dreaming! If I weren't I wouldn't be...\" She looked to the ground to find that she was floating, and look behind and found something better than her new form, her wings carrying her by themselves, no Power of Flight!! \"I... I... I can fly... by myself...! I'm not dreaming! But what about the people I protect? What about the other angels? What about Lady Palutena? How can I explain this to her?\" Pit wondered, but wants to try his new wings out! He thought it'd be best to...</span></div></div>",

Palutena needs to know of these creatures.\" Pit flapped her wings and flew off back to Sky World to report the were-girl attack and transformation he experienced. Meanwhile, as she lands in Sky World, the sun rises on the horizon. Pit groaned softly as changes started to take place. Her butt and hair shrunk to normal size and her breasts disappeared. Her stomach thickens and shrunk to normal size and her hands grew to boyish size and her nails are gone. The changes continued till Pit is a he again, but his wings stayed the same size much to his relief. He took off again and flew to the temple in search of Palutena. \"Lady Palutena? Something happened last night, and you're not gonna believe it!\" Pit called for his goddess with a need to tell Palutena of what Pit has become last night. He found Palutena looking into the fountain, watching what the humans are up to. \"Palutena, you will NOT believe what happened to me last night!\" Pit exclaimed. Palutena gasped as she turned around and saw what happened to his clothes. \"Pit? What happened last night? and what happened to your tunic and...? Your... your wings... they're bigger, can you fly now?\" Palutena asked. \"Yes, I can fly by myself now, watch!\" Pit exclaimed as he flapped his wings and floated in mid-air and flew around momentarily, while Palutena stood watching in amazement. Then Pit landed right in front of her. \"You couldn't just fly by yourself before! How does this happen?\" Palutena responded to his flight, she must really wanted to know! \"I was strolling in the woods with nothing to do and I saw rustling in the bushes. I went to check it out and a creature grabbed me and bit me! I defeated it and it turned into a teenage boy and ran off. Moments after te battle, I started to feel strange and turned into a were-girl. That creature must be a were-girl!\" Pit explained, much to Palutena's shock and awe. \"That... that's impossible Pit, they're not real.\" Palutena responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit looked at a mysterious box and held his head and groaned a little. \"Do you expect them to be real?\" a voice coming from the entrance called out. A dark reflection of Pit emerged from the shadows, his wings bigger than his old ones and just as big as Pit's \"Pitto?\" Pit responded. \"You're lucky I'm here to thank you for what happened last night, Pit-stain.\" the reflection said. \"Dark Pit was here to show me the same thing, I just couldn't believe it... Pit are you alright?\" Palutena explained. \"Never better, just what is in the box? It felt like what happened yesterday.\" Pit wondered. \"I felt that way too, but I passed out when something happened to me. I woke up with a torn tunic.\" Dark Pit said. \"A moon charm is inside this small chest. It was given to me by a stranger, he said 'use it to identify the transgender-weres good and evil alike. Defeat the evil ones, the good ones shall aid.' I didn't believe anything he said...\" Palutena answered as she opened the chest and showed Pit the charm. \"Now that you saw this, let's go back to how your wings grew... Pit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit just stared at the charm, quaking and sweating, then he groaned. His voice suddenly grew higher, which caught both the goddess and the dark angel's attention. \"Oh great, right in front of them.\" Pit groaned looking helplessly at his shocked goddess and the surprised (and aroused) clone. His hands shrunk and his nails grew, his F cup breasts came back, his butt swelled to the size of the were-girl he encountered last night, his hair grew longer, and his stomach slimmed and lengthened, and to top off the transformation, Pit's face became girly and sweet. His lips puffed up a little and his eye lashes grew longer. He opened his bigger, wider eyes and looked at the charm that changed him into a she, and howled directly at it. Palutena stammered \"How... I... but they...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Pit looked on until he notices changes happening to him too. He groaned and his voice grew higher, though not as high as Pit's voice. He nosebled through the changes that Pit went through. As the change finished, the angel roared with power and glared at the charm Palutena held and howled at it as well. The shocked goddess is surrounded by two now beautiful angels as they look at each other in shock. \"I can't believe this...\" Dark Pit whispered to herself as she wiped the blood from her nose. \"Now you know how my wings grew?\" Pit confessed. Palutena recovered from the shock and went closer to Pit to examine her, as well as poke one of Pit's large breasts. \"I thought they were a myth, but your strength is immense! It must be true...\" Palutena responded. Pit blushed as she notice her goddess poking one of her breasts and asked \"Now you can stop poking my breasts? It feels uncomfortable.\" Palutena stopped poking Pit's breasts and looked at her own, feeling self-conscious by the difference. \"Sorry Pit, but they are bigger than my breasts, and I never had an angel who became a transgender-were.\" Palutena said in a dejected tone. \"Don't be jealous Lady Palutena, I'd never be prettier than a goddess like you.\" Pit said to cheer her goddess up. Palutena smiled and said \"Maybe until your forms wear off, you and Pittoo might want to learn how to be girls while I research this dilemma further, see how to at least help you two gain further control of your transformations.\" Dark Pit was too distracted blushing and examining her were-girl form. \"Be... a girl?\" Pit gasped as she blushed, think of what she might want the two were-girl-angels do as girls. \"Ok, I guess so. It feels good to be in this form anyway.\" Palutena nodded happily and said, \"Just in case you don't change back for a day or so, I recommend you stay here in Sky World. If you do change back and decide to go somewhere else, remember don't think of anything naughty if you know what I mean, things could get awkward with the other fighters if you think of anything... sexy. Your call.\" Pit and Dark Pit looked at each other and decided to...</span></div></div>",

No inappropriate actions, there can be romance but not too graphic.<br>\r\n2. no killing in any place, especially the villains that turn good or appear in SSBB (including Wolf, King Dedede, Gandorf, Bowser, Wario), when any character is defeated will be trophicated and can be revived, or just simply make like a banana and split. In simple terms, no major character deaths!<br>\r\n3. When Pit becomes a certain creature (i.e. vampire, plant), he can spread it to other characters. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n4. New rule: Can be from SSBB/SSB4, Kid Icarus: Uprising or both! :D (I prefer both)<br>\r\n5. No matter what happens, Pit will still be good and remain faithful to his Goddess, Palutena.<br>\r\n6. Pit may or may not be able to fly by himself when changed, you decide.<br>\r\n7. Unacceptable pairings are PitXArlon, PitXThanatos, PitXMedusa and PitXHades because Arlon is classy that way, Thanatos is either weird or just dim, and Medusa and Hades are Pit's enemies, not lovers! &gt;:(</td>",
