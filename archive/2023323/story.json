Secret intelligence had informed you that this was indeed the correct spot. Any minute now Nathan Drake would return here, resting up for the evening. How had you obtained such information? Well that was a secret of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your right is a large table like object, half a tree stump you assumed. Deciding that it was a good hiding spot, you quickly duck behind it, facing the currently closed shack entrance. In your hand is a special device. A size changing ray, obtained from the same people who had given you the information and had transported you here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shack itself is pretty plain. Other than the table there's a simple bed, a wooden wardrobe, an eating area and a corner with several bandages and equipment. Modest really. You weren't all too surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear the crunching of leaves outside and then, footsteps coming closer and closer to the shack. Quickly you look down at your device and adjust the settings. You wanted to get the things going as soon as Nate walked in.</span></div></div>",

Turning it around you aimed at yourself and a moment of without hesitation you pressed the button, closing your eyes as the gun shot out a singular beam of light at your face. You knew exactly how the process played out, although not really the science behind it all. You could feel the molecules rearranging in your body, twisting and changing as you shrunk. The process was quick and painless and soon you opened your eyes, greeted by the merry sight of a giant wooden stump the size of a large wall in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time to take in your surroundings though, because the sound of the shack door opening soon filled the air. Quickly you hurry to the edge of the stump, peeking out from behind it. At first you're distracted by how different the things in the room looked from your size but soon your gaze sets on your prime target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the doorway was the gigantic form of Nathan Drake, decked out in his typical outfit, scarf included. The light shining from outside seemed to encompass Drake's body, seemingly causing a glow all around him. Even though you were at least a few regular feet away he still looked like a god to you, handsome and towering. As you scanned upwards, tilting your head back you deduce that you were the size of a toy to him. He could grab you in one hand and hold you captive. It was amazing and wondrous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch him scan the shack before making his way inside, his powerful boots hitting the ground with force as he walked about, unaware of the tiny guest watching him. It seemed like a perfect time to make your move.</span></div></div>",

The ray which came out was a blinding white flash that filled the room and forced your eyes shut. You hadn't expected the thing to have been so blinding, but then again you had never used a size changing ray in the first place. Despite having no vision you still tried to step backwards but fell when you hit the same stump of tree you had tried hiding behind moments ago, landing backwards and hitting your head painfully against a blunt object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you could hear a loud yell coming from the direction of the doorway - Nate's voice no doubt as the light engulfed him completely, rearranging the molecules within his body and his clothing. As it transformed him the light began to dim and you could barely open your eyes to see weird figures and bright shapes. The ray gun hadn't come with a manual so you weren't sure what was happening exactly. But one thing was certain and it was that the shack you were in was shaking violently, the walls compressing against some unknown force. Instinct told you to get out, but you weren't sure if that was even possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more seconds and the light began to fade rapidly. Bracing yourself you took another peek. </span></div></div>",

One moment you were hiding out in your apartment, too scared to go outside and gulping down plague medication like everybody else. The next, a masked assassin appears in your window and threatens you with a knife before tying you up and knocking you out. Now you found yourself bound and gagged on a chair in a dimly lit room with your prison guard staring intently at you from the shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for this.\" Eventually after moments of silence the masked man spoke. \"But I can't just test this on myself you see. It's unfortunate you were in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man walked forward, letting the dim light from above shine on his face. Now that he was closer you could see he still had his mask, a white and grey metal contraption shaped like a skull. He was dressed in a dark hooded grey cloak and wore an utility belt filled with dangerous looking weapons. In one hand he held a knife. In the other was a glowing glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just cut to the chase then.\" The masked man raised his gloved hand at you. \"You may have heard of me. Corvo Attano. And today you're my test subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can react a bright beam shot out from the glove as magic suddenly engulfed you. Unable to see through the light you struggle against the chair, making loud muffling sounds as you bit on the dirty rag in your mouth. Something was definitely happening and there was nothing you could do. The question was, what exactly was going on.</span></div></div>",

Firstly you notice that the gag and ropes are gone and you're able to move your hands freely. Secondly you realize you've been transported somewhere. The world around you looks completely different, filled with vast colorful shapes of large sizes-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wait. It couldn't be. As you looked around you realized something. The colors were familiar, the shapes as well. You haven't been transported to another world. No, you were still in the same place, the same dark room. The only thing was, you had shrunk. Either that or everything around you had grown to titanic sizes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's not a lot of time for you to react and your vision is quite blurry trying to adjust to the new view. A loud voice mutters something and you realize it must have been Corvo, even though you can't see him. \"Where the hell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was what Corvo meant by experiment. He had shrunk you and you had no idea what was coming up next. Lucky for you though it seemed that Corvo had lost track of you during the process, probably a result of the poor lighting. Lucky you.

I had no combat experience at the time, so I was placed in both the Intel and R&amp;D teams instead, seeing as how those were my previous strong suits. The fact they were willing to hire me seemed kinda miraculous in it of itself, but the fact they placed me in positions in which I could provide support to those out there in the field seemed almost deliberate. Even so, I valued my posts like they were the most valuable sets of jewelry, especially when I was given the opportunity to aid the man himself, Solid Snake, on his missions. Ever since I first caught wind of this guy's feats and accomplishments, the only job I could've ever wished for was to assist him any way I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I wasn't busy sending out information or providing feedback to my comrades, I'd often pay a visit to Dr.Emmerich's workshop to help out on whatever new equipment his eccentric mind could come up with. It went pretty good for awhile, but...I distinctly remember this one \" stand-out\" moment that nearly got me dismissed from Philanthropy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fairly busy morning at base, seeing as how Snake had just announced his eventual boarding of some tanker in a few days. In order to prepare for this mission, several of our R&amp;D members, including Dr.Emmerich and myself, went full force into creating some new gadgets for the mission. A lot of them failed miserably, but there were a few which earned Snake's consideration. One of which was a special device which could alter the user's size from average to ginormous or minute. At first I thought it was a joke, but then I actually thought of it as a legitimately useful piece of equipment in terms of a battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Think about it, a soldier could become small enough to easily sneak past enemy troops or large enough to tower through all of their obstacles.\" was my argument to have it used during the mission. Snake, however, was very skeptical and wished to try out it's effectiveness on himself. I was chosen to perform this task, despite me not making it. But, I ultimately caved in and decided to head out to the helipad to test it. Snake simply stood directly in front of me as my hands shivered in fear of messing this up somehow. I twisted the knob and aimed at Snake...</span></div></div>",

Within a matter of a few seconds Commander Snake had grown just as tall, if not more, as the two story helipad that towered over those of us stationed there ! The test seemed like a rousing success, well, to all except our commander of course. \" This is ridiculous.\" he muttered in his raspy voice \" Soldiers like us shouldn't be using this sort of equipment in our field of work. You, whatever your name is, shrink me back to normal size ! I've got a word to have with you and Otacon. Well, do it already !\". Fumbling around with the various knobs and buttons strewn about on the device, I ultimately found the correct set of frequencies and blasted at Snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everyone's seeming disappointment, our commander slowly shrunk back to his average state before dragging me by the arm to his quarters, hollering at both me and Dr.Emmerich as we made our way along the gray brick road to his own lair of Oz. By the time we finally reached our destination, Snake had already given Dr.Emmerich a piece of his mind and I was next in line. Once the door we were always warned about entering finally opened, I was pushed to a rickety computer chair while Commander Snake sat in front of me. \" Listen,\"he steadily began \" We're stealth fighters, not full on commandos. This type of gadget really doesn't suit us. Hell, it doesn't suit any army ! But...I can see how you were ecstatic about the test being a success.\". With a subtle wink, I could already what he was about to bring up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It's not a secret to anyone here Y'know. Everybody, including me, have seen those pictures you have in that desk of yours. Not to mention we saw 'signs' of your...little obsession.\". A blush and quick wave of shame rushed through me so fast I couldn't even formulate a single correct sentence. \" I mean, as long as it doesn't interfere with our plans and your ability to give us support, I honestly don't mind. It's kinda odd, but that's coming from a man who fought against both a shaman and a telepath. Regardless, after our next small op in the next four hours or so is over, meet me at the helipad with that size changing device. I have a bit of a surprise for you.\". And with that, Commander Snake simply trotted away, leaving me in a wild state of embarrassment. I was excited, yet nervous for what was about to happen.</span></div></div>",

Weeks of adventuring, struggling through the frozen tundra with little more than a blanket to keep you company, you've finally arrived at the magnificent ice palace.  The palace that stored the sacred ice crystals. There were a little more than a myth prior to today, but now, they were within your grasp. At least, close to within your grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered the empty, reflective hall, you realize your last obstacle awaited you. Sitting in a grand throne of ice, directly opposite of you, across the room was a man decked in royal blue robes, had white frosted hair and piercing blue eyes. In one hand he carried a staff with shards of ice coming out of one end. In the other was a glowing mound of magic, blue and shimmering. It was the Crystal Remnant. Protector of the ice crystals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stared at you intently, eyes fixed on your body as he spoke. \"...A visitor? It has been decades, perhaps centuries since the last adventurer found their way here.\" The ice guardian shifted on his throne and beckoned you closer with a finger. \"Yes... you are quite valiant for braving the cold. But it was all for naught. I cannot allow you to have the powers of the crystals so easily adventurer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped, standing in front of the throne. Getting a better look at the man you saw he was quite handsome but his expression was cold and unnerving. His clothing was decorated with tiny shards of ice and his boots were a silver metal mix, no undoubtedly composed of the minerals trapped within the ice. A high blue collar covered the lower half of his face. Compared to you, he was dressed like royalty. Then again, you'd probably die without all the equipment you had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The power of the crystals can be yours...if you can withstand my power adventurer.\" </span></div></div>",

To your surprise, the guardian began expanding in size, his body and his throne increasing in massive overall. The ice guardian was turning himself into a giant! You were in awe and shock as you watched the transformation. So this was your final task, to fight a giant ice mage! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking more and more steps back you watched in horror as the crystal remnant expanded, laughing wickedly as he did.

Soon you had to tilt your head back to look wards, as the ice guardian's face rose higher and higher into the seemingly endless ceiling of the mystical palace. It wasn't long before you found yourself standing, shocked in front of the now massive giant, looking at his gigantic forum in suspense. If you were to fight someone of his stature, you'd surely be overpowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look in fear adventurer! Behold my power!\" The crystal remnant spoke loudly. As you looked up, you realized the guardian was many times your height. Judging by how you only came to barely half of his boots height, you estimated he was probably ten time your size. Sitting on his ice throne, the guardian was a sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you couldn't look on for long, for the battle had begun. To him, you were barely the size of his hand, and he was ready to take you down without even standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice guardian shifted his left leg and your attention was drawn to the massive steel crystal boots that towered before you.

Perhaps the most beautiful and magical of them all were the fairy nymphs, a tribe of flying creatures of all sizes, all extremely beautiful in appearance. Most of the tribe were women, with men being outnumbered one to ten. That was the reason men were greatly treasured. As soon as the men became of age they had to undergo a special rite of passage with the fairy king, a human with arcane magic that could control the mystical gems that the fairies needed to survive. As a man many of the fairies worshipped him and tended to his every need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just come of age, being one of the fortunate few to be born as a male fairy. Your gender made up for the fact that you were only a few inches tall. As with all other male fairies you had prepared for your rite of passage with the fairy king, whom you knew only as Meliai. Traditionally fairies wore decadent robes when they underwent the passage but you had chosen a simple outfit, a breezy shirt, loose fitting pants and a necklace with an tiny emerald in it, to signify your status. Once the rite of passage was completed, Meliai would replace the emerald with a gem of his choosing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you flew towards Meliai\u2019s throne room you began to feel nervous. The \u201cking\u201d housed himself in an extravagant chamber, sealed off from others during a fairy\u2019s rite of passage. Accompanying you was two ogre guards, both bigger than you that walked stupidly alongside your floating body, controlled by the king\u2019s magical gems. One of the guards looked at you as you approached the entrance of the throne room. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The king knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath you watched as the golden doors swung open to reveal a long red carpet. As you went in you heard the doors shut tightly behind you, locking you inside. As if he was ready for it, Meliai appeared in a blanket of purple smoke.<br>\r\n\u201cSo little one.

The dark haired king arched his back and flexed his muscles as his motions became frantic and your tiny body was soon being jammed furiously against his dick. By now your head was dizzy and you weren't sure what was happening but you loved every moment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another pump the king let out a loud grunt and thick white ropes shot out of his cock, striking him on his toned chest, abs and face. Much of the cum flowed to the side, coating his cock and your tiny body with his warm sticky cum. Meliai continued as he shot load after load, creamy white ribbons soon decorating his abs, his pants and completely covered his hand which was still gripping you tightly against his throbbing cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the eruption subsided Meliai felt his body radiate with heat, breathing heavy and feeling relived. Through gasping breaths he slowly released his grip on you, his sticky semen dripping from his massive cock and your body. You felt his hand move back and opened your eyes. Thick ropes of creamy cum dangled in strands from the king's cock and his hand, you holding onto his organ, the sticky substance holding you in place. Looking up you saw Meliai's grinning face, his sparkling eyes and his chest which was covered in lines of the white stuff. You couldn't believe how much he had cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeliai caught your gaze and scooped you up with his sticky hand. Looking at you he seemed pleased, as if seeing his work made him happy. Smiling he said...</span></div></div>",

What had caught your eye was the label - Size Transformation Manipulation Stock Ad 3. Could it change the size of whoever drunk it? Initially you had searched the casino for anything that gave information on the strange concoction, but many dead terminals and ghosts had kept many of the areas sealed. Still, something like this seemed pretty powerful, and it would help immensely in the wastelands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still...you had learned the hard way not to trust what you find, especially when it was from a dead casino littered with toxic fumes. But the temptation still called to you. The fascination of what the liquid was for and thoughts of what it would be like if you could change sizes at will. Sure the auto doc could get you facial surgery, but nothing like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. I'm...I'm still kind of worried though. Maybe you want to have a taste?

There didn't appear to be any cracks, and you couldn't see any traces of the telltale blood red mingling within the shades of purple. You were excited for the possibilities, but knew firsthand that ingesting <i>anything</i> from the Sierra Madre could result in a few hours of unconsciousness at best. And from the presence of several dozen corpses, death at the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you needed was a test subject, and luckily, there was one not 2 feet away from you. You weren't the best doctor, but you figured that at the very least, you would do better in the event of an emergency than Boone. The man was a hell of a spotter, but not exactly the smartest fella in the desert. You felt a pang of guilt over taking advantage of him like this, but if it actually worked, it'd make for a hell of a story to tell back at the Lucky 38.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Boone... maybe you could make better use of this.\" You stepped over to him and passed the vial into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA raised eyebrow was all the response that the sniper elicited, \"Me? What the hell could I do with... \"Size Transformation Mani-pu-lation Stock Ad 3?\" He'd leaned in to get a better look, squinting to read the small handwriting that'd been scribbled on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, you were stumped. While you could justify a size alternating formula for your personal use as being useful for stealth missions, it was hard to use such reasoning on Boone. What use would a sniper who can't even hold his rifle be? Of course, if he grew large enough, he wouldn't need a rifle anymore, he could just use his size to intimidate any potential threats or flat out crush them if that failed. The idea of a giant Boone towering over New Vegas was quite appealing indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it would be better to have a guinea pig test it out first,\" you said with a smirk, \"And you were the first person who came to mind, congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks,\" he replied, flipping you off with his free hand before removing the cork with a small, 'pop!' He glanced once more at you, then turned back to the vial and raised its contents to his lips. A grimace told you that the scent wasn't pleasant and with a quick flourish, he chugged the entire vial in one gulp. He stuck out his tongue in mock displeasure and you could see that it'd been dyed a deep purple, the same colour as the liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood with intense anticipation, fists clenched at your sides as you tried to hide your excitement. You hadn't counted on him drinking the entire thing, but knew that it was probably his way of getting you back for making him take it in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you stood in an awkward silence as several minutes went by.

Sure you had medical experience but who knows what kind of disease was ridden in the-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-AH!

The only thing was, even though he was kneeling over, the top of his head matched yours completely. It was working! Frantically you scrambled backwards, taking yourself as far from the danger zone as possible, but you didn't get far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud yell and a surge of growth Boone stood up, his firsts clenched tightly on either side, his feet in a firm standing position. At his new height he was probably almost half as tall as he was before and he showed no signs of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling backwards you stared, jaw dropped as he expanded rapidly, his head shooting upwards, far into the sky. His massive legs and feet expanded forwards and sideways and you soon found yourself in a safe spot to watch the spectacle as both of his assault boots became massive walls on either side of you, trapping you between the open area in between. Looking up you followed the path that was his legs, upwards Boone's crotch and all the way across his chest and his head, now many many feet above you. It was Boone alright, except now he was the size of a massive statue, possibly taller than many of New Vegas' three story casinos and from what you could see, Boone's eyes were still clenched shut and his arms were still flexed tightly.
