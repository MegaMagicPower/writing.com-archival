You blink. <i>Who the heck is that?</i> you think. You couldn't remember Stephan saying anything about having a cousin... or a little brother... or that anyone was coming over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown and look from Stephan to the little boy. Bile is rising in your throat as you stare at Stephan, and you quickly turn away. The little boy looks to be about 8 or 9, wearing blue plaid pajamas. His eyes were wide open in fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grew up with 6 brothers, 4 of them being younger, so your heart went out to the boy. Trying not to gaze at Stephan's body, you start slowly toward the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there.\" You say softly. The little boy just stares at you. \"Hey... what's your name? What are you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, just as you'd skirted Stephan's body, fire lit the little boy's eyes. With a wild scream, the little boy launched himself at you. A flash caught the corner of your eye. A knife! How'd he get a hold of that? Then you saw that the biggest knife was missing from the holder. Fear clutched your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned and ran into the living room, slipping on Stephan's blood. The little boy was still screaming, and as you realize you hit a dead end, you weren't sure what to do. Your eyes lingered on the old rifle above the big T.V. You turn to the boy, his eyes filled with some dark emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you disarm the boy? Should you run? Or should you grab the gun and find out what the heck's going on?!</span></div></div>",

Looking around, you pick up a chair from the dining table and launch it at the huge living room window. With a giant crack and a loud shatter, the chair and what was left of the glass fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy seemed to be surprised by that and had stopped momentarily. Taking advantage of it, you rip off the curtains (which were the ones your grandmother made for you), wrap them around both your hands and lean over the edge of the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. Bile rose for the second time that night in your throat as you stare down the 3 stories of your apartment to the ground. Your eyes blurred momentarily, and you shook it away. You had precious little time to figure out how to get down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you look for a fire ladder, then realize it's on the other end of the apartment. Ooh! Just your luck, someone had thrown out a mattress. It was perched on the dumpster, at an angle that you might be able to hit and roll off without getting hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething nicked your back and you yelp, jumping to the right just as the knife struck a window and held. You look at the boy. He had grabbed your whole casing of knives, and since you were interested in cooking, that was a lot. Your back stung terribly, and you saw a small knife on the ground, covered with <i>your blood</i>. Luckily it wasn't very deep, and that the knife had only scraped across the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping for the best, you launch over the edge. For a few seconds, there's nothing but air. Then, the air gets knocked out of you as you hit the mattress, rolling off to hit the ground on your back before you can stop. You groan as the alley's dirt digs into the wound on your back. Opening your eyes, you see the little boy's head disappear from the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider your options. Should you go back into the apartment and try getting someone on the lower floor to let you use their phone? Or should you try walking to the police station? It wasn't too far, if you remember correctly. Or maybe you should go to the hospital. That way you can alert them to the boy and Stephan, and get the police at the same time (as well as get something for your back). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all those options may mean that the little boy will be gone when someone gets there. And the fact someone may go in there and think YOU did it. But there was no choice, you couldn't go up there alone, and even with a bunch of your neighbors it might not do any good.</span></div></div>",
