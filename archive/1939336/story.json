You roll over, smacking your lips, but realize you need to get up; you have school in a little more than one hour and you can't afford to sleep in anymore. Swinging your legs over the bed, you slowly stand up, your vision blurry and your head groggy. You were never much of a morning person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly making your way into the bathroom, you turn on the water and step into the shower, your head clouded. You were never usually good to start taking on the morning until after your shower, and the water felt cool and refreshing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea you were about to get the surprise of your life.

Head to toe, you're covered with the stuff. your hands and feet, too, look more like paws, and you gradually become aware of a tail hitting your legs. Quickly, you shut off the water and leap out of the shower, rushing over to the bathroom mirror, still dripping all over the countertops and floor.

Those were your eyes, but everything else was... wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of the whole hairiness thing, your ears were tiny little bumps. Your nose was flat and black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth felt weird as it was now pulled forward into an animal muzzle. You moved your tongue around in your mouth and recoiled as your teeth felt like needles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOtter,\u201d you said in flat disbelief. You looked like a sea otter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt heavy with the water soaked in your... fur. You scratched at it with the short, blunt... claws where your fingernails should be. The pelt was so thick you couldn\u2019t feel all the way to the skin underneath. It looked the same color as your hair. Maybe a little sandier, but still definitely blond. Is there such a thing as a blond otter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, calm down, you thought to yourself as to took a few deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d spent more time than you\u2019d care to admit thinking about what would you\u2019d do if were an anthro, so this shouldn\u2019t be too shocking; even if that was just fantasy and this clearly wasn\u2019t. Plus, you\u2019d always wanted to be something cool, like a wolf, not those things that swim on their back at the aquarium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Your hands barely looked like hands. Thick webbing connected your fingers together up to about the first knuckle, making your digits look look like cute little nubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, that was the that could be used to describe all of you: cute. You hate cute. With your tiny ears, big black  triangle of a nose and plush pelt you looked like a giant stuffed animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like that plan to get a tattoo when you graduated was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrinkled your brow and curled your thin lips into a fierce sneer, showing dozens of small pointy teeth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nope, still adorable. Dammit!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysically, you look to be about the same height at around 5\u20199\u201d, but definitely in better shape. Round shoulders and a wider back give you the lithe build of an olympic swimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Makes sense.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud pounding on the door made you jump into the air and emit a little surprised squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesse? Are you in there?\u201d Your dad\u2019s voice echoed from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinish up and get dressed. Dinner\u2019s almost ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind raced as the real implications of your inexplicable transformation hit you. How do you explain this? You can\u2019t! How will they react? Will they freak out?! Will you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... okay, I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run your towel roughly over your body, trying to work the moisture out of your thick fur. This leaves you looking like an adorable ball of fluff (<i>raaaaah</i>!)that you struggle to smooth down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to dry off your tail,\u201d your dad\u2019s voice called from a few steps down the hall. \u201cYou know how your mother hates it when you get the carpet wet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze. That sentence soothed your anxiety some, only to raise all sort of new questions. Does that mean everyone somehow knew you were an otter? How? Does that mean everyone else was a furry too? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe board shorts you were wearing before were still laying rumpled on the bathroom floor, but now had a slit in back that someone, presumably Mom, had lovingly sewn into a tail hole. It took some fiddling, but you got them on easily enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour t-shirt, on the other... hand had been replaced with a baggy Hawaiian shirt that you only buttoned up part way to avoid being too tight on your pelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou poked your head out the door looking for any other family members. Turning to look down the other end of the hall, got another start (and squeak) when you found yourself eye to eye with Kira, your older (and completely normal human) sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Kira said coldly as she walked away down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay</i>, you thought to yourself. Kira\u2019s still human, but she\u2019s not freaked out that you\u2019re not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up. Everyone\u2019s dinner is going to be cold waiting on you,\u201d she said as she kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Weird. Wonder what\u2019s got her in such a bad mood.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked down the hall to the dining room as nonchalantly as a boy who\u2019d just been turned into a giant anthropomorphic sea otter could be. Looking at the numerous family photos that lined the walls  you saw one glaring difference; you weren't in any of them! You lean in to look closer. The shots and poses look the same as you remember, you\u2019re just... not there; human or otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the hall, you finally find one picture with you in it; the newest one on the wall from last Christmas. The whole family was piled around a grinning otterboy wearing an ill-fitting santa hat that was slipping over his tiny ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dammit! I hate cute!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dining room looked the same, except the tall, stiff chair where you normally sit was missing its back. You took the cue and sat down, trying to act natural while avoiding sitting on your tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about the say something to break the tension and maybe get a hint as to what the holy hell is actually going on, when your nose was hit by the most amazing smell you\u2019d ever experienced. You closed your eyes to better focus on your enhanced sense of smell and the amazing aroma coming from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful, hon. It\u2019s still pretty hot,\u201d your Mom said as she set a whole cooked trout down in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your tail wiggling behind you in excitement. The notion that you don't usually care for fish evaporated as you couldn't keep from drooling and wanted nothing more than to tear into this magnificent meal. Except for one thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cum... can I get a fork?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour blank faces stare back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another couple seconds before Mom broke the silence.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you can, dear,\u201d she said handing you a spare fork.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that for as resistant as you've been in the past, we\u2019d sorta given up on that. I\u2019m proud of you,\u201d Mom said as she kissed your forehead and gave your ear a scritch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s good to remember priorities. Sure you may have taken the form of a humanoid bipedal sea otter, and have no explanation why or how your family doesn't find this odd, but dammit that trout was amazing. And it\u2019s hard to have an existential crisis with a full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fork <i>was </i>a bit of challenge with the webbing and such. You could see why you\u2019d avoided them in the past... the past you don\u2019t remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira still shot you the occasional angry glance at dinner. Need to figure out what that\u2019s all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, you spent an hour or so playing videogames with your little brother Andy, who unlike Kira, was thrilled to spend time with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe controller was awkward in your new webbed... let\u2019s face it, paws, but you still managed to put your little brother in his digital; place before dad came in and sent Andy off to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, furball. You too,\" Dad said turning to you. \"You've got a big day ahead of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow is:</span></div></div>",

Eventually you find you can move again and you examine each section of your body with curiosity and confusion. \"Fu.. fur?\" You look back up into the mirror. \"E-ears?\" This is impossible.. isn't it? You can't help but slip from confusion to anguish at the thought of being.. this. \"I've red.. I have fur all over.. an-and claws..\" You stare into the mirror, darting from one of the fox's eyes to the other as they grow wet. \"I'm a fox.. a fuck'n fox..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You glance back into your bedroom and see your lopsided alarm clock. It's 6:27 in the morning.

Your cereal is getting soggy!\" Your mother interrupts your thoughts with her morning checkup. You scramble faster than thought possible for something to reply. Mom certainly wouldn't like you to be asleep; fur or skin. \"I'm up, but I don't think I can go.. I've got some serious bowel problems!\" You regret what you said, but why? \"Alright, but I expect you to make it up. You've got a quiz Friday!\" She yells back. Wait, quiz? \"I had written that down yesterday.. I guess that means my body is the only thing that changed. But how..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You look downwards and saw something you <i>knew</i> wasn't there yesterday. \"My.. my dick..\" Your underwear used to cover it completely even when erect, but you've aquired a new red rocket that peeks <i>past</i> your waist band and almost reaches your belly button! You try to pull your underwear over it, but it reaches stretching point and only succeeds to make you erect further by rubbing against your furry balls.. \"Unnh.. um..\" You always did have a thing for furries, and you were kind of weirded out by the shape of a human penis, but this was unexpected and among all the thoughts bouncing around in your head you weren't sure if you should touch it or not.. after all, you know it feels better with this new equipment and you might make some noise!

You weren't like this yesterday, after all.. right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You shake it off and give a last reassurance that you weren't always like this. You can't afford to lose yourself to this if there could be a reversable.. thing.. to change you back! But maybe you don't want to change back.. <i>Argh!</i> You exclaim gruffly at your weak will. How can you lose yourself from humanity? But..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No,\" you say to yourself. Further thought is not an option. You walk back to your bed, and fix the position of your clock. \"6:49,\" you read aloud, yawning while doing so, but you whine towards the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Grabbing your mouth - muzzle, rather, - in surprise, you feel immense shame and roll over onto your bed and hug your spare pillow. \"I didn't ask for this,\" you say in a breaking voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Knock knock*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your eyes snap open, and you wipe your tears from your face, even though your fur has damp lines from where the tears have collected. \"Sweetheart, are you okay?\" your mother asks tenderly. You feel anguish just trying to reply to her. \"N-not really..\" \"Do I need to come give you medicine?\" She really does care for you, doesn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You are about to reply when an unexpected instinct kicks in, causing your vulpine sheath to bulge. <i>What the fuck, brain?!</i> You can't believe the perverted way your body just received your mother's affection. You want to <i>breed</i> with her! You sigh in anguish. \"Honey, I'm coming in, I know there's something wrong and it's NOT your intestines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You surge with adrenaline as the doorknob clicks and your red headed mother enters. \"Uh.. but..\" It's too late as your mother is already standing in the room, slowly walking toward you. You are filled with surprise as your mother nonchalantly sits down next to you and places her hand on your shoulder. \"What's wrong, honey?\" She asks with compassion. \"What's wrong?!\" You exclaim, voice cracking under both emotional and deepened stress. \"I'm a f.. I'm a fox.\" You stammer, hugging the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-well.. haven't you always been like this?\" She asks in a confused tone. \"NO!\" You bark violently in anger. She backs up slightly, and you regret your response. \"No.. at least.. I don't think I have.\" She hugs you and kisses your (at least, what you propose to be) cheek. \"Honey, please explain to me what you mean, because I definitely remember you being like this all of your life. Just because you were born into a family of humans doesn't mean you're not normal! I mean, sure, as far as we know you're the only one of your kind in the world, but hey, maybe some day you'll find someone like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm the only one of my kind..?\" You ask with anguish. \"But.. I was human yesterday.. I remember it! I was human all of my life, and then this morning, I was..\" You stop short, before looking your mom straight in the face. \"You've got to believe me, mom. I was human. I had a human girlfriend, and I had normal human friends that we had human fun with. You may remember me as being a fox, but I don't! I just woke up as one!\" Your mom stares at you with an unsure face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Please.. please, Mom!

You give it a few strokes with your furry paw beforehand to make it fully erect. \"Unnnhh...\" you moan as the silky fur, paw pads, and the new sensitive surface of your penis give three times the sensation of when you were human. You can barely hold back as you lean closer toward your rock hard vulpine cock and give it a tentative lick, sending shudders all the way to your tail. You can't hold back any longer and buck your pelvis fully into your mouth while leaning your head all the way down, effectively deepthroating yourself with your constantly throbbing dick. You roll your tongue all around the smooth surface while your furry balls contract. You tease your urethra with the tip of your tongue as precum flows out as you suck your dick with all the strength you can gather while shuddering in ecstasy. You moan deeply, barely remembering someone might hear you as your prostate clenches tightly and hot fox semen shoots into your mouth. You swallow every drop, while making sensual contact with your cock all the while drawing even higher amounts of cum into your mouth. You finally finish swallowing and pull your muzzle off slowly, yipping as the sensitive tip leaves your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You sit warmly, wafting in the afterglow of intense sex, only with yourself. You suddenly jump up and remember that you could be late for school, you're a fox now, and you haven't left the room once. You scramble to pull your clothes on and struggle with every step as your penis rubs back and forth under your shorts' waistline. You grab a shirt to guarantee coverage of the waistline since your penis peeks well above your shorts to your belly button. You worry about what your family might say, or what might happen at school. You slowly open your bedroom door with 8 minutes left before school. You..</span></div></div>",

Hundreds of questions quickly overflow in your head before your mother adds on, \"God forbid that happens again.\" What? <i>Okay, I don't remember that ever happening..</i> You come to the frightening conclusion that your past has changed as well as your species! Your mind races, and your anxiety reaches to a critical level and your nervous stomach takes its toll. You clutch your stomach and collapse into the bathroom and you vomit nothing the first time, and the second time catches you off guard and part makes it up your nose and into the toilet. \"God wh-\" you uncontrollably wheeze as your stomach clenches one last time and you swear you pulled a muscle somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You panic when you hear the bedroom door open and your mom rushes into your bathroom. \"Oh my God, Jesse..\" She rushes over and sees you hunched over yourself coughing.

You don't want her to worry, but she might send you to school then, and you don't want to leave her either. Although your stomach usually isn't so sensitive, it may be because you didn't eat; a similar incident happened as a child when you didn't eat all morning and you puked at the mall. Memories of your mother taking care of you as a child play in your head, but you are only able to see yourself as a fox and your member erects itself fully in your jeans. It's even more of a bother right now because it's so much more sensitive than when it was human like, and it's much longer - the very thought causes it to contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All of these things seem to keep you from choosing to stay or go, but after a few minutes you ultimately decide to:</span></div></div>",

You struggle upwards, trying to stand up straight and slowly waddle toward the mirror. \"What's happened to me..?\" You take a look at your hands and find they aren't quite hands anymore. You fondle your new pointed ears for a moment and then drop your hands to your side roughly. \"I'm a wolf..\" You shudder with excitement and small amounts of fear. \"I'm..a wolf. Hahah. Hahahaha..\" Your brain feels fried. \"I was a human yesterday. Now I'm a wolf. Hehehe. Hehe. Heheh heh.. hmph..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After your emotional episode ends, you examine your body closer. \"I can still speak with my mouth.. and I'm walking upright..\" Does it get any weirder than this? You try not to think about that too hard. Well, might as well dry yourself off and get some clothes on before you're late; under the circumstances, you think it would be best to be ready for school; fur pelt or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You feel like every movement is in somebody else's body, and you can't help brood over your situation. Your claws feel like you need to be careful when you even go to open doors. Your skin feels warm <i>all the time</i>, though you're thankful you're still warm blooded. You pull on your white tee with blue sleeves. You find that it presses evenly against your gut and outlines several muscles that aren't as visible with your fur covering them. \"Do I even need a shirt?\" You chuckle to yourself. You pull your blue jeans up and button them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You would probably be on the higher end of appearences; some might even call you handsome. You find there's a hole in the back of your jeans for your tail, though you can't ever remember putting a hole there.. You realize that your body may not have been the only thing that's changed! You quickly jump up and turn on your PC. You have nothing to do with humans on there. You distinctly remember having some articles of porn on there that had people in them! Has your whole LIFE changed? You find yourself aroused by the porn you <i>had</i> glimpsed at and quickly shut off the computer. You remember learning a long time ago that wolves had different anatomy than humans genital wise. \"Oh shit..\" You look down and see that, even while you were standing up straight with jeans and a shirt, you could see the entire tip of your canine penis peering over your waist band! \"Am I th-that huge?\" You brush a clawed finger along the tip and your whole body convulses with pleasure, only to bring your penis to full erectness. \"I don't even have to unbutton my pants to look at it now.. what am I going to do?\" You find that having a large (not to mention more sensitive) penis is more trouble than it's worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You readjust your lopsided alarm clock and check the time. \"Just enough time to eat breakfast..\" You turn around and walk to your bedroom door and try to work up enough courage to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Click-creeeak*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your door agonizingly creaks open as you walk into the hallway and head slowly to the stairway. You take the first step slowly, then walk downstairs a little faster. You realize on the way down that you're not wearing shoes, but it feels just like it. \"I guess that's a plus,\" you say slightly depressingly. You reach the bottom and head for the dining room table, and the rest of the family is sitting at the table. \"Looks like you finally made it in here,\" your mother says, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh.. yeah..\" you reply awkwardly. You sit down and scan the family and find they don't appear freaked out at all! \"You're not.. you don't think that..\" You stop short and catch a heavenly scent directly in front of you. Raw steak? Yuck! But.. it smells.. so goood.. \"Um.. I don't have any utensils.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You see that the rest of the family appears to have stopped. <i>Oh, so you freak out about something normal.</i> \"May I <i>please</i> have a fork and knife?\" You ask, wondering what the big deal is. \"Um.. sure, sweetheart. It's just that you've always refused utensils, so we'd sort of given up on trying to get you to use them. I'm really proud of you, though.\" She hands you her knife and gets you one of the forks from the kitchen. \"Thanks, I appreciate it,\" you say, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You know you didn't want them to freak out about you being a wolf, but it's still kind of scary that they didn't. It's like you've always been one.. especially considering your porn tastes have changed species, and your mother tells of you not using utensils- which you know you've used before! Something's definitely wrong, and your past seems to have changed aside from not being you anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you question the family about it, or put it off for the meantime?</span></div></div>",

I look around, and then squint and groan in frustration as my eyes seem to refuse to focus through my glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My eyes, again, go wide as I hear my voice. It\u2019s a little huskier now, and a bit deeper than I seem to remember. I move my arms around under the covers. It feels like there\u2019s a scalp of hair on them, or a feeling similar to shag rug, yet thinner. Only I can feel it. I suppose the only way to describe it is like a fur pelt, only it\u2019s mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It turns out, that\u2019s exactly what it is, as I find out when I bring my clawed, furred hand to my face \u2013 before promptly bumping it on my nose, which now sticks out unbelievably far from my eyes. I slip my glasses off, seeing as they no longer fit well upon my new, apparent muzzle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I find that I have perfect vision with my glasses off, which is definitely not something I remember from yesterday.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u201d I think aloud to myself. None of this is what I remember from yesterday. For a moment my mind drifts to why I was sleeping with my glasses on in the first place, but I have to snap myself back to reality and remind myself that is the least of my worries at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJesse, UP!\u201d I hear my mom call out from the hall. I tense up, expecting her to open the door right away. My brain is more than ready to start scrambling for an explanation, or dive under the covers, but I hear her continue past the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In <i>detail.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I realized I was hearing much better than before, as well. My paws go to my ears, only to find a flat furred area. My blood runs cold as my paws travel upwards, reflexively jumping back as they reach the base of\u2026 soft, cone-like, furred ears. Resting atop my head.<br>\r\nI feel another presence curl up around me, attempting to go between my legs as I sit up on my mattress. I look down and find a black, furry tail, with tan running along the bottom. I stand up in shock as it successfully curls under me, though I quickly become distracted and my eyes dart down to my feet.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My feet are completely digitigrade, looking mostly like paws, but retaining some human foot dexterity. They are covered in the same tan/black mix of fur as, apparently, the rest of my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I moan unexpectedly out of pleasure as I run a paw over my abs, and I feel a strong tingle in my crotch area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHuh?\u201d I croon apprehensively, looking down. I start feeling a slight urge to pant, and what meets my eyes is unbelievable.<br>\r\nI have a canine sheath connected to my belly for about six inches, and two large balls underneath that must have been close to the size of tennis balls. All covered in tan fur.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What then catches my eye is the red tip poking out from the top of the sheath. I move my paw closer to it, before running a claw against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGnh..!\u201d I\u2019m shocked with pleasure up and down my spine. The tip quickly surges upward, followed by an inch\u2026 no, two inches\u2026 three, now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inches of canine cock flow from my sheath until finally stopping at a good eight inches long. It stands deep red and throbbing, and I notice myself beginning to pant now. The more I think of how good it felt to touch it, the more it throbs, sending my tail wagging vigorously. I notice a large bulge in my sheath now, and my curious paw runs down toward it, grasping it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I groan, feeling as though I were cumming right there, but the feeling ebbs rather than intensifying. I still feel a long way from even being close to orgasm, though, and a rush of pleasure runs through me as I revel in my new libido and sensitivity.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I tug at the sheath as it finally stretches over the knot, bunching up under it, causing me to moan a little as a drop of precum oozes out from the pointed tip. My cock is now fully erect at 9 inches long, and I\u2019m practically drooling right over it as my paw moves back up to grasp my knot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJesse! Are you even awake yet?!\u201d Forgetting my lust, I jump, startled, as I hear my mom call out again from what seems like right outside. I quickly dart over, locking my door, inwardly sighing as she attempts to turn the knob from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, mom, I\u2019m up. Just getting dressed,\u201d I reply, stepping back from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My cock accidentally bumps against my lower chest, eliciting a barely held in moan from me as I fall back sitting on the covers, gripping them tightly. I barely hear my mom\u2019s reply as my sensitive balls rub against my fuzzy legs and the sheets, further stimulating my thick rod, now relentlessly dribbling precum. I even feel the hot fluid\u2019s caress down the underside of my member, stimulating my fuzzy, sensitive scrotum. I buck my hips hard into the air involuntarily, so badly wanting to fuck. My eyes finally uncross, staring at my aching, swollen knot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2026 the hell\u2026\u201d I whisper, panting. I feel unbelievably horny. I know I\u2019m not supposed to be some dog, but it just feels so good. Canine musk permeates the air around me, and the more I breathe it in the more my cock throbs. My paw starts to gravitate toward my moist, canine rod, trembling in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My cock continues to ooze precum and I have to force my eyes away to avoid jacking off wildly. I grip the sheets tightly, avoiding humping the air and moaning loudly, as wonderful as that would feel. Finally, the wave passes a little, and I manage to stand up, panting heavily. My cock is still as hard as a rock and peeking very well above my navel. I feel as though if I breathe in any more of the musk I might cum just from smelling it. My body seriously considers doing so, as I feel my prostate threaten to contract, and I can't hold back a lustful moan. I stumble to the bathroom, the sink in my sights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I stop walking and lean against the door frame, biting my lip. Every inch of me is on fire with absolute pleasure. I gasp, realizing I had begun to rub my abs again.

I finally reach the sink, and I urgently twist the cold handle. The water sprays out of the faucet quickly, and I bring my paws to the water, gasping in relief at a feeling other than intense lust. I cup them as best I can under the stream of water and bring it over my muzzle, inwardly sighing as the fiery lust ebbs away, and I calm down. I continue to rinse my face as I feel my cock retreat into my sheath. I sigh aloud, turning the faucet off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat the hell <i>was</i> that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shake my head free of water, when suddenly I feel the shake intensify and travel down my spine, my whole body twisting back and forth in waves. Before I even know it, I find myself standing there looking at a mirror now covered in drops of water, and the rest of the bathroom likewise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sigh. I hadn't really gotten the time to think about this very much. I admit to myself I do have some interest in what was called 'furry', or anthro, and that I did spend more time than I'd like to admit thinking about what I'd do if this were to happen, but this... this is impossible... isn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wipe my paws on a towel, beginning to think. How could this have possibly happened? Am I hallucinating? No, that lust was too powerful. This is too surreal to be some dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I...

Breakfast, <i>now!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I jump again, a bit more sober and less drunk off of desire. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201d I call out, rushing out of the bathroom and over to my dresser. I throw on a white undershirt, and then a blue polo that seems to fit me a little bit tighter now. I also pull on some boxer briefs and blue jeans, and I breathe in sharply as one of the shirts is run over my chest as I twist, rubbing against my nipples. I feel my sheath threaten to swell, and I have to stand up and breathe. I thank the higher powers under my breath as I feel myself settle down. I resolved to think as non-sexy of things as possible throughout the day; I couldn\u2019t imagine what might happen if I popped one in public or in front of my family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I stopped. My family? Do they know about this? Should I just walk out and show them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cKiddo, if you ain\u2019t been up already, there\u2019s not time for a shower. You know how long it takes to dry your fur,\u201d I hear my mom call out one last time. I completely froze. Fur? She couldn't be referring to body hair even if she <i>didn't</i> know; I was a pretty bare teen from what I remembered. I'd hoped, before, that one day I'd be at <i>least</i> somewhat hairy, but this much was a bit ridiculous! That aside, I resolve that whether or not she does know, she will in a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cM\u2019kay, ma,\u201d I reply, now looking for my shoes. I can't find them anywhere, and soon I find my sock drawer is empty of socks! I shake my head incredulously and give up, realizing my feet wouldn't be able to fit any kind of human shoe. I resolve to go bare-pawed, since my pads seem to be just as effective as rubber soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grasp the lock and twist it before doing the same to the knob, and I pull the door open, sticking my head out into the hallway. I open the door further and tentatively place one paw after another into the hall\u2019s carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlright... I\u2019m out,\u201d I called out, eying the doors to the other bedrooms left open. I closed my door behind me, and turned left, heading toward the hall door. I could see down the living room and into the dining room that they had begun eating already. I glanced at the clock above the doorway into the dining room that it was about seven in the morning. I took in a deep breath and walked forward, wincing as my dark black claws clicked against the floor noisily, echoing a little in the large living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As I grow closer, I see my brother, Andy, who is eating a bowl of cereal, look up at me and grin. I continue forward and my mom, without looking up, greets me. \u201cMorning, kiddo. Looks like you finally got your fuzzy arse up.\u201d My sister, Kira, glares at me from her phone for a moment, before returning her eyes to her device. Something\u2019s up her ass, whatever it may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before I can really think on it, my dad pipes up, \u201cSo, you ready for the big day today?\u201d I knit my eyebrows in confusion, pulling out a chair a bit cautiously. \u201cBig day?\u201d I ask, unsure. Kira scoffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOf course you\u2019d forget. We all know what you\u2019ve been doing in your room all morning,\u201d she says condescendingly. I feel my hackles raise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d I ask, standing out from my chair. \u201c<i>Kira,</i>\u201d my mom reprimands sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, it\u2019s so like you to take his side, mom! And you know full well what I'm talking about! Of course you wouldn\u2019t care about something you\u2019ve helped out with <i>zero</i> percent, and you\u2019d rather stay in your room all day <i>jacking off!</i>\u201d Kira stands up sharply, walking around the table and right past me, toward the hallway and presumably to her room. A door slams shut. What the hell was she talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMom, what\u2019s jacking off?\u201d My brother asks, basically broadcasting his innocence, despite the lately increased amount of zits on his face and slightly low-pitched voice. I wince inwardly. My mom sighs, putting her hand up to signify \u2019not now.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I take a seat, adjusting my tail through the bars of the wooden chair. \u201cMom, what\u2019s Kira talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighs again. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken surprisingly well to Kira this morning,\u201d she comments. Did she and I seriously have that bad a relationship? \u201cHaven\u2019t I told you?\u201d She asks tiredly. I shake my head, though she may have actually told me before. \u201cShe\u2019s jealous of you and thinks you should be doing more work, but I've explained to her before that you\u2019ve been working hard enough at school already. I think I have, anyway...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Huh. I don't remember that from... anything. Kira and I always had a good sibling relationship. I feel my ears lower a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My dad pipes up, noticing my mildly crestfallen appearance. \u201cAw, don\u2019t feel too bad. You should have plenty of fun, since...\u201d</span></div></div>",

The one thing that catches your eye the most is your huge dick now more of resembling a horse penis exept that it hangs out of its sheath six inches and below that are your grapefruit size ball. Wondering if this is just dream you pinch your self and to your disappointment it hurts. As you wonder what to do you start to examine your new form by seeing if water stays in your coat or how easily you hide your tail and main, after you do a few other things you look lower and feel how heavy your balls are seeing how they do have some weight you quickly go to your room and lock the door and put some underwear on to see that they fit but have a vary noticeable bulge. After that you wonder how big you actually are so you pull your underwear down and start to gently rub your already impressive dick, you start to get hotter and feel your shlong get bigger and extend as you rub it faster. After a few minutes you get fully hard having your horse cock be about 24\" and as thick as a soda can maybe more.

Just sitting\u2014no\u2014looming over the kitchen table, was a massive bear. You wanted to scream, but no one else seemed phased in the slightest. Your brother and sister were sitting at the same table casually chatting, your mom was up and cooking, and the bear was\u2026 wearing business clothes, reading a newspaper, sitting exactly where your dad always sat every morning. Even sitting it was taller than you. And it was looking right at you. Looking <i>down</i> at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028\u2028\u201cI said, \u2018good morning,\u2019 Jesse,\u201d the bear rumbled with a warm smirk. The voice was deep with a rich rumbling timbre, but you could recognize the cadence and inflection your Dad always had, and even though it was absolutely definitely a bear, it\u2019s grizzled furry face still resembled the man from your memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028\u2028\u201cGood\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d you have to clear your throat, eyes still frozen on what your animal instincts were telling you to get the hell away from <i>right now</i>. \u201cGood morning.\u201d This seemed to satisfy the enormous bruin, who smiled and polished off an huge sausage still speared with his fork. You watched as his large snout opened, broad tongue extending, a glint of huge fangs, before it snapped shut around the helpless piece of meat.\u2028\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, dear,\u201d your mother\u2019s voice rang in your ears, carrying a large plate stacked with a dozen enormous pancakes smothered in what looked like a gallon of maple syrup. She strutted towards the hulking beast like nothing, placing the plate before him and taking a plate that had held an identical stack of pancakes, now empty.\u2028\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, honey,\u201d Dad boomed, swinging an enormous arm around your mom\u2019s small frame and pulling her forcefully into a deep kiss, your mom giggling before her face was engulfed by the bear\u2019s snout. You wanted to scream, shouting something like <i>\u2018Don\u2019t eat my mom!\u2019</i> but you couldn\u2019t get it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, groooss,\u201d your little brother Andy grumbles, picking at his cereal.  Kira told him to shut up and the two bickered before your mom and the bear broke their embrace, your mom\u2019s whole face glistening with bear-drool. She wiped it off with her apron as if it was routine and looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up, Jesse, your breakfast is getting cold,\u201d she scolds you. You look at the table. The only chair is next to your now hulking furry papa bear. Forcing your legs to move, you step closer and closer to your Dad. Your dad had never been a particularly tall or large man, except for being a little overweight. But this hulking beast was built like an out-of-season powerlifter with broad, rolling shoulders, an enormous burly chest, and the massive mountain of a belly to match. You could feel the heat rolling off his body as you sat next to him, smell that not unpleasant woody musk, hear his rumbling breath. And was that deep, low, constant grumbling his belly digesting its contents? It was all\u2026 pretty incredible.\u2028\u2028You could see the buttons straining against that bulk, his shirt stretched to the limit around every part of his broad round torso, sleeves rolled up exposing his thick furry forearms, tie loosened to enjoy his meal. Finally, you smiled, seeing your own Dad in this whole new way. It was actually kind of awesome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to enjoy your breakfast, keeping your eyes turned towards the massive beast next to you. You nearly choked when something huge slammed into your back, its weight resting on your shoulders. You realize it\u2019s your Dad\u2019s huge paw. You look up at the big hulking bear as he looks down at you eagerly.\u2028\u2028\u201cSo are you ready, Jesse?\u201d You look up at him, confused, still worried about being in the grip of an enormous bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m not ready to be eaten!</i> You want to scream, but hold yourself back. \u201cR-ready for what?\u201d you manage to say.\u2028\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear laughs thunderously, his mighty belly shaking, his meaty chest bouncing. The dishes on the table shake. \u201cReady for\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

It appears that she is the only one who finally understands what you are getting at. Meanwhile, everyone else looks at each other with confusion, wondering if you were sane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComposing herself, Melanie chuckles and rises from her chair. \"Sweetie, I think you didn't get enough sleep. Why don't you go back to bed, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her voice and tone is motherly and concerned, her eyes tell a different story. It showed a sense of urgency and held a promise to tell you what exactly is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you shiver and slowly nod your head. You had a feeling she would dish out some punishment if you didn't get her hint. Putting a hand to your head and forcing a chuckle, you nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...sorry, you're probably right. I'll eat later, I guess,\" you respond, turning away from the table and slowly moving back into your room with a million thoughts running through your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're definitely crazy, right? Yet, Melanie's reaction wasn't a normal one based on her wolf features. You probably should be scared shitless, but for some odd reason, you feel less afraid considering your mother appears to be still present, regardless of her form. The fact that you had a secret interest in anthropomorphic animals might have helped too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you figure that perhaps going back to sleep would actually help. Entering your room, you were about to lie on your bed until you hear a knock on your door. Slowly, Melanie crept in and you are shocked to see how quickly she ate her food. Perhaps she is really a wolf for her to eat that fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air in your room remained silent as Melanie doesn't speak a word and slowly closes the door, locking it. She stares at you for the longest time, observing anymore reaction as you stare, wide-eyed, receiving a full-body view of her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis...couldn't be a dream. It feels real and you feel as sane as you were ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Melanie starts creeping closer. \"Sweetie...I know what this looks like, but...do not panic, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes and held  your breath, her reassurances only seemed to verify what you actually see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably confused and...afraid. You're viewing me like some sort of wolf creature, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head, dumbfoundedly as you listen. You felt any anxiety in your heart slowly drop the longer you listen. The fact that she can express herself in such...human movements despite having a wolf head actually helped you calm a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie closes her eyes and sighs again, putting her hand...er paws over her head. \"I never expected anyone to discover my secret, but it appears you've somehow broken through my illusion. Well...what's done is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on your intently observing state, she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, if there is any doubt, know that I'm still your mother. Despite this form, I gave birth to you and your siblings. To keep the story short, there are a lot of people like me. The majority of us can generate illusions that make us seem human and we use that deception to live normal lives amongst human society. To put it plainly, I fell in love with your father, we got married, and that's it,\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she kept it short, the revelation that there are...creatures like her existing amongst humans is huge! You have too many questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so...I'm guessing dad doesn't know, right?\" you guess, seeing how he didn't have a clue about your reaction like the rest of your family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie shamefully nods. \"That's correct, sweetie. You're the first one to somehow see through my illusion. I've heard about this happening before, but the chances of one becoming aware is less than one percent. Trust me, the only reason I hid my true self is because I'm afraid. I love you all so much and the last thing I want is to be thought of as a freak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took all of this information in and cleared your throat. \"S-so...does that mean that I'm also secretly a wolf? Kira? Andy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie shakes her head. \"No. Although it is possible to have wolf-children, humans seem to have priority with their genetic traits. It's only a blessing that we can carry human children at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, relieved that you aren't secretly a wolf-man. In addition, despite learning of your mother's true nature, the fact that she meant no ill-will also relieved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, I...I need some reassurance. I know this is a lot to take in, but the one thing I don't want is for my children to hate me. I love you, Andy, Kira, and Wesley so much and I don't want things to change within our family...so please say something,\" she pleaded, clearly worried about your internal thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a little guilty for causing your own mother to grow fearful. While this revelation is a lot to handle, you feel more at ease now that you understand the basic of her information. You smile reassuring and hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I understand mom. I'm sorry for worrying you and I won't tell anyone of this, either,\" you state as firmly as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie widens her eyes and tears start to form. \"Oh sweetie, you have no idea how relieved I am to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to smile, albeit embarrassed now that your mother is sniffling and crying in front of you. You do have one more question, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...so, is there a way I can see you in your human form?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie halts her sniffling and she frowns. \"That's...I'm not sure to be honest. Once you break an illusion, I suppose that there is no way to see differently. To be honest, our own illusion isn't something we can control. It just naturally appears once we're around humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo essentially, you're stuck with seeing your mother as a wolf-girl for the rest of your life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to worry your mother again, you give a small chuckle and try to laugh the whole situation off. \"Eheh...well, I guess I have to get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie frowns, easily see your internal trouble in your eyes, despite your efforts to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie comes closer and sits on the bed with you. You feel awkward sitting so close to her and seeing her features in greater detail, but that all fades to black as your mother pulls you in close. You are shocked to suddenly feel a blanket of fur covering you. It almost feels as if you can sink deeper into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...it's okay. You'll get used to it, I hope. Just never forget that I'm still your mother, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hum in response and start to feel sleepy. Seeing that you are slowly growing limp as she hugs you, she realizes you are relaxing far too easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, sweetie?\" she asks and is about to pull away, but you tug on her fur, keeping close. You aren't sure what is wrong with you, but you can't help but bury yourself into her soft fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...okay. It's just that now...you're so...fluffy,\" you explain, humming pleasantly into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie gasps and then lightly chuckles. \"I've never felt any different when hugging you, but you're saying it's different now that you're aware of my true form, hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, not really sure why that is. It appears that Melanie doesn't know the specific details either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is good at least. Are you going to fall asleep on me, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes, coming to realization that you've been hugging her far too long and pull back, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sorry! I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you pull back, you find another reason why you've felt like sinking. Sitting up close to her, you realize she's huge! She must be at least six or seven feet tall. In addition, her chest is...huge! It could just be all the fur that's stacked on her chest, but you've never noticed it since the fur seems to hide her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly composing yourself, you shake your head. \"S-sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie chuckles and comes to feel an odd maternal joy seeing her son act embarrassed. To her, everyone was short, but because they weren't aware of the height difference, she became used to interacting with everyone at her height. Now that she's seeing a true reaction, particularly from you, she feels overjoyed at the fact that she can interact with you without holding back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweetie, that's okay. I know you're a teenager, but why don't we cuddle with each other for a bit. You used to sink into me when you were a baby and while it looked normal to everyone, the one thing that people ask me is how I was able to calm you and the rest of your siblings down so quickly. Maybe that'll help you come to terms with my form easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, Melanie is only making excuses to get to hug her son more. Because she's naturally strong, there are times she had to hold back in order to make herself look more human. Thanks to this reason, she never got the chance to hug her children a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel embarrassed by your mother's suggestion, but the feeling of her soft fur doesn't escape your skin and you feel an urge just to sleep on top of her. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Part of her knew she should put an end to this now before things start to go too far. The other part wanted this to continue, whether this was her motherly instinct or her sex drive was still up for debate as she and her husband had not had sex for the past few months due to his job. The rational part of her mind won out and she whispered into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse, it's time to wake up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse stirred, his eyes slowly opening until his vision saw he was latched onto the nipple of one half of a good set of furry D-Cup breasts. He quickly let go of the nipple and looked up, his cheeks flushed with embarrassment. Melaine just couldn't help but smile seeing the blush on her son. <i>Looks like you still got it.</i> Part of her whispered to herself.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your mother still had long red hair worn in a ponytail but there was something seriously different about her. She was now a 12ft tall turquoise-skinned hippopotamus. Her average build had been replaced with an obese frame that had to weigh at least 5000lbs. Her belly was wider than she was tall and her butt was even bigger than that to the point where only the lower part of it was covered by her jeans. Surprisingly, she still had breasts and she also had curves that while less than noticeable due to her blimpish body, still made it clear that she was a woman. You can\u2019t help but watch as her minuscule tail wags back and forth. Your mom was about to place your breakfast on the table when you look up and see how huge she was. \u201cMorning, Jesse.\u201d Your mother places a plate of pancakes in front of you and then places her own breakfast on the table before she sits her enormous butt down in 5 chairs that creek and even start to come apart as she sits down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t help but stare at your massive mother as your father and siblings dig into their breakfast. \u201cMom?\u201d you think to yourself. \u201cWhat happened? People just don\u2019t turn into hippos overnight.\u201d You then look and see that neither your father nor Andy nor Kira are paying any heed to the fact that your mother is an enormous hippopotamus. You then see your dad kiss your mom on her snout and get even more confused. How could he be taking it so well that his wife was now a hippopotamus big enough to use two cars as a love seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira notices you staring and grunts. \"Jesse? Are you going to eat your pancakes today?\" You nervously start to eat your breakfast but you continue to stare at your huge hippopotamus mom. \"Jesse?\" asks your father. \"Is something bothering you?\" \"Uh,\" you say. \"Dad, don't you notice anything peculiar about mom this morning.\" Your mom just blinks while your dad gives an uneasy look. \"No. I woke up this morning, saw her first thing and nothing seemed out of the ordinary.\" Your mother opens up her mouth, showing the frightening, large and sharp boat-destroying teeth a hippopotamus is known for. \"Is there something in my teeth? Oh no! I don't have any gray hairs do I?\" You give a cough and then you finally say what's on your mind. \"Mom! You're a hippo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom raises an eyebrow at that statement and your little brother just gives a scoff. \"After 17 years you finally noticed that?\" asks Andy sarcastically. Your parents look at you in concern. \"Jesse,\" says your dad. \"Your mother has been a hippo since the day she was born. Heck, I don't even know how you, Andy or Kira came out 100% human.\" \"But I distinctively remember her being human yesterday.\" Your mother then grabs your forehead and you grunt. Your mom's skin was somehow rough and flabby at the same time and her fingers were like thick sausages ending in painted gold fingernails. \"Y'all must be getting a fever, hun,\" says the huge hippopotamus lady. \"Your memory obviously is acting up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push your mother\u2019s hand away. \u201cMom! Don\u2019t you find it strange that you\u2019re a hippopotamus who can talk?\u201d Your mom shrugs her shoulders and then devours her entire stack of pancakes (and her plate) in one bite. You couldn\u2019t believe it. Everyone was behaving as if your mother was always a hippopotamus and that it was perfectly normal for her to be one. You even look back and see some photos on the wall that leave you further confused. One of which depicts your parents\u2019 wedding and your mother is depicted as a hippo in that photograph with her wedding dress barely fitting her obese body and even tearing in the seat as she bends down and kisses your father. You don\u2019t know if it\u2019s everyone else who\u2019s wrong or if you were the one who was wrong. Even weirder was that in that photograph, your mother\u2019s bridesmaids were all African animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly what kind of day is it?</span></div></div>",

They didn\u2019t even have the same voice; instead of your mother\u2019s timid midwestern drawl, she seemed to have a deep, african accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This thing couldn\u2019t be your mother.</i> So what <i>was</i> it, then? It seemed to have everyone else fooled. Your family members seemed amused at worst by the hippo woman\u2019s eating habits, acting as if this entire scene was completely normal. You eventually came to the conclusion that this hippo woman had somehow brainwashed them, planting false memories to make them believe she was their mother the entire time! It all makes sense, now! That only leaves one question; just where is your real mother? A shiver goes down your spine when you glance at the hippo\u2019s huge, round stomach, which looked easily capable of containing a whole person. No\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t think such things. Your real mother must be alive; the hippo woman was merely hiding her somewhere\u2026 and you <i>had</i> to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile getting ready for school, you used every moment of free time to make a full forensic sweep of the house, looking for any evidence something was off. Unfortunately, you came up short. Your parent\u2019s bed was covered in the same slime and stench that covered the obese pachyderm. You looked through old photo albums, only to find pictures of you jumping on her fat belly like a trampoline when you were five, or her celebrating your tenth birthday with you. Even your old journal seemed completely different, containing crude drawings of the hippo, and an entry complaining about her accidentally sitting on your best friend when you were little. All sorts of childhood memories you just couldn\u2019t remember. All the evidence seemed to point to the hippo being your real mother all along. But\u2026 that was impossible\u2026 right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she offered you a ride to school, you just couldn\u2019t be sure whether she was your real mother or not. Perhaps you were the one going crazy here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed her outside only to stop in your tracks when you noticed the behemoth of a car sitting in the driveway. It looked like a monster truck! Each wheel was bigger than you were tall! Your \u2018mother\u2019 climbed in, and you realized that the huge truck must\u2019ve been built specifically to support her weight. Still, the truck creaked and groaned under the pressure as she climbed in, her massive body putting the heavy machinery to the test. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAre you coming, honey?\u201d</b></span> The hippo pushes open the passenger door, and you stand there staring blithely up at it, realizing it was too high for you to climb in. You squeal in surprise when she reaches down a fat, grubby hand and lifts you up by the back of your shirt, easily hoisting you in the air and setting you down on a car seat three times your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get settled in to the huge seat, a little shaken by the hippo woman\u2019s apparent strength. The seatbelt was far too big for you to really use, but in a car this size, you didn\u2019t really need it anyway. As she pulled out of the driveway, you realized the huge truck took up two lanes! How was this street-legal? You held your breath as she drove, convinced she would accidentally crush the other cars beneath the truck\u2019s huge wheels\u2026 but somehow, miraculously, she passed through traffic without any problems, and nobody seemed to question the two story tall truck tearing down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at your hippo mom as she drives, fascinated and disturbed by her features. She was wearing a dress now, that seemed custom made for her size. It looked like it cost upwards of thousands of dollars, and yet, it still barely clung to her obese form. You decide to start gawking, though; it would more productive to instead start asking her questions, get a better feel for what was going on here. With any luck, you could find inconsistencies in the hippo\u2019s story. <b>\u201cSo\u2026 mom,\u201d</b> you said, though it felt weird to call her that. <b>\u201cHow did you and dad first meet, again?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, I must\u2019ve told you this story a thousand times,\u201d</b></span> she giggled loudly, idly waving a hand. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cYour father took a trip to Malawi in his college days, and his friends dared him to swim alll the way across part of the Shire river. For most species, this would be easy, but sad to say, you humans don\u2019t swim very well.\u201d</b></span> Strike one. Your father\u2019s never been to Africa. In fact, you\u2019re pretty sure he\u2019s never left the country. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cLuckily, fate brought us together. I had gotten lost on my way to the elephant marsh, and that\u2019s the only reason I happened to be wading nearby when he started sinking. From there, I just cradled him in my arms and carried him the rest of the way to the other side.\u201d</b></span> She gestured happily as she told the story, carelessly taking her eyes off the road. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything in return, but he figured he owed me a life debt. So he extended his trip, we fell in love, and the rest, as they say, is history.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</b> You said, growing more and more suspicious. You furrow your brow as you try to carefully word your next question. <b>\u201cIf that\u2019s so\u2026 why are we, well, humans?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI don\u2019t quite know, actually. We expect you\u2019d be born half-human, half-hippo, but it seems you\u2019ve all taken from your father\u2019s side,\u201d</b></span> she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAren\u2019t <i>you</i> half-human, half-hippo?\u201d</b> You raise a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d</b></span> She gave you a weird look. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m just a regular hippo.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c... if you say so,\u201d</b> you shrug. She certainly doesn\u2019t look like a regular hippo. You just didn\u2019t know what to believe anymore. Either every single thing you thought you knew was wrong, and every memory you had false\u2026 or your \u2018mother\u2019 was really some creature trying to trick you. It was all too much to take in. You just wanted to get to school and forget about it for a while. Eventually, she pulled into the parking lot, her truck taking up three entire parking spaces. You sigh in relief as you hop down a few foot to the concrete ground, only to see your \u2018mother\u2019 climb out, too. <b>\u201cY-you\u2019re coming, too? Why?\u201d</b> You shudder, embarrassed to be seen by your peers with the 3,000-pound pachyderm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cPfft. Are you being silly?

Sure, she was happy to stay at home and take care of the house and raise me, Andy, and Kira, but you always suspected that she wanted..just a bit more. In your eyes, your mother was kind, selfless, and patient, and always thought that she would be a great teacher. You remember distinctively when you were around 12, you asked her for help on homework and casually remarked that you would love it if she was your teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back...maybe you should have kept your mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY TEACHER?!\" You yelled out of shock. You had just learned that this...hippo disguised as your mom, was one of your teachers. Specifically, your 4th period economic teacher. You shudder to think whatever had happened to Mr. Ferguson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blueish-green hippo tilted her head to the side in confusion. \"Yes honey, your teacher. I've been working here since you were four, and you started taking my class since last month. Did you...honestly forget that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...no! Of course not!\" You say quickly. \"I'm just...tired that's all. Didn't get a good night's sleep.\" It wasn't the best of excuses, you knew that. You were always good about going to bed early, and you could only hope that your 'mom' did not know about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you chuckled nervously, the turquoise pachyderm gradually made a small frown, her smile fading, not entirely convinced with your story. \"...alright sweetie. Are you sure your feeling well? You seem to be acting a bit strange today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mom, i'm fine\" you still had a hared time calling this thing your mom. But despite that, you couldn't help but feel a bit guilty about your actions. She seemed...genuinely concerned for your well being, with no hidden agenda but to make sure your fine. Then again, it could be just another part of an elaborate lie. You were still to dazed by all of this to think properly on the subject for long, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...okay Jesse.\" Your 'mother' sighed, a bit displeased by your answer. \"Just...remember of you need to talk to me, you'll know where to find me, alright?\" With that, she turned towards the school entrance, her fat, blubbery posterior jiggling at you all the way. Waiting for a bit until your 'mom' was out of sight, you followed after her into the school to start the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever happened last night while you were sleeping, whatever changes occurred to your reality while you were dreaming, it certainly did not start with your new mom and end with your childhood memories. The school that you were attending had changed. It still had the same look more or less, but the doorways and hallways had been modified to accommodate your mother's gigantic form. You could hear and even feel her heavy feet collide with the tiled floor in the next hallway over. Like your family, the other humans around did not seem fazed at all to the sight of a huge, fat, anthro hippo walking around their school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, there seemed to be no other walking talking animals in this new reality...that could see for now. You gulped, dreading that you might find that there were more of these...things, disusing themselves as people you knew.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment you stepped foot into your first period class, your heart seized in your chest. It felt like your whole world was unravelling around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in the front row you\u2019ve always had a crush on is now a 7-foot tall puma, her long tail waving idly in the air behind her as she tapped away at her phone. The quiet kid by the window was now a huge grizzly bear, so superhumanly buff he looked like he could twist your head off in an instant. Most horrifying of all, your english teacher, Mrs. Omarah, was now a humongous, 20-foot tall elephant! She was always a bit on the chubby side, but now she probably weighed over four tons, and almost touched the high ceiling every time she stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost unnerving, though, was how <i>mundane</i> everything was. Beyond the fact that some of the people in the class have transformed into walking, talking animals, everything else seemed completely normal. Mrs. Omarah made announcements and barked instructions in the same tone she always did. Nobody else seemed to blink twice at the fact she was two stories tall now, just watching her with the same bored, apathetic expressions they always did. You try to act natural as you slink to your desk, even as you\u2019re reevaluating your entire worldview. In your mind, two possibilities remained; either these \u2018animals\u2019 have completely taken over the world, redesigned every building, and replaced part of the population overnight, or you were going completely crazy. You weren\u2019t sure which possibility was more terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond the fact that many of your classmates had turned into animals, it was otherwise a perfectly normal school day. You, of course, weren\u2019t in the mood to concentrate on your education right now, instead just staring at the massive animal that used to be your teacher. She wrote on the whiteboard with her long trunk, while using her hands to stuff junk food down her throat and scratch the fat rolls of her belly. Her dress just barely fit around her huge body, running up her thick thighs and straining around her huge, sagging breasts. You noticed posters on the wall warning you not to get too close to anthros her size, lest you be accidentally trampled or sat on. You decided to heed their advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever you could, you pulled out your phone and searched for answers. According to every single source you could find online, anthros have always existed, and there are hundreds of millions of them. Most of them live in the wild, similar to real animals, but many have chosen to integrate into modern society. From what you can tell, a little less than 10% of the students and faculty at your school have been \u2018replaced\u2019 with anthros. You\u2019re nervous as you google former economics teacher Mr. Ferguson, worried that it might turn out that he never existed, or that he\u2019s \u2018disappeared\u2019\u2026 but no, he\u2019s definitely still alive and kicking, just teaching at another school, for some reason. So many random little things have changed, it was hard to keep track. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass proceeded as normally as it possibly could. When second period rolled around, you breathe a sigh of relief when you learn that your precalc teacher, at least, was still human. At lunch, you noticed all the food was either vegan, or made of synthetic meat; which made sense, in a world where animals could talk. You also noticed you seem to have a strange reputation as the son of one of the teachers, especially a teacher large enough to squash somebody with ease. It made you feared, but also unpopular. At least you didn\u2019t have to worry about anyone picking on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually came the moment you\u2019ve been dreading \u2014 fourth period. You stumbled in, and sure enough, your \u2018mother\u2019 is standing at the head of the class, your old teacher nowhere to be seen. You try to evade notice, but she immediately gestures to you as you walk in. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re feeling okay, sweetheart? You look a little sick,\u201d her gross, meaty breath stung your nostrils as she kneeled down, a concerned look on her face. You just now realize how pale you\u2019ve been all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m fine, really,\u201d you stutter, rubbing your arm, trying not to look directly at her. \u201cJust\u2026 school, y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, baby, you\u2019re doing just fine! Just do your best, and know I\u2019ll always be so proud of my little boy, no matter what,\u201d she says, in that familiar, motherly tone, \u201cand if you need anything, I\u2019ll always be right here to help. Okay?\u201d You nod curtly, just trying to get this conversation over with, only to be surprised when she leaned forwards, and her huge lips plant a big, sloppy kiss right on your forehead! She meant it as a sweet gesture, but you felt humiliated as you stumbled to your desk, trying to wipe the lipstick stain off your forehead amidst the snickering of your classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before she started going over the lesson. She was a fine teacher, you suppose; definitely more passionate and bubbly then Mr. Ferguson ever was. You, of course, couldn\u2019t pay attention at all, too blown away by how surreal it was to hear economic principles coming out of a hippo\u2019s mouth, especially since that hippo seems to be your mother. While you found her new blubbery figure and atrocious BO distasteful, the more you listened to her talk, the more she just seemed like\u2026 well, your mother. She was still the same pleasant and good-natured woman as she always was, she just\u2026 looked a little different now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a choice to make. Do you accept that this is just the way things are, and have always been\u2026 or do you keep stubbornly believing that the hippo isn\u2019t your \u2018real\u2019 mother?</span></div></div>",

Maybe all the cherished memories you\u2019ve had of her over the years were just\u2026 imaginary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake those thoughts from your head. It\u2019s just not possible. You couldn\u2019t wrap your head around the idea of every single day of your life so far having been a lie. You have memories of her as a human from yesterday, for God\u2019s sake. You remembered your mother, clear as can be, as a polite, well-mannered, graceful human woman\u2026 not some big, sloppy, obese animal. You watch in disgust as the hippo shoves junk food in her mouth while she teaches, her fat rolls heaving and jiggling as she\u2019s overcome with gluttony. The Melanie you knew was tempered and fit. This imposter wasn\u2019t even convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get your head back in the game. The hippo must be hiding your real mother somewhere out there, and you had to find her before it was too late. There wasn\u2019t a moment to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, you decided you couldn\u2019t afford to waste any more time. You had to confront the hippo woman, once and for all. You were a little nervous she might just 'get rid' of you when you reveal you know she's an imposter, but there were still a few students lingering around the classroom. Surely she wouldn\u2019t try anything while there were witnesses around, right? While the hippo sits happily at her desk, sorting through papers, you walked over and grabbed her thick, blubbery arm. \u201cWhere is my mother?\u201d You whispered accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my <i>real</i> mother?\u201d You whispered, your voice raising as you\u2019re filled with righteous anger. \u201cI know you\u2019re hiding her somewhere. You better not have hurt her. Where is she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay, Jesse?\u201d She frowns, not sure whether you\u2019re serious or not. \u201c<i>I\u2019m</i> your mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo you\u2019re <i>not!</i>\u201d You insist, trying to restrain yourself from yelling. \u201cYou may have everybody else fooled, but you <i>can\u2019t</i> be my mother! My real mother is a human, not some\u2026 <i>hippo</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-Jesse, that is extremely hurtful\u2026\u201d She looks upset, her voice stuttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen give me my <i>mom</i> back, you big, fat <i>animal</i>!\u201d You angrily demand, only to realize you\u2019d just spoken so loud, the lingering classmates could hear your clearly. They stared at you, stunned. The entire room fell silent as you all awaited the hippo\u2019s reaction. You were still filled with anger\u2026 only to be taken aback by how she reacts.</span></div></div>",

Everything was so normal until yesterday, and now there are walking, talking animals all over the place! And I...and I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you began to feel water creep into your eyes as well as the entire weight of your world came crashing down. \u201cI just want my mom back!\u201d You hell, not to the hippo, but at the universe in general. \u201cI\u2019m so confused! On one hand my entire life has been a lie because I can only remember having a Human for a mom, or...or...oh god!\u201d You find your legs giving out as you fall down into the floor on your knees in a healing mess. You cupped your face as tears freely flowed out of your eyes. Nothing made sense anymore. You didn\u2019t know what to think. Either some force had mass changed reality while you slept, or your mom was a hippo. And both of those options were ideal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just wanted your mom back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lingering students formned a semi-circle around you, but you didn\u2019t care. You kept crying, hoping that this was all some type of dream and you wake up to your old, normal world. Suddenly, you felt yourself be hoisted up by the hem of your shirt into the air. You knew it was the Hippo but you didn\u2019t open your eyes. You wanted to be as far away from the thing as possible. She set you down on top of her belly, with your head nestled up against her massive, saggy breasts. You tried to push her arms away when they came up behind you, but she was too strong as she pulled you into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe position you were in felt...familiar, but you couldn\u2019t pace it to a specific memory. Ignoring the hippo\u2019s acrid sweat, you found comfort as you sunk into the goliath\u2019s flabby rolls. Soon, the hippo began to sing a tune, something you had wr heard in a very, very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll love you forever,<br>\r\nI'll like you for always,<br>\r\nAs long as I'm living<br>\r\nmy baby you'll be.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother used to sing you that when you were a kid. She read it from a book to you every night before you went to bed. You blinked hard as you slowly put your hand on the turquoise colored skin of the Hippo\u2019s pudgy right hand. No one knew about that song. No one. Not sven your dad knew about it, mom always insisting that it would be \u2018our little secret\u2019. The only people in the world who knew about it were you and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up past the horizon of the Hippo\u2019s cleavage. \u201cM...mom? Is that...is that really you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hippo sniffles and wiped away a tear with a free hand. She was crying, but her mouth was smiling down at you. \u201cYes honey...it\u2019s me.\u201d </span></div></div>",

The school nurse was, of course, a walking, talking bunny rabbit now. Guess you should have seen that coming. It was a little uncomfortable talking to her; you weren\u2019t afraid of anthros anymore, of course, but it was a little uncanny to have a conversation with a lagomorph. <b>\u201cNo!\u201d</b> You insist, before stopping yourself. It was hard to put the situation into words. <b>\u201cI mean\u2026 I guess. I think I remember things differently. To everyone else, this is\u2026 completely normal.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cWould you mind describing how you remember things?\u201d</span> She asked, her tone indecipherable. You couldn\u2019t tell if she believed you or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUhh\u2026 sort of the same, but\u2026 without anthros, I guess,\u201d</b> you shrug, awkwardly. <b>\u201cMy mom, in particular, was\u2026 well, completely different. She was thin, tidy, polite\u2026 human.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cMhmm,\u201d</span> she said, tapping her pen on a clipboard contemplatively. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cI suppose that is what led to your, ah, \u2018outburst\u2019?\u201d</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod shamefully. <b>\"Yeah, I... sort of thought she was some kind of alien or something trying to replace my mom.\"</b> The words stung as they left your mouth, because you realize how crazy they must make you sound. Even the nurse gave you an odd look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discuss your symptoms for a while, before she just decided on the advice, \u2018wait and see how you feel tomorrow\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, your mother was speaking with the nurse in private, and you sat near the door, straining your ears to eavesdrop on their conversation. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cThis certainly can\u2019t be chalked up to simple memory problems,\u201d</span> you can faintly hear the nurse saying. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cIf anything, it could be indicative of the onset of certain\u2026 delusional disorders.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cYou mean like schizophrenia?\u201d</span> Your mother replied, sounding alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cWell, no, not exactly. Even healthy individuals can suffer from delusional ideation. The possibility also remains that your son might be manufacturing his symptoms, for lack of a better word,\u201d</span> she explained in further detail. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for human children to feel insecure about having an anthropomorphic parent, especially at your son\u2019s age. It\u2019s also not unheard of for them to insist they\u2019re not their \u2018real\u2019 parent. Not to say he dislikes you. Teenagers his age are simply trying to establish a concrete identity for themselves, and being split between the cultures and lifestyles of two entirely different species can be\u2026 confusing.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, the nurse gave your mother the same advice she gave you \u2014 wait and see how you feel tomorrow. If you\u2019re still experiencing strange symptoms, it might be indicative of a very serious problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ride home that afternoon, you contemplate what the nurse had said. Delusional? Maybe you were delusional. That was the only way you could explain today\u2019s events. Still, all your memories just seemed so\u2026 vivid. Could you really just be imagining them? Why did this all suddenly happen overnight? Can you trust any of your memories? Can you even know for sure what you had for breakfast this morning? <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cSo, you\u2026 don\u2019t have any memories of me at all?\u201d</span> Your mother speaks up, interrupting your introspection. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cEven from back when you were little?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI remember you! Just\u2026 as a human,\u201d</b> you explain, <b>\u201cand some other details are a little different. But I remember the important stuff, I think.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cOh, dear,\u201d</span> she said, seeming a little bummed by the idea you might\u2019ve forgotten some of your childhood memories. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t\u2026 frighten you too much this morning.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything you did. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s really scary not to recognize your own mom, you know?\u201d</b> More accurately, it was terrifying. Difficult to even put into words. At this age, your mother was supposed to be a stabile and comforting part of your life. To suddenly have the rug pulled out from under you had shaken you to your core. But now, even though she may seem entirely different at a glance, you know that Melanie is the same woman she always was, deep down. That knowledge felt like a massive weight had been taken off your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cAaww, honey\u2026\u201d</span> She frowned, pulling you closer with a pudgy arm and planting another huge, sympathetic kiss right on your forehead. She didn\u2019t know quite what to think about your \u2018delusions\u2019, but she definitely felt terrible for you. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhat an awful thing for my baby to have to go through.\u201d</span> She sat there for a while, trying to come up with the words. You hated seeing her so sad.</span></div></div>",

His red hair seems more straight and short than before, but aside from that his whole body is that color! Well, minus his arms, legs, and torso. He's just sitting there, eating cereal, reading comic books.. and he's an animal. A red fox. What the hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grasp at the air for a logical reason your brother has become this. His muscles are more defined, and his hands, well, paws, are tipped with sharp black claws at his slightly shorter fingers. His thumbs seem to have slightly distanced themselves from the rest of his fingers, but otherwise look just like before. Dark, tough pads dot each of his finger joints and a large one on his palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a tuft of fur sticking out of the front of his shirt collar, and that it's got three buttons undone instead of the typical one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Je-jeez, And-yy.. What's happened to you?!\" You yell at an uncertain volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour relatives glance at Andy, then eachother, then at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Jesse?\" Your mother asks, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He..

Do you need to be checked out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no.. I don't think so-\" You're interrupted by Andy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come sit down before you hurt yourself, big guy.\" His voice has deepened incredibly. Not that it's scary, but yesterday you swore his voice was still breaking in, and now he sounds like a fifteen year old!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. Okay.. jeez.. maybe I bumped my head today,\" you say, rubbing your right temple and then snagging a bite out of your cereal. You know you didn't bump your head, but it's been enough drama at the table today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at Andy a couple of times, and realize he's also gained height. His head is at your neck, when you remember his head barely reaching your shoulder when you sat down. \"Jeez,\" you remark. Did he hit fox puberty while you were out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Your brother asks, turning to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You definitely got taller than I last remember,\" you tell him quietly, taking your last bite out of your bran flakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks as awkward as a new teenager could be after a compliment. \"Y-yeah, I guess I'm not quite a kid anymore. Hey, you didn't forget today, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fox sibling explains,</span></div></div>",

You stare for a moment and then shake your head, trying to focus on getting your bowl clean. After rinsing, you place it in the dry rack, before walking toward the door. Your brother passes you, and you still can't get used to the idea of him being a fox. It's just impossible.. isn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find it harder to question as you become less shaky. Your normal, conscious brain tells you that you're interested in anthros anyway, right? But that's your brother.. your.. fox.. brother. the.. one with the.. six pack and the.. fur..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt as you try to control yourself. You still can't believe he's your brother, and also that he's kind of well built. Kind of hot, even, but you wouldn't say that about your sibling. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to control yourself and convince that he is indeed <i>your brother</i> and that such thoughts should be reserved for boys.. uh, girls, you mean..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't really tell the difference anymore, because your brain is so full of stress, fear, and small amounts of lust all over that you're not sure what you want. Your mom could be a male hippo and you wouldn't really give a shit anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse, let's get going.\" Your brother snaps you out of your confused cycle and is pushing you out the front door with your backpack. \"You seem broken today, bro. What's up?\" You barely detect his question as you subconsciously walk over to your car door. \"Just a little tired.. stayed up to late.\" Complete lies. You always go to bed earliest. You don't really want to answer questions right now, though, as you have more questions yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you going to ninth grade next year?\" You really want to ask other things, but you ask that just so you don't sound any crazier than you have already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah.. I am.\" Andy seems not to be able to say things clearly at this point. You glance over for a moment, and then see that he's trying to adjust himself a little awkwardly. A look at his face and at his trousers clearly explain that he is aroused, yet trying to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour previous lust arises even fiercer than before, but your mind fights, saying that it's wrong, that it's your brother! But he looks.. hot.. and he's aroused..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Andy looks at you again curiously as you walk up to your car and get inside, with him getting into the passenger seat. He places his bag down on his lap, and pulls on his seat belt, you couldn't help but look over at him again before turning on the car. The drive to school was a long one, much longer than what you remember, though you were lucky the traffic going there was pretty light. The thoughts of your newly changed brother still fresh on your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to Andy, who seems to have been looking out the window, his ears perked up. \"Hey, do you remember that time, we played hide and seek.\" You ask him, seeing if the change is as complete as is appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fox brother turns to look at you, his brow arch's up a moment before thinking. \"Of course, what I remember most of all are the times I managed to sneak right up on, and you weren't any the wiser.\" He snickers at that, the glint in his eyes taking on a mischievous shine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, of course Andy, but there's been plenty of times I found you!\" He pouts playfully at that mention and shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can only hide in bushes so well, with red-orange fur, you know that, besides I let you find me a few times.\" He smiles, and looks at you for a moment.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you are okay Jesse?\" He tilts his head, worry creeping into his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briskly nod at him and smile gingerly, or at least try to with out looking on any longer at his furry form. \"Yeah I'm fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the next light came up, you had to adjust your pants again, the school wasn't that much father now, and you made sure to take note of any pedestrians reactions to your brother. Everyone around there seemed to be familiar with him, waving his or your way as they walked and you drove past. You were really starting to wonder if you were the only one that remembered things any differently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you stop the car again to look at your brother, you catch him trying to sneak another peek at you, adjusting his shorts this time again before he finally notices you looking. He freezes and turns his head away, and you choose not to say anything about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andy, you been working out or anything?\" You ask, trying to break the current silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns his head back, after peering at the school getting closer, and you pull into the parking lot. \"Oh yeah, I have been a bit, though I'm told I have quite a bit more growing to do, you might end up looking up at me before long, Jesse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou park the car and freeze a moment, only to hear the door open and your furry brother slip out and stand there. \"Don't worry, big bro, I'll try not to embarrass you in front of your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there, those thoughts of your brother still on your mind, and your left wondering what to do, some space from Andy would give you time to think, but he's still your brother, and he's supposed to be shadowing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to him again, he pipes up...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had always felt that having gym first period was the best part of your schedule. You liked getting a nice workout first thing in the morning; it really helped you get your blood pumping for the rest of the day. Today, though, with Andy shadowing you, you suddenly realized that this class may present some... complications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, one presents itself almost as soon as you step into the locker room to change into your gym clothes. \"Hey, Jesse? I ... uh... I wasn't told to bring a change of clothes or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop and turn around to face your brother. All around you, the rest of the guys are already half-changed. Some of them glance up at your brother, but none seem particularly surprised. \"Damn, you're right. Hang on a second.\" Opening your locker, you're relieved to see that you still have a spare set of clean gym clothes, one you had put there in case you had accidentally left your main one at home on laundry day. \"Here,\" you say, handing the t-shirt and shorts to him, \"they may be a bit loose, but they should fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" he exclaims, and the two of you begin to remove your street clothes. As you do, you can't help but look at Andy's body out of the corner of your eye. Yes, that definition you saw earlier is certainly there, and the white belly and chest fur really serve to accentuate his abs. After a moment, Andy looks up at you with a wry smile on his face, and you realize that you've been staring a little longer than you should. You turn back to focus on changing your own clothes, though you're pretty sure that Andy's also watching you as you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you say once you're fully changed and have put your street clothes in the locker. \"How does that--\" You stop, surprised to see that the gym clothes Andy was wearing were now as snug on him than they were on you, maybe even slightly more! But that would mean-- you gulp as you realize you're staring Andy straight in the eye-- he's as tall as you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Jesse?\" he asks, smiling softly at you as he places his hands-- paws? -- on his hips... just on either side of a very pronounced bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can answer, you hear the whistle of Coach Mallarson, your teacher, and the few guys who're still in the locker room hurry out to the field outside. \"I guess that means we have to go, huh?\" Andy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, following the rest of the group, still a little dazed as you stand in a line as Coach Mallarson starts the class. Nothing about this made any sense at all. You know your brother was a head shorter than you just this morning, and he was even shorter than that before this whole fox craziness started. You thought about what he said in the car: \"I'm told I have quite a bit more growing to do, you might end up looking up at me before long, Jesse.\" Sure, kids his age had growth spurts, but this much was ridiculous, wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind is so caught up with these thoughts that you totally miss Coach Mallarson telling you what today's class is covering, and as he blows his whistle, you're a little confused as everyone, including Andy, starts to jog towards the track circling the soccer field. Not wanting to get in trouble, you start running along with them. After a moment's confusion, you remember that this is the day that everyone in the class is supposed to run 5 miles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot exactly the day you were looking forward too over the past few weeks, but it suddenly seems oddly appealing. After all, running is mindless enough, and it gives you time to further think about your situation... and to watch your brother. Andy runs right along with the high schoolers, his tail (which is sticking just out of the top of the pants, revealing a little more than is probably appropriate for PE class) flies behind him like the tail of a kite, and he soon takes the lead of the group. As the other boys fatigue, he seems to be full of energy, almost keeping a sprinter's pace the entire way. What's more, he seems to really be enjoying himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it really so bad to be attracted to him, you think to yourself as you watch him. I mean, on one level, yes, he's your brother-- but you certainly can't be physically related to him anymore, right? I mean, whatever's happened in this crazy alternate universe (if that's what it is), he would have be adopted or something, wouldn't he? And, from all the signals he's been giving you all morning, he certainly seems to be reciprocating your feelings. But maybe that's just wishful thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the class, Andy finishes several minutes ahead of anyone else, and as you complete the final lap in the middle of the pack, he runs over to you, a huge smile beaming across his muzzle. At first, you think he's about to give you a hug, but instead, he simply pats you on the shoulder. \"That was fun!\" he says, and you notice that he's panting ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... fun.\" Somehow, you can't disagree with him on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head back into the locker room, however, you begin to notice something...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your ears barely make out his plea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm really worried about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His eyes\u2013they're as high up as yours, you're reminded\u2013are glimmering. You can see both sets of whiskers push forward, and his dark lips separate ever so slowly as he awaits an answer. His head is tilted to the side. You're burning up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You close your mouth and discreetly bat his arm away while trying to avoid any eye contact with him. \"I'm\u2013 <i>I am fine,</i>\" you reply rather tersely. Maybe it was wishful thinking, but as you stroll past him you swear you saw his paw reach for your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I need a minute,\" you huff at the air, trying to walk off the agitated heat rapidly building in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In the changing room, things don't prove to be much better as the slam of lockers is overpowered by the cry of something not quite resembling the shrillness that you used to constantly hear through your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jesse, what the <i>hell?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Andy, what?\" You wheel around and bark with a little more volume than you planned. As if you didn't already startle everyone by rushing into the locker room with a fire lit under your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're\u2013 you're never like this, Jess; you've just been really <i>weird</i> all morning, and\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't have time for this, Andrew; please, just\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Would you <i>stop trying to act like I'm under you?!</i> This happens every time you get pissed! You are two years my senior! I\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Coach Mallarson's arrival to the scene was just enough to shock you out of rushing your own brother, but it's when you calm down that you really see how hurt your brother is. Perhaps the most glaring thing was the last thing he tried to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Perhaps it was the fact that Andy was <i>four</i> years younger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Andy wipes his eyes, as Coach defuses the situation, all you can think about is the error in math. If it was true, that would make him fifteen - or it would make you fifteen; either way, it was just wrong. He said the wrong number, that was all. What even was all that they discussed about his middle school? So, he misspoke. It's the only way everything made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>And yet,</i> a voice in the back of your head whispers, <i>evidence to the contrary is staring you straight in the face.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a profane scream, your friend's locker is busted, and your fist is bandaged for the remainder of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>~~~</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You can't tell if you're relieved that Andy isn't shadowing many of the same classes as yours. While it removes the stress of interacting with him again, all it does is leave you with the tug of war that is your conscience. Oh, and don't forget your little existential crisis there, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your fist throbs, and you're worried that you might have hurt it much worse than you initially thought. It's all you can stand to think about as your teacher drones on, and you grip your bound hand even as the lunch bell makes the ringing in your ears worse. Exchanging the books in your locker is nearly cathartic, and you almost forget your troubles until their very voice pipes up and scares the daylight out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Andy, for <i>god's sake\u2013</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jesse, please, shut up for a second. I want you to <i>listen</i> to me.\" You resume placing books into your locker. You swear you can hear the blood rushing in your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Jesse\u2026</i>\" You feel his paw on your shoulder, his grip insistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"\u2026are you mad at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your gaze turns to him, and he's more pitiful than ever. His tail is tucked, and he's almost clutching his notebook at his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your heart sinks as you scramble for words. \"No! I mean, I wasn't\u2013 I'm n-not\u2026 <i>mad.</i> At you.\" His head tilts, and you nearly piss yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I mean \u2013 I'm not mad at anyone! Shit. I'm\u2013 I'm mad at my\u2013 myself, a little,\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You jump a little as he places his paw on your hand; you can't get over how soft it is. The touch is short enough to be inconspicuous, but it's an intimate one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Calm down. And apology accepted, by the way,\" he quips, giving a sideways smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Christ, Andy. I'm sorry. I've just\u2026 there's a whole lot going on\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You find yourself being pushed down the hallway with unexpected force, and it takes you a second to resist it. \"Less talking; more eating!\" Andy cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You're startled both by his strength and the lengths he seems to be going to in order for you to put a sock in it, but as you yelp and try to push back against him, it's almost familiar. Something about this still feels like Andy, you realize, and like all the things that are different, you feel equally as anxious acknowledging all the things that are still the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>~~~</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>That's my brother, alright,</i> you marvel to yourself as he puts away half his plate before stopping to suck down his chocolate milk bottle. His method of drinking it from the bottle stuns you for a second, leaving you wordless as he asks whether or not you care for hot dogs. Your only response is to slowly hand over yours while your eyes discreetly trail down to the rest of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0About now you notice the fact that he changed back into his uniform while you were busy in the nurse's office. His shirt sleeves, which only come about two inches down his arm, now hug his biceps, and you look down and see that his shirt is only half tucked - it's not nearly long enough for his shorts, which nearly stop at the middle of his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, Andy\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You see his ears stand up in response, close to finishing his second weenie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You ever, uh, pay attention to the fact that you look like you\u2026 er, outgrew all your clothes?\" Your heart momentarily beats faster and you half expect him to suddenly scream in realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shranck in th' wash,\" he shoots back with a full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"\u2026Ah,\" you reply under your breath with a nod. That was less intense than it was building up to be, you feel. You still can't help but look him up and down, mildly hypnotized by how his uniform shirt hugs his lithe figure, threatening to come up with his sleeves if he were to raise his arms\u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aren't you going to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your eyes snap back up to his, and you feel truly ashamed. You were <i>actually ogling your brother.</i> But that retort still hangs in your head; if he wasn't human, then I mean how could\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>But\u2026 no, why are you even entertaining the thought? You have no plans on even giving that proposition the time of day. It\u2026 it means nothing if you two are related - you're never going to\u2013</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Earth to Jesse!\" He snaps his fingers in front of your face. You're momentarily intrigued that he's capable of snapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh, what'd you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He rolls his eyes. \"You aren't eating. What, you're gonna tell me you aren't hungry after exercising in the morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You scoff. \"Oh, like that was exercise for you. You were practically bouncing afterward,\" you counter with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you trying to deny food from a growing pup?\" He laughs and leans into your face, mock growling. For a moment, your eyes widen, and you feel uncomfortably warm at how close he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Back off, fido, I'm not on the menu,\" you laugh as you push him at arms length. He then opens his maw wide, threatening to close his jaws on you, before leaning over and giving a long, deep smooch on your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You can't help but gasp. You're unsure if what happened actually happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026Did your brother just kiss you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You bring your hand halfway toward your mouth, staring at his mischievous grin. Your breath picks up and your fingertips tingle, the sensation spreading up your arms and pooling in your chest as you try to get your mind under control. His expression is almost innocent, and you feel yourself halfway to giving long, hard looks at places you know they aren't supposed to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You're about to shut your eyes when the next thing to happen manages to shock you further, as you weren't sure if you were just hearing yourself go deaf or if the lunch bell really was ringing. Your brother perks up before scooping up both of your trays, sliding one on top of the other, and patting you on the shoulder with a hearty laugh. You can't seem to crane your neck hard enough as he disappears into the crowd of moving students.</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you sit down for your first class after lunch, you're glad that Andy's not shadowing your next class, as you highly doubt you'd be able to concentrate on anything if he was in the same room as you. As the teacher starts to drone on about something something World War I, however, you find yourself zoning out and replaying the end of lunch over and over in your mind. The hottest kiss you've ever had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No stop that, he's my brother for god's sake.</i> Still, as much as you try to push the thought out of your mind, you keep coming back to it, each time lingering a little longer on the kiss, each time feeling a bit more of Andy's warm chest pressing against yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's wrong,</i> you remind yourself. And yet, it didn't feel that way, at least instinctively. On a logical level, sure, everything about this feels as wrong as could be. Your brother is <i>supposed</i> to be four years younger than you, almost a foot shorter, totally not someone you had the hots for (or vice-versa). And, oh yeah, he's a human, not some sort of fox creature!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, apparently, you're the only one who finds this the least bit strange. Your parents, everyone at school, Andy himself-- they all seem to be reacting to this as if everything's completely normal. That was the strangest thing of all. And yet, what if this is normal? Would that be so bad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind is so flooded with conflicting thoughts, questions, and emotions, that you don't notice that your teacher is now staring at you with a stern look on his face. \"Well, Jesse,\" he says as he folds his arms across his chest, \"do you have any guess as to what the significance of the Lusitania was? Maybe if you had done the reading...\" Gulping, you shake your head, feeling too light-headed to form any coherent reply. \"Are you alright, Jesse?\" your teacher finally asks, his frown softening a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-actually, is it okay if I go use the bathroom and get a drink of water?\" you finally manage to blurt out, feeling sweat begin to bead on your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, your teacher motions towards the door. \"Make it quick,\" he says, as you leap to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you're hunched over the sink, splashing your face with water as cold as you could make it. Looking into the mirror, you notice your cheeks are flush, and your heart is pounding. You reach out for a paper towel to dry your face, you close your eyes and take a deep breath. \"Stay calm,\" you whisper to yourself, repeating it softly as you try to get your emotions under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, isn't this a coincidence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar voice behind you causes your heart to start racing again. Opening your eyes, you spin around to see Andy grinning mischieviously behind you. You audibly gasp, surprised not only to see him at all, but also to realize he's now looking down at you, several inches taller than he had been at lunchtime. His shirt is now almost skin tight, completely untucked with a noticeable rift of orange and white fur visible around his stomach. Several of the buttons on his chest seem to be ready to pop off at any moment, and you wonder how he could even walk comfortably without causing any of it to rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy seems not to notice or care about that all -- indeed, all his attention is fixed on you. Glancing to the side, you realize that the two of you are alone in the bathroom - a fact that Andy seems to also be all too aware of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Andy!\" you finally exclaim. \"W-what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to use the bathroom, brainiac,\" he giggles. \"Seems like I picked the right time to too.\" He takes a step closer to you, causing you to lean back against the still-running sink. \"Imagine, Jesse, when I go here we could be together like this like every day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't think of anything to say in reply to that, and Andy takes your silence as a cue to take another step closer, reaching out and placing his paw on your shoulder. Your brain says you should be frightened by having someone who's now bigger than you in this position -- but every other part of you is incredibly turned on. And judging by the bulge he now has pressed against your stomach, the same is true with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait. \" you finally say, softly pushing him away. \"Andy, we can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of disappointment in his soft green eyes and the slight drooping of his ears tears you up inside. \"Why, Jesse? What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I -- I mean,\" you gulp, \"we <i>are</i> brothers, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corners of his lips turn upward slightly as his whiskers twitch, as he says... </span></div></div>",

You reach for his chest, shocked at the tautness of his shirt fabric, nearly unyielding amidst his broad, older chest. It's enough to make you whimper a little as your eyes dart up to his. His muzzle is close enough to pick up the soft musk of his fur, and you close your eyes as he separates your legs with his own. With a fevered, soft gasp, you feel yourself losing the battle as your length slides up against your waistband, throbbing hotly against the weight of his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You gulp and shudder a little. You can't deny that you're starting to lose control of your breath as your chest feels like it's being filled with a warm relaxant.

You try to say no; to yourself or to him, you're not sure. You know you want to tell him to stop, but it's almost like the more you're around him, the more infectious he is. Of course\u2013 <i>of course</i> you want to tell him to stop\u2026 but\u2026 every move he makes seems to make you feel more exposed\u2026 it's too late to say anything, isn't it\u2026?

You whine quietly as his paws pull up your shirt, sliding his silky pads and downy fur across your chest. The back of your head is nearly touching the mirror, and you moan pitifully as he buries his muzzle into your neck, giving soft nibbles and kisses all the way to your shoulder. His velvety ears flick against yours, and you start to become aware of his paws hooking around the hem of your pants \u2013 dangerously close to your raging hard-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Staring up at you lustfully, your brother slides his chest down yours, nuzzling his whiskers against your pale skin after each affectionate peck - meanwhile stopping to give soft licks. You can't take it; you grip the sink and moan. It's too much, and with a panting glance downward, you can see that your brother knows it. He gives you a sultry smile while his paw massages your groin, and you cry out weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A\u2026 Andy\u2013!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I would hope my younger brother would know better than to try and hide these things from me,\" he begins, giving that familiar look of mischief. \"After all, wasn't I the one who discovered your hidden girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It takes a few seconds to register, but you know for a fact you're not hearing things this time.

Her expectations were low for those who didn't procrastinate a lot, but by that standard it was pretty high for just about everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hold the door open for Andy again, but he doesn't seem to be as upbeat as he usually is. You watch him go sit in the front left corner, and you decide to sit down next to him. You walk over to the neighboring desk, and as you drop off your bag in front of it, your brother asks you a question you didn't quite hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Repeat that, Andy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sure you want to sit next to me?\" he asks. \"I mean, you seemed pretty freaked out this morning about being near me and all..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You see his constant smile missing from his face, and his ears seem to be out of his control when it comes to emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aw, man, you know I like being around you! It's just.. well, I'll tell you about it later.\" His expression remains forlorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hesitate for a moment, and it feels like an adrenalized eternity before you hug him and pat him on his back. He just remains rigid for a couple of seconds, and then pats you back before pulling a bit tighter. \"Thanks, Jess. I guess I just feel a little neglected, and then I don't know many people at this school, so I just felt a bit lonely.\" You almost forget to break the hug, but you remember in just enough time to be less than awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anything for a brother of mine,\" you say, smiling. He gives you a smile that just makes you want to tackle him and cuddle, so you look away and shake your head a little violently. <i>He's your sibling; get ahold of yourself.</i> You begin to wonder if he's actually biologically related to you now, before he interrupts your thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jesse.. I..\" He hesitates for a while. He has a determined yet sad look in his eye. \"I.. I know-\" The shrill ring of the bell interrupts him, and not long after, Ms. Maria comes in. You hoped he would continue, but Ms. Maria is already speaking about the agenda when she walks in, so you give an 'it's fine' look to your brother before adjusting yourself back into your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hola, buenos tardes!\" Your class responds the same. \"C\u00f3mo est\u00e1s?\" She asks to Andy. He hesitates for a moment before replying, \"Muy..\" Mrs. Maria finishes with \"..bien. Muy bien.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You thought about how you haven't seen any other anthropomorphic animals around, yet you wonder why everybody everywhere seems to have already acknowledged his species for a while now. You think that maybe since the people in your neighborhood and town are so tight knit together, they've gotten used to it in the past thirteen years. Who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of class drags on as you practice math in your head to keep your mind off of Andy. When that didn't work, you played piano on your fingers. Finally, you sat back in your seat and glanced over at Andy. Mrs. Maria allowed him to work on other things for the time being since he hadn't taken Spanish class since the sixth grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You notice Andy's shorts tented again, and his nerves show in his ears again. You think back to yourself reading that vulpines have a much higher drive and sensitivity to any stimuli than humans are, and you convince that to yourself to keep yourself distracted from your sibling. You swear you're not gay. You've had a couple of girlfriends before, and have even come close to having relations with one. But you just couldn't keep your mind off of Andy. Your frustration builds until it seemingly ejects from your body in the form of ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The ringing turned out to be the bell for next hour, which shocked you out of your train of thought. You turn around to see Andy gazing off with his eyes half closed and a pleasant smile on his face, and his eyebrows are slightly upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Andy?\" He doesn't respond. \"Andy. Come on.\" You poke him on the shoulder and he blinks and looks around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You wanna tell me what you were going to earlier?\" He stares at you for a moment and says, \"Well.. later.. I'll tell.. I'll tell you later.\" He looks like he would be blushing right now as he gets up and grabs his bag. You look at him with one furrowed brow and then do the same as he heads out the door. You catch up to him, and you stand next to him. You look at him, and he seems to dart his eyes back and forth like he's going to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look, dude, whatever you're going to say, I won't hold it against you. It's not like anything is going to change, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Andy hesitates for a good 5 seconds, before saying, \"Jesse, can we talk about it after school?\" You nod, before he unexpectedly hugs you tightly. You are caught off guard, but you hug him back. He sniffs a seemingly teary sniff before pulling tighter. \"I promise you, Andy, we can talk about it.\" You ruffle his hair - really just slightly longer fur on the top of his head - before letting go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just promise me you can keep it together for the rest of the day.\" You really do mean this. Those fox eyes give you the most pitiful feeling. <i>Please stop, Andy. You're gonna make me cry. Don't make me cry, Andy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The momentary humor in your head lets you give a smile, which serves to assure Andy into nodding. \"I will, Jess.\" He holds your hand for a moment, before letting go. Fear rockets up and down your spine, then embarrassment soaks into it, while all the time you want to hold it longer. You pat him on the shoulder without looking, lest you lose control of yourself. You decide to go in front of him mainly to avoid looking suspicious, but as you approach the classroom, Andy jogs past you and holds the door open for you instead. He smiles at you a little more than friendly with his eyebrows raised, while you pull an awkward smile before rushing a little fast into..</span></div></div>",

With a glance, you realize it was some kind of bipedal creature with thick brown fur\u2026 and it was coming right at you! <b>\u201cAaaah!\u201d</b> You scream in surprise, jumping back. Your scream seems to startle the creature, and it freezes in place, staring at you wide-eyed. <b>\u201cWhat the hell is that!?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole family was looking at you strangely now, as if taken aback by your outburst. They didn\u2019t seem to even notice the furry creature standing in the middle of the dining room. <b>\u201cHey! S-stay back!\u201d</b> You cried out when the animal took a step closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cJesse, get a hold of yourself!\u201d</b></span> Your mother demanded. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cHe\u2019s your <i>brother</i>!\u201d</b></span> You realize that the creature seemed to be wearing your brother\u2019s uniform. Was this some sort of joke?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny! Keep it away from me!\u201d</b> You cried. You\u2019d always been nervous around large animals, and at around five feet, this one looks like it could maul you. However, to your surprise, it spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cJ-Jesse?\u201d</b></span> The bipedal animal whimpered, and you were shocked to hear your brother\u2019s voice coming from its mouth. Before you could respond, the shivering animal started sobbing loudly, covering its face with its paws as it turned away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cThat\u2019s it, mister!\u201d</b></span> Your mother stood up, pointing at you angrily. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cOut of this kitchen! Out, out, out!\u201d</b></span> Dazed and confused, you were herded easily out of the kitchen, forced out into the living room. Meanwhile, your mother bent over to soothe the crying animal. <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>\u201cOh\u2026 it\u2019s okay, sweetheart\u2026 don\u2019t cry...\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShellshocked, you walk over and sit on the couch, your mind unable to process what you had just seen. What was that creature? It looked like a human, but\u2026 not. Why did it have your brothers voice, and your brother\u2019s uniform? You dwell on these questions for a while until your father stomps into the room. <span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cWhat has gotten into you!?\u201d</b></span> He says, barely restraining his anger. <span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cAndy\u2019s bawling his eyes out! He thinks you\u2019re scared of him now!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThat\u2019s Andy?\u201d</b> You said, your heart sinking. Why would your brother have fur now? Something terrible must\u2019ve happened to him \u2014 something disfiguring. <b>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what happened to him\u2019?\u201d</b></span> He raised a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHe\u2019s an\u2026 he\u2019s an\u2026\u201d</b> You insist. <b>\u201c... animal now!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe freezes, as if in disbelief at what you just said, before narrowing his eyes. <span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cJesse, I am extremely disappointed in you. I don\u2019t know if you think this is funny or whatever, but the poor boy gets bullied enough as it is,\u201d</b></span> he said as he rubbed his forehead, with that familiar restrained anger in his voice. <span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cNow, when you get home from school, you are grounded from your electronics, from going out, from everything. You\u2019ll use the free time to make things up to your little brother. Do you understand?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cDad\u2026\u201d</b> You stuttered, confused and overwhelmed. Why is he treating this like it\u2019s completely normal? You just want answers. <b>\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026 understand\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cNo, I <i>don\u2019t</i> understand why you\u2019re acting this way. But you\u2019re putting a stop to it, right now. There is nothing wrong with your brother, and I don\u2019t want to hear you say a word otherwise,\u201d</b></span> your father insists, his voice shaking as he tries to subdue his anger. <span class=\"clgreen\"><b>\u201cNow go eat breakfast. You have to be at school in thirty minutes.\u201d</b></span> Despite your confusion, his tone of voice makes it clear that arguing with him wouldn\u2019t be a good idea, so you slink shamefully back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice your mother comforting Andy in the back. When he sees you, he darts away, as if hiding from you. You almost feel a little guilty, but confusion dominates your mind first and foremost. Even at school that day, the curious condition of your brother still haunted you, distracting you from class completely. You\u2019ve always been a big fan of anthropomorphic animals; perhaps that has something to do with it? Then again, you didn\u2019t think such animals existed, and certainly didn\u2019t think your brother was one of them. In all of your memories, as far back as you can remember, he was human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your question for information, you try asking some of your friends and peers. According to everyone you talk to, \u2018anthros\u2019 are people who were born with a rare medical condition that gives them animal features, and your brother has always been one. One of your friends even notes off-hand that Andy is an otter, which further intrigues you. Otters had always been your favorite animals. That couldn\u2019t just be a coincidence, could it? Perhaps your wish to meet an anthro in real life had finally come true, in the most unexpected of ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever you had a chance, you tried to search online for anything that might explain why you remember Andy so differently from everyone else. In all your searches, a single phrase reappeared; the mandela effect. Most of it didn\u2019t seem applicable to your situation, but one idea intrigued you; the theory that those with these different memories might be travellers from another timeline altogether. If that\u2019s true, then you weren\u2019t misremembering this; it\u2019s just Andy\u2019s always been an anthro in this timeline. Surely, such a theory was ridiculous\u2026 but you couldn\u2019t come up with any better explanations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drove back home, you decided to just act natural from here on out. Maybe you\u2019ll just have to get used to the fact that this is the way things are now. Regardless of what his species may be, Andy is still Andy. You return home to find the house strangely hush, your sister on the couch in the living room, giving you a strange look. Your brother seemed cheerful as ever, though, curled up on his bed with a comic book. <b>\u201cHey, Andy,\u201d</b> you said awkwardly, standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you have a better look at his new form, he doesn\u2019t look so bad. He looked just like, well, Andy, but with fur and a tail. His face looked different, too, with a black, button nose and big, brown eyes; it was actually kind of adorable. You didn\u2019t know why you were so scared of him earlier. This was your first chance to meet a real anthro! <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cO-oh, hey, Jesse,\u201d</b></span> he says, giving you a fake smile, although it was obvious he was nervous. Seeing just how timid he was around you now made you feel like a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cLook, Andy. I\u2019m really, really sorry about how I acted this morning. I\u2019ve just been all messed up lately, and I wasn\u2019t thinking straight,\u201d</b> you say, rubbing the back of your head, <b>\u201cand, uh\u2026 I want to make it up to you.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cS-so\u2026 you\u2019re taking me to the pool?\u201d</b></span> He asks, perking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him, confused. <b>\u201c... what?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOh, well, I just figured\u2026 I mean, the pool\u2019s my favorite place, so\u2026\u201d</b></span> He deflects, looking a little embarrassed to have jumped the gun. You were still confused. Since when did Andy love the pool so much? He hated swimming. Then you realized; he\u2019s an otter now. Of course he likes swimming. You wonder what other things have changed in this timeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c... alright, let\u2019s go to the pool,\u201d</b> you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe instantly leapt into the air in excitement! <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWoohoo!\u201d</b></span> He cheers, his demeanor changing completely. You chuckled, walking off and letting the otter get ready. You never saw human Andy get so excited over something so small. Perhaps this change wasn\u2019t so bad after all...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no doubt about it, your sister had the visage of a lioness. You stared at her in disbelief as she made her way to the kitchen and prepared a simple breakfast of cereal. Instinctively you knew that it was your older sister but you couldn't get over the fact that she had somehow transformed into an anthropomorphic lion overnight. Even worse was how you were the only one that was noticing the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like her hair had receded and redistributed itself across her whole body as she was now covered in sandy-blonde fur resembling that of a lion, the fur lightening a bit on her front. She was wearing a loose white tank top and some shorts, the clothing showing off her fit physique that was still visible under her short fur. Trying not to stare at her toned, fuzzy legs you noticed that her feet had been replaced with a pair of digitgrade paws and that a tawny tail was swaying low behind her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKira also now had a strong feline-like muzzle and as she started pouring the cereal into a bowl she let out a yawn that showed off her white pointed teeth and long rough tongue. Her rounded ears were flat against her head which made her look grumpy, though it was more likely she had not fully woken up yet. Or at least you hoped; her new animal facade gave her the look of a predator and you would hate to end up at the end of those teeth or the sharp claws she now had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she had got her breakfast ready and sat down at the table to eat. In a fit of confusion you just pointed at her. \"You're a lion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira lazily turned to face you, looking very unamused. Her irises had also changed colour to a vibrant gold and they bored into you as she stared. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you a lion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be rude,\" Wesley interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, are you trying to make some kind of joke or something? Because I don't get it,\" Kira said. Her tail was flicking about behind her like an annoyed cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked between the rest of your family. Were they really unaware that she transformed overnight into an apex predator from the African savannahs? \"No really, before today you were a human just like us. Am I really the only one noticing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore confused looks were exchanged around the table. Suddenly, a chair skid along the ground as Kira stood up and moved towards you, grabbing your arm and dragging you to the next room over. She guided you back against a wall and leaned over you with one of her hands pressed against the wall above you. Among the other changes you were sure that she must have gained a few good inches of height as well which only made her look more intimidating as she stood over you. You just meekly stood there as she stared at you with her golden eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long she broke the silence.</span></div></div>",

It was looking like another monotonous, uneventful day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, other than explaining to your girlfriend why you had to bail on plans to hang out over the weekend. Hopefully that wasn't going to be too big of a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you made your way down the halls something felt... off. Maybe it was just your imagination, but it felt like a lot of people were staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t your imagination. Everyone was staring at you; and they didn\u2019t look happy to see you. Some even looked downright hostile as you made your way to your locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour locker was a wreck. None of the lockers in your school looked pristine by any means, but your\u2019s and your\u2019s alone looked like it'd been worked over with a bat. Dents and scratches had taken off a fair amount of the paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulti-colored flecks speckled the door, as if numerous layers of graffiti had been scrubbed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked a bit closer and saw the word \u201cpervert\u201d clumsily scratched into the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour best friend Dallas paid you no mind as he pulled his books out of the adjacent locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, did something go on here this weekend,\" you said motioning to your vandalized locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? You\u2019re still surprised at this point? You really are dense, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas walked off to class, giving his locker door a melodramatic slam as he went. Leaving you to just stand and wonder what that was all about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was your weekend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze for a second when you heard Selena's voice. You didn't hear her walk up behind you. Time to face the music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath. She didn\u2019t sound too angry. You pasted on your best smile and turned to smooth things over<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, sorry we didn\u2019t get to hang out on Saturday. I had a last minute family....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words died in your mouth as you turned around. Standing in place of Selena was a large, humanoid...</span></div></div>",

There was a large bipedal cougar girl standing in front of you, in a school uniform no less, looking rather cross at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were frozen hard this time. The seemingly logical part of your brain wanted to flee in response to being two feet away from a dangerous predator. The rest was just struck dumb from the sheer oddity of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut the corner of your eye you could see other students shuffling past, paying this surreal encounter with no more than a few disapproving glances. Why wasn't anyone doing anything?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? Has it been so long you don't recognize me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Selena's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer, that was Selena's wavy black hair. Those were her sparkling green eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was clearly the locket you'd gotten her for her birthday, but instead of a chain, it was now set on a black, collar-like choker tight around her cream-colored throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Selena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo pointy ears poked out from her shiny black hair and twitched slightly at errant hallway sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had two little black stripes curving up each side of her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to say something, anything, but the words just wouldn't come out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ears flattened in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? Do I have something on my face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed her eyes toward the nose on the end of her muzzle and dabbed her thick, paw-like hands at the imagined mess on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... I... I mean...\" was all you could sputter out before Selena remembered what she came here for. She wrapped her fuzzy, black-tipped fingers around your wrist and gave you a tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school kept the lights off in the gym as much as possible to save money, so it was still dark this early in the morning. The dim light from the exit signs was apparently enough for Selena to see by as she lead you by the hand to a secluded spot behind the bleachers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was reeling. Was this really Selena?  What happened?  And how? And what was she planning to do with you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena turned back toward you. Her green eyes gave off an eerie glow as they caught glints of what little light there was in the empty gymnasium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Saturday was our six month anniversary, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selena, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could voice any of your... many, many objections, Selena placed a thick, furred finger up to your mouth to silence you. You could feel a sharp claw slightly scratching the top of your lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually don't mind that you didn't remember, but I am sad I didn't get to give you your gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even think of something to say, she grabbed you by the shoulders and pulled you in close, pressing her muzzle to your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue had a weird, rough texture as it pushed between your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain was screaming in thirty different directions at once. In the end, you decided to do the one thing that makes sense in this situation and kissed her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena responded as you leaned into her, feeling the sharp pin pricks of her teeth as your tongue slid past them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Selena closed her eyes, you could hear a soft purr rumbling in her chest. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wouldn't care to admit how much time you've spent looking at them, or how long you've imagined meeting a <i>real</i> one, but this is not imagination. This is real. There's an anthro fox living next door to you. You don't know how long you've been staring, but you know when he notices, and it scares you out of your mind. The next thing you know, he's at the fence line and looking you in the eye.. smiling. Your brain, it being its paranoid self, interprets the situation as a threat. This creature doesn't exist, and if it does, it probably will hurt you in ways you don't imagine. However, your mixed feelings throw your flight/fight response off and your feet freeze into place while your legs try to move, and you twist awkwardly without your consent and you collapse, the blood draining from your head momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Woah, dude, are you okay?\" You hear a voice of a teenage boy somewhere above your head, and you open your ey- wait, they were already open. Your vision floods back shakily and accompanied by the worst ringing of the ears you could imagine. You hear the question repeated, but you're still getting used to reality again and you can only half comprehend the fence post in the corner of your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Time seems to speed up, and within a couple seconds you're on your feet again with the help of some hairy.. oh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turn your head to see the fox's face, though you find an unexpected expression of concern on it. You nod your head after a few seconds and stand up correctly, hesitating to thank the vulpine. \"Uh.. yeah... thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You think some more and realize that he's on the other side of the fence now. <i>How did he go around it so fast, unless he jumped? No, there wasn't enough time for him to do that..</i> Your thoughts are interrupted by a question you didn't quite hear. Ringing ears, am I right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry, what?\" You ask shakily. The fox chuckles and nuzzles your ear unexpectedly while saying, \"Aw, I know you heard me if I heard myself.\" You pout at him knowingly, and he laughs. He moved in yesterday and he's acting like a close friend... Well, more like man's best friend, anyway, considering you don't know any close friends who nuzzle a muzzle in your sch- okay I'm done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kid, you look pale.

You nod and agree; this guy is kind of likable, despite him being an.. animal. You're torn between avoiding him forever and making friends. Those damn sociable people. He walks you over to the door, and out of the corner of your eye you see him just.. smiling. He's just a happy guy from the looks of it. It reminds you of how moody you could be when you were younger, and occasionally recently. You almost envy him. What the hell is going on? He's like a best friend, but he's an animal and you've never met him before? Your thoughts end by the time you notice your mom examining your head to see if you're okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Honey, you need to be more careful,\" your mother says almost cooingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You feel like such a kid.

What the hell?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your thinking is punctured by your mom's delicate, yet oh so valuable question, \"Do you want to stay home, or do you think you'll be alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You jump with happiness inside, but you have things to consider. There's that fox, and there's no guarantee that you won't get chores once you seem to be better.. but who's to say that one or both parents won't be out today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, Jesse?\" You feel the deepest part of your brain cringing at the fox knowing your name without your consent.

Dallas stands there, looking straight at you, blinking a moment his gaze going back and forth before he looks around to the sides of his own house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse, you okay? Wait, is there someone doing something?\" He looks around again, not finding any perpetrators, he twist back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a hold of yourself, you work up the nerve to give him a little smile before stepping closer to the fence.

He was wearing a t-shirt and some shorts, his long bushy tail coming out of the back and wagging slowly behind him. Dallas' body was also a bit more toned than what you remember as well. This was all impossible though, no one could've turned into an entirely different species at the drop of a hat. It had to be a trick maybe he was wearing a costume, and this was being recorded on tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour best friend opens his mouth to speak, just as you jump back to his surprise, his tall ears standing at attention as you point at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a joke, isn't?

Dallas then proceeded to sniff the air a little and walk around, soon after, he simply shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Jesse, if there were anyone sneaking around, I would know!\" He points at himself before looking curiously over you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you would, but what's with the new look?\" Your voice edges into worry, and after his nose twitched, Dallas seems even more bothered himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New look, what new look, I've always looked like this, and you know these are my favorite shirt and shorts, bud. That's not what I'm concerned about though, are you afraid of me?\" He asked, he seemed genuinely hurt at the thought of scaring you, and more than a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to assuage his fears you shake your head briskly. \"Of course not, just a little surprised is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas seemed to take that for what you meant, or at least tried to mean and settled down again, his muzzle turning back up into a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure. Listen, up for our usual plans?\" He ask, smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all this surprise of him being a dog, you had forgotten what you guys were going to do, you nod your head.</span></div></div>",

Two very large, warm, soft objects are now on either side of your head, smothering you like giant bags of Jell-O. \"What the-?!\" You sputter out, but the fleshy prison you've been enveloped in muffles your voice so much that all that comes out is a faint \"Mmph mph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, whoops! Sorry, Jesse!\" Mia hurriedly apologizes; you feel a pair of strong hands grab onto your back and extract you from your soft suffocation, allowing you to gasp for air as you take in the new Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite fur covers her skin, occasionally dappled with large black spots, and her hands each have three thick fingers and a thumb all ending in large hoof-like nails in the place of regular digits. Her legs are also different, now digitigrade and ending in large cloven hooves, and you can see a thin cow tail with a baby blue ribbon tied in it flicking at the air nervously. Her head is the most changed part of her, however - it is now unmistakably the head of a cow, complete with a small pair of horns, although the features of the face are still quite sorted, more human in shape, including the light grey eyes that you know are Mia's. But your friend's anatomical changes pale in comparison to the changes bestowed upon her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia's body, once quite lean and boyish, is now incredibly curvy, with wide hips, a large meaty rump, and thick thighs. Her waist isn't narrow or slim, but rather quite thick and more than a little bit soft with pudge; in fact, pretty much all of her is covered in a noticeable layer of fat now. And hanging from her chest are without a doubt the largest breasts you've ever seen. Each one looks to be a bit bigger than a watermelon, straining against the fabric of her dress, and you can see her nipples, each as thick as your thumb and proudly erect, through the thin cloth. Mia's also grown much taller; she used to be about your height, but now you are just below eye level with her massive mammaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You okay there, Jesse?\" Mia asks as you stare open-mouthed at her. \"If you keep your mouth open any longer, you might catch a few flies.\" After a few more seconds, you still have yet to process the fact that your old friend is now the textbook definition of a bombshell, and your friend-turned anthro can't help but giggle.<br>\r\n\"I swear, Jesse, you can be an absolute goof sometimes.\" Then she does something almost as unexpected as her transformation: She leans down and kisses you on the cheek. \"And I love you for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Well, this is different. You <i>did</i> have a bit of a crush on Mia at first, but that eventually gave way to a more platonic bond. But now she's apparently your girlfriend?! Granted, it's not that you're necessarily <i>complaining</i> about it - on the contrary, this is practically the stuff that your wet dreams are <u>made</u> of - but it's still quite the bomb to drop.<br>\r\n\"Now, c'mon, big guy!\" You hear Mia say as she takes your hand in her larger one and begins to lead you somewhere with a smile...</span></div></div>",

Selena had been out sick for a while and you haven't seen too much of her lately. You were beginning to be afraid that she'd suspect you of finding somebody else, so you invited her to go to the movies once she was feeling better. You look at your phone at the text message that Selena sent you. She had told you that she had made a full recovery and that she would see you at the theater. However, she was still a no show. \"Where on Earth could Selena be? She said that's she'd meet me here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you ponder the situation, you hear loud booming noises and feel the ground shaking. \"What the?!\" you ask. \"What's happening!? Earthquake? It can't be. The town isn't anywhere near a fault line. But something is shaking the ground. Whoa!\" You fall to the ground and then you feel a large shadow on you. \"Hi, Jesse.\" Says a familiar voice. You recognized that voice instantly. \"Selena?\" you ask as you stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in utter surprise because Selena looked different somehow. She still had long black hair and she still wore glasses, but Selena was no longer human. She was now a 12ft tall brown-skinned rhinoceros with two large horns on her nose. Her body was a combination of fat in some places and pure muscle in other places and looked as if she weighed 3 tons. Her jeans and shirt were so tight on her body that they looked like they were tattooed on and her pant legs were coming apart at the seams. She was so huge that she had to bend over to be at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of such a huge rhino so close to you terrified you and her front horn was dangerously close to your head. As you were trembling, Selena gave you a large kiss that enveloped most of your face and nearly caused you to groan out of fear of being suffocated. \"Sorry I'm late, Jesse,\" says your pachyderm girlfriend. \"At least I'm not late for the movie.\" You just continue to stare at Selena. \"Selena?\" you ask. \"Have you noticed anything different about yourself today?\" Selena snorted in confusion. \"Whatever do you mean?\" You see her huge rear looming in the air with her tail wagging and then bend over to get a good look under Selena's massive belly to see her huge hoofed feet and then you look back at her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I put this?\" you ask as you twiddle your fingers. \"Uh... Selena. You're an enormous rhinoceros.\" Selena looks at you, even more confused than before. \"Yeah,\" said Selena. \"So?\" \"So?! You weren't a rhinoceros last time I saw you!\" Selena snorts and rises up. \"Did you hit your head, Jesse? I've always been a rhinoceros.\" Before you can say anything, Selena takes out her wallet and shows a picture of her as a child that you remember seeing, but to your surprise, the photograph depicted her as a young rhinoceros with smaller horns than she has now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. Were you going crazy? Have you lost your mind. You don't remember Selena ever being a big, huge and fat anthropomorphic rhinoceros until today but if the photographic is anything to go by, she's been a rhinoceros ever since the day she was born. But how could you only realize this now? And how on Earth did you wind up with a 3 ton pachyderm for a girlfriend. Before you can say anything else, your girlfriend picks you up and carries you like a handbag to the movie theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jesse,\" says your rhino girlfriend as she ducks down to go into the theater. \"What are we seeing today?\"</span></div></div>",

One day you wake up, and someone you know has somehow changed into an anthropomorphic animal version of themselves!

Well, you're about to find out\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile a furry transformation is the most obvious subject here, feel free to include any other fetishes or interests! I know I will include lots of growth, as that's my favorite! Just make sure that a) whenever you introduce a new interest, you allow for different interests in the other choices, and b) while it's fine to add on other interests and fetishes on top of ones established in previous chapters, once an interest has been introduced, try keeping it a factor in subsequent chapters in that storyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's a list of some of the characters you might come across:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJESSE'S FAMILY<br>\r\nJesse - MAIN CHARACTER - 17, medium-length blonde hair, average build - a creative mind and a bit of a nerd, has always had an interest in anthros - high school junior<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy - Jesse's younger brother - 13, shaggy red hair, skinny - hyperactive and a bit of a handful, gets on Jesse's nerves sometimes but they get along. - eighth grader<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira - Jesse's older sister - 19, long sandy-blonde hair, fit build - studious and hard-working, but knows how to have a good time - lives at home while attending community college<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley - Jesse's father - 39, short blonde hair, slightly overweight - a good provider for the family, usually busy with work but makes time to spend with the family when it counts - manages local office of a national insurance agency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie - Jesse's mother - 38, long red hair, average build - emphasis on cleanliness and manners, has a midwestern politeness to her that's hard to miss - stay-at-home mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore will be added to this list as they're added to the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost importantly, HAVE FUN!</td>",
