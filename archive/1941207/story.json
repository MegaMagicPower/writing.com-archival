While she was walking, lost in her thoughts, Goku was following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Grandpa? I want to be alone right now\" said Pan as she stopped and turne her head towards Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we might catch up on things since I've been gone. We used to be close\" replied Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And whose fault is that?! You're the one who left at the tournament and never visited for years while you were training your new student!\" yelled Pan as she glared at Goku with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku gulped as Pan's glare reminded him of Chi-Chi and Videl and said \"I'm sorry, Pan. I know I'm not a good father or grandfather, but I'm sorry. Can I make it up to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right you're not a good grandfather. In fact, with the way you are now, I'm not sure I should call you Grandpa anymore. I mean, I <i>am</i> taller than you now. What do you think, Goku?\" asked a now smiling Pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku was shocked to hear Pan call him by just his name. He could feel something was changing between him and Pan, but he had no idea where this was headed. All he knew was that Pan seemed to no longer consider him her grandfather anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Goku\", said a now excited Pan. \"You want to make it up to me? Then you can do it by doing exactly as I tell you today. And apology accepted, Goku.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan grabbed Goku's hand and dragged Goku along to enjoy the rest of her day now that she was in a good mood again. She was also surprised by how easy it felt to call her grandpa by his name now that he was a kid again. She could feel things changing between them, but she had no idea where they were headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh well', thought Pan. 'It's not important right now.

As she pulled Goku to the ticket booth and looked over the list of movies.  Seeing a Disney movie for little kids Pan bought tickets to Emperor's New Groove and pulled Goku after her.  Knowing Goku's appetite Pan bought some snacks a small soda and kiddy popcorn for Goku and an extra large drink and supersized popcorn for her.   Having Goku carry his own food Pan lead him into the almost deserted theater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan choose a seat in the very back of the theater and pushed Goku into the aisle making him spill half his popcorn onto the floor.  \"That was a quite naughty Goku that is all the snack you are getting for the whole movie,\" Pan said trying to hide a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come on Pan that is not fair,\" Goku whinnied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so Goku?\" Pan said placing her hands on her hips and glaring at Goku as if he should be happy with what he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, for a full grown Sayian this is hardly a mouth full,\" Goku pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah but you are no longer a full grown Sayian but I see your point so I guess I could give you some of my popcorn,\" Pan said laying a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will, thanks Pan,\" Goku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I said I could not that I would to earn your popcorn you are going to have to let me...</span></div></div>",

Goku having never really received a spanking before began to get up only to have Pan place her one of her elbows on his back to hold him down.  Cracking her knuckles Pan lifted one hand into the air and brought it down hard onto Goku's bottom making a loud smack in the empty theater accompanied by a soft yelp from Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that was not ready yet,\" Pan said bringing her hand up again and using it to crack her neck before landing her second blow that if she had been spanking Goku over an armrest of a seat she would have pounded him into the ground of the theater.  \"Ah that's better,\" Pan said as she got into the flow of the spanking first doing a couple of swats to one cheek and than the other before doing some that landed right in the middle of Goku's bottom.  By the time she was done with this first set of spankings Goku was already tearing up as twin rivers of tears flowed down his cheeks though he tried not to show it Pan was really hurting him.  Pan could only laugh at the ways Goku was trying not to show how much pain she was causing him first basically humping her lap with every swat to hopefully reduce the power of her blows but also holding his hands to his mouth and biting them to stop himself from crying out in pain.

Still with that sweet smile of her face Pan performs a simple flick of her wrist and Goku finds himself on the ground at her feet his hand still caught in hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see that is your problem Goku you rely too much on your strength that you rarely use your mind see how I was able to use such a simple maneuver to transfer the force you gave me and send it back at you,\" Pan said before doing another flick of her hand to flip Goku over so he was lying on the ground with his hand being held in the middle of his own back.  \"You know if I wanted to I could uses simple skills to break your arm,\" Pan said conversationally as if she was just discussing the weather. At first Goku did not believe her and was about to say as much before she began to put pressure on his arm by holding it out to its full extension before she kneels on it with just a small portion of her weight.  \"I told you to come at me with full strength or I would lose all respect for you, and you did to a degree but only slightly.  While you used the full strength of your base form I know you could have gone Super Sayian or higher, did you ever think the reason I wanted that was to actually have a challenge?\" Pan asked as she shifted her body to put Goku in hold as she kept his arm extended as she wrapped her feet around it in a leg hold her feet pressed painfully into Goku's head.  \"But I guess even that would not have been a challange if this is how weak you are at the maximum of your base,\" Pan said as she kicked off her shoes so she could press her bare feet into Goku's face.

All he gets, however, is a laugh from Pan when he suddenly realizes that his body is producing no glow that was standard for his Super Sayain form.  \"Is that all you got Goku?\" Pan asked performing another simple maneuver so she was now sitting on Goku's chest with her leg's trapping his hands to the ground and his head between her legs.  Goku could not figure out why he was unable to transform maybe his current body could not handle it or possibly the humiliation he was experiencing at the hands, well technically feet, of his granddaughter had something to do with it.  In truth it did not really matter for Pan had already proven that at his base form he was no match for her so for the first time during the match he used his brain to think of a way to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan for her part was just content to sit on Goku's chest with his head between her perfect thighs and arms pinned under her muscular legs grinning to herself on how easily she had bested Goku and for the moment not feeling the need to gloat, at least yet.  Trying to move Pan even and inch and failing Goku sunk into a thoughtful mood thinking of how he could win when he suddenly remembered the trip back to the house Pan had struggled to keep up with him meaning that while she had power greater by him by an unknown amount he did have the advantage of speed.  Making a plan in his mind he suddenly became aware that Pan was slowly closing her thighs around his head.  Taking a deep breath Goku collected himself to perform a burst of speed and hopefully not only throw Pan off but, also embarrassingly, run away.

As she felt the water invigorate her Pan told Gidget to wash her back as she leaned forward.  Happy to have something to do Gidget knelt down behind Pan and began to gently rub her back with the soapy water of the tube before rinsing it off.  Once Gidget had finished with her back Pan lifted one of her feet out of the tub and told her maid to clean that as well before cleaning her other foot.  After Gidget had cleaning her Pan turned to her new maid and said, \"Okay Gidget hope in it is your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um but Miss Pan there is not enough room for me in there,\" Goku said looking scared that he was disobeying his Mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course there is my silly little maid,\" Pan said as she...</span></div></div>",

I eat a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan sighed as she knew that fact extremely well.Taking a small breath, she looked at Gidget with less anger in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know very well.

When she looked back the boy was alone no longer hiding his tiny penis making her laugh again for she sometimes had to help her mama take care of her baby brother and she knew from changing his diapers he had a bigger penis than this boy did.  the young girl watched as Goku went to lie down on some grass and fall asleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching silently the snuck over only to step on an acorn just a step from the boy and partially slip so instead of standing over the boy her small foot comes down right on Goku's stomach waking him up. As he opens his eyes Goku thinks that Pan has returned with some clothing for him to wear but instead he is gazing up at a girl who is younger than he looks at the moment.  As she moves so the sun is no longer right behind her Goku sees she has strawberry blonde in a pair of pig-tails tied with one with a red bow the other pink.  The girl was wearing a bright yellow shirt with a fairy on it, short black shorts, white knee high socks and a pair of blue and pink tennis shoes, one of which was still resting on his stomach.  \"Um can you please take your foot of me now?\" Goku asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops sorry,\" the girl said lifting her foot of his chest only to trip on the acorn again and...</span></div></div>",

While the force of the kick was nothing special it somehow affect Goku making him begin to wonder if Pilaf's wish was beginning to affect his strength and power.  The girl is so sorry that she crotches on her knees to make sure Goku is okay, only for her to sit herself down on one of Goku's hands with one of her knees.  Goku lets out a gasp of pain as her bony knee digs into his hand but she mistakes it for a delayed reaction to being kicked in the face.  \"Oh you poor boy I did not mean to hurt you,\" the girl said as she starts to look around for the teenager who had been with him in the process grinding his hand into the ground under his knee making him wince.  \"Did your older sister abandon you out here alone don't worry I can take you to my place and we can call your folks to come pick you up,\" the girl said standing up letting Goku snatch back his hand and begin to shake it to get some feeling back into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl seeing the shaking hand thinks he needs some help getting up grabs it in a powerful grip and with a mighty pull get Goku to his feet.  The girl than, not letting go of Goku's hand, begins to lead him back to her house.  As she is leaving a clearing she pushes a branch aside and not even thinking about it letting it go as she is past so it snaps back right into Goku's face making him stumble.  The young ten year old girl not seeing this but feeling Goku stumble wonders if he is just to weak to walk back to her house so she turns back toward him letting go of his hand.  As soon as she does Goku turns back to the clearing not wanting Pan to show up and him not be there for fear of punishment, but before he could move a single step the young girl pulls him towards her before hooking a hand behind his knees and once more showing off strength she did not look like she possessed lifted Goku into a newlywed carry and began once more to her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked Goku tried to break free but found her grip was to strong making him really worry about his failing strength if a normal human ten year old girl could overpower him what chance did he have.  Not knowing the fears going through Goku's mind the girl just tried to comfort him saying he would be alright as she walked him home unconsciously rocking him as she would her baby brother when trying to comfort him.  Goku's found his fears begin to lessen as the girl walked feeling somewhat comforted for some reason as she walked as the rocking began to put him to sleep.  As he fell asleep the girl noticed and just smiled down at him especially when he stuck his thumb into his mouth and began to suck on it making her intone, \"Ah the little angle... I just hope we can finds some clothes for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at her home she found a note from her father that he had left on some household task taking her little brother along, and reminding her that her mom was on the business trip so to stay safe.  The girl smiled knowing her stay at home dad was taking the opportunity to go to town with her mother gone but she did not care as she had the naked boy in her hands which would have been awkward to explain to either parent.  The only problem was due to her family only having two kids both of which were smaller than the boy in her arms there would not be much cloths for him to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the boy down on the couch she decided the first thing she needed to get him was some undergarments and not really wanting to share any of hers or raid her parent's underwear there was only one option going over to the changing table she grabbed a diaper and brought it back.  As she had been trained she began to put the diaper on the boy being very thankful that he was smaller than her brother in the wee-wee department otherwise the diaper would not have fit.  Once he was diapered she begin to wonder about getting him some more clothes. </span></div></div>",

(Man this is even worse than what ever clothes Pan would have gotten me,) Goku thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's you name, why were you only in your underwear back there, what happened to your big sister, where are you from?\" the girl asked launching a barrage of questions at him kicking her feet over the edge of the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Goku, an accident, do you Pan and well...\" Goku answered a little put off by the girl who leaned in closer hanging onto his every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to me you Goku, I'm Rose,\" Rose said holding out her hand to shake Goku's who reluctantly took it and winced as her fingers tightened around his painfully.  \"Strong grip you got there are you a fighter?\" Goku asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, ha no silly I am only in fourth grade,\" Rose said giving Goku a friendly slap on his back which sends Goku tumbling off the couch an into a coffee table .  \"Ops sorry about that I did not know you were so weak,\" Rose said helping Goku to his feet \"you must be worn out from your trials in the forest let me get you something.\"  Rose than leaves a very worried Goku rubbing a bruise that was forming on his forehead and went to look for something to give him.  As she was too young, in her parents opinion to use either the microwave or oven unsupervised, she began to look for something to make for Goku but finding little food in the house, one of the reasons her father was gone to get some groceries, and with a full sink of dirty dishes she realized she would have nothing to serve him any way.  Rose was about to leave the kitchen empty handed when she was some bottles of baby food and checking that they were still good saw no other choice but to feed them to Goku so he could regain some strength after being in the woods for who knew how long.  Taking some of the containers of baby food she was about to leave when she though of a drink and saw there was only one clean drink holder left, her baby brother's bottle, shrugging Rose filled it with some milk they had and took along with the baby food out to Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found him about to sneak out of the house so she put down the tray of food and drink before literally picking him up and bringing him back to the couch before thinking better of it and going to a corner and pulling put her brother's high chair.  Rose sat Goku in it before gathering the food and placing it before him.  \"Oh don't pout I am sorry but these are the only bits of food and drink left in my house until my father comes home from the store and you need to eat to regain your strength,\" Rose said putting her hands on her hips and making her look a lot like Chi-Chi in Goku's eyes.</span></div></div>",

Goku's response was to clamp his mouth shut and turn his head away, unfortunately for him Rose was used to dealing with a picky eater as she placed the bottle of baby food down  and used her free hand to turn Goku's face back towards her.

Your Mom and I didn't really know how to respond and when I mentioned that you two were out together, she wondered if you would raise Goku yourself. She had gotten a scary look in her eyes when she said that and she thought it would be serve him right if his own granddaughter raised him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut don't worry.

Mom, your Grandma Chi-Chi of course, decided to put you in charge of Dad while we're all gone. We all agreed to calm her down a bit, but take that for a grain of salt.

If they got divorced and Chi-Chi moved out of Mount Paozu, then there would be nothing left in Pan's way to have complete control of Goku. With her mom on her side, her dad would likely go with the flow and she figured that her Uncle Goten wouldn't be an obstacle to her; if he took the opportunity to move out of Mount Paozu as well, that'd be perfect for Pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pan entered the room, she noticed that Goku was starting to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have a nice nap, Goku?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku looked at her in confusion for a moment until the memories from earlier came to his mind and he blushed in embarrassment.

Goodd job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku blushed and averted his eyes at the subtle reminder of what happened earlier and he just remained silent. Pan then went to explain to Goku that the rest of their family, due to Chi-Chi, would be staying with the Ox-King for the time being and that it would just be the 2 of them for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Goku, trying to fiure how he should feel about this. \"My marriage to Chi-Chi has never been smooth and with me as a kid, maybe it's a good thing that she's gone for now. At leastt she isnt screaming and yelling in my face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if Grandma decides she wants to get a divorce?\" asked Pan, teting the waters for Goku's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a divorce?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan dropped her jaw in surprise. \"You don't know what a divorce is? A divorce is a way to end a marriage. If you and Gandma got a divorce, you wouldn't be married anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing Pan's explanation, Goku still really didn't feel much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's because I'm a kid again or maybe it's because I've been away from home for years, but maybe a divorce wouldn't be a bad thing. Gohan and Goten are both adults now and Chi-Chi could maybe find a new husband if she wanted to. It really wouldn't be fair to her if I were to remain a kid. I guess I don't love her like that anymore if I think it's okay for her to remarry, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan remained silent but inside, she was happy. She had a hunch that Goku wouldn't be too against a divorce and here he confirmed it to her. She hoped that her Mom could help convince Chi-Chi to go through with the divorce.

Yes he had come face to face with one of his old enemies in the Pilaf gang and had planted a suggestion to Pilaf on wishing Goku into a kid again as Goku did not have the courage to do it himself.  With his new body he had gone to a new town where the women were taller and beautify only to run into his own Granddaughter the most lushes woman Goku had seen in ages, but she had to take him home to his estranged wife.  Chi-Chi's reaction was understandable but Goku had hardly paid attention as he had eyes for the slim muscular form of Pan licking his lips as he looked over her tight bare midriff.  As Chi-Chi stormed out taking basically the whole rest of their family with her Pan had come over leading to some new experiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at himself he wish that being diapered had not been one of them.  Getting tired of nothing but baby shows Goku turns off the TV and begins to stretch and do some small bit of working out throwing punches and kicks against imagined foes.

Pan still thought that this easy task was too much for Goku who she still thought looked like he belonged in diapers which made a plan form in her mind.  Asking her dad if she could go to Namek with Goku to make up for some lost time he agreed.

It took him a few minutes to remember where he was but not why he was cuddled up against a stuffed bear larger than he was.  As he kicked off the covers he was shocked to find he was no longer dressed in his normal clothing but a bright pink dress; thinking that Videl was having a laugh at him for losing Goku heads to the closet.  His heart sinks as he opens it up to find nothing but dresses of different colors all frilly and girly; thinking maybe some normal clothes would be in the dresser he look only to find it full of socks, panties, and pull-ups.  Goku gulps hoping against hope Videl was just pulling a prank on him until he spots Videl with his suitcase out the window as she struck a match and began to light it and all his normal clothing on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing Goku, Videl looks up at the window and smiles at him waving at him to come down.  Not wanting to fly out the window to her Goku exits the room hoping he would not run into Pan only to find her helping Videl at the fire burning all of his normal clothing, training gi and what looked like posters from World Martial Arts Tournament.  \"Ah you are finally awake Goku I guess I beat you harder than I thought I did you missed lunch but don't worry I can make you some thing a little latter,\" Videl said as Goku joined them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you destroying my clothing, Videl?\" Goku asked completely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for one you will not be needing them any more Goku after I defeated you I was going to explain to you the rules for you to follow as you live with us until Gohan, Goten, and Trunks get back but you passed out to soon.  The first was during your stay you will not train or have anything to do with martial arts, the second is that you will do chores and study, for Chi-Chi said you never really went to school as a kid, and I think that from now on you will refer to me either as Mom or Mrs. Videl,\" Videl said watching as Goku's mouth opens in shock at each new rule.  \"Oh yeah from now on Pan is going to be like your older sister,\" Videl said placing a hand on her daughter's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What no way I refuse,\" Goku said and begins to walk away only for Videl to shoot her hand out and catch him by the scruff of his dress and easily tossed him over her knee giving him a spanking.

I came back eventually like I said. And I'll return again too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\", said Bra as she didn't want to listen to his excuses. \"Come on in, Goku.

I know I should feel sad or angry or something, but I don't. Maybe it's because I thought marriage was food when I first promised to marry her and thus probably got married too early. But Mommy, you're helping me get a new slate and this ddivorce helps that, right? I'm free to marry or not marry in the future. And so is Chi-Chi.

In the upcoming days, Grandma and I will be be decorating the room, such as painting the walls, maybe we can take some pictures of us and put some up. Maybe add posters or something. I'm not sure all yet, but we will get this room to feel like a bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarron smiled at Goku and went to the dresser and got out some blue pajamas for Goku to wear. Goku started to undress himself, but Marron insisted on doing it herself, so Goku let her do it. Once Marron put the school niform in a corner to later put in the laundry, she tucked him into bed. When she was about to sleep, Goku asked for a bedtime story. This time, Marron retold the day's events but changed some things around, such as the names. Goku pointed out happily the main characters in the story were just like he and Marron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, Marron saw that Goku was sleeping and kissed him on the forehead before leaving Goku. </span></div></div>",

A movie would be good thought Marron as it would provide a reason for Goku to cuddle up with his new Mommy.  Smiling she sat Goku on the large fluffy couch as she begins to look through the movies they could watch ignoring anything over a PG rating after all she did not want to give Goku nightmares.  Finding a likely candidate she popped it into the player and as it loaded she excused her self with the excuse of getting some snacks for herself.  When she alone she pulled out her phone and made some calls smiling as she set Goku up for a play date for latter.

Sitting down on the couch and grabbing the remote Marron throws and arm around Goku pulling him in and making him lean into her body.  Starting the movie about an animated toaster and other appliances trying to find their \"master\" the pair started to watch.  As Marron had seen this movie numerous times growing up she spent most of the movie watching Goku to see he reaction to it.  She was mildly surprised that he seemed enthralled by it even hiding his face in his hands during a scene in which an living air conditioner basically killed itself before he cried gently into her shoulder during a sad scene.  At the movies conclusion in a junk yard where the characters of the show almost got crushed Goku hid his face in Marron's arms evidently too scared to watch any more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first movie Marron put in another one trying to make it even more childish she picks out a video that she would sometimes play with young kids she babysat in the genre of a kids first learning type where everything was extremely simple and overly explained the one Marron selected was about the history, non-fighting of their planet.  Once more Goku seemed engrossed by the movies and even talked to it when it prompted clapping his hands when he got it right acting for all the world like real little kid.  Marron could not determine if he was playing along with the video to impress his Mommy or not but she did not really care as she looked at her watches.  Suddenly there was a knock at the door, as Krillin was scrubbing the floor in the kitchen Marron went to answer it to find.</span></div></div>",

Not wanting to be told off again by his Mommy for being rude Goku gulped out, \"Um hello Amy,\" even going as far as giving a small wave as his tiny tormentor.  Marron on the outside looked like mother who was trying to repair a damage relationship between her son and a classmate but on the inside she was laughing her ass off at what his young three or four year old girl would do to the once protector of the universe that he would be unable to stop.  Amy walks slowly over to where Goku is almost visibly shaking on the couch with a pace that any prey was sure to recognize as that of a formidable predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we watching,\" Amy said hopping up to sit next to Goku making the taller boy tremble in fear at her proximity to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just some movies,\" Marron said sitting down on a nearby chair so she could see everything perfectly that would happen on the couch. Seeing the blow of popcorn Amy takes an handful and starts eating before grabbing the remote and changing the channel to s girly princess movie which made Marron smile for she had focused on movies that would help impact on Goku a child like quality or undermined his limited intelligence and now here was Amy showing power by taking the remote and choosing to watch something else, and also doing something that Goku would have been punished for of touching the remote without permission.  As the movie started full of songs and girls in pretty pink dresses Amy pulled Goku closer to her and no matter how much he struggled was unable to pull himself away.  He looked over at his Mommy but Marron would not catch his eye as she pretended to watch the new movie on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring one overly happy scene Amy pulled Goku into a hug as if overjoyed but just wanted to see if she could hurt him again.  She did as Goku whimpered not wanting to scream out and make an even bigger wimp of himself as he already was and call for his Mommy.  Amy however senses his discomfort which just made her hug him even harder.  As Goku closed his eyes in pain Amy and Marron smirked at each other and than on a whim Marron pulled out the normal scouter and took a look at the pairs power levels.  Amy had a level of six pretty high for a girl her age as most adult males had around a five, looking at Goku Marron's mouth fell open in shock to see his power level was even lower as it tapped out at 0.38 making him even weaker than a new born baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marron was putting the Scouter away Goku, whose body was visibly shaking, accidentally knocked over the bowl of popcorn sending it scattering to the floor.  Marron calls for her father and Amy jumps afraid he might have a problem about how she was treating Goku, but upon seeing Goku's grandfather Amy relaxed as the man came in wearing a french maid outfit and just sweeps up the popcorn and leaves back to the kitchen.  Sharing a knowing look with Marron Amy decided to take full opportunity of Goku's accident.  \"Look at what you did Goku I think you need to be taught another lesson,\" Amy said as Marron pretended to yawn as she blocked her laughter with her hand as if not really paying attention to what the two were doing on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but,\" Goku stammered throwing a look at his Mommy for help but Marron had leaned back in the chair and partial closed her eyes and was pretending to sleep to give Amy free control at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but nothing bad boys need to be punished,\" Amy said and...</span></div></div>",

As the Princess Movie ended Amy selected another movie this one dealing with a couple of bad boys who were constantly getting into trouble before being punished by their younger sister, class mates and in one occurrence a father getting a spanking and corner time from his own pre-teen daughter.  Though it was over a PG rating Marron allowed it to show Goku that it was natural for bad boys to be punished by the females in their lives no matter the age difference between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Amy let go of Goku's hand and just sat back and enjoyed the movie with her hands behind her head.  Without the crushing grip on his hand Goku attention began to wander and felt himself falling asleep.

Amy seemed to notice his trouble and decided to help by quietly humming a lullaby making the feeling of drowsiness come easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Marron and Amy smirked as Goku's head began to nod his eyes closing and him beginning to slide deeper into the couch.  The pair almost burst out laughing as a small snore escapes Goku's lips but they manage to stifle it so as to not wake him up.  Marron started to get up to put Goku in his new bedroom but before she could move Amy beat her to it as she pulled Goku's head into her lap and began to run her fingers through his untidy hair.  \"You know Ms. Marron he does look sort of sweet when he is asleep,\" Amy said gazing down at Goku who had begun to suck his thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dear and you can just call me Marron,\" Marron said making Amy smile at how cool Goku's mom was.  \"Now I have a favor to ask you my dear I don't quite trust Goku to follow direction at school so if your could watch over him for me,\" Marron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy just smiled as she thought about being in control of Goku at school loving the idea that she a three year old would be the one in control of a fourteen year old sissy boy so she readily agreed.

As the movie came to a close Marron asked if Amy needed anything before sending her home.

As she worked 18 came home with a handful of shopping of new clothes for Goku to wear around the house and on weekends.  Seeing the poster that Marron was working on 18 let out a laugh.  \"Good thing I shopped around than,\" 18 said as she pulled out an actual maid outfit that would fit Goku as well as some other clothing as well what would work against Goku mental state and possibly weaken him even more like a baby blue shirt that had \"Mommy's little fighter\" on the front yet on the matching shorts had \"Win-0 loses- the sign for infinity on the bottom.

Goku was happy he had not complained for once more his mind acted on his body reducing his appetite so a good portion was left in the bowl when Goku began to feel hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching the movie last night Goku had learned never to interrupt when females were talking lest he get punished so he waited to inform Mommy Marron and his new Grandma 18 that he was full.  Goku was not that subtle as both Marron and 18 picked up that he had something to say but the pair just shared a knowing look and began to speak of nothing for a long time forcing Goku to just sit in his high chair with the oatmeal in front of him.  When there was a lull in the conversation Goku finally was able to speak up, \"Mommy I am full.\"  Marron looked at him with a hint of disappointment in her eyes yet a smile inside her head as Goku appeared to learn from the movie last night and his shrinking appetite which she had decided to test this morning by making a normal sized serving of oatmeal and seeing how Goku's body would respond to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can not leave the table until you finish your meal young man,\" Marron said with a slight edge to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mommy I will try to finish it and be a good boy,\" Goku said placing his food back down and struggling to finish  the rest of a single child size serving of oatmeal.  When he was finished he had once more to wait a while as Marron and 18 were once more in conversation though Krillin noticing the empty bowl picked it up and took it to soak in the sink before returning and beginning to work on 18's nails.  Once 18 and Marron were finished Goku had almost fallen asleep sitting in his high chair.  Lifting Goku out of the high chair the two women carried him out into the living room as Krillin did the dishes.  The three than sat on the couch with Marron on one side and 18 on the other as the two women squished him between them as they started watching TV.

It does not take long even in as large places as the spaceship hanger, for it seems after her suggestion most of the people had gone in search of the Earth Dragon Balls.  It was strange that she was able to find Goku after that, but it seems he wanted to hang out with his family for Marron found him sparing with Pan giving Marron another idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she was seen Marron makes her way to a corner before she starts to work on the Scouter again to deepen the deception.  It took a while but she finally managed to get the Scouter the show the power levels normal for others but massively lowered when used on Goku. After seeing Pan's levels she saw that her original plan of what she had displayed for Goku was even more ridiculous as Pan had a power level of at least a two million and using it on a random worker who had come in to shut down the rocket she found the non-fighter had a power level of 30.  Marron tweaked the scale making Goku's levels read around 25 for his base form and going up to sixty for his SS3 levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the Scouter back on she went back to watch the sparing match for the best time to enter the picture and start her ruse.  She did not have to wait long as a blow from Pan knocked Goku back a couple of steps.  \"Whoa there Pan take it easy you don't want to hurt him,\" Marron said rushing forward with the Scouter on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Pan asked as Goku unhurt got back in to position thought cocking his head in confusion at Marron's statement as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I found one of Mrs Bulma's old advance Scouters and began to think what if the wish had not only made your Grandfather a kid again but also lowered his power levels as well and well look at this,\" Marron said taking off the Scouter and handing it to her friend.  Marron did her best not to smirk or grin as Pan put on the Scouter and turned it on her youthened grandfather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What power level 25 this thing mus be broken,\" Pan said as she read the display before turning back to Marron and seeing her power level as a baseline non-fighter of a human \"huh 31 if this is correct you are stronger than Goku.\"  Marron hid her smirk thinking this was going to work off better than she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait let me see that,\" Goku said as Pan handed him the device and he read the pair of girls' Power Levels.  \"Well it looks like it is working but for all I know you could be pulling a prank on me,\" Goku said thinking about how Pan had been acting towards him calling him a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a possibility but not here lets have a test,\" Marron said and called over to the worker who had final finished shutting down the rocket and machinery.  When asked to use the Scouter the worker just shrugged and read off the their Power Levels, now Marron was not the only one trying to hold back a smirk and a laugh as the random worker \"confirmed\" that Goku's power level was six levels lower than Marron's.  Having done as requested the worker hands back the Scouter and leaves the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think this is a lie and I can prove it,\" Goku said a little hump in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" both Pan and Marron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if I am really weaker than Marron she should have no trouble taking me on,\" Goku said throwing a wrench into Marron's plans as she did not think he was yet at the mental level to neuter his Power levels himself yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not fair Goku,\" Pan said no longer calling him grandpa or showing him any respect with such a low level \"she is not a fighter in any sense how about just arm wrestling instead?\"  Goku agreed forcing Marron to accept.  Marron doubted her chances but noticed a slight twitch in Goku's arm as she placed her own arm down and found his grip rather weak though she was not sure if he was doing it by already being effected by his \"Power Level reading\" or in fear of hurting her.  Pan placed her hand on top of theirs and began to count down for the match.  When she let go Goku and Marron began to try to push the others down and to Marron's surprise at the moment they seemed well matched despite the real difference between their Power Levels.

Her skin tone was the same lighter tone his skine own was when he was offically younger. This woman unknown to Goku was in fact his very own mother Gine the black sheep of Saiyans she was never a good warrior having to be saved several times by her still dead mate Bardock. Gine had retired from active duty to work in a meat factory prior to Frieza destroying Planet Vegeta.  Gine had been brought back to life by the kais as since she was where Goku got his soft heart from they thought it would be good to bring her back to assist the now weakened hero. Gine was staring at her only living son in shock, she didn't know what happened to him she found him just laying weakened on the ground. \"Did you forget how to fly Kakarot?\" She helped Goku up to his feet and was shocked by how easily she was able to lift her son to his feet considering her power level was originally rather low for a Saiyan. She was able to train herself in the other world and get her power level to elite level now though even being able to become a Super Saiyan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're a Saiyan too, if you know my name,\" Goku said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my name is Gine, Kakarot and I am your mother,\" Gine said to a now shocked Goku. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my mom?!\" Goku exclaimed stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Bardock told me that you suffered a head injury when you arrived here and lost your memories Kakarot,\" Gine said even though she still felt hurt that her only living child didn't recognize his own mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku blinked. \"Bardock who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bardock is my husband and your father Kakarot,\" Gine told her son. \"You inherited his rough hairstyle,\" She ruffled his spiky hair. \"Anyways Kakarot what happened to you? Why are you a child again and why does your power feel so weakened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure\u2026last thing I remember was Pilaf making a wish on a different set of Dragonballs called the Black Star Dragonballs, suddenly I'm a kid again and my power was cut to less than half of what it was\" Goku told his newly found mother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If those black star dragonballs could weaken you this much Kakarot, they are extremely powerful and dangerous,\" Gine said worried on how her son would handle things in his weakened state.

She wore a black slender dress with slits at the side showing off her curvy long legs and V cut showing off her very voluptuous cleavage. She looked down at Goku.  \"This is one of the other counterparts to my Goku? He's so weak..I can barely even feel his power he must've gotten it reduced somehow. Hmph. I will retrain your skills and power myself, no counterpart of my husband will ever be a weakling.\" She lifts up the weakened Goku like he weighed no more than a feather with one hand and then flew off to a capsule home she had brought with her and was staying in while in this timeline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku woke up later and saw the strange woman. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman spoke. \"My name is Jona Alucard and I will be retraining you Son Goku, I'm sure you have noticed by now that your power was greatly reduced by that wish on the Black Star Dragonballs,  strange though as your power level should not have been effected at all, only your time limit to maintain your Super Saiyan 3 form. The Black Star Dragonballs must be much stronger in this universe to be able to reduce your once immense power to that of near a regular human.\" Jona would make a mental note to retrieve the Black Star Dragonballs at some point and undo the wish Pilaf made <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku was shocked he thought his power was much lower than it was earlier beforehand. When he had tried to fly, he had plummeted to the ground and why he got so tired even though when he was originally a kid,  he rarely ever got tired unless he had been hungry. He didn't know how those Dragonballs effected his power so much, but they did and that worried him on how he would be able to protect the Earth from future evil threats in his weakened condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and it is a disgrace what happened to you so you must receive retraining from me,\" Jona replied with her arms crossed under her huge breasts.  \"I will be putting you through harsher training than Master Roshi and King Kai gave you.\" She smirked at the youth sadistically ready to put him through the training of hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku sweats nervous about what she will make him do first.</span></div></div>",

Goku struggled to get up  with weight that normally would be less than a feather weight to him. Jona frowned as she watched. <i>'Did that wish do more than just reduce Goku back to a child? I should check his mind for any blocks and suppressents that might be in there.'</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku finally rose to his feet but was struggling to stay up his arms and legs visibly shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Goku try to attack me with a punch,\" Jona said coming close enough to Goku, so he wouldn't have to try to dash until she gets him retrained in his reflexes and stamina. She lowered into a fighting stance he recognized as the Turtle Stance that he took several times throughout his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right!\" Goku said and threw out a punch that was much slower and weaker than normal it was barely indistingushable from the punch from a non Z Fighter as he struck her in the stomach which she just let happen. Goku actually felt like he struck a nonbreakable brick wall when he attacked her, which alarmed him considering he orignally was able to break brick walls easily years ago when he was truly a child. His hand actually tingled in pain from hitting her.  He held his tingling hand to his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJona didn't even feel a single thing not even a mosquito bite like feeling, which was alarming since she knew any weaker counterpart to her own husband would at least be able to make her really feel their strikes. She sees him cradle his hand which looked red. \"I need to look into your mind Goku, I wonder if it is more than just that age reducing wish that weakened you,\" She gazed down at him and her eyes began glowing as she began to look inside his mind to see just what else could be weakening the Saiyan hero besides the wish which really shouldn't have effected his overall power at all... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jona scowled now seeing what had been really draining Goku's power and strength rather than the wish. Goku before marrying Chi-Chi never really was afraid of a female's wrath before even once fighting the blonde tomboy persona of Launch once and knocking her out after he had ended up waking up in bed with her.<i>'His submission to and fear of that annoying banshee Chi-Chi is causing his body to limit itself subconsciously now when he is faced with with female, I will not be able to retrain him with that fear crippling his power like this I need to either seal it deep within his subconscious where it will never limit him again or remove it completely. I always knew that banshee would be nothing but a nuisance to Goku and I was right it seems. I will find a way to get this counterpart Goku away from her and her influence.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n The busty Vampiress queen scowled at the mention of the only one obstacle during her own goal to become her Goku's one and only wife in her timeline/Dragon Universe and that was Chi-Chi. Jona had a great dislike of her knowing how she grows up to become one of the most annoying banshees in history who constantly kept her sons on the books and nagging Goku to get a job. So in her own timeline, Jona met Goku a few months before Grandpa Gohan died and comforted him after the old martial artist was killed by an berserk Oozaru Goku. She stayed by Goku's side even after he met Bulma and his other friends working her into his heart and managing to get through his very thick skull. When the time came for him to encounter Chi-Chi though Jona did something she didn't lose a wink of sleep over even now. She sent some of her familiars after the young Chi-Chi who had also been chased by a T Rex at the time. Her familiars distracted the Ox Princess making her waste her weapons fighting them and getting eaten alive by the dinosaur ending her pitiful life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goku i have discovered what is causing your strength to be so drained and limited,\" Jona informed the surprised Saiyan hero. She had an inward smirk knowing she could use this knowledge to make him realize Chi-Chi was no good for him. If there was no other way to fix this Goku's situation, she could always adopt him and take him back with her to her timeline and let this one that weakened one of it's best heroes to perish to whatever threats came it's way. She could always use another little son who resembled her husband anyways. She had three Goku look alike sons back home already, but she did enjoy having a big family of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really what is it?\" Goku asked. He really wanted to know why he felt so weakened and how to fix the situation. He looked to Jona hoping she would tell him and help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its Chi-Chi Goku, she's the reason of why you're so weak right now,\" Jona said to the now shocked Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?! Chi-Chi but how and why could it be?\" Goku asked completely shocked at what he was hearing from this woman. How could his own wife be responsible for the situation he was in now? It didn't make any sense to him that she was responsible. He was afraid to hear her reply about why Chi-Chi was the cause of his major drop in power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are afraid of making her mad and suffering her wrath and its been this way for your whole married life to Chi-Chi Goku. Because of it and that wish on the Black Star Dragonballs,  your body is subconsciously weakening itself for your guided misbelief that all females even weak non-powered earthling females are super powerful even more so than yourself a pure bloodline Saiyan warrior,\" Jona replied shocking Goku more. \"So we will need to do something about that misbelief Goku,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku looked down. \"What will you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJona came up to Goku and gently put a hand on his chin and made him look up at her. \"I am here to help you Goku, just leave it to me,\" She smiled to him making feel safe.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a rather short amount of time Goku felt a little tired to fly around, and thinking he was just worn out from his intense battle with Uub, saw a city and landed in a park.

His strength had decreased so much that he lost to you, who doesn't train. And if you look closer at his hands, they are smooth and soft. This is just a theory, but since he thought he was an Earthling when he was a kid and didn't the truth until he was an adult, the wish maya have not only have made him a kid again, but it may have even altered his DNA so that he's now an Earthling and not a Saiyan! If that's the case, he won't be able to ever become a Super Saiyan again and his appetite and everything is just like a regular person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBra and Marron just stared at Pan and the sleeping Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can that even be possible? Could the Dragon Balls really change his race like that?\" asked Marron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well these are the Black Star DBs that did this; they're more powerful than Earth's DBs,\" said Pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suppose this is true, and we still don't know if it is or not, does that mean you two aren't related anymore?\" asked Bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan smiled and said, \"Well that's an interesting question indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

My family is the richest family in the world and they have a lot of connections thanks to Capsule Corporation. In the science community, Grandpa and Mama are the most respected figures. Plus, I have been to many science conventions and conferences that they've attended and I've met a lot of people, including those that can test DNA. I can ask one of them to do it and I'm fairly confidant that they'll do it; money will not be a problem after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan and Marron just stared at Bra in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I've known your family all my life, that sometimes I forget just how rich or influential your family is,\" said Pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" added Marron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, we're all friends.

Then then drew ome blood from a finger of Pan's and put it in one the vials and then when they got with Goku, they noticed that the tiny prick with the needle on his lft index finger was leaking blood after they got what they needed. They had a chuckle that Goku needed a band-aid when Pan didn't so they got one and put it on okun to stop the bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I'll be off. I'll be back as soon as I can.
