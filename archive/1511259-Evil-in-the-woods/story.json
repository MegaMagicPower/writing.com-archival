She felt particularly close to her only sibling, Marhak, especially since they were the last remaining children living in Dankar. Shamil, their cousin, had disappeared just a few months earlier. Their parents and the elders had pulled Hensar and Marhak aside one morning to question them about his whereabouts. They\u2019d obviously hoped he was playing a trick on them and was hiding somewhere in the village. It wouldn\u2019t have been the first time: Shamil loved to play practical jokes - even the Chief hadn\u2019t been immune from their cousin\u2019s antics the day he put Succir weed in the old man\u2019s pipe - but this time was different. They\u2019d all sensed that something terrible had happened. There was a strange quality to the air that day. It seemed somehow denser and had what one could only describe as the vile stench of evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHensar was more scared of never seeing Marhak again than she was for her own safety. She stepped beyond the permissible zone and into the thick woods after him...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The wind whistled through the branches around and far away to the left she could hear footsteps lightly crunching fallen leaves. She reached Marhak and he displayed his discovery. In his hand he held a rucksack. It was her brothers.  A low growl came from behind the trees to their left. She looked at Marhak and held his hand. What should they do now....</span></div></div>",

Her mother had left the comfort of the rocking chair on the porch and it seemed that she had ventured back inside the house momentarily. Hensar ran up the path shouting her but no answer came from inside. When she reached the porch she saw the front door was swinging open in the wind and the glass that once held her mothers homemade lemonade was smashed on the floor, the lemonade itself disappearing fast in the crack between the wooden floorboards. She shouted her mother once more but still there was no reply. Maybe she was asleep? Maybe she had gone next door? Maybe even to the village? Hensar didnt think this was likely as it wasnt like her mother to leave the house so unsecure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all thoughts of her mother were quickly removed from her mind. Behind her back in the woods she heard Marhak scream....</span></div></div>",
