Also her deeper into her bellow are yellow sacks which contain her babies. Then later her heart. <br>\r\nShe is very cocky and often never really calls for help even when she needs it. And you can hide from her by going under armor because she never looks there when she loses sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNSFW is optional and will go into it only with consent.</span></div></div>",

Make a story on why it happening if you want! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it turns into role play of fighter versus boss. Now the reason this is 18+ is because vore and erotic scenes are allowed but give a warning first k?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey diz are ze rules!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No super op.<br>\r\nOk there can be situations where a fighter can\u2019t do anything about it and just lose. But don\u2019t make it boom boom dead. It\u2019s not very fun at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. When the boss and fighter are chosen only they can add to their roleplay others can as long as they have permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Pokemon based bosses only I will allow Anthros out pokemon only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose are the rules I can think off. Go crazy!</td>",
