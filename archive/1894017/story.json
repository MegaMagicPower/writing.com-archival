As you get home, you fumble around your pocket for the key and get inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afternoon, [your name]!\" says Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Spike.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Twilight?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be here soon.\" you say. \"She's over at Fluttershy's helping her with the animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike nods his head and you go to your room. Right then, you get a phone call from none other than Princess Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you say as you answer the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, [your name]! It's Auntie Celeste!\" says the princess. She always insisted on you calling her that since she was very good friends with your parents, especially your mother. \"I just called to see how everything's been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appreciate the check-up call, but found it rather embarrassing and rather unnecessary. \"Auntie Celeste, I've been living here for two and a half years, I'm pretty much adjusted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean I can't still ask how you're doing.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, same as always.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay then.\" she says, sensing that you didn't feel like talking. \"Bye.\" After you hang up, you get five texts at the same time, all from five different people, or should I say ponies. You read one text after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash: Yo, could use someone 2 help my time my laps @ the track. Hook a pony up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie: Hiiiiiiiii! Need someone 2 try this new muffin recipe I'm trying out. Pwetty plz?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity: Good afternoon, [your name]. Need your artistic opinion on my new line. Could you swing by the boutique?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack: Howdy, could use an extra pair of eyes 2 watch my sister since Big Mac is out. Up 4 it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight: Fluttershy needed more help than she thought. Help us out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you decide to help out?</span></div></div>",

This year, you decided to draw all your pony friends a portrait of them in costumes that suited their personalities. For Rainbow's picture, you drew her in Roman inspired armor that was rainbow colored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is awesome!\" she says. \"Now I feel bad about what I got you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it's great,\" you say. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash reached into her pocket, and pulls out a small box. \"Happy Hearts and Hooves Day,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the box and see a charm of a lightning bolt in your favorite color, orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Dashie!\" you say. \"I really like this!\" You then give the pegasus a hug as a thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, relax,\" she says, embarrassed. \"It's not like I like you or anything.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow didn't say anything, but she felt touched that you kept the charm after all that time. She expected you to lose it after a few weeks, but instead you held on to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" she says rather quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why don't we pop some popcorn?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right!\" she says, getting herself flustered. \"Where's my head at?\" she asks, more to herself than to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Dashie?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she say?</span></div></div>",

Grabbing your face with both hands, she pulls your head close to hers, close enough for your lips to meet but only your noses do. Before anything else happens, what you heard is what you were always hoping to hear, in a whisper anyway. \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time was left for any reaction as Rainbow finally puts your lips to hers. The sudden effect left you shocked but only temporarily. You even tried to pull back but her grip was too strong for you to squirm from.

The sheer force of will also went to your arms as you hugged back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis causes for the Pegasus to wrap her wings around you, and let go, hugging you tightly and burying her face into your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dashie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For so long now, [your name], I finally managed to work up my mind to finally confess.

Rainbow was wearing a dress that was waaaayy unfitting for her but you seemed to really like it. It was a spotlight dance, and she was embarrassed out of her mind, as well as you, but you enjoyed it either way.

For one, you were at your deathbed, in a scenario sorta like right now, but it was too late to save you and your funeral came and went.

After making your way up the stairs to Pinkie's room, you knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" she asked with a singsong voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's [your name],\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Come in!\" she said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the room and see Pinkie just as she was pulling her shirt down. Now, you always found Pinkie Pie attractive, and her bubbly personality made her that much more alluring. Although, you could never tell if she felt the same about you, since she was nice to everyone no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the mess,\" she said. \"You know I'm no good at cleaning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's no bother,\" you said as you walked towards her. \"I'm not like Twilight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both chuckled as you continued to walk towards Pinkie, but you suddenly tripped over something on the floor, falling to the ground, taking Pinkie with you. You landed on the floor with a thud, right on top of Pinkie. You both blushed when you saw how close your faces were, but then Pinkie giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you look cuter than usual from this angle,\" she said before kissing you right then and there.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, you and Pinkie have been boyfriend and marefriend. You two have gotten... frisky... several times in the last few months, but now Pinkie wants to go all the way. You really don't want to do that this early in your relationship, and you try to explain this to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie, I'm cool with anything else, but I'm really not ready for sex yet,\" you explain. \"I want to be your boyfriend, not your friend with benefits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie looks down for a second to think, then she looks up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your name]...</span></div></div>",

You were familiar with Pinkie's blowjobs and knew she could make you cum pretty fast. She yanks your pants down as she sucks and cups your balls in one hand, caressing your sac with her soft hand. You groan loudly, her soft rubbing soothing your aching nuts while Pinkie moves her head up and down the length of your cock as she sucks. She hums softly, sending pleasant vibrations up your body, and gently bounces your balls in her hand. Her humming ends in a deep moan as she takes almost your full length into her mouth without choking. The head of your cock almost touches the back of Pinkie's throat before she starts her bobbing and sucking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand runs through her hair as Pinkie sucks you, your dick starting to throb in her mouth. As always, Pinkie manages to anticipate when you will cum and pushes you far into her mouth just as your orgasm crests. You groan loudly as your throbbing cock spurts a copious amount of thick cum into Pinkie's mouth and down her throat. Pinkie swallows every drop of your heavy load, not a single bit leaking out. She lets out a moan after she slides your cock from her mouth and swallows the remains of your load. \"Tasty~\" she says, standing up and giving you a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a good handle on when I'm about to blow,\" you say to her, unable to remain mad with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, silly,\" she says. \"I'm really good at reading your body language even with your big thing in my mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou redden a bit when she refers to your dick as big. You had never thought of yourself as having being big, but Pinkie seemed to think so and that was good enough. \"I'd be able to tell you were about to pop even if you were <i>inside</i> me,\" she gives you a wink and flashes you her pussy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is that so?\" you ask, trying to fight off the mental image of Pinkie bouncing on you and getting off just in time to let you blow your load all over her ample chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm!\" she nods with a smile. \"Wanna find out~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment and decide...</span></div></div>",

You nod at Pinkie and she smiles. \"Are you sure?\" she asks, genuinely concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm positive, Pinkie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie beams then pulls off her shirt, exposing her large, soft breasts and lack of bra to you. Pinkie's ample bust and round butt were things that got you going and she knew it. Pinkie turns around to wiggle out of her skirt, taking longer than needed so you can stare at her round ass. She turns back around and moves closer to you, pulling off your shirt before sliding down. She gently strokes your dick to get you nice and hard again while she busies herself licking and kissing your balls. \"Lay back and let me work~\" Pinkie says after giving your balls a slow and sensual sucking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" you say with a nod, getting on your back and watching as Pinkie straddles you, noticing how her wetness has gotten to her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie steadies your cock and slowly lowers herself, moaning sharply as you penetrate her. She is incredibly tight and you know it is only thanks to cumming only a short time ago that you don't burst and flood her with cum right then and there. You both moan in pleasure as your cock fills Pinkie's tight pussy, the head coming to rest against her cervix once she reaches your base. \"Mmmmm, you're bigger than you look~\" Pinkie moans arching her back and bracing her hands on your chest, giving you a seductive wink. \"I might not want to get off~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind reels at her words. \"R-really?\" you ask, your mind flashing with images of what she was suggesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just so big~\" she moans. \"I might decide you feel WAY to good to get out~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words she starts riding you. Hands braced on your chest, Pinkie starts sliding up and down your shaft, moaning intensely. You bring your hands up to grab Pinkie's large breasts. As usual, you're amazed at how soft they are. You groan lowly as Pinkie picks up her pace a bit, moaning louder as she does so. \"AH! AUH!\" Pinkie moans as she rides you faster. \"I'm cumming, [your name]!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie stops riding to writhe ontop of you as she cums hard enough that she actually squirts. Her pussy contracts and convulses around you and her warm cum squirts out around your shaft, so much that it wets both your thighs and hers and even wets your balls. You've made Pinkie cum many times, but never like that before. \"Oh wowie,\" Pinkie gasps, coming down from her orgasm. \"I've never cum like THAT, before~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lusty gaze meets yours for several long moments before she winks and starts riding you again. It is not long after she starts riding again that you begin to feel your own climax building. You rub Pinkie's smooth thighs and give her ass a smack, making her moan sharply as she rides. As usual, Pinkie times it perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls off before you have a chance to unload the full contents of your balls into her pussy and angles your dick toward her. You cum with a loud grunt, your first wad of cum spitting from your throbbing dick to splatter across Pinkie's large breasts. Your hips buck up as you unleash an immense amount of cum, all of it splattering on Pinkie's breasts and toned stomach. \"I think you popped even more this time!\" Pinkie says brightly, panting slightly after you stop cumming on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know being inside you would be that good,\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Pinkie says, looking thoughtful as she sits on your thighs. \"I think I should call Dashie over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you blurt.</span></div></div>",

Sweet Apple Acres is maybe a mile out to the south beyond the tree covered hills, the Carousel Boutique is all the way back on the southeast corner of Ponyville next to the park, and Fluttershy's place is even further east right on the edge of the Everfree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity is the nearest of your destinations, however the thought occurs to you that Rarity's second opinion shouldn't take too long even if you decide to chat, while on the other hand helping out with Fluttershy's animals could take quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, quick stop at Rarity's, then to Fluttershy's,\" you tell yourself as you set off to the south, not bothering to utter the, \"but first...\" in your tone. You're sure Apple Bloom would love to hang out somewhere other than the Apple family farm. She can go with you and see Sweetie Belle at Rarity's and she definitely likes animals like any other filly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off with sprinting to make good time, humming a beat to keep pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes you're vaulting over the white wooden rail fence that borders Sweet Apple Acres and running up to the farmhouse. Winona was the first to greet you with a series of excited barks while she ran circles around you. When you ignored her antics, she ran up to you and jumped up to place her paws on your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Winona,\" you say, scratching her behind the ears. \"You wouldn't happen to know where Applejack is, would you girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog simply pants at you for a few silent seconds before getting off you and running towards the near orchard line. In answer to your question, Winona runs right up to the tall orange figure of Applejack among the trees, a bucket full of apples held against her hip. You smile and make your way over, Applejack noticing you shortly after Winona relays her excitement to the mare. She is wearing her signature cowgirl hat upon her golden mane, bangs swept to the side above her right eye while while the rest of her hair flows freely past her shoulders, unlike her tail which is held neatly together at the end with a red band. Today she wears a white t-shirt that hugs her curves and barely reaches her waist which sports a brass belt buckle adorning her tight three-quarter jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, partner!\u201d says Applejack, taking a moment to wipe some sweat from her brow. \u201cAh Thought Ah heard Winona tellin\u2019 me someone was comin\u2019.\u201d She leans down to give her dog a pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Applejack, how's it going?\" you say, giving a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Applejack grunts, bucking another three bucketfuls of apples out of a tree, \"Ah'm mighty busy at the moment...\" she goes on to kick the the tree next to her, stubborn thing only dropping half a bucketful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that,\" you say halting in your advance, realizing Applejack didn't want to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apple Bloom should be in her room. It'd be awfully kind of ya to watch her,\" she bucks another tree, wiping the sweat from her brow. \"O' course, she could always spend time with her friends, so it's up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" you respond, \"I'd like to hang out with Apple Bloom. There's some cool stuff we could--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEEHAW!\" bellows the cowpony. Ignoring you, Applejack delivers a mighty roundhouse to the tree. The whole thing shakes violently as her hoof makes contact and all the apples come crashing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...do in town... .\" Applejack departs from view, Winona right at her tail. Clearly, AJ has no time for a friendly chat. \"Well, I'd better get going; don't wanna keep the girls waiting,\" you say to yourself more than anyone else as you head for the farmhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder about Applejack. She usually took time to have a friendly word with her visitors and she brushed you off kind of quick this time. Maybe she's got a really big haul and is kinda stressed. You shrug as you open the door to the farmhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Apple Bloom!\" You call inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'll be right down!\" comes an answer form upstairs. Moments later, a litter filly with red locks is bouncing down the stairs. \"Hi, [your name], how's it goin'?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing great so far,\" you answer, \"but I still have some things I have to take care do. Would it be alright if I took you into town with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure, if ya get me home by supper. Where ya headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Rarity's boutique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Sweetie Belle's gonna be there\u2014let's go!\" And with that, Apple Bloom races past you and out the door. You follow at a brisk pace, but she has quite the distance on you when she calls, \"Race ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle twerp. \"Challenge accepted!\" And you run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the hour you and Apple Bloom plus one are on the road to Fluttershy's; Sweetie Belle was at the Carousel Boutique and decided to join the two of you. You are in the lead with the two filly's skipping behind you, a series of giggles growing in volume by the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" you demand, tilting you head back not bothering to turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing,\" replies Sweetie Belle, stifling a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothin' at all,\" snickers Apple Bloom, \"Just thinkin' back to what hap'nd at Rarity's.\" You raise an inquisitive eyebrow and look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle adds, \"You know, how she tried to dress you up as a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great,\" you sigh, \"you heard that?\" It seemed that once you were done inspecting Rarity's most recent creations, she decided that one of them warranted a fit test...on <i>you</i>. It was only joke, but with Rarity's magic creating a floating ensemble barrage, her hijinks did not allow your dignity to escape unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard it? We saw the whole thang,\" says Apple Bloom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think she might <i>actually</i> be trying to turn him into a girl?\" Sweetie Belle jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be. You're practically one already by the way you were screamin' like a filly back there; 'Wha-, Rarity! Aah! Aaah!<i>Aaaah</i>! What are you doing?! Stop it! Stop it!' \" she mimics mockingly with her high-pitched and girly caricature of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I resent that!\" You stop and turn around. \"I do not scream like a filly! I'll have you know that I scream like a full grown mare.\" You cross you arms and plaster a smug smile on your face. The two filly's giggle at your self deprecation right as your phone starts ringing. You pull your phone out and are about to answer when you add, \"And I would like to see what you would do if a corset was gonna crush you like a vice.\" You turn around and continue walking. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, [your name],\" answered Twilight. \"What was that about a corset?\" Oops, had your phone on when you said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just one of Rarity's things. So what's up? We're basically right outside Fluttershy's house right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really? Well, I was just calling to tell you that we got everything under control and that you didn't have to come over, if you didn't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, cool,\" you say, happy that they got things done though irritated at this pointless and long journey. \"So are you leaving right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually me and Fluttershy have got a fun game going on,\" Twilight said with enthusiasm. \"You and the girls can still join us if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you agree. After all, it was either Fluttershy's or dink around town.  A minute later you are on the doorstep and let yourself in. Fluttershy and Twilight are on the living room floor playing...</span></div></div>",

We just going through my wardrobe\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fluttershy had a lot of clothes in her closet,\" Twilight interjects, gesturing to the piles of clothing, \"most of them she made herself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we were just going to be reorganizing when we decided\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014To have play <i>dress up</i>!\" Twilight squeals in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eye twitches. \"Duah-duh-dress up?\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've even got some clothes from when I was smaller, if the girls want to play,\" Fluttershy says more to Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be fun,\" answers Sweetie Belle. \"What do you say Apple Bloom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Apple Bloom agrees, \"maybe we could get our cutie marks in modelin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can definitely help us out, [your name],\" Twilight holds up a corset. Nope. No. Nah-uh. Not gonna happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, look at the time,\" you say, looking at your non-existent wristwatch, \"I just remebered that we have something <i>really</i> important to do. Gotta go; duty calls!\" You grab both Apple Bloom's and Sweetie Belles tails, halting their advance. \"Let's go!\" You pull lightly as not to hurt them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we just got here,\" Sweetie Belle reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you had nothin' planned ta to in town anyway,\" Apple Bloom says wryly,  turning around and yanking both her's and Sweetie Belle's tails from your hands. You stumble backwards and fall over, rather intentionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you gasp, grasping the air and writhing around. \"Can't breath! Must escape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to crawl for the door, all the while making hacking and wheezing noises, making you journey seem agonizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Estrogen levels *cough* toxic! Contamination...*wheeze* reaching critical mass!\" You pull yourself up and stagger to the door opening. \"Must...find... a gym...stat!\" You open the door and yelp in surprise only to fall down again. The moment you looked out a face is right there, startling you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya Scaredy-Cat!\" says Pinkie Pie in one of her bouts of randomness, \"though you're more of a scaredy and less of a cat. Hahaha! I was just thinking how boreed you must be doing all this hard work on a Friday\u2014\" Pinkie's lips speed away at a mile a minute as she explains her entire thought process from the moment you left Sugarcube to this moment, all the while wildly gesticulating in big circles across Fluttershy's yard. You pick yourself up  and as your initial bewilderment passes you stand there impassive while Pinkie wrapped things up: \"\u2014and so when I found my pogo sticks I totally thought 'hey, [your name] should have fun with pogo sticks too!' \" She had been bouncing around the lawn for a few seconds now. \"So whaddaya say? How 'bout we take these babies for a hop around town? A-boingy-boingy-boingy-boi\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SLAM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in,\" you announce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sort of uninterested at first when Twilight and Fluttershy stated that this game had some reasons behind it, so you didn't ask more about them. There was something about a traveling festival that had just been scheduled yesterday to take place in Ponyville next week. That was why you had not heard of it along with most everypony else in Ponyville. Except your friends. As it turns out, Pinkie Pie's new recipe is to be a sensation with all the pony's  that will be coming in from out of town, Applejack is hauling in a ton of apples to bake a ton of concessions by a certain deadline, Rarity is to making sure there is enough fancy get-up to go around, while Twilight and Fluttershy are just deciding what to wear to the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, why do you need a dress to go to a festival?\" you inquire as you laze on Fluttershy's couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite it being a festival, it is actually a well-organized event that is semi-formal at times,\" explains Twilight. \"This year, the theme is \"Tartarus and Elysium\", which will span three days. \"Tartarus\" will be on the first day and be the hectic and wild party while \"Elysium\" is on the last day and it will be a more formal and refined party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds weird,\" you state. \"It's something new, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually. Though it has been around for only a few years, it's been getting more and more popular and taking place in bigger and bigger towns. I'd say we're lucky it's taking place right here in Ponyville. How would this dress look?\" Twilight asks, holding up a green dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not really your color,\" you say, serving your purpose as the artistic opinion. At least your not a \"model\" like you almost were. \"Why are you choosing from Fluttershy's wardrobe and not ordering another custom from Rarity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's swamped with orders and stocks to fill as it is. There's no need to make her job any harder than it already is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, okay, yeah, that makes sense,\" you agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy steps from the other room as she was trying on the dresses first. She has on a red strapless, single-piece dress that fit her form to the very last curve. Her hands are clenched behind her back and her eyes were downcast nervously as she smiles while blushing. \"H-how do I look?\" she asks. She looked really pretty in that dress, but the color was quite a contrast and you doubt she'd wear something so revealing anyway so you move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try the green one,\" you suggest, pointing to the dress Twilight held in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Fluttershy was back in the other room you ask, \"So why are you so concentrated on the \"Elysium\" day? Tartarus is sure to have some excellent bands with some great moshes. Dress in the black and silver? Or how about the middle second day? \"The Meadows\" will have some awesome raves going on; I'm sure that DJ that you like will be playing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Twilight giggles at your laid-back enthusiasm as it began to show, \"but the \"Elysium\" will have an outdoor dance.\" Twilight leans towards you, \"Y'know, one with slow songs for two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to tango.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on! It's the best time to go on a date!\" She nudges your shoulder with her elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk knowing Twilight must just be teasing. \"Are you asking me out, Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha\u2014? No!\" She giggles. \"I already have a date!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you falter. \"Who\u2014wha\u2014really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Twilight says, ignorant to your sudden discomfort. \"I know I never told you about him before, but I met this great guy in the Chess Club. Ooh,\" she claps in excitement, \"you should let Fluttershy tell you how she and her date first met!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Fluttershy steps out in the green dress, much more confidently. She twirls around for her own enjoyment, dillying long enough for Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom to make their big entrance before you with a loud \"TAA-DAA\" dressed in the most atrocious combinations only for a trip over Apple Bloom's hoof to send them into a sprawling disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" Fluttershy smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and give a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes slowly, but it eventually gets late and you set out to drop off Sweetie Belle at her parent's and lastly Apple Bloom at the Sweet Apple acres. You feel a little down on your way back up to town as you just trudge across the dirt road with your hands in your pockets, listening to the scrape of your shoes whenever they drag across the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike is still at the library; you kind of feel like talking to him. But then you remember Pinkie Pie. She always has a way to make anyone feel better, and besides, you probably should make sure that she isn't hurt about you brushing her off back at Fluttershy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think a little more about it while kicking at a rock, rolling it down the road. Once your entertainment makes an errant bounce into the bushes you finally decide to</span></div></div>",

Can't really be following Twilight and her date around the whole time\" you say to yourself<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't want to spoil it for them.

She has yet to see the shock on your face melt away into relief because the light does not reach you at the doorway, but she does see you stumble to the nearest desk for support as the adrenaline rush left your legs weak and trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank Celestia,\" you breath a sigh of relief, \"you're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your name], what's wrong?\" Twilight sits up in her bed, looking at you with a worried expression. \"Did something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Some one broke in!\" you exclaim softly with sincerity. \"The library is trashed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Twilight bolts upright out of bed, staring at you, your eyes confirming to her that you're not joking. She looks alarmed, but you breath another sigh of relief in knowing that she's okay and walk towards her, about to give her comfort, but she dashes past you, trotting in place with panic. \"Oh no, oh no, oh no! The Elements!\" she cries, charging down after that moment's hesitation. You follow her close behind, nearly tumbling down the stairs trying to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stands amongst the chaos, surveying the scene in silent horror. She sees the smashed glass case where the elements once were. They are gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The books!\" Twilight exclaims, pointing to the one scattered across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The books?!\" you ask incredulously, \"Twilight, the <i>Elements</i> are gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They might not be,\" she says, with some assurance.\"Help me find the one named The Elements of Harmony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat good would would that book do if the elements were stolen? Regardless, you began to pick up the books scattered across the ground while Twilight picked through the piles thrown onto the ground beside the shelves. Despite the Elements being gone, you were quite calm at the moment. You glanced at Twilight as she hecticly sifted through the piles of books, just happy that she was alright. Whoever had done this was in the house when she was asleep. You shiver at the thoughs of what could have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you righted the overturned table in the center you found the book you were looking for and called Twilight. She levitated it away before you could bring it to her. She quickly magicked through the pages, falling on a certain page with a depression, a magical pocket that held five jeweled necklaces and a tiara. The Elements of Harmony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew,\" Twilight smiled as she held the elements to her chest and sank to her knees. You run to her and kneel down, putting both hands on her shoulders with your arm behind her back, steadying her reassuringly. She looks up at you and explains, \"I had placed an emergency teleportation spell on the Elements that in case the glass surrounding them was broken, they'd disappear and return to the Book of the Elements of Harmony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down next to Twilight, keeping you left arm around her, but resting you right on your knee and she leans into your embrace, resting her head on your shoulder. She didn't show it at first, but Twilight really had a scare. \"Come on,\" you say, \"let's get off the ground.\" You gently help Twilight to stand up, but she tells you that she's fine and does so on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" came Spike's voice. He is standing at the stairs looking drowsy with his blanket still clutched in his claws. His eyes widen when he sees the state of the room. \"What happened to the library? I just rearranged these books!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a break in, Spike,\" you inform. \"Someone tried to take the Elements of Harmony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A break in?\" he stares blankly for a moment. \"My jewels!\" Spike runs arms-outstretched for his hidden jewel stash in the basement, which everyone knew about. You roll your eyes heavenward<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your name],\" Twilight spoke authoritatively now, \"call our friends and tell them what happened. If they are still awake, we should let them know immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Twilight,\" you comply, flipping out your phone. \"Sending a message to all our friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight has her phone out as well, sending a message of her own. She turns to you when she's done. \"If this turns out to be a threat against the harmony of Equestria,\" she says gravely, \"I'll have to inform Princess Celestia about this.\" She turns away from you just in time to miss you cringing at that. You just hope that if it comes to that, you won't end up surrounded by a platoon of Celestia's royal guards until this thing blows over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nah</i>, you think to yourself as you press \"Send\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You ended up with Spike as everyone started to investigate what had happened. There wasn't much to do as Twilight had taken to levitating everything in sight from the main chamber, using some sort of tracing spell to look for fingerprints, hoofmarks, mane follicles, whatever. So far, she has nothing. Meanwhile, you, Spike, and the two friends that actually showed up--Pinkie and Applejack--split up to look for any clues yourselves. Applejack took to circling the outside perimeter, Pinkie Pie called dibs on checking the ceilings, while you and Spike checked the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it does look messier than you remember, that might be because Twilight uses it as her laboratory often enough. Test tubes, beakers, and flasks sit in groups on any flat surfaces and wires of all colors run behind the tables or sometimes just stretch across the ground, all connected to the few pieces of metallic machinery, their lights dark and the magical components vacant from energy. This is the most chaotic place in the library despite Twilight's compulsive orderly nature; you can't tell whether the thief decided to take it easy here or if this is just one of Twilight's messes. You need to ask her, because you see something out of place that she never did touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuff iz zath?\" Spike asks with his mouth full as you heave the heavy object covered by a tarp back into its upright position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" you apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike finishes shoveling a handful of gemstones into his mouth so he could actually finish chewing and ask, \"What is that?\" he point to the thing under the tarp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this,\" you say, placing your hand on the rigid structure, \"this is a project I had started when I was about to turn sixteen. You don't remember?\" you raise an eyebrow. \"I spent a lot of my time on it. Kind of made the gang upset at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike pauses to throw a couple more jewels into his maw. \"Mmph, why didn'ff foo finiff itff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you lean up against the object, \"like I said, it made our friends a little upset, but it also affected my performance in school when I got frustrated that it wasn't going so smoothly anymore. Auntie Celeste had a talk with me about my grades and. . .yeah, I gave up on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike giggled a little at your mention of your name for Princess Celestia. <i>Shut up, Spike</i>, you think loudly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But anyway, Twilight never touches this thing so I think whoever was here was also down in the basement looking for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they really <i>could've</i> been after my jewel stash.\" Spike cradles the bucket in his claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No</i>, Spike, they weren't after your...ugh,\" you grunt in exasperation. Nobody cares about his gems, not even him, apparently, the way he keeps eating them when he still wants to have them. \"I can't tell what they were after down here when they didn't take <i>anything</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, maybe the Elements of Harmony were they wanted,\" Spike concedes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think at this point that's obvious. The real question now is 'who done it?' \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh,\" Spike shrugs, \"Probably some two-bit crook, evil mastermind wannabe with a hackneyed plan to take over Ponyville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds familiar,\" you say contemplatively scratching your chin. You stand and move towards the stairs. \"Let's just forget it. There's nothing down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the least we can be sure of is that if whoever did this shows their face, Twilight and the others can just blast them with the Elements' powers,\" the dragon says as you let him ahead of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do what? Turn them to stone or make them regress in age?\" you ask with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Spike answers with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the both of you enter the library's main chamber, Applejack and Twilight are waiting for you there. Applejack is dressed in some loose fitting jeans and a plaid jacket while Twilight is no longer in her pajamas having quickly thrown on a white button up shirt and black pants. She is pacing around the room with her eyes shut while her horn glows, holding out her right palm face down. Applejack interrupts her concentration first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Checked all 'round the library, Twi,\" she says, \"no sign of anypony havin' been near here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel a tremendous impact on your shoulders. Your arms flail about as you desperately try to maintain balance. \"And while Applejack searched low, I searched high!\" exclaims Pinkie just before she causes you to fall flat on your chest. She jumps off just in time to remain upright and turns to look at your prone form through a magnifying lens. She was currently in her pajamas, pink with purple stripes. \"No spicks, no specks, no nothin'! Except for that broken window up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie points skyward and everyone looks up, except you have to roll over, and see the highest window in the library opened wide with cracks in the glass and the wooden frame bent out of shape. You are just getting up when Pinkie jumps right in front of you, dons her deerstalker cap and prods you with the pipe in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the library fell victim to a cat burglar,\" Pinkie Pie deduces, with a squint of her eyes. \"Only he is <i>not</i> a cat!\" She runs over to another window and says, \"For as you can see, your drapes are still intact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear Twilight groan in exasperation at the antic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is my belief,\" Pinkie continues and starts to pace while puffing at the bubbling pipe, \"Is that this crime was committed by somepony with the instincts of a cat. Therefore,\" she stops and turns around, holding out a picture of a pony dressed as a cat, \"suspect number one; a pony last seen on Nightmare Night wearing a very convincing cat costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie! That was you!\" you moan, clutching at your head. That was her in the picture. She went as the cat last year!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie,\" Twilight chides, \"I know you're just trying to lighten the mood, but I think we should be taking things a little more seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but Twilight, I was just about to make [Your name] here my assistant.\" Quick as lightning, Pinkie pops a bowler hat onto your head, \"After all, he wasn't there to witness my skills of clue finding.\" She blows a stream of bubbles as she stands with her thumb and index finger on her chin, head tilted up in the contemplating detective's pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With a lot of help from Twilight,\" you retort acerbically. You take the opportunity to pluck the pipe from Pinkie's lips. \"Speaking of which,\" you turn your attention to Twilight, \"solving a case on cake nibblers is one thing, but are you really planning on tracking down somepony who committed a break-in and entry without contacting higher authorities?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See,\" Pinkie pipes in, \"he's just full of silly questions, with obvious answers.\" Pinkie Pie then blinks and looks at Twilight expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight rolls her eyes and answers, \"I don't know, [Your name]. If this an attempt on the harmony of Equestria by somepony or something powerful, it would be best to keep the number of ponies and humans,\" Twilight  to you with a smile; you shrug, \"involved to a minimum. And I'm still not sure about the 'break-in part, because that window up there was forced open from the inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up again, realizing a few nuances in the shape of the warped frame. They definitely indicated that whatever forced it open was leaving. Unless, of course, if forcing it open with magic form the outside could make it look like that as well, but that is in Twilight's field of expertise, not yours. You are getting too tired to think clearly about this anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Sugarcube,\" Applejack speaks up, \"Ah know that you're worried an' all, but Ah don't think stayin' up and tuckerin' your mind out is not gonna get this sorted out any faster.\" Finally, somepony has the same idea as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" Twilight concedes, looking as if she finally realizes that she was feeling fatigued. \"But--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack raises her hand to silence her. \"No 'buts' now,\" she insists, \"the Elements are safe and sound in that little book there, so just take it with ya. Ah know y'all must be nervous to sleep in the library after this mess, so how 'bout the three of you stay at the Apple family farm's guest room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you Applejack,\" Twilight says gratefully, about to take her up on the offer when Pinkie Pie interjects:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on! Sweet Apple Acres is way, way, way far away. Sugarcube Corner is just around the corner,\" Pinkie snickers at that last bit, \"so you'll be all snuggled up in no time! You and Spike in the guest bed while [Your name] bunks with me.\" Pinkie Pie winks at you. You blink a few times, wondering if she meant what you <i>think</i> she <i>might've</i> meant by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to let either Pinkie or AJ down, Twilight compromises. \"How about Spike and me go with Applejack while [Your name] goes with Pinkie. That way everyone has their own bed.\" She turns to you, \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat <i>do</i> you think? Now's your chance to switch the arrangement if you wish.</span></div></div>",

Outside, the night air is cold and bites at your skin through your clothes. The starry sky above dimly illuminates the world around you and you can see Pinkie has no intention of stopping, but you can't leave yet. With increasing resolve you resist, eventually pulling your arm free just so you can take the moment to bid the other two ponies goodnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and Applejack have just left while Spike closes the door. You walk over and wrap Twilight in a tight hug. \"See you tomorrow, Twilight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returns the embrace in silence for a moment. \"[Your name],\" she giggles, pushing you away firmly and crossing her arms. \"I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't worry yer head a bit there, partner,\" Applejack assures you. \"Tough as nails, this one right here.\"  She places a hand on Twilight's shoulder and gives her a shake as if to emphasize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry that cute little head of yours,\" reiterates Pinkie, suddenly behind you and giving your hair a rough tousling. \"If you're the one who's scared of the dark, you little 'fraidy cat, you've got Pinkie Pie to keep you smiling!\" With that she grabs you much more forcefully in her playful manner and gallops away with you barely able to keep upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight guys!\" you call to Twilight and Applejack, your fleeting view of Twilight's horn glowing and a forcefield materializing a great dome of violet aura around the entire tree that is library quickly disappearing around the corner as Pinkie presses on towards Sugarcube corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of you arrive, the lights are off, the sweets shop having closed hours ago. The bright colors of gingerbread house-themed building were hidden in the shadows leaving only its odd shaped silhouette standing against the speckled dark blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie suddenly stops and turns to you. You can't see her face, but she cringes down and her next sound makes it obvious that she's putting her finger to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhhh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What's up?\" you ask her in a whispering tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gotta keep it down when we go in,\" Pinkie explains quite loudly despite her whispering rasp, \"see, I'm technically not supposed to have other ponies over, especially colts--\" She nudges you with her elbow at the last part. You can only imagine that she winked as well in the darkness. \"--The Cakes' rules and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean over as in overnight,\" you specify, since you and the gang were over in Pinkie's room plenty of times for her parties, but they never were slumber parties. \"Then why did you invite me over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly,\" Pinkie Pie claps her hands to your cheeks and presses your faces together, forehead to forehead, nose to muzzle, \"they didn't say anything about having <i>humans</i> or <i>boys</i> over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. Taking the advantage of poor word choice in verbal agreements,\" you say rolling your eyes dubiously. You doubt Pinkie could see you do that despite the close proximity to her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that right.\" She lets go of your face. \"But I doubt that Mr. and Mrs. Cake will see it the way I do, so we'll sneak in anyway. Makes this feel much more. . .naughty,\" she spiders her fingers across your chest as she says that. You're starting to cling to a certain idea of what that the wink she gave you really meant. The idea both urges you forward while giving you apprehension as well. You stand there a moment before you have to catch up with Pinkie Pie who is already at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside and the door shut and locked behind you, Pinkie tippy-hooves her way up the stairs while you, despite your rubber soled sneakers, still manage to make it seem as if every floorboards underneath your feet creaks loudly. It's not that loud, but you're still paranoid, a pair of guardians with disapproval of your current act sleeping somewhere in the deadly quiet building. Even greater disapproval of what else might happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you go. Down the hall you creep, everything dark but visible to your straining eyes. You come to Pinkie's closed door, light slipping out from beneath the gap at the floor. Feeling low, you take a moment to yourself now that you aren't being ushered anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie had always been a great friend to you. When you moved to Ponyville you felt very alienated being in a new town that had never seen a human in person before. Twilight and Spike were your only friends to begin with, everyone else keeping a distance from you or a few who felt like tormenting you. Applejack quickly followed as a close friend when she stood up for you on multiple occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only pony who took a shine to you quicker was Pinkie Pie, as she did to all newcomers, so you didn't feel too special when she threw a welcoming party for you. She also prodded you a lot throughout, curious of your strange visage and attire. She meant no harm, but it was a reminder of the stares and humiliating questions you received in you classes on the first days of school. You were a tough crowd for Pinkie. Any smiles from you were forced or halfhearted at best. You didn't consider her a friend at first, merely an acquaintance. But as time when on, your depression continued to build up when you found yourself unable to open up about your problems to anyone anymore, knowing that you would be singled out for a long time to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you didn't know at the time were the lengths at which Pinkie Pie would go to give you a genuine smile and make a friend in you. She would find you often and do her best to cheer you up by just being herself since she couldn't drag Baltimare to you. It was something to get used to, her personality, but she eventually grew on you and she had even begun to make you smile and then laugh at her best jokes and scoff at the ones that fell flat. At the darkest time, she had become the light of your days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories make you feel better and you smile. You realize that you have been standing still outside Pinkie's door for a while. Her light is still on, but you don't hear movement. She must be in bed already and waiting for you, if she's not already asleep, after all, she was wearing her pajamas to begin with. The light blinds you when you open the door, your eyes slowly readjusting. You shield them with a hand as you blink a few times as you move into Pinkie's room. Finally able to keep them open, you open your eyes and your eyes fall across Pinkie's bed, the covers undisturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, Pinkie?\" you breathe in confusion. Looking left, looking right, you are about to sweep around when *click* the lights go out. Back in the darkness, the assault of light in your eyes leaves you blind. \"Hey, what's going on? What'd you do that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must've been Pinkie at the light switch pulling another fast one on you, about to jump at you with a creepy mask on. You try to move, but immediately step on something unseen in the dark and lose your balance, arms flailing about. Suddenly, you feel gentle fingers press into your chest, steadying you. You have no time to thank the pony who can be none other than Pinkie, but gentle fingers become a firm shove with a palm that pushes you back. Only able to sputter a few confused syllables, all you can do is walk back to avoid falling over before the back of your knees hit a soft edge. The hand leaves your chest and you nearly regain balance when a finger flicks your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boop!\" says Pinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelp, thinking you'll hit the floor, but you fall back into the soft bed instead. The bed shakes as Pinkie fallows you down, arms on with side of your head, her legs nearly straddling your hips, and then her muzzle presses gently to your nose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. It was obvious that Pinkie's playfulness around you had become somewhat sensual of late, but it had often been in jest of other relationships, making fun of that part of growing up. At the worst it was just Pinkie teasing you crazy for kicks. You didn't think Pinkie Pie ever wanted to take it seriously. To tell the truth, you didn't think she was ready, and neither did you think you were ready to go through with it, especially not like this, not here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's thighs tighten around you and her arms wrap around your shoulders as she presses her body into yours. You groan, arching your back so that she won't feel the stiffness building in your pants. You know you should stop this, but if she makes the first move, it will be difficult not to reciprocate. You don't know if you have enough willpower to resist.</span></div></div>",

You try your best to sit up to see across the bed to the furthest side of the room, but Pinkie is still unwittingly holding you down with her weight while looking over her shoulder, watching the door as well. You can feel her whole body stiffen through her palms her held to your shoulders when she sees the light in the hall click on and seep into the room from under the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie!\" you whisper urgently, \"let me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could definitely push her off if you wanted to, but you didn't want to be so forceful with your friend, not to mention the noise it could cause, and those hoofsteps were drawing ever closer. In seconds they would be at the door! And Pinkie didn't even hear you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie!\" you poke her sides to grab her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh...what?\" she asks as if oblivious to the situation at hand (or hoof in her case).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off'a me!\" you demand, \"I gotta hide!\" It's when you're finally jerking your way out from under her that she gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I was just thinking of a place for you to hide, since you really are bad at hide and seek. I know where--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the hoofsteps stop just outside her door. Shit, maybe they would've just passed by; did they hear your talking? Too late to do anything now, the doorknob clicks as its mechanism turns and light spills into the dark room. Mr. Cake is standing there with Mrs. Cake right behind him. He is the first to see into the room, his eyes focusing in on whats happening on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie?\" he asks, \"what's going on in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, exactly what it looks like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is it that I'm looking at?\" he asks sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just camping out on the bed and telling scary stories!\" Pinkie Pie replies, turning the flashlight held in her hands onto her grinning muzzle. She was now under the sheets and had them propped up with a stick like a makeshift tent. \"\u2014with. . .uh. . .Gummy,\" Pinkie ad libs away, yet the little reptile helpfully pops his head up from underneath the covers, \"and. . .umm. . .ooh, Mr Pillow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHa! No matter how farfetched Pinkie's fibs will be, the Cakes will never be able to find you! Even as the light in Pinkie's room turns on, Mr. Cake clearly not swayed by her impression of your voice that she gave, er, Mr. Pillow. You hear his hoofsteps slowly circling the room, perhaps nonchalantly looking around for any. . .unwanted guests while you hear Mrs. Cake begin speaking to Pinkie about why she really shouldn't stay up late. There really wasn't much place to hide in Pinkie's room other than the closet, under the bed, and in the hooflocker, and a protective guardian like Mr. Cake would be sure to check the obvious places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the other hand are not even in the room at all! Hanging by the tips of your fingers, you are holding yourself up just below Pinkie Pie's outside window sill. Okay, that sounds dangerous, but the second story roof is only a few feet below, so you are safe enough and can make your sneaky getaway if you need to, though you'd rather stay until the Cakes leave the room, because where else to go when it's this late? Your arms can probably hold out anyway. Best of all, you've completely dodged a bullet because Mr Cake won't check out the window because it's right behind Pinkie's bed. Genius. You are a freaking genius! If both your hands weren't occupied you would give yourself a pat on the b\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh Pinkie,\" you hear Mrs. Cake's voice, \"it's pretty darn cold outside, would you be a dear and close your window?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okie-dokie-lokie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next split second it takes for Pinkie to reach up and slam the window down onto your fingers you don't have much time to think about the things that could have been going through your head, and your next almost instinctual reaction of yanking your fingertips out of harm's way probably wasn't priority one because that's exactly what you did. A good question to ask yourself would be \"dammit, Pinkie, why?\" but the next moments as you fall and catch a glimpse of her face with a rather blank expression of \"oops\" etched all over it answer that one plainly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto the the darkness you fall a bit too perplexed to even cry out in surprise. You can feel yourself pitch as you fall, landing flush on your back with the angled roof, knocking the wind out of you. Too dazed to do anything, your body's inertia still forces you to slide and roll further down. You topple over the edge, but you regain control in time to throw your arms to the shingles and scrabble desperately for a firm grip.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You and Fluttershy had been eating peacefully as you helped yourselves to the nice breakfast that she had prepared for the two of you. It was a simple breakfast plate with scrambled eggs and black beans topped with tomatoes, avocado slices, and a snip of parsley. You also have a plate with toast and butter, and for drinks a glass of milk and another with orange juice. As you are just finishing up, picking at the last bits of food straying on your plate, your mind begins to wander back to the upcoming festival. It had taken a backseat to everything for the past few hours, but now that thing would (hopefully) revert back to normal, you were back to wondering who it was that Fluttershy was taking, and for that matter, who you would take. Twilight had said that she and Fluttershy had dates, yet they would have been the first one you would have wanted to ask to such an event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your Name], is something wrong?\" Fluttershy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh,\" you realize that you had been staring blankly at your empty plate for a while now, \"nothing, just have a little something on my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy's gaze lowers nervously as her hands fidget under the table. \"Was it about what happened at the library?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think so, but nah,\" you say lightheartedly. \"Maybe the years in Baltimare made me accustomed vandalism, or something. No, I was thinking about that festival--what was it called, Tartarus and Elysium?--I still don't know who I should take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" Fluttershy perks up as the subject changes to something more pleasant. \"Have you asked any of our other friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hadn\u2019t had much time, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've all been pretty busy themselves, so maybe they haven't had time to ask anyone yet,\" she suggested trying to be helpful in her friendly way. \"I'm quite positive that Rainbow Dash is not going with anyone yet and I know that she is interested in attending. I could help you in asking her . . . that is, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to ease into this question so it wouldn't seem like you were prying: \"Maybe I will. I would usually go with Twilight, but it looks like a date has asked her out already.\" You give her a curious smile, \"Twilight also told me that someone asked you out as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sort of. He didn't ask me to the festival as much as I arranged to accompany him to the festival,\" she began as her cheeks began to blush. \"You see, he's never really been to Ponyville or any town for that matter, living mostly all by himself. When we met, we started to talk about where both of us lived and when he said that he wanted to see the world, and I thought that the festival would be as good a chance as any for him. So, I proposed to be his escort into Ponyville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what\u2019s his name?\u201d you ask the important question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name is Hunter, and he\u2019s a\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust to clarify,\u201d you back up, \u201che has not been in town, does not get out much . . . is this an old hermit living in the middle of the woods?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no, he\u2019s not old, but he does live in the Everfree Forest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that makes se\u2014what?\u201d you reel. \u201cThe Everfree?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Fluttershy affirms with jubilation, \u201cand he practically knows all the woods around Ponyville like the back of his hoof. We met one day when I was escorting some animals to some new homes and he\u2019s been kind enough to offer his accompany whenever I\u2019m out there ever since.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Fluttershy meeting someone in the Everfree and then leading them into town makes you dubious. However, you don\u2019t want to assume too much, remembering the overreaction that Zecora\u2019s presence had stirred a while ago. Still, you need to press the issue further and find out more about this Hunter, as he was called. The words built up on your tongue just as your phone went off, signaling a phone call. You grumble in annoyance, but ask politely for Fluttershy to excuse you, to which she smiles kindly and lets you go off to the adjacent room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would be calling this early?</span></div></div>",

You and Fluttershy sit idly, sipping away at your beverages while you explain to her that the responsibility for the protecting the Elements of Harmony and possibly Equestria itself has fallen squarely on the shoulders of you, her, and your friends all for the sake of discretion. Fluttershy becomes worried immediately:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how can we help?\" She stammers. You give her a quizzical look that makes her cast her gaze down in thought. \"Well, what I meant was, wouldn't it be safer if we let the the Guard take care of everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"I think Celestia is trying to bait the culprit into trying to steal the Element's again, you see, we really don't know what we're dealing with; whoever did it was very sloppy but very clean at the same time. Last night when Twilight was--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a knock at the door. That's good, you won't have to repeat yourself again now that your friends are starting to arrive. You walk over to open the door and immediately a blur of blue zooms overhead into the house. Your eyes follow Rainbow Dash as she loops inside for back-flip and crouches into a perfect landing on both hooves, startling Fluttershy with her loud entry. Her pose grants you a few milliseconds to admire those beautifully athletic legs, that gorgeously toned posterior clad in tight black-and-white training shorts albeit slightly obscured by her rainbow tail, and her lithe body hugged by a grey workout shirt. Rainbow stands and turns around to smile at you, and you mentally slap yourself, thankfully able to look at her face and smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gang's all here [Your Name],\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on a moment, RD,\" calls Applejack's Dixie drawl right before she trots in. \"Don't get [Your Name] to tell ya the big news before everyone has time to catch up.\" You move your head to see past Applejack and spot Rarity and Twilight far behind, just moseying along, seemingly in conversation. \"I already had ta haul it on over here to catch up with ya'll without ya flyin' ahead. I'd say I made time good enough to beat yer ground speed records.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow just scoffs. \"In your dreams, AJ.\" She then walks away to take a seat by Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' there, [Your Name],\" Applejack takes notice of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Applejack,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, what's that there dressin' ya have on yer head for?\" She also takes notice in the bandage wrapped around your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what, this? It's nothing, just a headband.\" You only jest to make light of the fact, because Applejack can sniff out your lies. She however crosses her arms, expecting a better answer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know a bandage when I see one. Did ya get that just yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack really, it's no big deal, and I don't want to talk about--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes narrow. \"Did that feller Dumbbell take a swing at ya again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble in irritation. \"Fluttershy is this really necessary?\" you turn to ask even as you are pulling the bandage off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your head was bleeding [Your Name]. You really shouldn't take it off so soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it is off you feel the back of your head and feel the beginnings of a nasty scab forming under your hair. \"It's just a scratch,\" you inform her, a little exasperated, but you smile so she knows you're just fine. You then look at Applejack and say, \"See? Nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened?\" Applejack asks, just curious now that she deduced that it wasn't a bully, but she still seems insistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just slipped and fell, because of...,\" you say, the ending kind of petering off into mumbles. Applejack blinks for a moment when you drop the reason, but shrugs and decides not to prod further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, just be more careful next time, alright partner?\" She says, smacking your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, what a nasty cut on the back of your nut,\" comes a deliberate rhyme spoken right into your ear. Speak of Discord... \"If I ever find that *mumble grumble mumble* that did this to your cute little head,\" Pinkie Pie glomps you around the neck, \"it's in a world of trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll throughout your teeth are grinding away in anger. \"Pinkie, a word,\" you tell her, pulling both of you outside and closing the door,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, are we playing charades?\" Pinkie lets go and bounces. \"How many syllables? Make it a big one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This</i> is <i>your</i> fault!\" you growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfftth, that's four words, silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The head wound, Pinkie! You dropped me out of the window!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie gasps, \"Wha?! I didn't <i>drop</i> you! ...I just closed the window on your fingertips.\" Pinkie smiles nervously and cringes at the last part. \"Sorry, my bad. Although,\" she perks up again, \"you really need to work on your hide-and-seek skills. You pick <i>really</i> bad spots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrr! Why'd you drag me in there if the Cakes were gonna freak out about it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'd say you freaked out more than they did when you jumped out the window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then what?! You just left me out there in the cold?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I saw Fluttershy helping you, and I know how good she is with taking care of strange creatures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you bawl indignantly, so frustrated at trying to contend with Pinkie's bubbly attitude that you feel as if a blood vessel could pop in your neck at any moment. \"I had a nasty dream because of you!\" you obviously ran out of arguments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? What about?\" Pinkie gets eye to eye with you in her curiosity. You have to gently push her back as you know that no good can come from talking to her about these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I tell you what the dream was, you're not gonna go breaking out the tarot cards, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie averts her eyes in thought, then looks at you and says \".......Mmmmmmaaayyybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it,\" you let her go and heave a sigh, rubbing your temple. \"Oh Celestia. I should have walked out when I had the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not get the chance to sleepover at my place?\" Pinkie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if it means breaking the house rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" calls Twilight, she and Rarity finally making it over to you two. \"What were you two talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Twilight, hey Rarity,\" Pinkie greets the both of them, \"[Your Name] and I were talking about last night when mmphmbfffbm--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cupped your hand over Pinkie's muzzle before she got any further. \"Just a random Pinkie moment that I hope never has a bearing on my life...or even this next week for that matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight raises her eyebrows. \"Oh uh okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your name],\" speaks Rarity, \"I don't mean to be rude but I have quite the order that I must fill by day's end. Could we possible get things going so I can get back to my work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay. Everyone else is already inside.\"</span></div></div>",

There would be more than enough ponies there to hide out among the crowds, mostly on the first day, Tartarus. With all of the mosh-pits and loud music, it would be perfect conditions for a thief's getaway.\" You listen more and are actually impressed by how well thought out her plan was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second day, in the Meadows, will probably be the least likely day that they would try to take them but enough is going on that they may still try.\" she continues<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the third day, Elysium?\" asks Pinkie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our last resort... If the thief doesn't make a move on the first or second days of the event we'll wear our Elements to the event in formal dress. This would be the most dangerous scenario to us becuase we wouldn't have them guarded in one place. We would possibly be facing the thief head on. But becuase they wouldn't be guarded so closely and becuase they'd be out in the open, the thief may just be desperate enough to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony thinks it over for a moment.

He\u2019s in a lot of your classes. \u201cYeah,\u201d you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do you know what he thinks of me?\u201d she asks, this time with her face as red as a rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you see where this is going. Rarity wants Jumper to take her to the end-of-school dance. \u201cNot really,\u201d you answer. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, if it\u2019s not too much to ask,\u201d Rarity pleads, \u201cCould you please ask him how he feels about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d you say, \u201cbut if he\u2019s interested, what then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you tell me, and I\u2019ll ask him out,\u201d she answers as if it was so simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll ask him when I get the chance,\u201d you say, as you turn to leave the boutique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd be subtle about it!\u201d she calls out before you go out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will,\u201d you say, \u201cBye!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk home, you think about what just happened. Rarity just asked you to ask a stallion she liked if he\u2019s interested in her. You always questioned Rarity\u2019s taste in men. She was a beautiful pony, but she always tended to go for the stallions that look good, but don\u2019t deserve her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake Prince Blueblood, for instance. You knew him personally, since you used to live in Canterlot, and you knew that he was a real dick. You wanted to tell Rarity that, but you didn\u2019t want to ruin her dreams of getting with him, and she probably wouldn\u2019t have believed you since she was so infatuated with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper, on the other hand, seems to be a pretty nice guy. Even though he\u2019s a jock, he was the kind of jock that wasn\u2019t a total flankhole to everypony. He wasn\u2019t a dimwit, either. You sit next to him in every class that you have with him, and you would occasionally glance at his tests when the teacher would give back the grades, and he always got a good score. He\u2019s pretty much an all-around good guy, perfect for a pony like Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, speak of the devil, you see Jumper just down the road. This would be the perfect time to ask him what he thinks of Rarity. You remember to heed the words she said: be subtle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Jumper,\u201d you say to him as you reach him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, [your name]?\u201d he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much,\u201d you say. \u201cI\u2019m just on my way home from Rarity\u2019s place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d he asks. \u201cAre you two-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no. She just called me over to help her with her designs and stuff,\u201d you say. If Jumper thought that you and Rarity were together, then he wouldn\u2019t give her a second thought, and that\u2019s not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince we\u2019re talking about Rarity, what do you think of her?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s Jumper\u2019s response?</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds, you walked to Twilight's room to make sure she was okay. She was on her bed, face buried in her pillow when you entered. \"Are you all right, Twilight?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" she replied into her pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a crush on you, you dolt!\" she blurted out, face popping up from her pillow. \"I have for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would explain the kiss,\" you said, trying to lighten the mood as everything clicked in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've wanted to tell you for a while,\" Twilight said. \"I was just too scared to say anything. And...I think I want to go beyond just being a crush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you, Twilight,\" you responded. \"As more than just a friend. Just with everything going on lately, my head's been in a thousand places. And what do you mean 'beyond'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Twilight began, her face growing red. \"We've lived together for a while now. And...well...I've SEEN you, if you catch my meaning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you asked, then it hit you. \"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" Twilight said. \"On accident the first time! I think you didn't close the door all the way one day while you were showering. And...umm...I liked what I saw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face became very red and her voice got quiet. \"What?\" you asked, not quite catching what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I liked what I saw,\" Twilight said, her voice getting stronger. \"So I kept trying to see it again. And, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off and turned on her back to face you, purposefully spreading her legs to let you see up her skirt. Twilight was not wearing any panties, leaving her smooth pussy bare for you to stare at. \"I even spied on you masturbating once,\" she said, her breathing getting heavier. \"I don't know why I'm telling you all of this, but I just can't stop myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords failed you as you stared at her pussy, noticing that it was glistening with wetness. You also noticed, for the first time it seemed, that Twilight had stellar hips. The sound of your zipper made you look down to see Twilight using her magic to undo your pants. \"Twilight,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait anymore,\" she said. \"We're alone and all of it is out in the open. Can I see it up close for once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just nod, noting the sexy tone in her voice. She undoes your pants and tugs them off with her magic, letting your hard dick spring free. Twilight stared at your shaft and moved closer to it. You closed your eyes in enjoyment when she started moving her smooth hand over the length. You let out a small groan when she cupped your balls. You opened your eyes to see her unbuttoning her shirt and freeing her breasts. \"I've seen you ejaculate a few times,\" Twilight said, laying back and spreading her legs invitingly. \"And I want to do it in me...please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, your head fogged by the aroma of sex. She was your best friend, but also just said she wanted not only to have sex with you, but also that she wanted you to cum in her. You got between her legs and inserted the head of your dick into Twilight's pussy, making her moan sharply. She grabbed you with her legs and shoved you the rest of the way inside her. The sudden flood of warmth, tightness, and pleasure was too much for you. You came the instant your dick hilted inside Twilight. Your head flared against her cervix and spat a fat wad of hot cum straight into her womb. Twilight cried out in pleasure as your cum splattered wildly through her cervix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel it throbbing,\" Twilight moaned hotly, her body tensing as your big load sprayed into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's legs released you when your orgasm ended to catch her breath. You slowly pulled your dick out of her and sat back, closing your eyes and basking in the afterglow. After a few moments, you felt a sensation in your crotch.

If not, Twilight would immobilize her with a paralysis spell and force her to talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Lyra!\" she says with a smile. \"You wanted to talk to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" the unicorn replies. \"It's about [your name].\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth mare's demeanor turns sour instantly. \"Ugh, you called me here to talk about <b>him</b>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking things too far,\" Lyra says. \"You're lucky nopony important found out.

With Lyra and Bon Bon back together, and you and Twilight now in a relationship, life could only get better. You couldn't keep the fact that you were now dating away from your friends, who, thanks to Rarity, quickly found out what was going on between you two. Since the cat was out of the bag, you decided to ask them if they were going to the end-of-school dance, and who they'd be going with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash was going with a colt that was on her track team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie got a ton of invites from various guys, so she just chose one at random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was going with Jumper (thanks to you).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was going alone. She was never looking for a date, since she thought that it wasn't important. You wonder if she has even the tiniest bit of a romantic in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy didn't want to go, but since she was the Secretary on the Student Council, which is funding the event, she had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the night of the dance, you all meet at the front entrance. \"My, oh my. Don't we all look stunning this evening?\" says Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah guess so...\" says Applejack. The dance was semi-formal, so she wore a blouse that Rarity insisted on making for her and some jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the party's inside, so let's go,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the school gymnasium, where the dance is being held, the air is more festive than you expected. The music was blasting, and everypony was on the dance floor, Pinkie Pie and her date included. \"Maybe we should wait for a song that's a little slower,\" suggests Twilight. \"This one is a little too fast-paced for my tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" you say. \"Wanna go get something to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Twilight walk to the snack bar, where Fluttershy was taking her post. \"They've got you manning the snack bar, I see,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least it gives me an excuse not to go on the dance floor,\" she says. \"What would you two like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get a diet cola?\" your date asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make that two,\" you add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four bits, please,\" the pegasus says. Twilight reaches for her wallet, but you beat her to the punch and take yours out first. \"No way, Twi,\" you say,\"I'm not gonna let you make me look bad in front of Fluttershy. I'm paying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy giggles, and so does Twilight. \"If you insist,\" the unicorn says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you find a place to sit once you get your drinks. Suddenly, the song changes to a slower one, but still upbeat. Hoping that the caffeine from her drink loosened her up a bit, you ask Twilight, \"Do you want to dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she say?</span></div></div>",

As Rarity explains the insecurities she's been having over her latest designs, your mind keeps replaying that brief moment. That brief moment where you... \"sensed\" something in the mare when she asked you to help her out. Was it... hesitation? No, it couldn't be. Rarity's not the kind of pony to hesitate.

You never thought that Rarity was \"too high-maintenance\". Sure, she could be a drama queen at times, and she does have some extravagant tastes, but she was never unreasonable or demanding like a typical high-maintenance girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it's just that I've been evaluating my love life for a while,\" she explains. \"I've gotten a taste of what high-maintenance was when I met Prince Blueblood at the Gala. Celestia knows how long it's been since then. I've been through three boyfriends in my life, all of whom I've dated during our second year of high school. They all wanted to break up because they thought that my standards were too high, but they can't be. All I want is a regular guy. Is that too much to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't,\" you say bluntly. \"They were most likely making excuses. I think the problem with guys like your exes is that they expect girls as pretty as you to be just that, pretty girls.

You're always there, looking out for me, helping me when I need it the most. I'm sure the girl you're taking to the dance can't wait to go with you.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I don't have a date,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you don't?\" she asks, surprised. \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

After that, you got to work hiding anything that Auntie Celeste wouldn\u2019t like. R-rated movies, drawings of girls (because Celeste never liked you bringing up the subject of girls), CDs with those \u201cParental Advisory\u201d stickers on them, anything that she would deem, in her words, \u201cinappropriate for a boy your age,\u201d which is weird considering that you\u2019ll be eighteen by the end of summer.

You\u2019re awake!\u201d she says. \u201cGo and take a shower then get dressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already have one parental figure coming over. I don\u2019t need another one,\u201d you say before going up the stairs to take a shower. After cleaning yourself up and getting dressed, you go back downstairs to see a mini buffet set up. You lick your lips in anticipation and go for a plate, but a bolt of magic hits your hand as soon as you reach out to grab one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now!\u201d Twilight scolds. \u201cWait till Princess Celestia gets here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your hand and start to mumble to yourself. \u201cParanoid, crabby, overbearing little-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you hear a knock on the door, and the unicorn grunts in frustration. \u201cCan you get that, [your name]?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhoever it is, tell them that we\u2019re really busy and to <br>\r\ncome back later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and make your way to the door.

Me first!\" says Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie Pie's the kinky one that will try anything,\" you say against your will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me?\" Applejack asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rough one,\" you say, making everypony burst out in laughter, except Fluttershy, who wasn't very comfortable with the topic at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Fluttershy?\" asks Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not know...\" the yellow pegasus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gentle one,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No surprise there,\" says Dashie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the squealer,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? How!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any mare that acts tough all the time is a total squealer. It just makes sense.\" The carriage erupts with laughter again, everypony agreeing on what you just said. Even Fluttershy giggled a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about me, darling?\" Rarity asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dominatrix,\" you say reluctantly. The unicorn ponders this for a second and says. \"Yep, that's me, alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now me,\" says Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be good,\" Rainbow whispers to Pinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The freaky one,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, everypony else, including Fluttershy, laughs loud enough for Canterlot to hear you. Twilight, on the other hand was blushing profusely. \"The freaky one? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bookworms are always the freaky ones!\" Pinkie Pie giggles. \"I bet you have some really freaky fetishes, Twi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, whatever,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage finally pulls up in front of the school, and you all file out. However, just before you enter, a certain somepony calls out to all of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, [your name]! Cousin Twilight!\" she calls. Everypony turns their head to see Solaria approaching you and Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Oh, fuck me,\"</font> you say under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Solaria,\" says Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise! You weren't expecting me were you?\" says the princess in disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everypony, this is my cousin, Solaria,\" says Twilight. \"She's going to be staying with me and [your name] for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to surprise you two, plus I wanted get out of the house for the night, so this was the perfect excuse!\" Solaria says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are we standing out here for?\" says Rainbow Dash. \"Let's go inside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens during the dance.</span></div></div>",

You recall the first time you both met, she was barely able to say her name, saying it so small &amp; softly with her face being all red. It made your heart explode from adorableness. You two both had this love for animals, which made Fluttershy talk with you a lot more easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, wanting to go help her out...but with Twilight their..<br>\r\n <br>\r\n&lt;Twilight Sparkle&gt; you chuckle to yourself, no need to say much about Twilight.

After Elementary though, you had to leave since your father was moving jobs all the way to Baltimare. The sad day when you had to tell her yourself that you were going far away was heart breaking non the less.

She had so much confidence like Rainbow Dash, but wasn't to arrogant. She was beautiful, maybe not as much as Rarity, but Applejack had something more than looks. She was kind-hearted, but didn't let anypony treat her like trash like how Angle bunny does to sweet Fluttershy. She was a fun, maybe not in a sense of fun like Pinkie Pie, but looking at clouds, kicking some apples with someone can be fun. She was a leader, like Twilight Sparkle. But unlike Twilight, Applejack wouldn't throw everything out of proportion like when she did just for not sending her letters on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you sit up. You've decided to go help Applejack...watching Applebloom can't be as bad as dealing with somepony arrogance, a sicking dessert, getting drama for saying a dress looks nice &amp; dealing with a cold-devil while petting some cats...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start running down stairs, you spot Spike dusting some shelves on the latter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run past the latter, causing it to spin around with the poor dragon holding on for dear life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-W-waaah!! [Your Name]!? Where ya going!?\" Spike shouts as you open the door in a rush<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop for a second, you feet still stamping the ground. You tell your dragon friend with a grin \"Going to AJ! See ya!!\" and on those words...you're off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ==============================<br>\r\nAfter running through Ponyville for the past 10 minutes, you finally reach the front gate of Sweet Apple Acre's. You breath hard as you take some steps forward. You got to thank Rainbow Dash for all the running, you're more faster than you give yourself credit for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk past the little entrance to get into the barn's fields. You look around, seeing haystacks near the barn, the farm animals walking behind the fences, the workers readying the fields<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff, wiping off some sweat on your forehead. Wondering if AJ is inside her house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walks towards the Apple Family's house, you wonder what Big Mac is doing since you never seen him not on this farm. You reach to the front door of their home. You knock on the door 3 times and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, the door opens. Your eyes are greeted with a nice sight. A tall-orange mare who is wearing a brown cowgirl hat, orange cowgirl-daisy duke top that shows off her midriff with a pair of blue tight shorts that hug her waist tightly that also show off her nice long legs. Her grayish yellow mane &amp; tail are both tied with a band at the end of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your name]! You're here now, I thought you'd wouldn't be showing up\" said the southern belle of the Apple Family Applejack<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself blush, you wipe your nose with your finger to hide the blush. \"Eehe, Sorry...was busy for a bit..\" you tell her, you don't want to tell her you blew everypony off for her. She's to nice like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack's muzzle forms a smile, the 3-freckles on each of her cheeks complement her beauty. \"Dat's all fine and dandy Sugarcube, I was more worried for Applebloom, she's the one that wanted to see you here..\" Applejack says, her shoulders leaning against the door way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, Applebloom wanted to see you? You find it funny...you do recall seeing her every time you hang around AJ. You wonder why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack seems to have realized that she's been letting you stand in the heat, she gets off the door way and takes a step inside her house. \"Sorry about that sugarcube, C'mon\" She urges you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk inside the Apple House, walking past the kitchen and slumping your butt on the living room couch. Applejack giggles at you as she walks to where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, wait here den', I'll go tell Applebloom about ya being here now\" she tells you as she walks towards the stair case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, you open your mouth to tell her \"W-wait AJ!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack stops as she reaches the first step, she blink and walks in front of you. \"What is it sugarcube..?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Applejack with your mouth hanging open, your words on what you're gonna say die in your mouth as your eyes taste the sweet eye candy of her well-shaped body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack's chest bounces slightly from the breath she takes, her tight daisy duke shirt is the only thing holding them back since it seems she doesn't wear a bra, Applejack might have the 2nd biggest set, only losing to Fluttershy.

The minute she gets out of your sight, you instantly remember what you wanted to tell her. You were going to tell her that you had feelings for her.

You turn to see a yellow pony with a pinkish-red mane and tail coming down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Applebloom.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I was wondering'\u2026 if you'd like to see my clubhouse.\" she says. You were aware that Applebloom hung out with two other ponies and that they were known as the Cutie Mark Crusaders, but you didn't know that they were a legit club. \"Umm\u2026 sure.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Come on!\" she says as she practically drags you by your arm to her clubhouse, with her older sister trailing behind the two of you. Applebloom spends the next several minutes showing you around the club house. You catch sight of a long list of talents that the Crusaders attempted in order to find out what their special talent was. You chuckle to yourself. After the \"grand tour,\" you and the Apple sisters lounge around outside the clubhouse. You decide to take a chance and ask AJ out, but you had to get her sister out of the way, first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Applejack,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" she says, turning her attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I talk to you in private for a second?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\u2026\" she says, unsure of where you're going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applebloom,\" she says. \"Could you give me and [your name] some alone time for a hot minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, okay.\" she says, and she walks back to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, we're alone now, so what is it that you were fixin' to say?\" asks AJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was your chance now.

Honesty is a virtue indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack seems to notice that sad look in your face, she gives a genuine toothy grin \"Now, I can't *go to the movies* with ya..but I can watch one with ya in my house\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself light up again. \"Awesome!\" you say enthusiastically like when Twilight get's herself a new book to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack giggles at your excitement, she turns away from you &amp; starts walking over to her house, giving you a nice look at her sweet-ass &amp; swishing tail. \"Well, might as well watch one now since my jobs done for today, Come on Tiger~\" your southern beauty teases you with a new nickname as she walks into her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou quickly run into the Apple Family's house, not wanting to leave your crush waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst you &amp; AJ, Applebloom as been watching you both from her up-stairs window. The little pony's face seems to be a bit red &amp; her eyes filled with a tears....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put in a video cassette in the VCR in the Apple Family's living room, Applejack went up stairs to put Applebloom to sleep since its past her bedtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie you're both gonna watch is some Wild West flick, figures Applejack would like that kinda genre, but hey, so do you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou click the rewind button &amp; grab the remote, seating your butt on the big green couch as you wait for Applejack to come down. Your wish has been granted, Applejack slowly walks down stairs, still wearing her same get-up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya...wouldn't cha know, Applebloom decided to sleep in early by herself...\" Applejack tells you a bit surprised, she sits right next to you on your right. You shrug \"She did help you pick up the apple right? That is kinda tiring\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack nods, seeming to take your answer as the truth, she leans back on the couch as you press the remote to play. The VCR makes it noise &amp; starts to film. The usual FBI warning &amp; advertisement for other movies begin.<br>\r\nAs one commercial starts about some child movie about some boy finding a special device &amp; is some chosen-one starts. AJ shows some discomfort. Her legs keep crossing each other as well as her rubbing her hoof with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice this and ask her \"Hey, Applejack. You alright?\" your voice sounding a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack turns her head to look at you, she smiles softly &amp; shakes her head \"Na, I'm fine Tiger, it's just after a long day of apple bucking, my hooves tend to be sore..also doesn't help much when I do my exercises in the morning to stay in shape\" she says. AJ lifts her right hoof on her lap &amp; rubs it with her hand roughly. Grimacing slightly from the soreness \"Applebloom or Big mac would give me a massage on my tense spots to stop the pain...\" Applejack says as she glances at you, a bit of red covers her freckled cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly have a coy smile on your face, your eyes narrowing playfully as you understand what she's getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I'll give you a massage then\"~ you tell her with a little slur in your tone,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ gives you a little grin, her face still looking hot \"E-Ehh~ why not...but it's not *just* my hooves Sugar~\" she says back at you. Applejack flops on her stomach, she then lays her arms &amp; head on the couch's arm rest. Her hooves lay on your lap, she kicks the playfully as she closes her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself blush since you're gonna be touching Applejack..let's hope you can keep yourself under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough into your fist to clear your throat &amp; then ask her \"Where would you like me to start..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She nods slowly &amp; lays her head between her arms as she continues to watch the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently move Applejack's hooves off your lap &amp; stand up, reaching your hand into your back pocket to get your cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly flip open your phone &amp; say \"Hello?\". Suddenly, that familiar stoic voice speaks to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hey...where have you've been the past hours..</i>?\" said the voice of an old friend &amp; your host of where you now live...Twilight Sparkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a chill go up your spine as she sounds more colder than usual, she must be upset about you leaving her with Fluttershy to take care of those animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you say anything, you cover the speaker on your shoulder and look back at Applejack, the look on her face showing confusion &amp; worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong, [*Your Name*]..?

At this moment, that wouldn't be so bad..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your finger up to her &amp; shh \"It's..important..I'll be right back AJ..\" you whisper. Applejack blinks, wondering what's got you so fidgety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright hon..\" she says back in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly step out of the living room, leaving your date alone to watch the movie meant for the both of you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ===================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly go outside in the front of the Apple Family's house, leaning your body against the wall. You take a deep breath &amp; hold the phone up to your ear. \"Sorry about that...I was..busy..\" you say to Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you hear for the moment is just the static of the reception, then your lavender-maned unicorn *friend* speaks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Uh-huh...Where in Luna's moon have you've been..!? Spike told me you left to Applejack's place..!</i>\" Twilight shouts into the phone, her voice sounding loud enough for your ears to go deaf for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes twitch slightly &amp; you move the cell phone away from your ears, pulling it back you reply. \"I did..I came over to help her watch Applebloom..\" you tell Twilight the reason why you came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Too watch Applebloom? AJ needed help with that??\" Twilight says in harsh tone, she's not done \"Well, its nice to know she needs an extra pair of eyes to watch one kid.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feels yourself grow angry, you retort \"Hey, Big Mac left her in charge of the farm, she has to buck all the apples, make the cider, bake the pie etc.! She can't do all that if she's watching Applebloom..\" you say back at Twilight with a snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, you could of at least TOLD ME yourself, instead of some *\"Sorry, I have a previous engagement.\u201d* bullcrap!</i>\" Twilight's voice booms through the phone's speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince from how loud this mare can be \"Look, I'm sorry about that, I didn't want to blow you off..I mean it\" you assure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince this conversation is over a phone, you can't be sure if you know what Twilight is really feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she starts speaking again \"<i> Applejack usually bucks apples after school during the weekdays to 4 PM, during her weekend she starts at 3 PM and ends at 5 PM sharp....which was 3 hours ago..</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, you look up into the sky and see its actually evening, Celestia has set the sun &amp; Luna raised her moon up high, it shining brightly as the stars twinkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace, meaning its 8 PM now..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, you see..it's not just Applebloom, she needed help around the house..so I stayed longer.\" you say with your pride dimming, you can't just tell her that you stayed cause you asked Applejack on a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh..</i>\" is all you hear from the other line. \"<i> So, helping Applejack around her house is more important than helping Rarity out with her dresses shes making for the students of are school's dance..</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You of all people should know Rarity gets overworked with making dresses, she needed you there just so she can have a second opinion without having to doubt herself &amp; tearing herself apart for something she doesn't think is right</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't see that in the message..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Or helping Rainbow Dash with her training for are school's annual track team race..?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash didn't tell you this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i> Rainbow has the whole team putting all their hope in her, so she's been staying at the track for hours &amp; hours to get better..Dash can only have so much confidence you know...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Rainbow didn't say that in her message, besides!

Always..Applejack..it's like you just picked one you liked..and left us all in the rain..!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't tell if this is Twilight Sparkle, the one you've known since childhood, or the stoic smart ass that you've come to live with the past years in Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself become depressed at this, Twilight is right, all you've been hanging out with is Applejack...You rarely ever go to school along with Twilight, go over to Rarity's art class to check out her work, watch Rainbow Dash run on her track field. Go with Pinkie Pie to do her crazy pranks. Talk more with Fluttershy to get her out of her shell..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, even though you've been neglecting Dash,Rarity,Pinkie &amp; Fluttershy. Twilight has been acting odd before you even met them. This might be your only chance to ask her without her giving you the cold shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight...?\" you say softly to her. \"I'm sorry about that..truly...but, ever since I've got to live here in Ponyville, even when we met back in Canterlot. You've treated me like some unwanted nuisance than a friend...\" you tell her. \"Every time I even try to talk to you, you act so snotty, pompous &amp; just giving me the cold shoulder...I just want to know now..why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen their was silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she says something \"<i>....I..don't want to tell you this over the phone...if you really want to know, just...come back home..</i> she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line suddenly ends, the talk lasting for 5 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, closing your phone &amp; putting it in your pocket. This might be the only chance you can get to the bottom of her attitude. But, that means you have to leave AJ during your date now..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

You sigh in disappointment....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie Pie must not be here then..\" you say aloud..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a playful voice from a familar friend says aloud behind you \"I'm not here for what, you silly??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump up &amp; let out a girly scream as you turn around to see Pinkie Pie, the pink-colored &amp; fluffy maned pony that works for the Cakes of Sugarcube corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie stares at you with her signature smile &amp; big blue-eyes, she wears a simple yellow loose shirt with short sleeves. Her legs wear a big striped socks that reach up to her frilly skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smack yourself mentally, you really need to stop checking out your friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush slightly &amp; give a force smile back at Pinkie. \"Hey Pinkie! I was hoping to talk to you..\" you say a bit bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie's face beams with happiness, she bounces up 'n down which make her skirt &amp; shirt show off some of her skin \"REALLY!? GREATCAUSEWEHAVEN'TTALKEDINREALLYLONGTIMESINCEYOULIKEALWAYSHANGAROUNDAPPLEJA CKORRUNNINGAWAYFROMTWILLIGHTANDSTUFFAN-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly cover Pinkie Pie's mouth with your hand, she blinks &amp; tilts her head as she looks at you. You forgot how Pinkie Pie can go on 'n on..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeh..sorry, can we talk inside..?\" you ask her as you move your hand off her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink pony nods \"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks over to the Sugarcube corners front door, lays her head on it, tabs it gently...causing the door to swing open...how did she even open it without turning the knob at least..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on silly!\" she says as she walks inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Its Pinkie Pie..you can't explain Pinkie Pie..&gt; you tell yourself mentally    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then walk into the Sugarcube Corner..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you're here, will you tell Pinkie Pie about the surprise party for both of your friends? or maybe tell her this later &amp; ask how she's been doing and stuff?</span></div></div>",

Since you'll be meeting Fluttershy anyway at the party there\u2019s no point for you to have a guilt trip about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou change your direction &amp; head towards Carousel Boutique, wondering how Rarity is doing with those dresses. Part of you wonder's how Applejack is doing right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeh, probably bucking some apples like always.. you tell yourself, maybe once you done meeting up with everypony, you'll go see Applejack to give her another massage....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut enough about that, TO CAROUSEL BOUTIQUE AWAY!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===================================Carousel Boutique===============================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, you reach Rarity's home &amp; shop. You notice the sign on the entrance says *OPEN* so you might as well just walk inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door, taking a few steps inside Rarity's shop, the place looking rather tidy. Though the tables &amp; floors have tuxedos &amp; dresses scattered all over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not like Rarity to dump her work around the place unless she's really, really overworked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close the door &amp; take careful steps so your shoes don't smear any dirt on the cloths or floor; you look around the boutique to see were your fashion loving friend is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity..?\" you call out, hoping she would answer. No answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over some more dresses, you finally see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beautiful white-coated unicorn with a radiant indigo mane stands on her on her personal stage, mannequins circled around her, wearing her latest designs for Ponyville High\u2019s prom night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're finally able to walk normally since the floor before you ain't covered with her clothes &amp; fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity seems to have not noticed you. She's so into measuring each of mannequins with her designs. \"Almost perfect...just almost\u2026\" you hear her mutter to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lovely mare wears a simple long white dress that covers down to her knees with a beautiful diamond necklace around her neck; no doubt it's one of her own self-made dresses. Simple, but it complements her natural beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up on the stage, right behind her. \"Hey Rarity\" you speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-aah!\" The unicorn squeaks in shock, she quickly turns around &amp; presses her back against the mannequin that she was measuring. Rarity stares at you in surprise. She blinks as she realizes who it is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[*Your Name*] darling?? W-What are you doing here all of a sudden..?\" she says with a little crack in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile &amp; tell her \"Just wanted to see you, that's all...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Rarity's face lights up, her ears perk up as well \"R-really?\" she says. You nod &amp; take a look around the boutique \"Yeah, and help you out with the dresses, like you asked me yesterday.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity seems a bit taken back at that for some reason \"Oh..I see..\" she says tiredly as her ears drop, her mane looks a bit messy, even her designer work glasses can't hide the tired look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel that damn guilt again for not deciding to help Rarity out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity seems to notice the look on your face, she giggle softly &amp; stands up straight. \"It's fine dear, I've manage to make most of them yesterday anyway\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a bit better hearing that, she is one amazing worker... maybe a bit better than Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll help pick up around here.\" you say, Rarity seems fine with that, she nods \"Thank you darling. I just need to spruce up these clothing and I should be free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn those words, she turns around &amp; goes back to doing what she does best. Letting out a tired sigh, you turn around &amp; see all the cloth on the floor of the store. This is gonna take me awhile... you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 23 minutes of grabbing every piece of fabric, cloth and clothing, you feel yourself sweat a bit as you keep bending over. Hell, you can feel you thighs getting a bit sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, Rarity has taken a few glances at your...*ahem* hindquarters with a little blush on her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finally grab the rest &amp; put them on a little neat pile on one of her work tables, you walk back to Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity, I finished up finally...\u201d you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white-colored unicorn turns around with a smile, her horn glows that shimmering azure, using her levitation spell to keep up the sewing of her dress. \"Oh, wonderful! Thank you, darling!\" she squees in delight. Suddenly she grabs your shoulders &amp; pulls you closer; she then plants little kisses on both of your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel the burning shades of red heat on up on your face..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks it was no problem...\u201d you state while averting your eyes in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity giggles at your expression. Suddenly her face turns a bit saddened as if she's thinking about something. She quickly does a heel face turn back towards her mannequin &amp; crosses her arms around her chest as she concentrates back in sewing this one last dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, wondering what's with the sudden feel in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" [*Your Name*]..?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Rarity?\" you reply, wondering what\u2019s on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then asks you a question...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you...\" she trails off, her voice having a little edge in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before you head off, you check the time. It was half past eight, and you were supposed to be back at Sugarcube Corner at quarter to twelve, so you have time to take the fifteen-minute walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way to Sweet Apple Acres, you began thinking about what AJ might say when you ask her to prom. If she's as attracted to you as you are to her, then she'll definitely say yes. Don't forget that she kissed you yesterday, and she's not the type of girl that would string a guy along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, the prom is one of those events where you dress up really nicely, and Applejack was never into those kinds of things, except for that one time she went to the Grand Galloping Gala. If she does say no, you can take Rarity, who's really excited about the dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you think about it, Rarity has been dropping some hints that she may have feelings for you. You recall talking to her about her dreams, and aside from being a famous designer, she wanted to find her \"Prince Charming.\" For some reason, she was looking at you with a weird look on her face. You look through your phone on a hunch and see that the majority of phone calls and text messages you received were from Rarity as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do feel some attraction to her, but it's nowhere near as strong as the feelings you have for Applejack. You begin to wonder if promising to take Rarity to the prom if Applejack said no was a good idea. You didn't want to treat her like she was a backup girl. She didn't seem to mind, but love makes people do crazy things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thought process was interrupted by the realization that you reached AJ's place. That was arguably the shortest fifteen minutes of your life. You knock on the door and look around the farm. Applebloom is usually running around with her friends at this hour. If they weren't here, you most likely would've run into them on your way to the farm. Finally someone answers the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya, Tiger.\" says your cowgirl friend as she sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, AJ.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings ya here this time?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to ask you something,\" you say. \"but before I do, where's Applebloom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack sighs. \"She's been in her bed all day. I haven't the slightest clue what's wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, tell her that I hope she feels better soon.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do.\" she says. \"So what was it you wanted to ask me, hon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" you say. \"I wanted to ask you if you wanted to go to the prom with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack pauses for a moment to think about it, and she says...</span></div></div>",

That's the reason why she doesn't want to go with you..? Part of you understands, Applejack hates getting all pretty with make up or a dress, reason you like her so much is cause of her natural beauty. But another part of you feels offended that she won't go just for your sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you just sigh in defeat \"It's alright Applejack...\" you state in defeat, so your original idea is shot down the tube. Suddenly the image of Rarity in one of her fine dresses dances in your head, you feel your lips turn into a little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack pulls her hat down to block the sun's gaze from hitting her eyes, she looks at you sadly &amp; pats your shoulders \"Ah'y am sorry about this Tiger, hope ah'y didn't ruin ya day now..\" she says as she rubs your shoulder lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little smile form on your lips, you look into her eyes &amp; shake your head \"Na, it's alright AJ. It was just in the moment..I wasn't even really planning on going to prom..heh..\" you tell her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotal lie on your part, you really wanted to go to prom with your special somepony, that's another reason why you helped Applejack out, too confess &amp; ask her out..though, Twilight DID kinda ruined that for you when she called..but you leave that in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack tilts her head back slightly, her eyebrow raised as she judge whether you mean what you said or not. The cowgirl grins &amp; playfully smacks your shoulder..ow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw shucks you little devil, ya don't need some silly dance to say this...\" Applejack says in slur like voice, suddenly she grabs both of your shoulders &amp; pulls you for a deep passionate kiss. Your body tenses up &amp; feel your emotions get bewildered at the start, but as the kiss progresses, you feel yourself get putty in her strong grip &amp; forceful lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack decides to break it to your disappointment , her lips pull back from your with a loud *smack*. The cowgirl looks into your dazed eyes with a little grin on her freckled face, her strong arms releases your shoulders &amp; she taps her index finger  on your nose \"Ya don't need anything fancy~ just love 'n care\" said Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes derp a bit from such a breath-taking kiss, she must of had practice. No one could be this good without practice. You shake your head &amp; nod with a little grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ smirks coyly, she turns around &amp; walks back into her home, her butt shaking gently as her tail sways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyes end up glued to her rump...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack turns her back to look at you, noticing where your eyes are staring at. The smirk on her face still there, she makes a gesture with her finger to come inside.  \"Come on Tiger, might as well give ya a nice drink or something\" AJ says, her voice still dripping with seduction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly look away from her butt &amp; scrunch your mouth, you prepare to take a step inside till something in your mind, well...reminds you of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh crap, Rarity!</i> you remember, now since AJ shot you down, you should tell her soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel like maybe now would be the best time, you nervously grin at Applejack <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh..that's all right AJ, I kinda need to-\" your sentence gets cut short as AJ speaks back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! What 'eve ya doing ya should at least rest for a bit.\" Applejack retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're about to tell her you really need to be some were, AJ comes over to you &amp; pretty much grabs you inside with ease even with you struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack pulls you inside the house &amp; tosses you on the couch you two spend your movie night together. You let out a little yelp before your face collides with the cushions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ lets out a little giggle, \"Ehehe~ Alright now settle down sally, I'll go get ya something t'a drink...\" Applejack says as she leaves to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she leaves, you pull your face from the cushions &amp; rub your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Luna, she's so forceful...\" you say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot feeling like sitting down, you stand up and start to walk around, thinking about the idea of really taking Rarity to the prom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes as you walk around the coffee table, envisioning the idea of being with Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She would be a in one of her beautiful dresses, walking down stairs from her house to meet you, you'd be in one of her fancy tuxedos. You would take her hand &amp; lead her to a fancy carriage outside, arrive in style in front of the school. Dance in the ballroom, win the cutest couples contest..and seal it all with a ki-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*ahem* Didn't ah tell ya to relax Tiger...?\" the sounds of your cowgirl beauty interrupt your little fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jolt up &amp; turn to look at Applejack, her face showing a bit of annoyance.  She puts down a tray that has some apple juice (go figure), some sliced apples (again..go figure) &amp; a sandwich on the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch the back of your head \"Uhh..sorry, I'm fine really..\" you tell her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack just huffs &amp; closes her eyes, she lets herself slump on the couch. Sweat flowing down her head &amp; body profusely, she tends to work her butt off every morning with some running &amp; exercises to limber herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah what'evea...\" Applejack mutters in a tired tone. She lays her head against the couch's arm rest, her hooves being held up by the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Applejack's body, seeing the sweat drip down her face, stomach &amp; legs sort of makes you feel aroused. You clench your legs with grit teeth, really not wanting any sort of wood right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack gives another tired sigh, she arches her body forward &amp; stretches. Giving you a good view of what makes her so damn sexy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm~! Since ya not so tired, would ya mind giving ya southern beaut another one of ya masterful massages..? \" AJ says, crossing her hooves together \"Ah could really use one..\" she says with that seductive voice again..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You still had three hours before you had to be back at Pinkie Pie\u2019s, but you tend to lose track of time when you\u2019re with AJ. You\u2019d have to set an alarm on your phone for eleven \u2013thirty just in case you lose track again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Applejack,\u201d you say. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a massage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks a plenty, sugarcube!\u201d she says as she lies on her stomach on the couch. \u201cI was wonderin\u2019 if you\u2019d work on my back this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat as you hear this. Massaging AJ\u2019s hooves was one thing, but her back? Needless to say, this makes you nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t be nervous, now,\u201d she says. \u201cI won\u2019t bite ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a breath and walk towards the southern beauty lying on the couch and get to work on that massage, trying your hardest not to get aroused. It didn\u2019t help that Applejack would let out a sigh of relaxation every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDead puppies, monster trucks, the smell of an old person\u2019s house\u2026\u201d you think as you try to distract yourself from how hot this was. The last thing you want is for AJ to get the wrong idea. Finally, after several minutes, her phone gets a text, and you have a good idea of who it\u2019s from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, lookie here,\u201d she says. \u201cPinkie Pie invited me and the other ponies to a party at noon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, your phone gets a text from Pinkie as well. You read it and it says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust sent the txt 2 the girls. Can\u2019t w8 4 the party! :)<br>\r\n                                                                                                               -Pinkie\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got an invite, too.\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that gives me somethin\u2019 to do today.\u201d says Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back to work on that massage, and eventually AJ is feeling much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! That was amazin\u2019, hon!\u201d she says, stretching her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you liked it.\u201d you say. \u201cWell, I\u2019d better get going.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty, then. See ya at the party.\u201d she says. \u201cOh, and sorry again fer turnin\u2019 down your offer for the prom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack gets up and walks towards you. \u201cYou\u2019re too sweet, ya know that?\u201d she says. She then hugs you tightly, the feeling of her chest on yours putting a smile on your face. AJ then kisses you on the cheek saying something you were not expecting to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you.\u201d she says with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this was surprising to say the least. It was also really bittersweet. On one hand, Applejack just said she loved you. On the other hand, now you\u2019re gonna feel really guilty when you take Rarity to the prom. You couldn\u2019t think of any other response except\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly leave Sweet Apple Acres and check the clock. It was eleven fifteen. You have plenty of time to make a quick stop at Rarity\u2019s and tell her that you\u2019re taking her to prom, but it wouldn\u2019t kill you to help Pinkie Pie finish setting up for the party and just call Rarity. Then again, she may prefer to be told in person\u2026</span></div></div>",

Your legs start making you walk all the way back to Carousel Boutique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but hear those words over and over inside your mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I love you..said Applejack</i> You feel your eyes get droopy as you keep hearing her sweet accent say those words. You sigh &amp; slide your hands in your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack drop the Love card so soon, you weren't expecting to hear that from her till maybe about a month or a year of your relationship. Though, you two were best friends before you confessed your feeling's to the apple farmer. You still remember the day you both met, going to your first week of high school. Your eyes close as you take yourself back....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ====================================<br>\r\n<i>Things were rough back then, Twilight wouldn't talk to you, you haven't met the rest of the girls &amp; the topper, you are the only human in Ponyville High School...scratch that, Ponyville in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst day was awful..once you got to your first class, Miss Cheerilee made you stand up in front of everypony to introduce you..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt so awkward, standing there, while your teacher pretty much tells the class about you...or more like what you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes of everypony staring at you like if you were some freak show, maybe to them, since they've never seen a human in person before. Some eyes filled with curiosity , some filled with wonder, but most filled with disgust. When Miss Cheerliee told the class to you ask you about yourself, most the question felt more like insults..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy is your mane so short?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere's your tail..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs your muzzle broken..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you have a cutie mark?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou some sort of monkey?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never had these kinda question back in Baltimare..but back there humans are more common, this felt really odd for you. You end up answering about not having a tail by saying you're born without one, you face is naturally shaped this way, you don't get marks on your butt &amp; your human ancestry are from apes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curious or disgusted eyes of the pony's stayed looking at you even after all the question...even when Miss Cheerliee finally let you take a seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wouldn't have been so bad.....if it didn't <b>happen over &amp; over in all your classes</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, all your classes were about, telling the students what you are, letting them ask the same questions, answer them no different. You never felt such relief of going back home after a day of school. Just closing yourself in your room ,ignore Twilight's cold queen attitude, play around with Spike &amp; playing your games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past first week was dealing with bullies using you for a way to stroke their ego's, being ridiculed from the popular kids &amp; dealing with your personal loneliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the second week started, and on Monday things changed for the better.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, you walk to your locker after dealing with your daily dose of getting picked-on. As you open it up, you hear the sounds of hoof-steps walking closer to you. You clench your teeth in anger, thinking its one of those Luna-damn jocks that force you to do their homework, not today dammit!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to turn around to shout, your body stops as you hear the voice of a mare with a southern accent..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Howdy partner..\" said the orange-colored mare wearing a cowboy hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at this mare, you remember seeing her in your fourth period class in math. You wonder what she would want with you. You close your locker after getting your books from it. \"Who are you..?\" you ask reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowgirl mare smile &amp; holds out her hand \"I'm Applejack, please to meet ya partner!\" the mare now known as Applejack says with enthusiasm. Your eyes narrow slightly, wondering what's her deal..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack takes notice of the look in your eyes, she blinks and moves her hand back \"What..? Ya don't do handshakes where you're from sally..?\" she says with a bit of sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she says her words end up pulling your stressed nerves, you slam shut your locker, not giving much of a damn if its locked or not. \"Look, if you're here to give me more shit then, say it already.\" you tell her off, having had enough of being everypony's butt monkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack seems taken back at your retort, she glares harshly at you as you ready up to leave \"Now hold on their buckaroo, ah ain't here to mess with ya like those other jerks..\" said Applejack, you can tell she's trying not to sound a bit peeved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoff at that &amp; saddle up your backpack \"Sure...\" you say with some sarcasm as well \"What do you want then..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack's expression changes to slight embarrassment, she gives a nervous chuckle \"Well...Ah was hoping you'd...\" she mutters as she lose trail of her last words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to look at Applejack with a curious look on your face \"Hoping you'd what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd want to be friends..\" she says shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour look at this mare in surprise, she wants to be friends...with you? Part of you would welcome this, but what if she wants something from you and is just using you to take it? Or she's gonna do some sort of prank on you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks..\" you say bitterly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowgirl seems shocked at that reply \"No..? Why not?!\" she retorts, sounding offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore answering her &amp; start walking over to the exit. You'd had enough of this BS, no-one,nopony would just go up to someone and say *Hi! wanna be friends?* especially when you're considered the freak of this school. As you reach the exit, you hear the cowgirls voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah guess she was wrong about ya\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh..??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn away from the exit, looking back at AJ standing with her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah friend of mine said ya were a shy little fellow hiding in you're own shell, that ya needed a friend..\" AJ tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your teeth clench at her words, she might be right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack walks over to you slowly \"Look sugarcube..\" sugarcube..? Did she just call you a cube made of sugar..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah know its rough, coming over from a far away place, we all have it rough on the first day of a new school, especially when ya different than the rest...but its much easier with friends.\" Applejack tells you, looking at your face to read your emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your lips twitch, trying to say something back at her, whether it's a witty remark or just a insult. You can't seem to say anything though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack's emerald eyes read you like a book, she smiles &amp; lightly hits your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince &amp; rub the spot she hit \"Ow..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ giggles \"Sorry sugarcube...\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your shoulder &amp; roll your eyes, at least it was just a light punch. You sigh, realizing being a loner won't do you any good. You need a friend more than ever. Besides...something about this mare makes you feel like you can trust her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out your hand to the cowgirl. She blinks then looks at you a bit astonish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a little smile \"Pleasure to meet you Applejack..\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ's hand grips your tight &amp; shakes yours roughly, damn she has a strong grip..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure's mind sugarcube!\" your friend AJ says with a happy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a weak chuckle as you pull back your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehe...so umm..I was wondering..\" said Applejack, her voice trailing off key. You tilt your head slightly, wondering what she's gonna ask. The southern cowgirl scratches the back of her head as she ask \"...Ya think you could help me out with my math..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes, figures. But a smile forms on your lips \"Sure, your place or mine?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ blinks, looking surprised. \"Ahh..Ah think my place would be good, Big Mac wouldn't like if ah I left to some stranger's home...besides, I think you should meet my sister, she loves meeting new people!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckles &amp; nod at her eagerness \"Sounds good, let's go then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute sugarcube, ya didn't give me ya name\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right...my name is....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ====================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour flashback gets interrupted as you face-plant against a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww! Mother...!!!\" you shout as you pull back &amp; rub your nose, you blink as you see that you face planted on the front door of Carousel Boutique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, longest fifteen minutes of my life...</i> you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this past time you've been thinking about the past, when really you should be thinking about now. How would this effect Applejack is she finds out about you taking Rarity? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach for the door knob, a cold feeling goes down your spine as you think that maybe..you don't really love Applejack..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head at that revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door of Rarity's shop, you call out to her \"Rarity..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot hearing any responses, you walk inside the store. It still as clean as you left it, you do remember Rarity was gonna rest after you left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk towards her fashion stage, you see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If they really love you, they'd understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a good idea.\" you say. \"Thanks, Auntie Celeste.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime, dear.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Celestia's routine calls were starting to get annoying, they finally come in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you arrive at Pinke's house and help her finish setting up, the other ponies soon arrive to the party. Once everyone was present, you get all of their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, girls.\" you say. \"I know that I haven't been spending that much time with some of you lately, so I had Pinkie get this party together so I can make it up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get this party STARTED!\" chimes Pinkie Pie as she turns on the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party was great. You got to catch up with Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy, and you didn't feel afraid to approach Twilight anymore. About an hour into the party, you pull AJ and Rarity aside to talk to them. At least, you were <i>going</i> to, but someone asks you to dance. Who asks you?</span></div></div>",

The silky, warm touch gives you good idea on who it is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head to see who if it is who you think it is. Yep, like you thought. Rarity, the beautiful violet-maned unicorn looks at you with a smile &amp; a hopeful look in her azure eyes as she grasps your hands gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity? Hey\" you say as you turn to face her, this is good, now all you need to do is get Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity blushes slightly &amp; glances back at where Pinkie Pie and Twilight are showing off their crazy dance moves. \"Hello [*Your name*]...\" said Rarity in a soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you feels she's hurting..you grimaces, knowing its because you didn't say return the words she said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity lets go of your arm, you can tell by her body language, the fiddling of her fingers, the little tap of her hooves kicking the floor, the little blush on her muzzle. You know she wants to ask you something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is little miss Rarity feeling jumpy again?\" you say to tease her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity opens her mouth to say something, but shuts it &amp; pouts with her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle, finding a pouty Rarity a cute one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph..I just wanted to ask..if you'd..do the honors of dancing with me..\" said Rarity, her expression shows a fear of rejection again. You smile, you can at least give her this without a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do a little bow of respect to Lady Rarity. \"Of course Milady..\" you tell her as would a gentlemen would say. Rarity's eyes flutter, a big smile arouses from her lips. She returns your gesture with a little courtesy, the mare's still wearing that sexy looking red-velvet top with those tight skinny jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you [*Your Name..*]\" Rarity says with a little hitch in her tone. The hip-hop dance song ends, the next song changes into something more slow. Suddenly, Sugarcube gets a bit dark, a disco ball pops out from the ceiling where the fan was. The room illuminates with shinning little lights sparkling around the whole room as the disco ball spins, you cover your face as it spins and hits some of the glare into your eyes. Rarity does the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie suddenly appears right behind you &amp; Rarity, too both of your surprise. \"Waaa!! Pinkie! Whats is the meaning of this!\" Rarity says the bubbly Pinkie Pie. As you were gonna ask the same thing, Pinkie Pie quickly says \"Youcanboththankmelater!\" then pushes You &amp; Rarity into the center of the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both stumble back on your feet &amp; try to understand what the heck has happened. You quickly notice the pairs of eyes staring at you &amp; Rarity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight Sparkle, Fluttershy,Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie &amp; Applejack are all looking at both of you curiously. You catch a glance at Applejack, the look on her face shows some sort of confusion than curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity's hand grips against yours to get your attention. You look at Rarity with a weak grin \"I wasn't..you know expecting this..\" you tell her truthfully. Rarity smiles sadly. \"You don't have to darling if you-\" you quickly silence her by taking her hand &amp; kissing it, causing Rarity to blush with a look of astonishment. \"May I have this dance..?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn mare looks up into your eyes, you can see them shimmer with...the same look that she had last time. She nods her head fast &amp; quickly, not evening saying any words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at her reaction, you pull her closer to you. Her body pressing against yours, holding her right arm up while your left hand rest against the beautiful mare's waist. Taking a deep breath, you both look into each others eyes and begin to slow dance along with the romantic melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt amazing to say the least, every step you took with Rarity, every breath you felt from her as you both mimicked each other movement, to when you both press your foreheads together as you both look into each others eyes. Its felt magical, felt like nopony was there, only the spotlight that shined on you &amp; Rarity. Just the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music finally ends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou &amp; Rarity stop, your eyes looking deep into each other. The heat of the moment hasn't died out in you, your face leans in closer to Rarity's. The Fashion mare seem's not mind as she twist her head, readying to except your kiss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..It's cut short by the sounds of clapping &amp; stamping of hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen and you pull back to look around the room to Rarity's disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Fluttershy slowly clapping her hands with a smile while Rainbow Dash gives a wolf whistle &amp; stamps on her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight seem's to take everything she saw as a lesson, since she's writing something down in her portable notebook. Pinkie Pie's being Pinkie Pie by hoping up 'n down while clapping like a giddy school filly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one who you don't see clapping is..Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowgirl mare stares at you with a hard to read expression, you feel yourself freeze up from that look. Oh no, she didn't take this the wrong way did she..??!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Applejack..</span></div></div>",

You collapse on to Applejack, catching the look on her face of pure shock as you both crash onto her bed.

The look of pure arousal...her lips partly open as she breath roughly, her eyes half-closed as she looks at you..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight alone makes you feel tight in your pants, you feel Mister Slithers press against the tip of your pants...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLust builds up in you, making so hard to think clearly &amp; the cider alone was effecting your motor skills. The lust in your head screams for you to dive in &amp; kiss her, feel her,taste her...<b>Fuck</b> her..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what about...?</span></div></div>",

With little effort, you make Applejack cum. Her cinnamon taste fills your mouth as she squirts in orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping your mouth, you re-position yourself between her legs. You and AJ stare at each with lust-filled eyes as your hard shaft just barely touches her wet pussy. \"I don't have anythin to saddle you up with, sugar,\" she says, \"so be careful not to go squirtin your juice inside me. By the size of your boys, I reckon you're pretty productive~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in response and slowly push your hard dick into her pussy.

Cum all over my breasts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ's words come a bit too late as you hilt yourself in her pussy, your orgasm seconds away. She tries on last time to tell you to pull out, but her words turn into a long moan when you cum. The head of your cock flares against her pussy before a big load bursts from your dick. Hot, thick cum gushes straight into Applejack's womb. The sensation of such heat suddenly bursting deep inside her makes the mare beneath you cum again in another squirting orgasm. You groan loudly, your thick cum gushing into her womb from your throbbing dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ writhes in pleasure beneath you, her head tilted back and her eyes shut as your cock pumps thick spunk into her.

Although this thought overpowered all others as the only logical one (others included alien replacement and a succubus taking her form) you obviously couldn't accept it because that would mean that Aunt Celeste had feelings for you (can you get the mares or what?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear are you alright?

On top of the fact that Applejack and Rarity liked you, now you had to deal with the possibility that Auntie Celeste might like you, and you couldn't even go to anypony for advice as she was the one you went to for advice. You felt the room start to darken as your body started to sway, everything going black as you fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke in your bed to the sound of voices, from what you could tell it was Twilight and Aunt Celeste, \"I-I don't know what happened, I just went to go make dinner and then I heard this loud sound and I rushed in to find him passed out\" you slowly opened your eyes to see Aunt Celeste talking to Twilight, \"don't worry Princess, my magic tells me there's nothing wrong with him he just fainted, although I can't figure out why\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to speak but your throat was dry and all you ended up doing was coughing \"he's awake aunt Celeste cried and as Twilight ran off, you assume to go and get you a glass of water, Aunt Celeste wrapped you up in a tight hug, \"what happened?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nothing, I just was so happy that you were staying with me that I fainted: you say pulling out the worst line ever, surprisingly Aunt Celeste seems to buy the line, a large smile spreading over her face, she steps back as Twilight enters carrying a glass of water and hands it to you. Aunt Celeste smiles and speaks as she stands up \"well I still have dinner to make, you seem well enough and Twilight will get me if anything's wrong, dinner will be in about 30 minutes.\" The door to your room shutting behind her as she leaves, Twilight just sat there staring at you \"so what were you thinking about so hard?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My magic said that there was nothing wrong with you, but you were thinking about something so hard that you overloaded yourself, what were you thinking about?\" she asks. This could be a blessing in disguise, although you and Twilight hadn't exactly been on the best terms for a while, she was still your friend right? Although that exact same reasoning made her the worst possible candidate, plus Twilight was kind of paranoid, for all you knew she might take your theory as you trying to get between her and Aunt Celeste.</span></div></div>",

Don't worry.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn smiles and leaves the room. Over the next several minutes, you think about who you should turn to about this whole issue with Auntie Celeste. You wanted to tell somepony who would take you seriously, so Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie are definitely not on your list of candidates. Then you think that maybe you should tell someone that's close to Auntie Celeste (other than Twilight, of course), and the only pony that comes to mind is Princess Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Luna didn't talk much. In fact, the last time you even saw her was this past summer, when you went to Canterlot for a few weeks, and that was almost ten months ago. She was well acquainted with your parents, though, so maybe she'll be willing to help you out. The only problem is this: how are you gonna get in touch with her? You walk downstairs as you wonder how you could get in contact with Luna when, as luck would have it, you see Auntie Celeste on the phone talking with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna, you'll do just fine on your own,\" she says. \"It's only for a couple of months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. Now or never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auntie Celeste, is that Princess Luna on the other line?\" you ask, as if you didn't already know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is,\" she says. \"Would you like to speak with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please,\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" she says. She turns her attention back to her sister. \"Hold on, Luna. [Your name] wants to speak with you.\" Auntie Celeste hands you her phone and you speak into the receiver, turning around to go up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Princess Luna,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, [your name],\" she says. \"We haven't spoken in a very long time. How goes everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait until you're in your room to answer. \"Pretty good, but I actually wanted to talk to you about something important,\" you say as you close the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she asks. \"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about your sister,\" you say quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" she says after a long pause. \"What is the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, \"Well, I think started a while back when I told her that I liked somepony.\" You said \"somepony\" because you didn't want Luna to know that you liked two ponies. \"Now, she's telling me that she's going to be living with me in this house. Not only that, but she sets a strict curfew for me, and she tells me that I can't have any girls over, knowing that most of my friends are girls. Not only that, but she even wants to sleep in the same bed as me. I think that Aut- I mean Celestia is a little... jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there and wait for Luna to tell you how ridiculous that sounds. Instead, she sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a feeling something was amiss about Celestia lately,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should be up front with her and talk to her about it,\" she says. \"While there is the possibility that she'll just dance around the issue and avoid giving you any straight answers, it's still worth a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Princess Luna,\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just 'Luna' is fine,\" she says. \"Let me know how it all works out, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you say. You then hear somepony in the background speaking to Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go. Tell Celestia I'll call her back, alright?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you say, and the line goes dead.

You then think about what to do later on. It all may have been avoided if you haven't said anything to Applejack, but where would that leave you with Rarity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're thinking too hard. Right now, you have to finish dinner and see what to do for tomorrow, especially since its school.</span></div></div>",

With prom night only four days away, you're in a really excited mood. You meet Twilight in the main hall of the school, and start talking about prom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who's taking you to prom?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I tell you who my date is if you won't tell me who your date is?\" she asks back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch\u00e9,\" you say, \"unless you don't really have a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do so have a date!\" says Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right,\" you say nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do so! He's the colt that sits behind you in Chemistry class!\" Twilight yells, only to cover her mouth after realizing that she just told you who her date was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha,\" you say, as you walk off to your first class, leaving Twilight fuming mad. You missed messing with her like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day goes by smoothly, until you get to your last class of the day: math. You and Applejack sat next to each other in that class, and today, the teacher was asking all the students questions as a way to review for the upcoming test. When he finally gets to Applejack, you see her face freeze. She looks at you, as if she were pleading for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Miss Applejack?\" says the teacher. \"What does x equal in this equation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ sits there, totally confused and racking her brain. \"Umm... ah... it's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a last resort, you lightly tap AJ's hoof three times with your foot. Taking your hint she says \"Three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, Miss Applejack,\" the teacher says. \"Hopefully you can answer the questions on the test <i>without</i> any outside help.\" He says those last few words looking at you. Before another question was asked, the bell rings, and everypony stampedes out of the classroom, you and Applejack being the last to leave. \"Don't forget to do your homework!\" he says as everypony leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowpony sighs in frustration. \"Ah am mighty screwed when that test comes up, and it's this Thursday!\" she says. She hangs her head down, thinking of the bad grade she'll get, but suddenly she looks up at you with hope in her eyes. \"Say, tiger,\" she says. \"Ya don't suppose that ah can stop by yer house an' you can help me with mah homework, do ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there for a second, mulling it over. While you did settle things with Celestia, you still aren't sure if she's completely okay with you having girls over. You'll just have to test it out today. \"Sure,\" you tell AJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walk from school all the way to your house, and you open the door, telling Applejack to wait outside for a second. Inside, you see Celestia sitting on the couch, dressed in a normal t shirt and jeans. This was the first time you saw your aunt in such casual wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, [your name],\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Auntie Celeste,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was school?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" you say nervously, \"and I... brought a friend home with me...\" You then open the door, letting Applejack in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy, princess!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Celestia react to this?</span></div></div>",

You try not to refer to Celestia as your aunt (ESPECIALLY in front of Twilight, knowing how jealous she gets), but you were talking to her in person, so if you referred to her by her real name, she'd then correct you and Applejack would've been giggling harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go upstairs, Applejack,\" says Celestia. \"I want to talk to [your name] for a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ nods her head and goes upstairs to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" says Celestia, \"You're studying with Applejack for that big test tomorrow, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't end up making out with her afterwards like the last time she was here,\" she says somewhat sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze and look at her in shock. \"How did you know that we made out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't,\" she said. \"You just told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush with embarrassment. You walked right into that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously though,\" she says. \"I know it's hard to control yourself, but try not to do that. I sleep in that bed, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Auntie,\" you say, and you trudge up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter studying with Applejack for a good two hours, she feels fully confident that she was going to ace that test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yee-haw!

Applejack doesn't seem to mind. To her, the sooner this test is overwith, the better. After the test, you and AJ meet outside the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That test was so easy!\" says the cowpony. \"Ah wonder if Mr. Calc will have it graded by the end of today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he is pretty quick with grading tests, and the test was multiple choice, so there is a good chance that he will,\" you say. Your assumption proves to be correct, as Mr Calc was able to give everyone their tests back at the end of the day. Unfortunately, AJ's mood takes a turn for the worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah can't believe it!\" she says. \"Ah got a 49! Ah was so sure I got an A.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look at AJ's paper. \"You did get an A, Applejack,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last time ah checked, a 49 was an F,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look again,\" you say. \"You didn't get 49 percent, you got 49 out of 50 questions correct. That's 98 percent, AJ! You aced it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?\" she says in disbelief. She pulls you into a tight bar hug, practically squeezing the breath out of you, then she lets you go. \"Thanks a plenty, sugarcube!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime,\" you say.

This was your first formal event in years, so you don't exactly keep track of ties. You only had fifteen minutes to be at the Carousel Boutique to pick up Rarity, and here you are looking for a stupid tie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for something?\" asks Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just searching for a tie, Auntie Celeste,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why didn't you say so?\" she says. Her horn begins to glow, and a brand new tie appears out of thin air. \"See, you had nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Auntie,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, sweetheart,\" she says. \"So, the carriage I ordered for you just pulled up outside, so you can go whenever you're ready. Have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" you say. You give Celestia a hug after she helps you with your tie, and you set off for Rarity's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the Carousel Boutique, Rarity finishes getting ready for you to pick her up. She sprays some perfume in her mane and waits by her bedroom window for you to arrive. She sees a royal carriage pull up in front of the boutique, and she's confused at first, but then she realizes that you had gotten a carriage to ferry you to and from the prom. The unicorn giddily rushes down the stairs, reaching the door just in time for you to knock on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your name], darling!\" she says. \"You're looking very handsome this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you say, \"and you're looking really beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop!\" she says with a blush. \"You're embarrassing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" you say. \"Well, your carriage awaits, princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you two get into the carriage, you start to chat with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, [your name],\" asks Rarity. \"How many times have you kissed Applejack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, you lost count, so you just make up a number. \"Four, why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I plan on evening the score before the night's over,\" she says with a wink.</span></div></div>",

You're glad that Rarity wanted you to pick her up an hour before the prom started, because there were other ponies that had the idea of taking carriages to the prom. When you finally get inside, you see everypony dancing to the upbeat music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they even got DJ Pon-3 to show up,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very impressive,\" says Rarity. \"The planning committee has outdone themselves this time around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, four ponies come rushing towards you and Rarity, startling the two of you. Then again, you should have expected Twilight, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you were taking RARITY to prom?!\" says Twilight, with a look of shock on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no idea you two were together...\" says Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You owe me twenty bits, Rainbow!\" says Pinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna-dammit...\" Rainbow Dash says under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, girls,\" says Rarity. \"[Your name] only took me here as a favor to me. I din't have a date, and I didn't want to go alone, so I asked him to take me. We're only here as friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out an inner sigh of relief. This saves you the trouble of having to come up with an excuse yourself. Leave it to Rarity to think ahead. You and your \"date\" hit the dance floor and dance for a good hour and a half. You eventually get a little tired, and ask Rarity if she wants anything to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, darling,\" she says. \"Some punch would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the refreshments table and ask for two cups of punch. When you get your drinks and walk over to where Rarity was waiting for you, you see Twilight dancing with the colt she had mentioned when you tricked her into telling who she was going. You chuckle to yourself at how badly Twilight is dancing. Her date didn't seem to mind, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to where Rarity was waiting for you, and hand her a cup of punch. \"Thank you ever so much, sweetie,\" she says. After shifting her eyes around to make sure nopony was watching she sneaks in a quick kiss on your lips. \"That makes two kisses before I'm caught up with Applejack,\" she says, more to herself than to you. You decide to let her have her fun, since you weren't even sure how many times you've actually kissed AJ. After relaxing for a while, a song comes on that makes Rarity squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Celestia!\" she says. \"I LOVE this song!\" The unicorn practically yanks you onto the dance floor and you both dance to the song. Once it ends, though, something happens that nopony at the dance was expecting, especially you and Rarity.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All of a sudden, the room brightens up. You had to squint your eyes because of how sudden it was. When you get yourself together, though, you see that it's not the whole room that was lit, but just the immediate area around you and Rarity. The music slows down, and while you could barely see the ponies that weren't in the spotlight, you could feel their gazes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't... what I think it is, is it?\" asks Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not,\" you say quietly. \"I don't feel comfortable dancing with everypony watching us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at DJ Pon-3 and she lifts her shades and winks at you, as if she had planned for this to happen. How could she know that you and Rarity were here together? Does she have some kind of sixth sense? Nah, this was all by chance. You're over thinking things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't just stand there!\" yells somepony in the crowd. You could tell that it was Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'll just have to suck it up,\"</i> you think. You take Rarity's hands and dance with her to the slow music that was playing. You soon began to disregard the ponies that were watching you, and dance with your date as if the entire gymnasium was empty save for you two. When the song finally ends, everypony claps their hands, cheers, and stomps their hooves. You shyly stand there with Rarity, taking in all the praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that little slow dance, you and Rarity find a seat on the bleachers to the side of the gymnasium. Rarity's been pretty quiet for the past few minutes, and it starts to worry you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Rarity?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about me, darling,\" she says, her voice breaking. \"I'm just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn looks up at you. Tears are running down her face, but she has a smile on her face. \"This is the best night I've ever had,\" she says. \"I'm so glad you could take me here, [your name].\" She then wraps you in a warm hug, burying her head in her shoulder. \"Do you mind if we leave early, sweetie?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've only been here an hour,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's eleven fifteen,\" she says. \"We're only leaving forty five minutes early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your watch and realize how much time has flown by. \"All right then, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reach the Carousel Boutique, you tell the carriage drivers that they can go home, since you intend on walking home. They happily oblige and leave you and Rarity alone on her doorstep. Once you head inside, you give a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the sigh?\" asks Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just relieved that nothing went wrong,\" you say. \"All that's left is to say goodnight,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to Rarity and drape your arms over her. She wraps her arms around your waist in response. You both lean your heads in closer until your lips meet and lock for a good fifteen seconds. After the kiss breaks, Rarity giggles to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more kiss, and I'm tied with Applejack,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still hung up on that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it.\" she says. \"So....\"</span></div></div>",

When you both reach her room, you both take a seat on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why did you want us to come up to your room?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wanted to tell you something that a little... hard to say...\" says Rarity. \"You know how prom night is a really big night for teenagers right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... you know what a lot of teenagers do after the prom, right?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head again, only slower this time. \"Yeah, sex,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn starts to panic. \"Yes, but it's not like I... Well, it's just... I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Rarity,\" you say. \"Just say what you want to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity takes a deep breath. \"What I'm saying is that... I'm not quite ready for sex yet, but I was hoping if you could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity's face turns red as a beet. She's too embarrassed to say it, so she decides to tell you what she wants in a different way. She spreads two of her fingers, brings them to her mouth, and licks in between the two fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen in realization. \"Oh,\" you say. \"So <b>that's</b> what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to if you don't want to,\" she says. \"I just felt like taking a chance and asking you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle. It was cute how shy Rarity was acting over this. \"All you had to do was ask,\" you say. \"There was no need to be so nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you'll do it?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promised myself that I'd make this the best night ever for you, and that includes after the prom,\" you say. \"Truth be told, I'm not ready for real sex either, but I'm totally okay with giving you oral.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhh!\" Rarity says with disgust. \"Don't say it like that! It sounds so... disgusting when you say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, could you turn around,\" she asks. \"I need to undress.\" You nod your head, stand up, and turn to face the other direction. You hear the sound of shuffling clothes, and eventually hear the dress plopping on the ground. \"Okay,\" she says, \"You can turn around now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to see Rarity in nothing but her underwear, which was colored black to contrast with her white coat. All you could to was stand there like an idiot as you take in her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gorgeous,\" you answer, and the unicorn blushes. She sits on the edge of the bed, then lies flat on her back. You walk up to her and get on your knees in front of her. You spread Rarity's legs and slowly pull down her panties. As you were doing this, you feel her legs shaking with nervousness and anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it makes you feel any better, I'm just as nervous as you are right now,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems to calm Rarity down, as her legs stop shaking and she lets out a sigh. You then get to work on Rarity, and she lets out a small yelp when you start, but then she relaxes. As you continue, you begin to elicit moans from the unicorn. Her moans become louder, and her hands fiercely grip the bed sheets as her legs move erratically. She then wraps her legs around you, preventing you from stopping until she was satisfied (not like you wanted to, though). Rarity's moans continue to increase in volume, until finally, she lets out one final, climactic moan, her legs tightening their grip on you for several seconds, then going limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up to see Rarity sprawled out on her bed, panting with exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, darling,\" she says. \"That was just heavenly! It's a good thing my parents and Sweetie Belle aren't home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure, princess,\" you say, and she blushes at you calling her that. \"We're still on for tomorrow, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she says. She then hands you a towel and some breath spray. \"Here. It's best if you don't make Celestia suspicious when you get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you say as you wipe your face and take a few spritzes of breath spray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing,\" says Rarity. She gets up and gives you a quick kiss on the lips. \"Now I'm tied with AJ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes, say your goodbyes, and head back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get inside, you see Celestia asleep on the couch in the living room. You decide not to wake her up just yet and go upstairs to take a shower and get ready for bed. When you finally get your sleepwear on, Celestia opens the bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're home,\" she says. \"How was the dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing,\" you say, \"but a little exhausting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuntie Celeste giggles as you both get into the bed and drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Once your vision clears up, you see that you're in a different room, one that you've never been in before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Where the hell am I?\"</i> you think. You look to your left and see a lump in the sheets, which means that wherever you are, Celestia is here with you. Could this mean the she took you here? You're about to get your answer as the sheets rustle. Celestia takes the covers off and- wait, that isn't Celestia. That's... that's Rarity! Somehow you ended up in a bed with Rarity, only she looks... different. She seems to have aged a couple years, and her mane is a little longer. You also notice that she was wearing a white negligee with black underwear underneath. You blush a deep red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sweetheart,\" she says. \"Did you have a good rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so,\" you say, and your eyes widen at the words you said, or rather, <b>how</b> you said those words. Your voice has gotten deeper. It wasn't by much, but it was still noticeably deeper than last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem a little... off this morning, darling,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he is!\" says a voice behind you. It sounded very familiar. All of a sudden, a pair of arms wrap around you from behind and you feel an ample bust press against your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After what we did last night, it's no wonder why poor [your name]'s feelin' out of it,\" the mare says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who were ya expectin'?\" she says as she turns you around. You get a good look at her and see that she looks a few years older, too. Her mane has gotten longer as well, longer than how much Rarity's has grown. You see that she was in her underwear, too. Just what did the three of you do last night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your forehead for a second. \"What day is it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the calendar, silly,\" Rarity says with a giggle. You get out of the bed and do just that. You see that it's the same month and day, but your eyes widen at the year. Apparently, this is tomorrow, but three years into the future!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since it's my turn to make breakfast, I'll head to the kitchen,\" says Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only you and AJ left in the room, she gets up and walks up to you. \"Do ah have to fill ya in on yer entire life like yer some sort of amnesiac?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my entire life, but the last couple of years would help,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack chuckles, thinking that you're just playing dumb, but she decides to humor you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it all started on the last day of our junior year in high school,\" she explains. \"Ya told Rarity an' me that you couldn't decide who you wanted to be with more, cuz you couldn't imagine life without either of us. Needless to say, it struck a chord with the two of us, so we decided that we'd share ya. After graduation, we decided t' live together in Vanhoover to spend our college years, an' here we are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, AJ,\" you say with a smile. \"So, what exactly did you, me, and Rarity do last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowpony chuckles. \"Let's just say you made me an' Rarity feel like real mares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast is ready!\" you hear from another room, only it wasn't Rarity's voice. Is sounded more like... Auntie Celeste?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly wake up in your regular bed, in your regular bedroom, in your regular time. That was a really weird dream. Although... it did get you thinking. Maybe it would be best for you to have both Rarity and Applejack as your girlfriends. You needed to talk to somepony about this, but who?</span></div></div>",

She's a;ready nervous at the thought of you dating one mare, so telling her you might be considering dating <b>two</b> of them might be pushing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, though, she's said it herself: you can talk to her about anything, and you're sure that dating two mares falls under the category of \"anything\". When you get to the table for breakfast, you take a deep breath and look at Auntie Celeste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auntie,\" you say. \"I know you don't feel comfortable when I talk about other mares, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it sweetie?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had this dream,\" you say. \"It was about... well, me... three years from now, living in Vanhoover in an apartment with Applejack... <b>and</b> Rarity.

I must have been stressing out over my relationship with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia nods her head and you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That dream got me thinking,\" you say. \"Is it really that bad if I can't choose between those two? Would having a relationship with both of them be the best thing for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia stays quiet for a moment, then speaks up. \"Well, [your name], I don't know about humans, but polyamory isn't uncommon among ponies,\" she explains. \"In fact, I have several friends in Canterlot that are in such relationships. What I'm trying to say is that it's an option, but you have to be sure that it's what you want. More importantly, you need to know if Rarity and Applejack are okay with it as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at Celestia. You weren't expecting her to be so calm about this. Could this mean that she's finally gotten over her jealousy? \"Thanks, Auntie,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, sweetheart,\" she says. \"Now you should get ready. You're spending the day with Rarity, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man!\" you say. \"I almost forgot!\" you quickly wolf down the rest of your breakfast, and get ready for your date with Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to the Carousel Boutique and see Rarity waiting outside for you. She was wearing an ice blue top and a black skirt with white bell bottom pant underneath. \"Why hello, darling!\" she says, excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rarity,\" you say. \"You ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I ever!\" she says. \"I have something special planned for us. Since you promised to spend an entire day with me and that where we go is my call, I've decided that we'll be going to Canterlot for the day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that explains why you wanted me to meet you so early,\" you say. \"The train ride is forty minutes long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and we have to get there before we miss it, so let's go,\" she says as she takes your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you were able to catch the train and find a booth to sit in. Rarity sat on the same side of the booth as you so that she could nuzzle up to you.

See you at school tomorrow!\u201d she says, and the line goes dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second. Did Rarity just say that the prom was Saturday? You had no idea that the prom was that soon! Then again, all you need to worry about is your tuxedo, which Rarity is most likely taking care of for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the massive hangover you had earlier, things were looking up. You have a date to the prom, and there are absolutely no consequences. The only real \u201cproblem\u201d you have is whether you\u2019re more in love with Rarity or with Applejack, and the answer will reveal itself in time, so there\u2019s no need to stress about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back to the room you here sleeping in and peek though the door to see Applejack hugging her little sister.

You eat your breakfast, brush your teeth afterwards and headed out for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way there, Twilight decides to make some conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, this is the first time we\u2019ve walked to school together in a long time,\u201d she says. You realize she was right. For the past few years, you and Twilight always walked down different routes to school. The last time you walked to school together was in elementary school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since we\u2019re on good terms now, we <b>can</b> walk together,\u201d you say. \u201cBy the way, thanks again for doing my science project for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said before,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s no big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you finally get to school, and since you and Twilight\u2019s lockers were in different areas of the school, you both part ways.

Buck that, you already know Dash hates these clowns since they tease &amp; mock her skills a lot. Shit, you feel bad for Rainbow since she has them in her track team..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoops leans over &amp; nudges Dumb-Bell, the dark-coated stallion looks over at his friend curiously as Hoops whispers something in his ears. Dumb-Bell nods \"Right right..\" he then turn his attention back at you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and Hoops wants a date with that Pinkie Pie chick..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!!?\" you shout in shock.

You feel that light tap again, and you just happened to be looking down at the time, so you see that Rarity is playfully kicking your foot with her hoof. You smile lightly as she smiles back at you, but then you quickie remember that you were sitting with five other ponies, including Applejack. How could Rarity be okay with flirting with you so openly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, then again, it's not that open. It's just a little game of footsie. What's the harm in that? You decide to entertain her and kick her hoof back. You couldn't have predicted what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did somepony just kick me?\" Fluttershy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWay to go, hotshot. You just kicked the wrong pony. How you managed to do something that stupid is beyond you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bad, Fluttershy,\" you say. \"I was just stretching my legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay then.\" she says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Rarity, expecting her to give you one of those \"You've got to be kidding me\" looks. Instead, she giggles, finding your slight mistake to be cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, the school day ends and you go to you locker. As you expected, you get a visit from Dumbbell and Hoops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, have ya made your decision?\" asks Dumbbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you say. \"I'll help you out.

Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, sure.\" says Dumbbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure if he was being sincere, but you were proven wrong the next day. Dumbbell and Hoops were true to their word and stayed away from you and didn't try any funny business with your friends. You enjoyed the lack of harassment, and this was by far the happiest week of your life. You were even happy enough to bear all of Auntie Celeste's daily phone calls, and she was happy that Dumbbell and Hoops weren't bothering you anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Saturday morning, you wake up to the smell of breakfast, as usual, and after you ate your fill, there was a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delivery for a Mr. [your name] and a Miss Sparkle.\" says the pony at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Twilight look at each other, wondering what you guys received. You open the door and the delivery pony hands the packages to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's from Rarity.\" says Twilight, and the two of you immediately know what she sent you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, you and Twilight received your outfits for the prom, which were really stunning. Twilight's dress was a shade of purple that complemented her coat, and your tuxedo was a great shade of midnight blue, with jewels in the place of buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were admiring the outfits you receive a phone call. There's only one pony you know that would be calling this early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Auntie Celeste.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you too, [your name],\" she says. \"Sorry to call so early, but I have something arranged for your date with Rarity tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

The delivery ponies from Canterlot already dropped off the car, which was a beautiful red sports model.

You don't normally address Celestia as your aunt in front of your friends, but you accidentally did that in front of Rarity, and she occasionally teases you about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you finally reach the school and make your way to the gymnasium, where the prom is being held. There was a festive atmosphere and lights everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot to tell you,\" you say to Rarity, \"You look beautiful tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity chuckles. \"Better late than never.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find your friends, and they're all surprised that you and Rarity were going together. Well, everyone except Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie, and Twilight kind of suspected that you two would be going together.

One, you were sure that Fluttershy was going to inquire about your... situation. Maybe Twilight didn't tell anyone. Two, usually when the girls had sleepovers, it was mares only. They were usually at either Pinkie Pie's or Twilight's place. Auntie Celeste would let you and Spike crash at the Canterlot Castle when the sleepover at Twilight's. So this was not only the first time Fluttershy was hosting the sleepover, but also the first time you were invited. Maybe the girls can finally trust you to go to a sleepover with them without being suspicious of you trying something sleazy. You would never do that, though, mainly because one of six things would happen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Twilight would give you a harsh scolding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Rainbow Dash wold beat the shit out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Fluttershy would never look at you the same way again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Pinkie would blab to everypony in Ponyville about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Applejack and Rarity would dump your sorry ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. All of the above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven those possibilities, it wouldn't be worth it to try anything stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accept Fluttershy's invitation, and as she walks away, another pony approaches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Twilight,\" you say, trying not to sound bitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, [your name],\" she says. \"I was hinking about what you said last night... and you were right. I shouldn't have spied on you and Applejack. It wasn't any of my business. Your secret's safe with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile grows on your face. \"Thanks Twilight,\" you say. \"By the way, are you going to Fluttershy's sleepover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know that I was invited?\" you ask back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my idea to invite you in the first place,\" she says with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at Twilight again and wrap your arm around her. \"Aww, thanks 'little sis'.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're only two months oder than me,\" she says matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" you say. Just then, the warning bell rings which means that everypony now has two minutes to get to class. \"I should get going,\" you tell Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day goes by smoothly, and when the last bell rings, you go to your looker and get all the books you needed to do your homework for the night. Just when you start walking out the school doors to your car, you're stopped by two ponies. Who are they?</span></div></div>",

Why does your love life have to be so damn complicated? First you can't decide between two girls, and now another one admitted that she likes you too.

The party over at Pinkie's was when I told them about my likings for them. After my encounter with the cider, and Rainow, I hope nothing bad happened to you, I was over at Applejack's, trying to get better. Unfortunately, I had to fix her status with Applebloom, who was sore at her for me liking her and vise versa--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the hay now..?\" Applejack asks. You guess Applebloom <i>didn't</i> tell her everything. The poor filly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay..? There went prom night and you know what happened. I went to Pinkie Pie's for the muffins she gave me, again, thanks, Pinkie--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo problem!\" she replies, with so mush enthusiasm, it somewhat made you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The day after that, I went out with Applejack, still feeling bad about not being able to decise, while Twilight here was spying on me and realized the whole situation. Which I'm glad you told no one, Twilight. You somewhat saved me there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're somewhat welcome,\" she playfully sarcastically replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time, Rainbow Dash just couldn't believe her ears.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Prom night was an extravagant event. It promised to be a great change of pace from everything that had been leading up to it. In that time, you managed to spend more time with your friends and keep it a secret who you were going to the prom with (though you suspected Twilight had figured it out at some point). Celestia had been very generous and lent you a carriage to ferry you and Rarity to and from the prom. Dressed in your fine tuxedo, you pick up Rarity and set off. She was radiant in the dress she had made and would certainly put most other designs to shame. \"I'm real excited,\" you say when the carriage sets off. \"I was afraid something had come up since you seem to have been so busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just needed to focus on my work, darling,\" she replies. \"And work out a little something for after the prom. I do hope you won't mind leaving a bit early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" you say with a smile, wondering what the surprise could possibly be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" she says, beaming and kissing you on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dance itself was great. Everyone was surprised initially to see you and Rarity. Thankfully, you and Rarity had worked out an explanation of why they were there together that would spare Applejack's feelings. As far as everyone knew, you were taking Rarity because she did not want to go alone and you were doing her a favor as a good friend. Dancing with Rarity was divine and seeing Rainbow Dash knock one of the clowns who picked on you for a loop when he tried to make a move was very satisfying. But, you did not stay for the whole thing as Rarity wanted to leave early for the \"surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage drops you both back at her shop and you enter. Rarity closes and locks the door behind before using her magic to light the shop. You were surprised by the sight of Applejack waiting there in her usual getup. \"What's going on?\" you ask, looking from Rarity to Applejack as she walks over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack and I did some talking,\" Rarity said. \"And we came to a decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we're both...well taken with you,\" Applejack picked up, \"but I didn't want to go to the prom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We worked out a way to make the night favorable for everyone,\" Rarity said, a light blush going across her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to ask what they were talking about when Applejack shut you up with a kiss. You melt into the kiss, savoring the apple-cinnamon taste that went with AJ. Out of the corner of your eye, you see Rarity using her magic to get her extravagant dress off. While her bust was not as large as AJ's and she did not have the same athletic tone, you did notice she had an amazing butt thanks to her back being to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack gets your attention back by rubbing your crotch and you suddenly understand what they planned. \"Are you sure?\" you ask after managing to break away from AJ's kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" Applejack says with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very,\" Rarity says, walking over only in her bra and panties. \"And I think the time for idle chatter has passed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity the kisses you and you kiss back, noting her sweet taste. Your hands move over her back and over her wide hips before moving over her backside. You could tell from looking that Rarity's butt was as round as AJ's, but you doubted AJ's ass was as soft as Rarity's. While you shared a kiss with Rarity, Applejack went to work getting your pants undone. She undid the button and slowly worked the zipper down. \"Looks like somebody's all excited~\" Applejack says in a seductive tone when she sees your erection through your boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity moans softly into the kiss as you squeeze her soft butt and you feel AJ tug your pants down and the she gasps. Rarity breaks the kiss to see what she gasped at and stares at your erect shaft. You would not use the word \"big\" to describe your shaft, but was above average in size from what you knew thanks to Twilight's library. Even so, you could tell the sight of it clearly aroused Rarity and Applejack. \"You're certainly impressive, darling,\" Rarity says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice and healthy~\" AJ says and you jump slightly when you feel her hand move over your sac, which you knew as a bit bigger than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ then stands and undoes the knot of her shirt, letting her large and firm breasts spring out. The sight makes you stare at her round melons and a bead of clear pre-cum appears from your dick. Rarity undoes her bra and lets it fall, exposing her round and soft breasts, then pushes her panties off while AJ undoes her shorts and pushes them off her hips. \"I think we can skip 'formalities' with three of us here,\" Rarity said with a seductive edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we,\" you say, \"you know...use protection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, Tiger,\" AJ says. \"Neither of use wants you all saddled up tonight~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her in disbelief. Not only were you about to have a threesome with two beautiful mares, but neither of them wanted you to put a condom on. It seemed a very lucky night for you! \"So...\" you start before Rarity cuts you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I had you to myself all night, I think it only fair that Applejack get you first.\" Her statement surprised you, but you were sure that the argument between them had been lengthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ gives you a seductive wink and drags you more to the center of the room. Rarity follows, stripping you of the rest of your clothes to leave you naked as they were. AJ pulls you down on top of her and gives you a wink before glancing at your dick, which was dripping pre-cum. \"Looks like you're about to pop, sugar~\" she says before whispering. \"I bet all that watchin of my rear you've done has you ready to pop big time~ If you're gonna pop, then pop inside me~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and push your cock inside AJ's wet pussy, aware of Rarity watching. AJ moans loudly as you push inside her and you can't help but groan at how tight her pussy grips you. You look over to see Rarity watching and slowly rubbing her own wet pussy, clearly biting back her moans. You push all the way inside AJ and the head of your dick pushes against her cervix. \"Ah~\" she moans, \"you feel as big as you look, sugar~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start thrusting in and out of AJ's tight pussy, sure that you won't last long. Her large breasts barely move as you thrust and you feel her toned thighs hug your waist as she wraps her legs around you. Your hands tease her breasts, squeezing the firm mounds before pinching her nipples. You can hear Rarity moaning as you fuck AJ, the cowgirl pony's moans much louder. You groan lowly and push your face into her tits, feeling your cum start to surge through your dick from your balls. \"He's throbbin!\" AJ moans loudly. \"Cum in me, sugar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if you wanted to pull out, AJ's toned legs keep you locked inside her tight pussy. You shove fully inside her and cum hard. Your thick load bursts from your dick and gushes into AJ's womb through her cervix. You feel AJ cum around your dick and hear Rarity cry out in orgasm as well. You groan loudly as each throb of your cock pumps more thick spunk into AJ. You cum so hard and fill her so fast that a bit of your cum spurts out of AJ's pussy around your dick. \"Ahhh~\" AJ moans as you stop cumming in her. \"I knew your apples were weighty for a reason~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unlocks her legs from your waist and lets you pull out, a small stream of cum escaping her pussy. \"I hope you didn't empty EVERYTHING into Applejack,\" Rarity says, coming over and pushing you to your back as AJ scoots away. \"Because now it's my turn, darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'd have more drippin from me if he emptied everything in those nuts of his,\" AJ says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity straddles you and sinks down onto your dick. Her pussy was easily as tight as AJ's and made you groan in pleasure again. You grip her thighs as you feel her soft, round ass touch your balls lightly and hear her moan sharply when she feels your head touch her cervix. Rarity leans forward and whispers to you: \"I feel your gems hot against my rear, darling. I know you must be aching to empty them and you're so deep inside me~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts riding you, moaning as she thrusts up and down your thick cock. Her breasts bounce lightly as she rides and you can already feel your orgasm approaching. You groan as she rides and inhale sharply when you feel something wet on your sac. You tilt your head to see AJ between your legs licking your balls. She gives you a wink before starting to finger herself. You feel a tingle in your sac as she licks telling you that your going to shoot a big load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time you feel yourself ready to erupt and your dick begins to throb inside Rarity. \"Yes!\" she moans loudly. \"Cum inside me, darling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hilts your dick in her pussy when you tell her you're cumming. Your head flares against her cervix before hot, thick cum sprays through her cervix and splatters against the depths of her womb. She cries out, cumming as well. Unlike AJ, Rarity squirted around your dick when she came. \"He's cumming!\" she moans loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan loudly, AJ no longer licking your sac, as your cock sprays into Rarity. Rarity's riding combined with AJ's licking makes you cum so hard and fill Rarity up so fast that a large amount of excess actually squirts out of Rarity around your cock, getting on both your thighs and the floor. Rarity squeals a bit  when she feels your cum squirt from her and you hear AJ cumming as well. \"You came quite a lot,\" Rarity says, a bit breathless after you stop cumming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say he filled us up,\" AJ says with a lusty tone as Rarity slides off your dick. \"And you're still hard, Tiger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide...</span></div></div>",

You turn around and lock eyes with Rarity for about a split second, but she quickly turns her head away, looking at the other two mares that were with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh well,\"</i> you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, you keep catching Rarity shooting those glares at you. You don't understand, one minute, she can barely stand to be in the same room as you, let alone look at you, and the next minute, she can't take her eyes off you (albeit not in a good way). Is she genuinely mad at you, or is she just jealous of Applejack?You feel like you should tell her something, but you fear that it will only widen the already huge rift between you two.</span></div></div>",

Finally giving up, you say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, never mind,\" you say. \"It's not important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it wasn't so important, then why didja need the two of us to be alone?\" the confused cowpony asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you say. You then try to change the subject. \"Well, I'll be inside watching Applebloom while you get your work done. I don't want to hold you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... okay,\" says AJ, and she walks away towards the orchard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the mare is out of your sight, you literally kick yourself. \"Aargh, I can't believe it!\" you say angrily. \"How could I be so stupid!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" asks a little filly from behind you. You turn around to see Applebloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't understand,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah' understand perfectly,\" she says. \"You have a crush on my sister, but yer too scared to tell her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her in disbelief. \"How did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?\" ask Applebloom. \"It's completely obvious! And ah' can't even tell ya how painful it was ta see ya try an' ask my sister out. Why do you think Ah'm always around when you two are together? Ah' wanted to see when you'd finally come clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as you just saw, I totally blew it,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know what yer problem is?\" the filly asks. \"You're focusing more on asking her out and less on simply admitting your feelings. Baby steps, [your name]. Baby steps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe that you're taking relationship advice from a middle school pony, but she has a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, Applebloom, you're right,\" you say. \"Maybe you'll get your cutie mark in relationship counselling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe filly's face brightens up. \"Really? I've got to tell the other crusaders!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well just don't mention my name or Applejack's,\" you say, and you run off in the direction that AJ went. You see her bucking some trees in the west orchard, and you call her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sugarcube, I'm kinda busy right now,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but there's something I need to say first,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ sighs, hoping that you wouldn't just say \"never mind\" for the third time in a row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack,\" you say, \"this is something that I've been wanting to say for almost a year now. I... I like you. I really like you. I mean, you were the first friend I made in Ponyville, and you're always there for me. I think you're a really beautiful mare and you mean so much to me. If you don't like me back, I understand. I just wanted to get this off my chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of that whole spiel, you're breathing harder than normal.

I just don't feel the same way, (your name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, this sentence hit you hard.

She went to get her friends for... something.\"<br>\r\nYou walk away from the orchard, now showing your emotion without having Applejack see. Nonetheless, she saw you walk away with some regret, and is even shocked to see the tear drop falling down from your concealed face from your hair. Once you were out of view back at her house, you wipe off the tears coming down your face. You haven't cried since Gilda punched your face in the 6th grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you decides to text the other ponies that you'll help them in asap when done with each other, whoever's closest.

I'll see you then, (your name), and remind me to ask you just what was your little \"engagement\" later, okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you can't help but feel that Rarity's text was somewhat pleading you to come first, and that Twilight is going through confusion and then curiosity. Nevertheless, the only places nearby, now that you got off the farm, is the Sugarcube Corner and the Carousel Boutique. Who to go to first..?</span></div></div>",

Rarity's usual hairstyle is now completely ruffled, her matching dress is completely rumpled, and she has the very tired look that is extremely conspicuous that even makeup can't hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's going back and forth, switching the pieces of cloth to see if they match up to each other. You put a hand on her shoulder and she calms down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Rarity?\" you ask the unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Yawn) No, I'm fine, darling,\" she replies, \"haven't slept in a solid 3 days, but I'm managing.\" She yawned again, this time, leaning onto you after she turned around. You start to find this a bi embarrassing, but at least you consider yourself lucky that Sweetie Belle isn't here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, (your name)!\" Rarity suddenly exclaims. She comes to her senses and realizes that she more cuddling instead of leaning. This was enough to make her blush and walk back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I read you needed help, not sleep, but if you want, I can help spruce up the place while you sleep. And by the look of it, you especially need one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd really do that? Thank you, (your name).\" She hugs you again, you hugging back this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry; I just hope I can make up for almost skipping out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's (yawn) okay, darling. But before I go, um, can I, err...\" She trailed off and started blushing again. Rarity walks away for a bit before you try to resume her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Rarity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to say, err... do you..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... want to, per se, go out on... a date, with me?\" 'There I said it! I just hope it wasn't something I'll regret.' Rarity thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis se you back. First it was confessing to Applejack, then trying to let you down gently, and now this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, want to go out with... me? Out of all people, me?\" Now it was your turn to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, (your name), darling, perhaps, I was a bit too early or quick to start with, but if you don't want to, I can completely understand,\" Rarity explains, rather quickly. But you couldn't say no. You remember AJ rejecting you and you cried... For a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince this is Rarity, and you know how dramatic she can be, you had to say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face brightens up when you accepted her request. \"Would you really!? Oh, darling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't expecting it, and neither was she, but the unicorn just so happens to plant a soft, yet somewhat forceful, and oddly inviting, kiss on your lips. Of course, this was both of your first kisses. She took no hesitation to hug you either as you do so as well. For a good minute, you two stopped making out. Your foreheads touched as your eyes get lost with Rarity's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, why don't I walk you to your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, (your name).\" As you walk, you see a clutter nearly everywhere. This might take a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you read her room, Rarity lets go of your arm. \"I'll see you later.\" Sh then kisses your cheek and closes the door. While you rub that cheek, you were lost, until you trip with a discarded spool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the unicorn looks so happy, that she falls down and fainted, both of tirednesst and elation. You both fell at the same time so none of you suspected a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 15 minutes of organizing everything, you realize that you still have other chores to do, Rainbow Dash and Twilight with Fluttershy.

But... you can't just leave, then again, you don't want to wake Rarity, either. You decide to write a note and leave it on her bedside. You quickly find a pen and paper and scribble the message. You then walk up to Rarity's room and slowly open the door. She looked so peaceful as she slept, and you're glad that she's finally getting some rest. You quietly walk to the unicorn's nightstand, place the note and hold it in place with the lamp that was on the nightstand. The note read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dear Rarity,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to run, Twilight and Fluttershy need me to help them tend to the animals. I was able to get all the cleaning done, so you don't have to worry about a thing. We can work out the details of our date later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet dreams,<br>\r\n[Your name]\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still wonder if writing \"Dear Rarity\" and \"Sweet dreams\" was necessary, but you decided to write both because Rarity would like stuff like that. Before you turn tail and leave, you take another look at Rarity. She looked so... serene, especially in her face. Even though she looked so tired and stressed just a while ago, she somehow looks really beautiful. Maybe.... maybe Applejack really wasn't the one for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately push that thought out of your head and leave Rarity to sleep in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way to Fluttershy's, you get a text from Rainbow Dash. The text reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to come over to the track, I was able to find somepony else to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this means that Fluttershy's cottage will be your last stop before heading home. You check the time, and it's five in the evening. You hope that the two mares you're going to see haven't already finished what they had to do. You finally get to the cottage, and when you open the door, you see Fluttershy and Twilight trying to get Angel Bunny to eat his dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank goodness!\" says Fluttershy as you walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys,\" you say. \"So should I just help get the other animals settled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, that;s already taken care of,\" says the yellow coated pegasus. \"It's Angel Bunny that's the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realize why she asked Twilight to come and help her. You always knew Angel Bunny was a handful. You sometimes wondered why Fluttershy even puts up with him. Apparently, even Twilight and all her knowledge can't fix this situation, so you walk up to Angel Bunny and kneel down in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat,\" you say, as to push the bowl of food in front of him, and Angel does just that. It seems like you're the only person that Angel isn't a total prick to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you could do it,\" Fluttershy says joyfully. Twilight just rolls her eyes, as if she were saying \"It's not that big a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I talk to you outside?\" the unicorn asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" you say wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of you were outside and out of earshot, Twilight starts talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what took you so long?\" she asks with a sassy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had other friends that needed me to help them, too, so I helped them on my way over here,\" you say, trying not to retaliate to Twilight's tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" she says. \"So what was this 'previous engagement' that you told me about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much what I just told you,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you expect me to believe that?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For Celestia's sake, Twilight!\" you say, finally snapping. \"Why do you have to be like that? Ever since I moved here almost three years ago you've been like this. What's your damage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's YOUR damage?\" she asks back. \"Why are you always keeping secrets from me? We used to tell each other everything, and now the only pony you confide in is Celestia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you see what's going on. Twilight was jealous of Auntie Celeste. You always thought that Twilight wouldn't be able to understand the problems you've had these past few years, so you always turned to your \"Aunt\" for advice (being a royal princess and all). Maybe you should just tell her about what happened with Applejack and Rarity...</span></div></div>",

Applejack?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you, sugarcube,\" she says uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you stand there silently for about five seconds, then you speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what brings you to this part of town?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ah was just stoppin' by Sugarcube Corner to grab me a bite o' Pinkie's new muffin recipe,\" she says, still feeling uneasy. \"Really good, those muffins...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know,\" you say. \"I had one yesterday after I... after I left your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you are silent again. This time, AJ speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why're you in this neck o' the the woods, partner?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was just headed over to Rarity's,\" you ask. \"She needed my help with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hurt you to lie to Applejack, but you can't tell her that you were planning a date with Rarity after you confessed to AJ less than twenty-four hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright 'den,\" says the cowpony.  She then twiddles her fingers for a moment. \"Yer not sore with me about rejectin' ya yesterday, are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" you say. \"Like I said, it's okay if you don't like me back. That's life, right? I just have to try and move on. You don't need to worry about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish that it were okay, and you wish that AJ had nothing to worry about, but it was, and she did. You can't bring yourself to tell her that, though, so you just play it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's nice t' hear,\" she says. \"Ah'll see ya later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later,\" you say, as you continue on towards the Carousel Boutique. Unbeknownst to you, Applejack was watching you as you walked off, with a look of regret on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach the boutique and receive the usual greeting from Rarity, only with a kiss on the cheek added at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So darling,\" she says. \"I've been thinking about our date, and was thinking...\"</span></div></div>",

But she will soon realize it so you decided its better to let her know now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright. (Sigh) Yesterday at Applejack's, I was helping her out watching Applebloom. I horribly confessed to AJ about a little crush I had. But after she somewhat let me down gently, I went to Pinkie's, came here, then helped Fluttershy afterwards. I didn't know you felt this way, but I didn't want to hurt your feelings either. I'm over Applejack now, but something seems funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We accidentally bumped into each other just before I came here. Very awkward situation, I'll give it that, but I couldn't help but notice that she acted a little off today. I told her it was okay about yesterday, but I can't quite place what is wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity thinks for a second. \"You don't suppose she's... jealous now, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack didn't have the same feelings for me. I can't put jealousy in that category. Besides, she doesn't even know about us, so she has nothing to be jealous about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well, I hope things work out right soon. Maybe we can talk to her later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I can--\" Suddenly your phone rings. Who's the call from?</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s thirteen, so she\u2019s at that age where she doesn\u2019t have a full understanding of her feelings. It\u2019s also the age where most ponies get their cutie marks, according to your experiences with ponies in middle school, at least. However, something tells you that Apple Bloom isn\u2019t being completely honest with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the walk is rather quiet, but thankfully it only took about three minutes to get to the school track from where you guys stopped. When you get there, you see Rainbow Dash doing some warm ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, [your name]! And Apple Bloom, too!\u201d says the pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d you say. \u201cAJ wants me to keep an eye on her, so I decided to take her along with me as I help everypony out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s cool,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve already done some flying training with the rest of the team, but I\u2019d like you guys to help me train for the running events.\u201d It\u2019s at that point where you notice that Rainbow Dash is wearing one of those braces that pegasus track runners wear to keep them from using their wings to give them a speed boost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve helped Rainbow train, before. You have a record of her best lap, her best overall time, and the time averages for all the school teams in the district. Dash gives you her stop watch and you and Apple Bloom set up the hurdles on the track while the pegasus gets herself pumped up at the starting line. Once the hurdles are set, you and Apple Bloom signal her to get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn your mark\u2026\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet set\u2026\u201d says the filly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGO!!\u201d you both say simultaneously, and Rainbow Dash takes off. Apple Bloom operated the stopwatch while you use your phone to pull up an updated average sheet. After Rainbow does her laps, Apple Bloom lets her know how she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou started to get a might slow in laps five, six, and seven, but then ya really kicked it into gear for the last three laps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith that in mind,\u201d you add, \u201cI think some endurance training will fix that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d says Rainbow Dash, \u201cI'll get right on that endurance training!

As you two walk away, Rainbow Dash notices Apple Bloom inching closer and closer to you with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Could she really... Nah, it's nothing,\"</i> she thinks, and gets back to her training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the little filly finally make it to Rarity's, where the unicorn was inside waiting for you to arrive. When you knock on the door, she rushes to answer it. \"Be right there!\" she says. She opens the door and happily greets you with a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your name], darling!\" she says. \"How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean since I last saw you two hours ago when school let out?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ha, ha,\" she says, then she notices the young filly standing next to you. \"Oh, Apple Bloom!

For some reason, you could trust her to keep your secrets.

You know how indecisive I can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I forget..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Apple Bloom was upstairs with Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo, with the filly not paying much attention as she keeps reminiscing the scene in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apple Bloom?\" Sweetie Belle asks. But no response. \"Apple Bloom?\" This time, she responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Apple Bloom?\" Scootaloo asks. \"You're spacing out more than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, guys,\" Apple Bloom replies, \"just thinkin' of somethin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell it's about about cutie marks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it isn't if not, what Ah told ya a few months ago. My crush on [your name]?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about it?\" Sweetie Belle asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was just an accident, but we both fell an' almost... kissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" they both exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so loud!\" Apple Bloom whispered. \"But I can tell he didn't know what to do. I think he likes somepony else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can't be,\" Scootaloo says. \"You think it was an accident?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom blushed. The way they both looked during that scene. 'Oh, why did ya interrupt us, Pinkie Pie? The moment was perfect...' \"Well, maybe Ah can do something to change his mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.

I mean, [your name]'s seventeen, and you're only thirteen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'll be fourteen by the end of summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then he'll be eighteen the month after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love knows no age, Sweetie Belle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AB's right!\" says Scootaloo. \"I say go for it, sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" she says with a new determination. \"Ah'm gonna go downstairs and see what Rarity and [your name] are up to.\" The little filly sneaks down the stairs and catches wind of your conversation with Rarity. While the Cutie Mark Crusaders were upstairs, the subject of your conversation switched from Apple Boom to Apple<u>jack</u>. However, Apple Bloom arrived in the middle of the conversation, and no names were mentioned, so she was totally in the dark as to who you and Rarity are talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think she's the one?\" the unicorn asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure of it,\" you say. \"There's something about her that makes me like her so much. I don't know what it is. There's a lot of different things about her that I like; her positive attitude, her cute southern accent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, you don't have to give me a list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Cute southern accent?\"</i> Apple Bloom thinks. <i>\"He must be talking about me! I knew it! I knew we were meant to be together!\"</i> Unfortunately, she forgot about the fact that she had an older sister that's your age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've had a crush on her for over a year now,\" says Rarity. \"I think you should admit your feelings. I'm sure she'd appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?\" you say. \"You're right. Once I get back to Sweet Apple Acres, I'll tell her how I feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go! That's what I like to hear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom sneaks back up the stairs, then rushes to Sweetie Belle's room to tell her friends what she heard and what (she thought) you were talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you help Rarity with her designs, you call Apple Bloom down and tell her that you're ready to go. As you two leave Carousel Boutique, Apple Bloom asks you something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are we going to Fluttershy's next?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the plan,\" you say, \"but I talked to her and Twilight earlier and they said that they're set, so I don't need to show up. So, I guess we'll be headed back to Sweet Apple Acres.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe filly resists the urge to jump for joy, because she's expecting you to confess the feelings that she thought were towards her. Little did she know that she was in for a big surprise. When you both get back to the Apple Family home, Apple Bloom decides to put \"Operation Tumble\" into motion. She immediately spots a tree root on the path to the house, and she stops you just as you reach it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your name], Ah really want to thank ya fer takin' me out with ya today,\" she says. \"It was really fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, the back of your foot right by the root, which you still haven't noticed. \"Anytime, Apple Bloo-WHOA!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the filly planned, you fall backwards, the filly pretending to fall with you. You both hit the ground with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" you say. \"I'm really clumsy today, aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't mind,\" she says with a tone that seems rather strange to you, coming from someone like her. \"So, [your name],\" she says. \"Is there something that you want to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Here it comes! I can't wait!\"</i> the filly thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to say that I had a lot of fun, too,\" you say. \"We should do this again sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom instinctively opened her mouth to say \"I really like you, too,\" but stopped when she heard what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well, Ah'm lookin' forward to it.\" she says. \"Could he have chickened out?\" she thinks. <i>\"Yeah, that's gotta be it. He's been too afraid to say it for over a year, so he must have gotten scared at the last second. Well that's fine with me. Ah can wait.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe filly gets of of you, and you both walk back to the house. When you knock on the door, you're greeted by Applejack, who's wearing different clothes form before. She must have gotten her work done and took a shower afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy, you two!\" she says. \"Did ya'll have fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots of fun, big sis!\" says Apple Bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, before I forget, AJ,\" you say. \"Can I talk to you later? There's something I want to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose last seven words make Apple Bloom's heart stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No way,\"</i> she thinks. <i>\"But when Ah heard him talking to Rarity earlier today, Ah was positive that... Oh, no! He was talkin' 'bout Applejack!? But I... I thought that... No.... No, no, no, no, no!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, Apple Bloom?\" you and AJ ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear streams down the poor young filly's face, and in a crying fit, she runs away. The question is: in which direction did she run?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She just kept running away. \"Was it something I said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't think so. We'd better get her quick. Who knows where she could be headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you somewhat underestimated Apple Bloom's speed and direction and so you have been wandering off trying your best to look for the filly. You even had to ask the others to help out. Unfortunately, they couldn't find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReason being, she ran off into the Everfree Forest, with no intentions in mind but letting the sadness go. She was sitting near a tree root, sobbing her eyes out, mourning over the loss of her crush. She didn't even hear the rustling of a certain mare, or should I say Zebra. After a twig snapped, Apple Bloom looks up. \"Who's there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" she heard. Then Zecora came out. \"Ah, why it's my little friend, Apple Bloom. I do not understand; why are you in gloom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe filly runs to hug the zebra. \"Oh, Zecora! I can't believe it! I have a cush for someone, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why are you here with me, instead of your family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My crush is [your name], and his crush is my sister, Applejack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see now why you feel this sting. After all, as I said, love is a weird thing.<br>\r\nHere, let me take you to my home; maybe what you need is some time alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Apple Bloom and Zecora make their way to her home, you were still wandering about to look for the filly. But no one had any luck. Until Twilight asked a few ponies and said that she was last seen entering the Everfree Forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this scared Fluttershy, but you somehow managed to make her come, even if her hooves are scraping the ground. 'Geez, Applajack. But I know it's understandable; after all, it's your sister.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom was sitting outside of Zecora's house. Rethinking about what just happened, she just couldn't believe it. \"Why, [your name], why..? I thought you meant me when you said, 'cute southern accent'... But it was Applejack you liked. Why, [your name]?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora looks at the filly outside. 'I can't stand seeing Apple Bloom this way, but I also can't believe that today was the day.<br>\r\n[Your name] admiting his true feelings to Applejack; but now, how will this filly ever change back?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom stands up and goes inside, her tears still flowing like calm streams. \"Zecora, I was wondering, do you have any love potion of any type? If I can't have [your name], then nopony can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZacora sighs before replying. \"I am sorry, my dear Apple Bloom, to say that I think there is none. I may have a remedy, but I can't exactly change [your name]'s mind for the one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Zecora! I really like him and I don't want to be without him. Are you sure there isn't any way for you to get me and [your name] together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora had to think about it. After all, it's a filly of 13 who's in love with you of 17 years of age.</span></div></div>",

She blinks and says \u201cReally?\u201d You nod your head again. \u201cWow\u2026 Ah\u2019m really flattered that you were so up front and honest with me\u2026 Ah guess that\u2019s one of the things ah like about you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d you say, starting to put two and two together. Now it was AJ\u2019s turn to nod her head. \u201cFor how long?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember the day ah first invited you over to Sweet Apple Acres?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. That was the first day we met.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, so Applejack started liking you before you started liking her. And here you thought that the idea of there being a connection between you two was absurd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh know we\u2019re in a might urgent situation, but\u2026\u201d she pauses, \u201cah\u2019d like to kiss you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously chuckle. \u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and AJ get closer to each other, and then you both wrap your arms around each other. Equally nervous, you both inch your faces closer and closer, until having your lips meet in the middle. Kissing Applejack felt warm, like there was a fire burning inside her, a fire that grew hotter and hotter with each passing second. You both eventually part from each other, getting back to reality. With your feelings finally out in the open, you and the cowpony rush off to catch up with your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see Zecora\u2019s hut!\u201d says Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Here comes [your name] and Applejack!\u201d says Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now that everyone\u2019s here, let\u2019s see if Zecora has seen Apple Bloom,\u201d says Twilight. The unicorn knocks on the door, and Zecora promptly answers it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Well hello, my dears. I think I know just why you\u2019re here,\u201d says the zebra. \u201cYou must be looking for Apple Bloom. She\u2019s inside, in my living room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank Celestia!\u201d says the oldest Apple sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was safe here with me. Would you like to join us for tea?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be great, thanks,\u201d says Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your friends enter the hut, and see Apple Bloom at the center table. Applejack rushes over to hug her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay, little sis?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m totally fine,\u201d says the filly. This confused AJ a little, considering how upset her little sister was when she ran off. She pushes the thought aside, though, since the fact that the little filly is safe is more important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone gathered at the table, Zecora brings out the cups of tea. She had spiked your tea with the love potion she conjured up. As planned, she only put in enough to last the weekend, figuring that would be enough to make Apple Bloom happy. After Zecora hands out the cups, Applejack turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[Your name], ah never got to thank ya  for lookin\u2019 after my little sis for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAh really appreciate it. It means a lot to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora looks at the way you and Applejack are looking at each other. Somehow, she sensed the attraction between you two, and starts to have second thoughts. Even if the spell would last only two days, it might ruin your relationship with AJ. Then again, that might not happen, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh made this tea myself!\u201d Apple Bloom chimes in. \u201cAh know you\u2019ll all love it! Especially you, [your name].\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Applejack is the only one that finds those last words a little suspicious. She eyes her sister for a second, wondering what she meant by those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up your tea and are about to drink it when\u2026</span></div></div>",

You remember going to search for Apple Bloom, the Applejack wanted to talk to you about something, then you found Apple Bloom in Zecora's hut and you drank some tea that she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the tea made me sleepy,\" you say to yourself. \"Oh, well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you take a shower, eat breakfast, and get dressed, you get a call from Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why AJ would call me this early?\" you say, the memory of you two admitting your feelings to each other completely clouded. All that you could think about was her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sugarcube!\" says Applejack. \"Ah was wonderin' if ya wanted to come on down to Sweet Apple Acres today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder why the cowpony on the other line sounds so happy. Something must have happened to her that's making her be this way. Then again, why do you care? Going to Sweet Apple Acres means seeing Apple Bloom, the filly of your dreams!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you say. \"I'll be right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling Twilight where you're going, you rush over to the Apple family house, where Applejack (and more importantly, Apple Bloom,) was waiting. When you knock on the door, you hear hoofsteps rushing to answer it. The door swings open, and Applejack smiles when she sees that it's you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your name]!\" she says, hugging you and kissing your cheek. \"You're here!\" When AJ kissed you, it caused your head to hurt for just a second, and you vaguely remember the last time you kissed somepony, but the memory quickly fades away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AJ, what are you doing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do ya mean?\" she asks. \"All I did was kiss ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That <b>is</b> what I mean,\" you say. \"Why did you kiss me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even remember what we were talkin' about last night?\" she asks. \"You know, when we were admittin' our feelings for each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the pain in your head again. This time, the memory of you and Applejack confessing your feelings for each other comes back, but t was very vague, and it leaves your mind. You then eye the mare with a look of confusion. What in the hell was she talking about? Was she delusional? She must be a little trippy. Looks like you're not the only one that was affected by the tea last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember that at all,\" you say. \"Is your sister home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. She's upstairs, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that information, you immediately go inside the house and walk up the stairs to see your sweetheart. \"Apple Bloom!\" you call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your name]?\" she answers in disbelief. <i>\"Yes! The potion worked! He's all mine now!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe filly rushes towards you and wraps you in a tight hug, which you happily return. \"How've you been, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fine,\" she says, \"but Ah'm much better now that you're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, would you like to take a walk around town with me today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'd love to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem. 'Scuse me?\" says Applejack, who was watching most of this scene unfold before her very eyes. \"Ah'd hate to bother you two, but can Ah borrow my little sis for a sec?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'll be right back, handsome!\" she says, and she follows her big sister into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Apple Sisters were in the older one's room, AJ keeps her voice down so you can't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this is way too weird,\" she whispers. \"Somethin's up, Apple Bloom, and Ah wanna know what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothin's up, big sis,\" whispers the younger sibling. \"[Your name]'s just came to his senses. It's not my fault he likes me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But last night Ah told him that Ah liked him, and he said that he felt the same way 'bout me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He obviously wasn't in his right mind. He was probably trying to make ya feel better. That's just how nice he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apple Bloom, what did you do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told ya, nothin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apple Bloom, you did do somethin' to [your name], and Ah swear to Celestia Ah'm gonna find out what it is, and when I do, Ah'll...

Ah'm the one [your name] wants, so get over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the filly exits the room, leaving her older sister fuming mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm ready to go, darlin'!\" she says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" you say. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Apple Bloom leave to go out on your date, but what does Applejack do?</span></div></div>",

It was pretty quiet like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She took it pretty well,\" you say. \"I guess hearing it from me worked a lot better than hearing it from somepony else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I guess we're officially together now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah guess we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how our friends are gonna take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we tell 'em on Monday when we get to school?\" she suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack gives you a quick kiss on the cheek before you leave, and you have an idiotic smile on your face for the rest of the day. Two days later, when you and AJ get to school, you both stand outside the main entrance, about to make your relationship public. You both look at each other and nod your heads. You then hold each other's hands and walk into the school halls. You immediately attract looks from the other ponies in school. The looks on their faces ranged from either \"I knew it,\" to \"Them? Together? Who knew?\" Thankfully, there weren't any looks of disgust. As you both walk down the hallway to your lockers, some ponies approach you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho are they?</span></div></div>",

In fact I'm willing to make things as comfortable as possible for you. If you ever feel uncomfortable, just say the word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Alright, I'll do it, if you pay me when I show up to... where are we doing this exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At my place. It's across the street form the Carousel Boutique. And don't worry, I'll pay you every bit once you show up. How does tomorrow at noon sound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think on it for a moment. You don't have anything to do tomorrow, as far as you know. \"That sounds good,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra's face brightens up. \"Great!\" she exclaims before pulling out a piece of paper. \"Here's my number,\" she says as she scribbles the digits down with her magic before handing the paper to you. \"Text me so I have yours, kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you say with a smile before continuing to walk home. \"See you tomorrow, Lyra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye!\" she says as she waves to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way back home and see that Twilight's already returned from Fluttershy's place. \"Hey, Twi,\" you say. \"Sorry I couldn't help you and Fluttershy. I was helping AJ with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No harm done,\" she replies. \"Fluttershy and I were able to manage. Since you mentioned Applejack, though, you know her birthday is coming up, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You plan on getting her anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm keeping it a secret.\" You didn't want Twilight to know that you were getting AJ a ticket to Vanhoover. Being the inquisitive mare she is, she'd then ask you how you planned to pay for it. Sure, you could lie and say that Celestia would be paying for everything rather than half, but that could lead to a phone call to Celestia, which <b>will</b> lead to her getting mad at you for lying, and she'll decide not to pay for the ticket at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, you don't take risks with Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you attempt to change the subject. \"You know, I talked to Applejack, and she said that she didn't want to do anything special for her eighteenth birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Twilight says. \"Why not? An eighteenth birthday is supposed to be special! I read it in a book about important milestones in a young pony's life. Remember Rarity's eighteenth birthday party last month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that was a blast. Hell, even Fluttershy had a decent get-together for her birthday the month before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe we can convince her to do <b>something</b> for the occasion...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully. We have two weeks, though, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. Who knows? She might have a change of heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you go up to your room and get ready for bed. Looking after the Crusaders took a lot out of you. You can't figure out how AJ can handle them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you woke up at around eleven in the morning, so you go downstairs for breakfast, scrambled eggs and pancakes, to be exact, and wolf it down quickly, you then rush upstairs to brush your teeth take a quick shower before getting dressed. By the time you're all ready yo leave, it was quarter to twelve. You figure that you should leave now so you could get to Lyra's on time. Thankfully, Twilight is in her room reading a book, so you're able to avoid the awkward \"Where are you going?\" moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt three minutes to noon, you reach Lyra's house. You knock on the door and the unicorn promptly answers. \"[Your name]! You made it! Come in!\" she says happily. You both go to Lyra's living room, where you both take a seat. What does Lyra do first.</span></div></div>",

In reference to your other question, it is really hard to figure out what your purpose in life is without something telling you what it is. Some humans pursue what their passionate about, while others pursue what will make them the most money, and while all ponies are talented at something, some humans just don't have a certain talent or niche to fill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, interesting. Well, the next question I want to ask is why are humans so fascinated with the advancement of technology?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans are curious creatures by nature.

Actually, there were times when even you were too shy to talk to her. You have no problem with the other ponies, but Fluttershy is just the one who makes you look like you replaced her in the shyness category.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother reason you wanted to help her first, the homecoming dance was getting close, and well, you had a bit of an attraction to her. Ever since you saw her for the first time, you looked at each other for a slight second, and you look back someplace else. The funny thing you noticed, she was blushing as well. You don't know for sure that she was attracted to you or not, but you decide to try your chances with Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou text Twilight that you'll meet Fluttershy in a bit and text the other ponies you'll get to them soon. Once you leave, you make you way towards the woods in which the pegasus resides about 15 minutes later. While walking on her usual trail, you suddenly hear a bush rustling. A squirrel came out of the bush and looks up at you. After some nose wiggling, it runs away when it saw a figure coming towards you. None other than Fluttershy; it had to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was failed to be realized was that she was leading a line of rabbits to another area with her back turned on you. You didnt know she was close either since you were facing away from her as well. So, while being off guard, you were pushed to the ground. And as you knew, she would start chattering it up, apologizing for her mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my goodness!\" Fluttershy exclaims, in that high whisper. \"(Your name), I'm really sorry for bumping into you like that! I didn't know you were behind me! I was just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fluttershy, Fluttershy!\" you interrupt. \"It's okay. I know it was just an accident. I wasn't looking either, so I'm at blame as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch your head, blushing because of bumping into Fluttershy, and the fact that she was the most beautiful dress you ever saw, the way it's white frame balanced out her golden coat was so enchanting, that you find yourself blushing even more than usual, especially since you're gonna try to ask her out to homecoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, (your name)?\" Fluttershy asks. Her head is tilted slightly with a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, I-I-I'm fine, Fluttershy. Heh heh eh...\" Another flaw is that you sometimes stutter around her. You try to think about what you say, but with the pegasus of your dreams standing right there is severely complicating the situation. \"So, uh, you needed help with the animals here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right! Yes, you see, there were more than what I expected. Could you please... help me?\" She grabs your hands, something totally unexpected and was making you sweat very badly. It doesn't give any help either that her cute smile is there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure, I'd love t-to help!\" Luckily, she doesn't notice anything yet, so you took this as not messing up. \"Uh, where is Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She left just before I bumped into you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour finishing rounding up the rabbits, squirrels, birds and all the other woodland creatures, you sit down at a nearby tree. Fluttershy does the same, only she sits next to your right hand side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for helping me, (your name),\" she states. \"I'm really grateful for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No problem,\" was all you could manage to say. You both sit there in awkward silence. You keep telling yourself to tell her now, but it's just so difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Fluttershy?\" you start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, (your name)?\" she replies, looking at you.

You weren't really worried about her going with another guy, since you're the only guy her age that she's close to, but you don't want her to be stuck at home with nothing to do on homecoming night when you could've asked her to go with you. You look up, and you see that you were so deep in thought that you reached home without you noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you eat dinner, Twilight looks at you with a question mark over her head. \"Is something the matter, [your name]?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's nothing,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are Dumbbell and Hoops picking on you again?\" she asks in a tone that reminds you of Auntie Celeste whenever she asked that same question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just thinking,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight drops the subject and you continue eating. After dinner, you look at the clock. It was six-thirty in the evening, and you think about Fluttershy again. You then come to a realization: the worst thing she can do is say no, so you have nothing to lose. A surge of confidence flows through you, and you decide to go through with asking Fluttershy to homecoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you go about this?</span></div></div>",

Fluttershy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're really surprised! She's scared of even her own shadow! But flying at speeds comparable to Rainbow scares the hell out of you! But you couldn't help but see a huge smile and... tearing eyes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back, but it proved futile, as she lands on top of you, with no hesitation, and you ate forcefully pushed all the way to Twilight's house and make a big hole where the door should be. Luckily, she or Spike didn't get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy then surprisingly kisses you right there, not caring that she caused a scene right there.

I will go with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised that even Fluttershy would retort like this. Hell, you were even expecting for her to say no. But all this was worth it, not even caring that you were in pain (you hear your ribs crack and fingers break).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the pegasus gets off of you and helps you up, she couldn't help but kiss you again, this time you kissing back. By the time Fluttershy came to her senses, she pulled back and looked sideways, blushing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, (your name),\" she says. \"I guess I got carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Fluttershy,\" you reply. \"At least you said yes.\" You both smile at each other, sort of awkwardly, luckily the other ponies walked away, and she says goodbye and leaves.

Like his equally dimwitted friend, he constantly harasses you and your friends at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese three bullies tended to hang out together, but since they're kindred spirits, that's no shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you guys want?\" asks Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard talk that [your name] and Fluttershy are a couple, and we had to see it to believe it,\" says Gilda.

She probably even told Celestia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't want you to keep them waiting. I'll see you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Later, Fluttershy.\" You both wave goodbye, and you head for home, but you stop at the pharmacy first and get a box of condoms. What? If you planned on having sex with Fluttershy, you'd want to be safe. You don't want her to become a teenage mother, even though she'd be able to handle it, knowing her. Still, better safe than sorry. You ask for the box to be put in a paper bag. (The last thing you need is Twilight on your case for why you bought a box of condoms.) Once you get back home, you open the door to see.</span></div></div>",

Once you get to your room, you close the door and go into your closet. You use a stepladder to get to the top of the closet and grab a box with a lock on it. This is where you keep your most personal possessions, including a picture of you and Fluttershy from freshman year, your first year in Ponyville. You put the box of condoms in your lock box and place it back in its place in your closet.

The next day, you go over to the Carousel Boutique to ask Rarity to make an outfit for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your name], darling!\" she says. \"What brings you here on a Sunday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was wondering if you could make an outfit for me for the dance Friday night,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn smiles. \"No problem! I'll put you on the top of my waiting list,\" she says. Rarity was your closest friend in Ponyville, and she was also the pony you could trust with a secret. Some would question why, but she has yet to reveal a secret of yours in the almost three years you've known her. \"Is there anything specific you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only that it's easily removable,\" you say, thinking about what you and Fluttershy will be doing afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Rarity ask next?</span></div></div>",

Their jaws were all on the ground as they all try to figure out why Fluttershy's acting so forward with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'all don't think he's gonna go for it, do ya?\" Applejack asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he will!\" says Rainbow Dash. \"He's a guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should stop spying on them, in case he does,\" says Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" says Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you think about how out of character Fluttershy's been acting lately. First she gets herself all dressed up for you only a day after you admitted your feelings for each other. Next, she suggests going back to her place the first chance she gets, and then she practically forces herself onto you, asking you to have sex with her. There's no way Fluttershy would do all this unless... unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not Fluttershy,\" you say, finally realizing what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever do you mean?\" the pegasus asks, remaining on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean just that,\" you say more sternly. \"You're not Fluttershy!\" You push her off of you and get on your feet. Fluttershy falls to the floor with a loud thud, loud enough for your friends to hear from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?\" Pinkie Pie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, something's not right here!\" Rainbow says. \"We've gotta get in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Fluttershy's room, Fluttershy gets up off the floor and looks at you with fire in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How DARE you!?\" she yells, her voice distorting. Realizing this, she covers her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it,\" you say. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you got me,\" says the impostor, letting her real voice show. Her eyes then turn green, and a pillar of green energy surrounds her. As it disappears, you are shocked at the impostor's true form as she stands before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer coat was charcoal black, with holes in her arms and legs. Her silky mane was a dark cerulean color, and it went down to the middle of her back. She has a long, deformed horn on her head, a black crown, and tattered wings. To top it all off, she was wearing a long black dress that looked like it's been torn up intentionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Auntie Celeste has told you about this mare, how she almost ruined the royal wedding between Shining Armor and Princess Cadance, how she led an army of love sucking creatures in an attack against Canterlot, and she looks exactly the way Celestia described her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard of you,\" you say. \"You're Chrysalis, queen of the changelings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen chuckles, \"I'm impressed,\" she says. \"Not many humans have heard of me. You're quite smart, young man, and your will is much stronger than Shining Armor's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it!\" you snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, such a lack of manners,\" says Chrysalis. \"That explains why you had the nerve to push me off the bed. You should have just made love to me. It would have been a great experience for the both of us.\" She then looks at you seductively. \"Then again, it's not too late. You are quite handsome after all, and I'm MUCH better in bed when I'm in my true form. So, would you like to become my king?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder in disgust. \"Ugh, no thanks!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis quickly becomes angry again. \"You've insulted me for the last time!\" As the queen of the changelings prepares to attack you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After another few seconds, she yawns and you check your phone for Celestia's message. Rainbow Dash is now visible and you're playing Go Fish with the changeling queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have any 8's?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-mm. Go fish,\" you reply. Rage quit occurs and she slams her cards and overthrows the table. You were finally pissed and call Rainbow Dash, now that you know it's her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, RD, just use the SRb (Sonic Rainboom) already!\" You abbreviate these things just to get some enemies out of the way already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear instantly, Rainbow finally hits Chrysalis, sending her off who knows where. At least she won't cause any more problems for you or the ponies for that matter. Speaking of which, you need to report this to Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully that teaches her not to mess with us anymore,\" Twilight says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a good thing I had Fluttershy's Harmony Element here,\" you add, taking it out from under her bed, \"well, just in the case of-- (gasp) <b>Fluttershy</b>!!!\" ithout knowing where she was, your instinctive love has made you try to see where she was and you can see that, once you come outside, she's under the bridge, in complete fear, doused with tears (it actually made her make a small river of them) and that she was tied up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy gasps when she sees you. \"(Your name)!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fluttershy!\" Your voice cracked a bit as you started to cry as well, trying your best to untie those knots. \"Oh, Fluttershy, I can't believe this happened to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugs you tightly, now happily reunited with each other.
