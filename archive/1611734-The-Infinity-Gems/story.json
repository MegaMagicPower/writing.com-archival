I'm also writing this in the second person.  With that out of the way, enjoy.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting up the Scene:  You are Jacob Alex \"Jake\" Madison, a 18 year old High School graduate, waiting for college to start.  Stuck with nothing to do during summer vacation, you are constantly bored.  You do not have any siblings.  You are not rich, but not poor.  You live outside of New York City, in a suburban town in New Jersey.  You have never been athletic, and was always bullied by the jocks in the high school.  You've tried to work out to get stronger, but nothing has worked.  You just became very skinny.  Your interests are in movies, theater and video games.  You're very excited to be going to college next year at University of the Arts in Philadelphia to study theater and dramatic acting.  You've always been part of the theater group at the school, and have made friends in that group alone.  One day when walking home from a movie, you find the stone that started it all. Now, let's begin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya Tom!\"  You yell, waving goodbye to your best friend.  He runs off, heading toward his house.  Meanwhile, you walk down the road towards yours.  It's still a couple blocks away, but not too far.  Suddenly, a small yellow stone falls in front of you.  It catches you off guard.  You wonder where it could have come from.  You look up to see if it fell out of a tree branch, but there wasn't a tree within 50 feet of you.  <i>It must have fell out of the sky</i>  You think to yourself.  You decide to pick it up to examine it.  However, you can't see it because it's too dark out.  <i>Man, I wish I had a light to see this.</i>  You wish internally.  Immediately, the stone glows yellow, and a street light appears next to you.  \"What the hell?  That was not there before!\"  You shout.  Thankfully, nobody heard you.  You continue walking home, wondering what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you enter your house, you notice that your parents are already asleep.  <i>Every time I get home when they're asleep, I wake them up.  I wish I was quieter.</i>  You thought.  The yellow stone lit up again.  Once the light dimmed, you noticed that your steps were silent.  Eerily silent.  You tried stomping really hard, and still no sound was produced.  <i>Okay, I'm confused.</i>  You think.  You walk to your room, and sit at your desk, and put the stone down.  \"Okay, it seems that whenever I wish for something with this stone, it comes true.  Let's see if this is true.\"  You say, taking a $1 bill out of your wallet.  \"I wish this was a $100 bill.\"  You wish.  The stone did not glow, and the dollar did not change.  \"What if I hold it?\"  You pick up the stone and repeat your wish.  The stone glowed, and the $1 bill became a $100 bill.  \"Okay, so I do have to hold it.  What if I put it in some kind of holder?\"  You hesitate, thinking.  \"Okay, I wish I had a watch that could house the stone.\"  The stone glowed, and a large watch appeared on your wrist.  Then, the stone broke into small pieces, and inserted itself into various indentations of the watch.  \"Now, let's see if this still works.  I wish that there was another $100 bill next to the once I wished for before.\"  Your watch glowed, and another bill appeared next to the other bill.  \"Okay, this can work.\"  You laugh as you realize the endless wishes you can grant for yourself.  \"Okay, for my first real wish, I wish I was the richest person in the world!\"  You immediately black out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up and looked at your phone.  It said noon, August 27, 2016.  \"Huh, I was out for quite a while.  Now, let's see the....\"  You stopped as you noticed how different your bedroom was.  Rather than your small bedroom with only a twin bed and a desk, you had a huge bedroom suite.  You looked down and noticed the king sized bed beneath you.  To your left was a door.  You walked through it and found yourself in a giant bathroom.  A bathtub that could fit 3 people sat in the corner.  In the other corner was a gigantic shower, big enough to fit an elephant.  You entered it and notice that it was one of those showers that had 12 jets spraying your body at the same time.  On one wall was a full body mirror, and a sink.  On the other side was the toilet.  This bathroom looked very elegant and modern.  Everything was clean, and the layout was very appealing.  You exited the bathroom and looked for other things in your room.  That's when you found your closet.  It was as big as your old bedroom.  Each wall was lined with clothing or drawers.  Everything was very neatly hung and folded.  All the clothes were designer, and it all looked very expensive.  The closet also had a dressing room with a 360 mirror.  However, you didn't want to get out of your pajamas until after you took a shower.  You exited the closet and saw a pair of doors that looked like it led into a study.  You entered it and found your study.  At the far end were windows and a stereo.  On the wall left of you was a large bookshelf that had all the plays and novels you've ever read, and many more you haven't.  On the right was a large desk with a giant desktop set up.  It was what you've always dreamed of having.  3 monitors hooked up to the most powerful hard drive money could buy.  You turned on your computer to look at its specs.  It had 64 GB of RAM, the fastest processor you could get, the best graphics cards, and multiple 16 TB SSD's.  You had no idea what you could possibly download that would require this much storage, but you liked having the extra.  You also decided to look at how rich you were.  You googled \"Jacob Madison net worth\", because surely someone of your wealth had a celebrity net worth page on them.  Sure enough, you found it.  \"Madison Family:  Net worth, $150 billion\"  (Bill Gate's is around $80 billion).  You also looked to see how much you were worth, and found that you were worth $50 billion.  Your parents did own most of the companies you make your money off.  However, you also found that you were making more than your parents annually.  Somehow, you were making $15.768 billion a year, after taxes.  Sitting next to your supercomputer was a laptop that was just as powerful.  You synced up the memory between your laptop and desktop, just in case you couldn't access your desktop.  Everything looked modern and expensive.  You liked it.  You exited the study and walked around you bedroom more.  Eventually, you came across a set of couches surrounding a coffee table, and a shelf with every good video game console you could think of, and some you couldn't.  Next to it was a room containing every game in it for each console, labeled and in alphabetical order.  EVERY GAME!  Over the console shelf was a 120\" TV with 16k resolution.  You didn't even realize that resolution existed.  In front of your bed was another TV with a Roku box.  You noticed that you'd bought every single movie and TV show on Amazon Prime Video.  \"I can get used to this life.  However, this did not solve my wimpiness.\"  You say as you look at your skinny body.  \"I wish I was the best teen athlete in the country, and had a really sexy body to match!\"  You wish, and nothing happened.  \"Oops, I don't have my watch on.\"  You laugh as you put on your watch, and repeat the wish, adding that you also wish for an awesome home gym to be added to your bedroom suite.  The watch glowed, and you black out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up on the floor exactly where you made your wish.  Your phone, which you only now realized was brand new and awesome, said that it was 1 PM.  \"Okay, I wasn't out nearly as long as last time.  I guess that when I change myself directly, I black out.  Interesting.\"  You said to yourself.  \"Either way, I want to see my new body.\"  You walked into your bathroom, and over to the full body mirror.  You took off your clothes, and revealed a body the jocks that bullied you wished they had.  You looked like you didn't have an ounce of fat on you.  6'3\", 275 lbs, and 3% body fat.  All of your muscles were huge, ripped and strong.  Your favorites were your rock hard 10 pack abs and your legs.  Your best sport was always track, so it would make sense that your legs were strong.  \"Wait, I was never on a track team, unless my reality changed with that wish as well.\"  You realized.   \"I need to see how strong this body is!\"  You yelled, flexing a 20\" bicep.  As you walked to your gym, you felt your biceps and noticed they were much harder than you were expecting.  You realized that a lot of your weight was in muscle density instead of size, so all of your muscles were very hard.  Once you made it to the gym, which was nothing special aside from the fact that it had all the equipment you could possibly need/want, you notice a chart.  It said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake's current size chart:<br>\r\nDate:  August 15th<br>\r\nHeight:  6'3\"<br>\r\nWeight:  275 lbs<br>\r\nBiceps:  20\"<br>\r\nNeck:  19\"<br>\r\nWaist:  32\"<br>\r\nChest:  53\"<br>\r\nThighs:  30\"<br>\r\nCalves:  20\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax Lifts:<br>\r\nBench:  500 lbs<br>\r\nLeg press:  850 lbs<br>\r\nLat Pull Down:  350 lbs<br>\r\nCurl:  400 lbs<br>\r\nSquat:  1000 lbs<br>\r\nDeadlift:  1100 lbs<br>\r\nMost sit ups done before fatigue:  2500<br>\r\nMost push ups done before fatigue:  1000<br>\r\nMost pull ups done before fatigue:  800<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning Stats:<br>\r\nMarathon Time:  1:45:19.26  WR<br>\r\n10k:  22:53.98  WR<br>\r\n5k:  10:17.34  WR<br>\r\nMile:  2:27.46  WR<br>\r\n1k:  1:15.68  WR<br>\r\n400m:  38.65  WR<br>\r\n100m:  8.32  WR<br>\r\nFastest speed obtained:  27 mph  WR\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have world records in like, every single running distance race.\"  You laughed.  As you walked out of the gym, you noticed something different.  On the wall next to the door to your gym, there was a large glass case.  In it, there were countless trophies and medals.  On the top shelf, you saw the 8 Olympic gold medals you won.  You got gold in all the men's running events.  \"I like this new body!\"  You laugh as you enter the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Warning, this chapter involves Homosexual themes and sex.  You have been warned.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finished showering, you put on your bathrobe and walked to your closet.  If you were going out, you were going out in style.  You decided to go with your normal summer look, designer polo, shorts and sneakers.  You also wore a hat displaying the seal of University of the Arts, the college of your choice.  Despite your new found athleticism, your passion still lies in acting.  Besides, it wasn't like you were too huge to choose any profession aside from bodybuilding, you were just strong and sexy.  After you exited the closet, you put on your watch, and walked towards the door leading out of your room.  However, something stopped you.  You felt lonely.  You decided that you'd wish yourself a boyfriend that lived with you.  He would also be really sexy, muscular and strong like you as well.  The watch glowed, and another sexy man appeared next to you.  His name was Harrison Michael Jones.  He was 6'2, a bit shorter than you, but still 260 lbs.  He had a body like yours, but more built in the upper body.  He was a climber.  Thus, you had stronger legs, while he had stronger arms.  The main common point between you two muscle wise was the 10 pack abs.  You two always worked out together.  You also wished that you two were 24, and out of college already (I don't feel like writing about college).  The watch glowed and you felt older.  You also felt sexier.  You and Harrison kissed and felt each other's ripped muscles.  Both you and Harrison were very successful Broadway and Hollywood actors, having enough range to play any role, as long as the roll needed to be as sexy as possible.  While you were still making billions of dollars a year, Harrison averages a modest $50 million a year after taxes.  Of course, the two of you are very generous people, and give at least $1 billion a year to charities.  You and him live in a mansion in Malibu, very similar to your parent's in the Hamptons, where you grew up.  They still live there, and you visit regularly.  You also have an apartment in New York for when you're on Broadway.  In fact, today, you're in NYC because your seeing Hamilton.  The tickets cost you thousands, but that was nothing.  You made that money back in seconds!  Anyway, the story picks back up at your dinner with your boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, welcome to Juniors, may I take your order?\"  A waiter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, start off with a Caesar Salad, and could I have a lobster roll?\"  You asked as you take a sip of your milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And could I have an Asian Chicken Salad and the Fried Chicken?\"  Harrison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  Are you going to see a show?\"  The waiter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're seeing Hamilton.\"  You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we'll make sure your out in time then.  Many people come here before seeing a show.\"  The waiter explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  Harrison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome.\"  The waiter responded and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy is getting a good tip.\"  You laughed as you looked at your watch.  \"Although, it's only 6, so everything should be fine.\"  You took another sip of your milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't drink too much of that.  You'll love your perfect abs to fat.\"  Harrison joked, knowing full well that your metabolisms both made it so that you couldn't physically have more than 5% body fat.  You laughed at the joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harrison, have you listened to the soundtrack yet?  I've been saving myself from listening to it.\"  You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've been too.\"  Harrison replied.  \"I've been so excited to see this.  I can't believe I'm actually seeing Hamilton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, money can't buy a sold out show without ticketmaster.\"  You smiled.  \"I've always loved this restaurant.  This is the main thing I miss about not living near New York anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, that's why I wanted to come here.  I thought it would be the perfect place to do this.\"  Harrison stood up, out of his chair, took a small box out of his pocket, and got down on one knee.  \"Jacob Alex Madison, will you marry me?\"  He opened the box and revealed the most beautiful ring you'd ever seen.  It was a silver ring with a large black diamond in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harrison, of course I will!\"  You cried as you hugged your hunky boyfriend.  \"Harrison, I love you.\"  You continued crying as you gave him a passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see a great musical.\"  Harrison smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until after I eat dinner.\"  You cry-laughed as the waiter brought you and your fiancee your salads.  \"Speak of the devil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations Mr. Madison.  Here are your salads gentlemen.  I'll ask the management if I can get you a free desert as celebration.\"  The waiter smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  Harrison responded.  \"Jake, that ring looks really good on you.  It contrasts with your perfectly tanned skin perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\"Thanks Harrison.\"  You cry more.  You take a large drink of water, not realizing how thirsty your crying made you.  You start to say that you love him again, but Harrison cuts you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, just be quiet, and try to calm your crying down.  You're not speaking very clearly right now.\"  Harrison smiled, wiping a tear off of your face.  After many minutes of you crying and Harrison trying to calm you down, your food arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were able to get you a free desert of your choice.  What would you like?\"  The waiter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we have a slice of Devil's Food Cheesecake?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"  I'll bring it out in a bit.  Enjoy your meal.\"  The waiter smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better Jake?\"  Harrison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  I need my lobstery goodness.\"  You smiled, bringing your lobster roll up to your mouth.  After your first bite, you say, \"Delicious as always.  How's your chicken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.  I love this place.\"  Harrison smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came here before every single show I saw on Broadway back when my parents used to take me.  Now, whenever my parents see one of my shows, they come here without me.  However, without fail, they always bring me a slice of cheesecake for after the show.\"  You explained, continuing to stuff your hungry face.  With all the muscle you have, you need to eat a lot.  However, your metabolism makes you never gain fat.  You could literally drink fat and not gain any fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 hour later, at the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are Harry, Box A.  I bought all the tickets just so we'd have a box to ourselves.\"  You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Jakey.\"  Jake smiled, leaning in for a kiss.  The kiss was long and passionate.  \"Let's sit down.\"  The two hunks sat down in their seats, and waited for the show to start.  After a couple of minutes, the lights faded, and the stage manager asked to silence all cell phones.  After all the announcements, violins started playing.  The musical had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was perfection.\"  Harrison stated, dumbfounded with the quality of the musical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing I got the package that allows us to talk to the cast after.\"  You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That exists?\"  Harrison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it did after I gave them $1 million and asked them to meet them.\"  You laughed as you walked out of the theater.  You stopped by the side to watch the Ham4Ham show, and then walked back into the theater.  As you made your way to the stage, the cast walked out of the wings and onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CONGRATULATIONS YOU TWO!!!\"  Lin-Manuel Miranda (Praised be he.) yelled.  \"On behalf of the cast and crew of Hamilton, we'd like to say congratulations on your engagement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twitter.\"  Phillipa Soo laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a lengthy conversation about your and Harrison's shows on Broadway, the cast congratulated you again, and you started back to your NYC apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got into your bedroom, Harrison smiled and said, \"I think we need to celebrate this the right way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what might that be?\"  You asked, knowing exactly what was about to happen.  Just as you predicted, Harrison started taking off his clothes.  You quickly followed suit.  Eventually, you were both fully naked.  Just the sight of your naked body made Harrison hard, and visa versa.  Soon, both you and Harrison were fully erect, and both a foot long.  \"Ready Harry?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready.\"  Harrison replied.  Using your immense strength, you effortlessly lifted Harrison's muscular body, and placed him on your penis.  You held him tightly, feeling his hard abs with your hands.  \"Do you want me to flex them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"  The abs got even harder.  \"They feel like they could stop a bullet.\"  You moaned.  The sex happened, and in the end, there was cum everywhere.  You put the watch back on.  \"I wish the cum was gone.\"  The cum vanished.  Harrison knew all about the watch, and you'd made sure only you could wish using it.  \"Harrison, that was great.  I love you.\"  You said as you fell asleep naked in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too.\"  Harrison said, falling asleep naked spooning you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules for Continuing this Story:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarn people if there is any content in your story that some may find offensive.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Before I start, I'd like to amend a mistake from the last chapter.  For the Leg Press, I screwed up the weight.  Instead of 850 lbs, it should be 2100 lbs.  How did I screw up that badly?  I DON'T KNOW!  Also, homosexual themes.  Anyway, enjoy.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was a great shower!\"  You smiled, exiting the shower and wrapping a towel around your muscular body.  As you dried yourself off, you noticed a small blue gem on the ground near you.  Aside from the color, it was identical to the yellow gem you'd found last night.  \"Huh, I guess that there are more of those gems.  I wonder what this one does...\"  You picked up the gem, and it glowed a brilliant blue.  Immediately, you felt your mind fill with information.  \"Wow, I feel really smart.  Like I know everything!  Huh.  This is the Mind Gem, from the Marvel Universe.  That yellow one must have been the Reality Gem.  If I can find all six, I'll become a God.  I need those gems.\"  You explained to yourself.  \"But for now, I need to get dressed.\"  You finished drying off your muscular body, left the bathroom and walked over to your closet.  Once you entered, you tried to find the best outfit for the day.  Because it was a hot day, you decided to go out in a designer polo, blue shorts and flip flops.  After putting on the clothing, you walked to the mirror room to check how you looked.  You felt like you were sexiness incarnate.  Then again, the only reason People Magazine had not named you sexiest man alive yet was because you were too young.  You should know, they told you.  After checking yourself out, which included a lot of flexing, you put on your watch.  \"Before I leave, I think I need to do a couple of things.  First, I wish I had a net worth and money available for spending calculator in my room, similar to the debt calculator in NYC.\"  The watch glowed and a large board appeared on the wall by your study.  There were two numbers on it.  The top one said $55,000,000,000 and was rising at $500 per second.  You figured that this was your net worth.  The bottom number said $13,000,000,000 and was growing at $200 per second.  This was the amount of money you had readily available to you.  \"Next, I wish that the blue gem was also part of my watch.\"  The watch glowed again, and some of the yellow gem's parts turned blue.  \"Finally, I wish to the only one who can see the watch glow when I make a wish.\"  The watch glowed, and you noticed nothing.  However, the power of the blue gem let you know that it did work.  \"Time to go out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked out of your room for the first time and found yourself in the main hallway of your 6 bedroom, 9 bathroom, 3 story house.  Across the hall was your parent's room.  It was very similar to yours, just bigger and more their style.  You continued walking through the house, which was more like a mansion.  You eventually made it to the staircase.  There was one up, and one down.  The upstairs was mainly guest rooms and butler's/maid's rooms.  The middle floor mainly contained your room, your parents' room, and a large meeting room your parents held meetings in.  Downstairs was a large living room, kitchen, dining room, rec room and theater.  The basement was mostly storage, the main gym, and the garage, which contained many million dollar cars.  The car you mainly drove was a blue Mercedes Benz SL65 AMG (~$220,000).  You loved that car.  You were feeling very hungry, seeing how you still haven't eaten since you woke up, so you went to kitchen to make yourself breakfast.  When you got there, you noticed your butler waiting for you.  \"Master Jacob, what would you like today for breakfast?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me the usual Gerard.\"  You responded.  Your usual was a 3 egg omelet with cheese, onion, pepper and bacon, 2 sausages, buttered toast, cereal, and a bowl of fruit.  Your muscles needed a lot of fuel after all.  As you sat waiting for your meal, you looked out the window to your backyard.  It had a large deck with a lot of backyard furniture, a large pool, a hot tub, a gazebo, and a fire pit.  There were also changing rooms for the pool.  The pool was amazing.  It was designed to blend in with the surrounding rocks, and had many natural water slides.  It also had a diving board and a high dive.  Aside from being the youngest Olympic runner to win the gold, you were also a great swimmer, despite your large and muscular build.  Maybe you'd take a swim after your date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Jacob, your breakfast.\"  Gerard said in his normal monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Gerard.\"  You thanked him.  Gerard was always a great cook.  That's why you pay him so much.  You took one bite of your food, and felt like you were in heaven.  Old poor Jake would have killed for a meal like this, but for new rich Jake, this was the norm.  Five star meals were the average standard for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finished your delicious meal, you got up to head out.  You never worried about eating too much because your metabolism prevented you from gaining fat.  You were meeting your boyfriend at his mansion for a movie.  \"Mom!  Dad!  I'm going to Ollie's place.  I'll be back soon!\"  You yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Jacob!  See you when you get back!  Drive safely!\"  Your mother yelled.  You grabbed your keys, and went to the garage, where your Mercedes was waiting.  You got in, and drove to your boyfriend's mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, you arrived at your boyfriend's mansion.  You drove up to the gate, and put in the code to open it.  You knew the code because your boyfriend gave it to you.  Finally, the gate opened, and you drive down the driveway.  Your boyfriend was waiting in front of the front door for you.  His name was Oliver Watkins.  He was very similar to you.  Billionaire, 18, ridiculously sexy, muscular, and a gold winning Olympic athlete.  He was a gymnast, so he was much slimmer than you.  However, that did not make him small.  He was 6'2\", and 200 pounds.  Plus, he was extremely strong for his size.  You have to be to be a gymnast.  Anyway, his net worth was about $20,000,000,000.  \"Jakey!  What took you so long?\"  Oliver yelled happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ollie, I slept in.\"  You smiled exiting your car.  \"Get over here big guy.\"  Oliver ran to you and gave you a strong hug and a passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in, the movie's waiting!\"  Oliver motioned you to come into the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Felicia!\"  You said to Oliver's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jake!  I've never seen Oliver so impatient.\"  She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sorry?\"  You asked confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your here now!\"  She continued laughing.  \"You know what they say..  Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"  You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jakey!  Get over here!\"  Oliver yelled from his movie theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming Ollie!\"  You yelled, running to the theater.  When you got there, you noticed that he was playing \"The Loser\", a movie that wasn't even out in commercial theaters yet.  \"Where did you get this?\"  You asked confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know people.  I wanted our one year anniversary to be special.  After this is done, we're going out for dinner in La Parina.\"  Oliver explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oliver, you are amazing.  I hope this relationship never ends.\"  You smiled, almost crying.  When you said that, you noticed your watch glow yellow.  <i>I guess wishing isn't the only way to make the gem work.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, ready?\"  Oliver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"  You and Oliver sat down one of the couches in the theater.  Oliver eventually laid down on your abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love your abs.\"  He smiled as he rubbed his hands on your hard abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love yours too!\"  You laughed as you rubbed his equally hard 10 pack.  His abs were your favorite muscles on his muscular body.  Even without flexing, they were rock hard.  But, once you or Oliver flexed your abs, they truly became rock hard.  \"Shhh.  The movie's starting!\"  The movie started, and you became silent.  Oliver even stopped rubbing your abs, which he almost never does!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a great movie.\"  You said.  \"Like, Oscar worthy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I'd have to agree.  Anyway, how much longer do you want to wait until dinner?\"  Oliver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say about an hour.  I ate right before coming here.\"  You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do until then?\"  Oliver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shirtless workout?\"  You proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"  Oliver responded, walking towards his gym.  As you entered it, you noticed a chart similar to yours.  It read;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oliver's current size chart:<br>\r\nDate: August 15th<br>\r\nHeight: 6'2\"<br>\r\nWeight: 200 lbs<br>\r\nBiceps: 19\"<br>\r\nNeck: 17\"<br>\r\nWaist: 30\"<br>\r\nChest: 45\"<br>\r\nThighs: 23\"<br>\r\nCalves: 17\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax Lifts:<br>\r\nBench: 375 lbs<br>\r\nLeg press: 1200 lbs<br>\r\nLat Pull Down: 300 lbs<br>\r\nCurl: 300 lbs<br>\r\nSquat: 600 lbs<br>\r\nDeadlift: 675 lbs<br>\r\nMost sit ups done before fatigue: 3000<br>\r\nMost push ups done before fatigue: 1200<br>\r\nMost pull ups done before fatigue: 1000\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that he was weaker than you, and that you had some of the strongest legs in the world, but the difference was staggering.  However, you knew he was much more endurance based, proven by his \"before fatigue\" stats.  Anyway, you and Oliver began to work out in the gym without your shirts, but it quickly became a flexing/muscle worship show for both of you.  After you and him showered together, and did some other stuff, you got ready to leave to go to the restaurant.  La Parina was the nicest Italian restaurant within 20 miles, and one of the most expensive.  As you and him drove to the restaurant, you bean debating whether to tell Oliver about the gems or not.  Do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules for continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will find all the gems at some point.<br>\r\nIf you are going to have any adult content, put a bold disclaimer at the top of the chapter.<br>\r\nProper grammar and spelling!<br>\r\nMake a creative title.<br>\r\nActually progress the story along.<br>\r\nDon't kill any main characters.<br>\r\nHave fun!</span></div></div>",

Turn back if offended.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ollie?\"  You asked in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"  He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something I need to tell you.\"  You started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Ollie said confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know my watch?\"  You asked, holding up your wrist.  \"It's very special.  In the Marvel Comic universe, there are these six stones called the Infinity Gems.  They grant the wielder incredible power.  Each one does something different.  Somehow, they made their way into ours and have chosen me to find them.  I've already found two.  The Reality and Mind gems.  The mind gem basically made me all-knowing and gave me telepathy.  However, the interesting thing is the Reality gem.  I can grant any and all of my wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you telling me this?\"  Ollie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three reasons.  Number one, I trust you more than anyone else.  Number two, if I find all six, I will become a god.  Flat out.  And I will make you one as well.  Third, my life did not exist like this yesterday.  Yesterday, I was a regular middle class wimp.  I make more in ten minutes now than my whole family did in two years before my wishes.  I basically wished for a perfect life for myself.  I was fed up with my old one.  Now, look at me!  I'm a huge, sexy, ripped, muscular, Olympic-gold winning athlete with more money than I know what to do with, and a boyfriend who fits the same description.  What could be better!\"  You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.  So, I'm part of your perfect world?\"  Ollie started to cry tears of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.  And, when I said that I hoped our relationship would never end, my watch reacted and granted it.  Seriously, ask me to wish anything, and I'll make it happen!\"  You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Ollie wiped the tears away.  \"I wish that our bodyguards were not following us so closely.\"  Ollie turned around and saw the bodyguard's car almost tailgating.  Immediately, the watch glowed, and the car fell back.  \"Whoa, it glowed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By me telling you that you could make a wish, I allowed you to notice the glow, and notice the change.  Nobody else will notice the changes unless we want them to.  However, I have to approve all wishes.  That is until we become gods.\"  You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm excited.\"  Ollie laughed.  \"Wait, why can't you wish for the gems?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They need to be found legitimately.  All I know is that they're within 10 miles of my place, and only gem-bearers and those they're with, you, will notice them.  We need to find them.  Omnipotence is waiting.\"  You rambled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, but for now, let's have a great dinner.\"  Ollie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn undisclosed amount of time later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  You said to the valet.  \"Well, here we are!  La Parina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.  Let's go.\"  Ollie stated.  You and him walked into the extravagant restaurant.  It was spacious, well decorated, and had aroma of wealth to it.  This is where only the most upper class can go.  Much like you and Oliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Benvenuto.  Welcome to La Parina.  Will it be just you two?\"  The host asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  It's our one year anniversary.\"  Oliver explained.  It was his idea after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  One moment please.\"  The host started looking in his books for open tables.  \"Would you like a private room?  It will be $50 extra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please.\"  Oliver responded.  In the time it took him to say it, you and him made $750.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.  Follow me.\"  The host left his podium and started walking.  You and Oliver followed him to a large, opulent room with a single two-person table in it.  You bodyguards sat outside the room at the table nearest to it.  You were paying for the bodyguards' meals as well.  The host sat you and Oliver down, gave you menus, and left to continue his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the life.\"  You smiled as you opened your menu.  As you read the choices, you felt your stomach grumble violently.  You were very hungry.  As you read it over, you noticed a prix-fixe 6-course meal for $350.  As you made your selections, you stomach began grumbling harder.  You even had to grab it.  \"Ollie, I'll be right back.\"  You said as you got up.  \"Bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you in a bit.  What do you want to drink?\"  Oliver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a bottle of Fiano.  I'm getting shellfish.  Just give me a minute.\"  You responded, rushing into the bathroom.  Once you got in, you took your shirt off, and looked at your stomach.  Your abs were still as perfect as usual, but they had a strange color to them.  A bizarre red glow to them.  After a minute, the red glow became stronger, and the pain got worse.  After a minute, your whole torso was red and in pain.  Eventually, your whole body glowed red and throbbed.  However, the red and the pain went away.  Once it was all gone, a small red gem fell into your hand.  You realized that this was the Power gem, and put it into your watch.  You then put your shirt back on, after feeling your abs once again, and left the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened in there?\"  Oliver asked in a concerned manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found the Power gem.  The pain was me absorbing its power.  Anyway, did I miss anything?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I ordered the wine and water.\"  Oliver replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ollie.\"  You leaned over to kiss him.  \"Now, back to ordering.\"  You stared at the menu, deciding which dishes to order.  By the time the waiter came back with your wine, you were ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to order?\"  The waiter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Can I have the six course meal?\"  Oliver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  Which courses?\"  The waiter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Prosciutto, Bolognese, Veal Parmigiana, Caesar Salad, the Fresh Mozzarella, and the Golden Truffles.\"  Oliver answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truffles will cost $1,000 extra.  Is that alright?\"  The waiter clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"  Oliver smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.  What would you like sir?\"  The waiter turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll also have the prix-fixe.  Bruschetta, Spaghetti Carbonara, Grilled Scallops, Chef Salad, Provolone, and the Special Macaroons.\"  You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Special Macaroons?  That's our most expensive item here!  That'll cost an extra $5,000!\"  The waiter stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes them so expensive?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, both of your deserts are made out of edible gold, and one of the macaroons has a diamond in it.\"  The waiter answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.  I'll have that then.\"  You smiled.  The waiter smiled and left.  \"$7,500 meal.  Not bad.\"  ($800 wine)  You lifted your wine glass, and Oliver raised his.  \"To our lives, our bodies, our wealth, and our relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To that!\"  Oliver responded, clinking the glasses, finishing the toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner was fantastic.  You ate every single morsel, and loved every bit.  It was the greatest meal your rich self had ever had, and that was saying something.  When you and Oliver were finished, you left a $1,500 tip, got your car from the valet, gave him $50, and left.  That night, you and him spent close to $12,000.  But, with a daily earning of $64,800,000, that was petty cash.  It was 8:00, the sun was down, and you were driving back to his place.  You and Oliver both lived in the Hamptons, had penthouse suites in NYC and Los Angeles, and private islands.  Your's and Oliver's were right next to each other.  Oliver decided that he wanted to stay the night with you at your place.  So you were dropping him off so he could get his stuff together, and then he would drive to your place.  Your at home, putting on your bathing suit.  You and Ollie are going for a swim.  However, you just remembered your discovery.  \"So, this gem is supposed to give me immense strength.  Let's test this.\"  You walked into your gym, and noticed your size chart.  500 lbs on the bench.  You walked over to the barbell, and put all the weight that could fit on it on.  The bar weighed 1,500 lbs, 3 times your max.  You gripped the bar, and lifted it like it was paper.  You were able to hold it in one hand without any effort.  Then, you said that you didn't want to be that strong, and the weight became heavy.  You were able to control whether the red gem was active or not.  You decided that you did not want it active right now, and would just have your normal, still incredible, strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BZZZ</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm in your room went off.  \"Hello?  Who's at the door?\"  You asked condescendingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me silly.\"  Ollie's voice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be down in a second.\"  You responded.  You ran downstairs, only wearing a speedo and your watch.  You opened the door to find Oliver standing with a bag full of clothes.  \"Do you have your speedo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do.\"  Oliver smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\"  You motioned him to follow you to your pool.  Oliver followed you, only to watch your muscular legs working on moving your muscular body.  Once you got to your backyard, you told Oliver to change into it.</span></div></div>",

I've got to try this more!\"  Jake excitedly hurried off to find his wallet.  In it, he found a $20 bill, and put it on his desk.  \"I wish this was $2000 dollars.\"  The stone glowed in his hand, and the $20 bill became 20 $100 dollar bills.  \"Okay, what else can I wish for?  I know, I wish I was the richest person alive!\"  The stone glowed in his hand, and everything changed.  His small bedroom became a large opulent room.  His twin sized bed became a king.  His desk disappeared, and was replaced with a 120\" TV with every game console and game he could think of.  To the left of him was a set of doors that led to a large bathroom with everything a bathroom could need.  Next to the bathroom was a large walk in closet with designer clothing, averaging $1000 per article.  To his right was another door leading to a large study with the most powerful computer money could buy.  The computer had 3 monitors for maximum gaming potential.  The computer sat on a large mahogany desk with drawers for everything possible.  Behind it was a large bookshelf full of all of Jake's favorite books, novels and plays.  Finally, the large balcony of his bedroom allowed him to see the beach of his new palace.  Plus, since he was going to college near his house, he would not need to move out.  Jake moved to his study, where he logged onto his computer to see his bank account.  He put in his account number, and checked his accounts.  \"$4,000,000,000 in my checking account, $6,500,000,000 for my credit card, and $40,000,000,000 in investments.  This could not get better, or can it?  No matter how rich I am, I'm still a weakling.  That needs to change.  I wish I've always been a muscular and ripped teen, and that I was the sexiest person in the world!\"  The stone glowed a brilliant yellow, and Jake felt his body start changing.  The fat on his body seemingly melted away and was replaced with lean, large and defined muscles.  His flat stomach became a perfect 8 pack that could cause anyone to salivate.  His legs became large and muscular, looking like an Olympic runner's.  His pecs burst out, leaving a shadow on his perfect abs.  His biceps became 20\" monsters, with horseshoe shaped triceps to round it out.  His pale skin became tanned and blemish-less.  Finally, Jake's face slimmed down, created a sexy jawline and beautiful face.  Jake was the sexiest person ever, according to his wish.  \"I look so good!\"  Jake yelled, caressing his new body.  \"However, I should probably do something about this stone.  It's annoying to always hold it...  I know.  I wish this stone was part of a ring I always wear!\"  The stone glowed, and shrunk down.  Meanwhile, a small gold ring formed around his ring finger.  It had a spot for a stone, but it was empty, for one second.  The yellow stone stuffed itself into the slot, filling it snugly.  \"There, perfect.  Now let's see what this bod can do!\"  Jake exclaimed as he flexed his abs.  Even when not flexing, his as were well defined.  But when he was, they looked like they could stop a bullet.  \"I wish my bedroom suite also had a fully equipped gym!\"  His ring glowed, and an new door appeared next to the bathroom door.  \"Let's go in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake stepped into the room, he noticed that it looked like no other gym.  Rather than looking like a typical gym full of equipment, people and trainers, this looked more private and extravagant.  Mirrors lined an entire wall, another wall had another large TV, as well as a high-tech stereo for when he wanted to listen to music.  the final wall was a giant rack with dumbbells ranging from 10 to 200 pounds.  In the middle was all the equipment a gym-rat would need.  All gold too.  \"I wonder how much this would cost.\"  As soon as he said this, the TV showed '$15,000,000'.  \"Oh, that's nothing.  My private jet cost ten times that!\"  (It costs more)  Jake exclaimed.  His rich lifestyle was getting to him.  Even though he just wished this, reality already changed for him.  \"Anyway, with that out of the way, let's see what these can do.\"  Jake said, flexing as many muscles as he could.  He started with the bench press.  He put 180 pounds onto the 45 pound bar.  \"225 seems like a good amount to start with.\"  He was wrong, as he found the bar too light.  \"Wow, that was too easy.  Let's put 180 more on.  405 seems like enough.\"  It was.  He was benching 405 pounds.  \"Ha!  Who's the wimp now!  Not this kid!\"  He yelled cockily.  \"Now let's see what these Olympic legs can get me.\"  He ventured over to the treadmill, where he set the speed to 15mph.  Anyone else's sprinting speed.  However, Jake was not like everyone else.  His muscles were stronger than the average muscles.  His legs continued the 15mph like nothing.  \"Okay, Usain Bolt ran 28mph, can I run that?\"  He set the treadmill to 28mph, and started running.  It wasn't long until he needed to change the speed to 30 to feel fatigued.  \"I just ran faster than the fastest man alive for a longer period of time.  I am awesome!\"  Jake panted, recently finishing a 2 minute mile.  \"I'm tired.  I think I'll take a relaxing shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower was huge.  It was one of those showers that has 6 different places where the water comes out, and washes your whole body at once.  During his shower, he noticed something different about his body.  During his becoming sexiest person ever, he did not notice what had happened to his mid region.  Even soft, it was longer than it was before.  \"How did I not notice this when working out.  I must have been paying to close attention to my guns to notice this!  I think this shower may go a little longer than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 minutes later, Jake exited the shower, but not after measuring himself.  250lbs, 3.5% body fat, 21\" biceps, 60\" chest, 35\" waist, 12\" you know what, 45\" thighs, and 26\" calves.  He was a monster.  Jake put on his vicu\u00f1a wool bathrobe, ($13,000) and headed off to his designer closet.  In it, he saw a myriad of expensive clothes, whether it be t-shirts, jeans or suits, everything looked expensive.  He decided to put on a polo and jeans with his diamond watch, wish ring, and leather shoes.  He looked like $1,000,000, mainly because his outfit cost that much.  It was mostly the watch.  After all that, he looked at his $900,000 watch, and saw it was 4:30.  About time.  He was about to leave for his private island.  He completely forgot.  He packed his bags full with his clothes, and left his palace of a bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of navigation, he finally made it to the runway on his estate.  His parents were not going with him, seeing how they both had important meeting.  That's what happens when your parent founded and own 50% of the world's largest store chain.  As Jake headed towards his plane, he noticed other aircraft in the hangar.  He'd completely forgotten about the other planes his family had.  They each had one to themselves, one family plane that could take 15 people, and 2 helicopters.  As he stepped towards the plane, he noticed someone running towards him.  It was his best friend Vincent.  Vincent was not quite as buff and sexy as Jake, but he was close.  Athletic as he was charming, Vincent was also ridiculously rich.  His parents became billionaires through smart investing and founding an extremely successful holding company.  Together, the two teenagers were worth close to $80,000,000,000.  \"Vincent!  Took you long enough!\"  Jake yelled at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, tell that to our architects, it takes me an hour to get to your runway, and we live next to each other!\"  Vincent joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm glad you can come to my island with me.  It's so boring alone with my servants.  I need my workout buddy!\"  Jake joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I get terribly bored on mine when my parents are gone.  Absolutely dreadful.\"  Vincent said without a shred of sarcasm.  \"Anyway, let's get on the plane already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you.\"  Jake replied politely.  Vincent boarded the plane, immediately followed by Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you, the reader, thought that things didn't get more opulent than Jake's room, then you'd be wrong.  This plane had everything.  A fully equipped bar, leather upholstery on the seats, a large bathroom, a bedroom, multiple TVs, a guest room, a lounge, and a wallpaper lined with gold.  There was a two 2 person tables with large comfortable seats on either side, and some priceless paintings, some valued at over $100,000,000.  This price meant nothing to Jake though.  He's made that much in a month, after taxes.  The jet was valued at $1,700,000,000, and was the second most expensive one in his family, after the largest one.  \"Vincent, better sit down, we're taking off soon.  Want a drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, give me a gin and tonic on the rocks.\"  Vincent replied while checking his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bartender, a gin and tonic on the rocks, and one martini.\"  Jake ordered.  \"You know Vincent, you're my best friend.  Something happened to me earlier today, and you're the only person I trust to tell right now.  Oh, our drinks our done, come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teen grabbed their drinks, (I know that the drinking age is 21.  They don't care, they're rich) and headed into the lounge.  When they got there, Jake turned on the TV, put on one of the movies the two of them starred in, and sat on the couch.  \"See this ring?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your yellow diamond ring?  Yeah, you've worn that ever since I met you.  What about it?\"  Vincent replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no ordinary ring.  This stone grants wishes.  I found it earlier today, and wished for this life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit.  Prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See my martini?  I wish it was on the rocks, I usually ask for that and forgot.\"  Jake said as the stone began to glow.  Immediately after, Jake's martini glass added some ice cubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\"  Vincent screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  In my old life, I was always bullied.  I was a wimp who could barely afford college.  My parents borrowed money from almost my whole family to pay for my first year of tuition.  However...</span></div></div>",

Don't complain to me about it.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However much money we borrowed though, it wasn't enough.  Tired of this miserable life, I prayed for a better one.  The next day, I found this, and wished for this life.  I've never been happier.\"  Jake finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this ring caused all this?\"  Vincent asked, motioning around the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.  All of it.  I asked to be the richest person alive, the sexiest person alive, and for this ring.\"  Jake said, holding out his ring.  \"So, do you want to make a wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of do.  Since you trusted me with that, I'll trust you with this little nugget of information  I'm not sure you knew this, but I'm actually gay, and have had a crush on you ever since I saw you workout for the first time.  Can we be more than friends?\"  Vincent begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly Vincent, I don't need the ring for that.\"  Jake laughed.  \"I am too, and have had a crush on you too since I saw you work out that one time.  I've been too scared to ask you, seeing as I didn't know you were gay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it that's the case, can you buff me up a bit?  You're so hot Jake.\"  Vincent begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Vincent was as sexy and buff as me, but in a different way!  That way we're not identical.\"  Jake wished.  Vincent's muscles bulged a bit more, and soon, the friends were equal in musculature.  Then, Vincent's face and skin changed to a tanner and sexier version of himself.  \"Wow Vincent, you're so hot.  After we take off, I think we have some clothes to take off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're right.  Here's to a new and better life.\"  Vincent chuckled, raising his glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's to a new and better life indeed.\"  Jake raised his, they clinked glasses, and drank, finishing the toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for takeoff, angel?\"  Vincent asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready when you are, hunk.\"  Jake replied.  The two laughed as the jet revved up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to my room.\"  Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay angel.\"  Vincent said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you keep calling me angel?\"  Jake inquired as they headed towards the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because those looks only come from heaven.\"  Vincent replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cliche, but in this case, true.\"  Jake laughed as he held up his ring.  \"Okay, here's the bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, let's get close.\"  Vincent suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on.  Let me go to the bathroom.\"  Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be waiting angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake went to the bathroom, and made a silent wish stating that no matter what, Vincent would not break up with him.  The bathroom lit up to a beautiful yellow, and nothing changed.  Jake wanted to make absolutely sure nothing would go wrong.  \"Sorry, just needed to pee!  I'll be out in a sec...  All done.\"  Jake left the bathroom, only to find Vincent laying naked on his bed.  Just like Jake, Vincent didn't need to flex to have his muscles look perfect.  And just like Jake, his penis grew in the growth process.  Foot long just like Jake's.  Jake immediately tore off his clothing, and got on the bed with Vincent.  \"Honestly, I think we could use a tad more muscle, just make our abs 10 packs instead of 8.  What do you say?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have nothing wrong with that.\"  Vincent replied eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish we were more muscular, ripped and hung.  Enough to make our abs 10 packs.\"  Jake wished.  It came true.  Both of them grew a bit.  Jake figured that his biceps grew 2 inches, he gained around 25 pounds, and his cock grew to 15\" inches hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kinky.  I like that.  Let's feel up this body.\"  Vincent smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if I can feel yours.\"  Jake replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two muscled teens flexed for each other while the other felt the muscles.  They were big and rock hard.  Even with their strength, the muscles barely dented.  Meanwhile, their cocks grew to their full 15\".  \"Oh, my cock, it's erupting.\"  Vincent yelled as he came all over himself, Jake and the bed.  After about a pint of seed came out of Vincent, Jack erupted.  His cum covered his pecs and abs, and Jake just rubbed it in.  The warm, sticky liquid felt good on his hard muscles.  Soon, Vincent began rubbing his.  \"All I know is that this will be hell to clean up.\"  Vincent joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not with this it won't!\"  Jake yelled, holding the ring.  \"But what's the rush?\"  He continued playing with his cum, his penis shrinking back down to its 7\" resting size.  Vincent meanwhile started flexing his abs, trying to figure out how much cum he could fit in each crevasse.  The answer was a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later, the two boys were done playing in the cum, and Jake wished for all the cum to be cleaned up.  \"I would take a bath, but there's no way to put a bath on this plane.  Even with the ring, it just would not make sense.  I think I need another drink.\"  Jake stated as he put his clothes back on.  \"We will continue our escapades on the island.  For now, make yourself comfortable, with clothes on.\"  Vincent complied and started putting his clothes back on.  Jake went back to the bar, and asked for another martini, this time on the rocks.  Once he got the drink, he made his way to the lounge, where <i>The Forgotten Son</i> was just ending.  Jake had forgotten that he put that on.  For his and Vincent's first movie, it wasn't bad.  It got a 87% on Rotten Tomatoes, and got them both Oscar nominations.  Vincent for lead, and Jake for supporting.  Both of them lost, but for a debut, not bad.  Jake took that movie out, and wondered what else he could play.  He was thinking The Graduate.  Martini in hand, Jake scrolled through Amazon Prime until he found the movie he was looking for.  He put it on, and relaxed.  Life was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, we are about an hour from the island.  Is there anything you need of me?\"  Timothy, Jake's personal valet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Timothy, I'm fine.\"  Jake replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Vincent?\"  Timothy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're fine.\"  Vincent politely refused.  Jake and Vincent were sitting at one of the two tables, eating a 5 star meal.  Jake's chef, Chef Bobby Prudhomme, was one of the absolute finest in the country, and Jake hired him for this trip.  Currently, Jake and Vincent were eating Bobby's favorite recipe, mixed seafood over a bed of fresh pasta in a light garlic and butter sauce.  While somewhat fattening, Jake and Vincent's metabolisms are some of the best in the world.  They couldn't have more than 4% body fat if they tried.  \"Jake, where did you find this guy?  He's great.  The pasta is so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents hired him for one of my birthdays a couple years ago.  Remember the one when I got this jet?  I think it was that one.\"  Jake responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.  The food during that one was great.  I think it was your 15<sup>th</sup> birthday.  I got my get when I was 15 too.\"  Vincent replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember, I was one of the people in the inaugural flight.  It didn't have anything in it yet.  We just sat in regular chairs and flew around for an hour.  That was fun.\"  Jake recollected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my jet is so good now.  Almost as good as this one.  I may have to steal some of your decorating ideas.\"  Vincent joked.  \"I'm kidding.  Mine is perfect for me.  Yours is perfect for you.  Everyone is happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, anyway, time for desert.  I think Bobby has something special for us.\"  Jake said excitedly.  \"Here it comes.\"  Jake pointed to Timothy holding 2 slices of golden cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your desert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Timothy.  Vincent, this cake is made with edible gold.  Not food coloring.\"  Jake explained.  \"This slice of cake is worth $1,000.  Petty cash, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"  Vincent chortled as they ate their cake.  An enormous fee for any other people, but only cost 0.0000025% of their combined wealth.  \"I love being rich.\"  Vincent laughed as he drank his champagne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.  Vincent, how much do you make per second?\"  Jake inquired.  \"I personally make about $200 per second.  Amounting to $6,307,200,000 annually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I make about $190 per second, amounting to $5,991,840,000 annually.  Why?\"  Vincent wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just curious.  I don't mean to sound self-centered, but I was wondering how much richer my wish made me than you.  For contextual purposes.\"  Jake explained.  \"It seems that 5% was the answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  That ring can sure do a lot of stuff.\"  Vincent stated.  \"It can do anything.\"  He hesitated.  \"Jake, can you make us rings to show our relationship?  I think we should have matching rings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a great idea.  I wish we both had matching rings with the central stone being 24 carats of the most expensive stone in the world, surrounded by smaller studs of pure flawless diamond.\"  The yellow ring began to glow, and two rings appeared on the table.  \"Here they are.  It seems that the central stone is a 24 carat pink star diamond, and it has 5 more carats of regular diamond, made with a 24 carat gold ring base.  It's even engraved with our names.  These rings are worth $33,613,297 each.\"  Jake grabbed his ring, and put it on his right ring finger, putting the wish ring on the left.  Vincent followed suit, putting the ring on his right ring finger.  \"Here's to a beautiful relationship.\"  Jake said, holding up his champagne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's to.\"  Vincent replied, clinking the glasses, drinking, and then kissing Jake, ending the toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Options for continuing the story:  Don't feel shy to add on!<br>\r\nOption 1:  Antics on the Island.  Jake and Vincent test out their new bodies in the private gym, and have more fun in bed.<br>\r\nOption 2:  Using the power of the ring, Jake and Vincent decide to become superheroes.  Both have the same powers, but Jake is more strength oriented while Vincent is more speed/agility oriented.  Both can still kick serious ass though.  They find crimes to solve, and have fun doing it. </b></span></div></div>",

Please make sure you are secure for landing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, where is your island?  It must be much farther away than mine.\"  Vincent inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  About 100 miles west of Hawaii.\"  Jake responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder why this flight took so long.  Mine is in the Gulf of Mexico.  Much closer.\"  Vincent laughed.  \"When we get to your Island, what are we going to do?  Aside from workout and have copious amounts of sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a surprise, and you'll like it hunky.\"  Jake replied, squeezing Vincent's large bicep, noticing how hard it was despite it not being flexed.  Vincent responded by fondling Jake's 10 pack abs, feeling the ridges go up and down.  \"You're so hot Vincent.  I can't wait for your surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your so fucking hot too Jake.  Just looking at you is enough to make any person cum.\"  Vincent replied flirtatiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it for the island.\"  Jake laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes of non-stop flirting later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Vincent grabbed their bags and descended the stair of the plane.  \"Welcome to the Danforth Archipelago.\"  Jake smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You own this whole Archipelago?\"  Vincent questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.  My island is Dolphin Key, and the other islands are owned by the rest of my family.\"  Jake explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many islands are there?\"  Vincent asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4.\"  Jake answered.  \"Doesn't your family also own an archipelago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Our islands are in a very big archipelago with like, 20 islands.  A couple of other people own other islands in ours.  We call it the Golden Isles, seeing how about 5 different families call the islands there's.\"  Vincent explained.  \"Anyway, I want this surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, once we put our bags in my room, I'll give you the surprise.  Follow me.\"  Jake motioned Vincent to follow him into the large mansion on the island.  As they entered Jake's room, it seemed smaller than his suite in his usual house.  Granted, it was still huge.  A king sized bed was directly opposite the door into the room.  The room also had a large TV surrounded by couches, with a large coffee table in the middle.  On the left wall was a door leading into the large bathroom.  It had a corner bathtub that could fit 3 people, or 2 large muscular teenagers, a giant shower similar to the one he has in his American home.  The sink was adorned with a golden faucet, made from pure 24 carat gold.  Next to the bathroom was a large gym, similar to Jake's home gym.  However, since his wish, the weights have increased, with dumbbells weighing up to 500 pounds.  Next to the gym was a large walk in closet, with space to put any clothes that Jake would bring to the island.  The mansion itself was over 30,000 square feet, 2,000 just being Jake's master suite.  This was Jake's island after all.  There were 8 other bedrooms, a large kitchen, a large living room where all the guests could relax, and 12 full bathrooms, including one for every bedroom.  Overall, a giant mansion.  Still the smallest one that the Danforth family owns though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my room.\"  Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad.  Anyway, where's my surprise?\"  Vincent asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here.\"  Jake said, and motioned Vincent to follow.  \"Rules of my island.  When only myself and my significant other, in this case, you, are here, there are no clothes allowed.  Only servants can wear clothes.  Do you know what that means?  It means that we will be naked for the next week.  My parents won't be here, so there's nothing to worry about.  Anyway, let's get down to business.  I need to work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's do it together.\"  Vincent suggested as he finished taking off his clothes, his penis becoming erect immediately.  \"I feel so free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do too.  Let's see what our new bodies can do!\"  The muscular naked teen motioned Vincent to follow him into the gym, where he (Jake) took a 300 lb dumbbell and started curling it in his right hand.  \"It's too easy.  I need the 500.\"  Jake took the 500 pound weight and started curling it.  \"Still too easy.  I wish that I had dumbbells that could challenge me!\"  His ring began to glow, and the dumbbell rack expanded, allowing weights of 1 ton on the rack.  \"I knew I wished for more muscle, but I didn't realize that it made my muscle tissue stronger!\"  He took the one ton weight, and began curling it.  He could barely get a rep.  Meanwhile. Vincent was benching 3 tons like it weighed nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit we're strong!  I feel like I can bench a car!\"  Vincent yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We probably could.  I wish there were cars and trucks in here to use as weights.\"  Jake wished.  The ring glowed, and the room expanded.  Soon, there were small and large cars in the room.  Jake laid under one, and started benching it.  It was too easy.  \"Vincent, how much does it say this car weighs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5 tons.\"  Vincent replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vincent, we're the strongest people on the planet.  I love this!\"  Jake yelled.  The thought of being this strong made his cock erect and ready to cum.  \"Vincent, I think I need some help over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming.\"  Vincent snickered, realizing the pun he made.  Vincent grabbed Jake's giant cock and started giving it a stroke.  Soon, he stuck it in his mouth and started sucking.  Jake did the same with Vincent's, making a large, muscular 69 right on the floor of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing, their cocks were still very erect.  \"How much is in here?\"  Jake wondered, fondling his tennis balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully enough for round two.\"  Vincent replied, grabbing his own cock, giving it a strong stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!  I have an idea.\"  Jake and Vincent left the gym to go to his beach.  \"Whoever can cum the farthest with top next time we do anal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  You go first.\"  Jake started stroking his 15\" pole, making it start to leak pre-cum.  Soon, the feeling turned orgasmic, as Jake yelled a primal yell, and shot his cum almost 1000 feet into the air, before it landed almost a mile away.  \"Jesus Christ Jake!  My turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVincent started stroking his 15\" dick, before letting off a large load, hurdling through the air at the speed of a car, before landing near Jake's load.  However, not quite as far.  \"I guess I win.\"  Jake laughed.  He took Vincent in his arms and plopped him right on his still erect dick.  \"There's more where that came from.\"  Jake said, looking over to his large load on the sand.  \"I have gallons left.\"  Vincent eagerly waited on Jake's penis, feeling it expertly massage his insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, when can we marry?\"  Vincent asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you propose.\"  Jake replied jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll wait until we get back.  That way I can get you a ring.\"  Vincent said disappointingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you have some cum to get.\"  Jake said as he came inside of Vincent, filling him up to the brim with cum.  Vincent's body's response was to cum out all the cum entering his body.  A solid stream of cum came out of their bodies for a full 20 minutes.  \"Seriously?  Where does all this cum come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's magic.  The ring must have done that on it's own.\"  Vincent suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish there was a finite about of cum I can cum.  That way I can actually stop for a change.\"  The ring glowed, and the two stopped cumming.  \"I wish that amount was a gallon.\"  The ring glowed, and the two felt their balls empty.  \"Ahh, much better.  Anyway, now what?\"</span></div></div>",

He walked back to his desk and opened the top drawer. There, he found an old metal necklace which he had gotten from his grandfather years ago.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm going over to Kyle's!\" Zach called to his mother as he finished tying his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have your cellphone so I know where you are?\" his mother said, coming out of her home office. She was a typical middle-aged mom, but Zach thought she was the most awesome mom in the world. Despite being a famous business woman at one point, Tycoon Tara he thought he'd heard people call her, she'd cut back her hours considerably to ensure she had time for him, while his dad had managed to launch an extremely successful line of household robots. The end result was Zach was relatively well off and lived in one of the nicer parts of Calgary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mom I do,\" Zach said brightly, \"See ya later.\" With that he dashed out the door and down the street. Though only ten he was quite athletic and had developed a little muscle. The reason behind this was an immense fascination with superheroes. He owned every comic and action figure he could find, and loads of t-shirts and the occasional costume. Though he wasn't sure if he could be brave enough to do some of the things superheroes did, he strove to be like them; muscular, athletic and smart. Plus he figured if Batman and Robin were just ordinary people who'd buffed up their bodies and minds, than he could do the same thing for real. He was blond haired and blue eyes twinkled in his cute face. It was summer so he was wearing blue plaid shorts and a light blue t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was his best friend and the two did almost everything together, including trying to 'become superheroes'. In fact it was Kyle's dad who owned most of the gym equipment, though Zach had a few weights too. And they lived close, with Kyle just a few blocks away next to an old lot. Usually Zach paid no attention to the old lot, but today as he was walking past he saw what looked like a small crater in it with something shining in it. \"What's that?\" Zach muttered to himself, dashing over to the spot to investigate. Sitting in the hole was a golden gauntlet. He crouched down and picked it up, then quickly placed it on his arm. It was several sizes too large, but he still thought it looked cool. And then, right before his eyes, it shrank down until it fit him perfectly. He also found that, despite being made of gold, it was quite light and easy to wear. In fact he could very easily forget that he was wearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn closer inspection he saw it also had five round indentations, one on the back of each knuckle and the final one on the back of the hand. \"Hey Zach!\" came Kyle's voice from behind him. He turned around to see his friend running into he old lot. Kyle was brown haired and green eyed, and like his friend was slim and athletic with some light muscle, though his complexion was fairer than Kyle's and he had a dimple in his chin. \"So it was a gauntlet! I saw this thing shining from my room so I came down to have a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah doesn't it look cool?\" Zach asked, making some dramatic superhero-ish poses with the gauntlet. \"I think it's magic or something too,\" Zach said, \"It shrank to fit my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that useful then is it?\" Kyle replied. \"But it's still awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what these little holes on the back are for,\" Zach mused as they wandered back across the lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" Kyle said, dashing across to a corner of the lot and picking something up. \"Hold out your hand,\" he said as he ran back to his friend. Zach held out his right hand, the one without the glove, at which Kyle giggled. \"No you numbskull, the gauntlet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh,\" Zach said, holding out the gauntlet. Kyle slotted something into the indentation on the index knuckle and grinned when he saw it fit. He pulled back and Zach saw a red gem, a ruby Zach guessed, perfectly round and smooth and fitting perfectly into the indentation, not falling out even when he held it upside down. Quite suddenly he felt a surge of incredible power through him and through every inch of his body and muscles. \"Wow,\" Zach said simply, \"I suddenly feel really strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's go to your dad's weight room,\" Zach said, dashing off towards the house. He was surprised to feel himself pick up speed until he was running at least as fast as his mom's car and the world zoomed by in a blur. Then he came to a stop at the front door, still waiting for his friend to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" Kyle asked in awe. Zach shrugged as Kyle opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, it just sorta happened,\" Zach said as they jogged downstairs. Zach ran over to the rack of dumbells and grabbed the twelve and a half pound ones, the ones he usually used. Usually they were mildly heavy, but when he picked them today he felt nothing at all. Frowning he grabbed a pair of twenties instead, and found them to still be light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Kyle asked, doing hammer curls with the other pair of tens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's really light,\" Zach said, picking up forties now and still noticing little difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Zach replied, turning around with a pair of sixty pound dumbells and tossing them up down like sticks. He picked up a pair of one hundreds and did the same. Finally he picked up the two hundreds, the heaviest Kyle's dad had, and still held them like there was nothing to it. Kyle rushed over in awe, looking his friend over, at his request Zach took off his shirt and flexed, but his muscles weren't particularly spectacular. They were for a ten year old, but not much overall. He flexed his biceps to get a slight bulge and his pecs and abs faintly showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're like a rock,\" Kyle said, tapping Zach's abs. He looked around and grabbed a spare barbell, hefting it with difficulty. He swung it around to hit his friend, who cried out in shock, only to feel the barbell painlessly bounce off his body. \"Woah,\" Kyle muttered as Zach pulled his shirt back on. \"Maybe it's that glove, or- wait! You said you felt really strong shortly after we put that red gem in! I bet that's what's making you strong and tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Then... hey it means I really am a superhero now!\" Zach cried gleefully. \"Then you can be my sidekick until we find something for you to use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Hey I want to go try some stuff,\" Kyle said, dragging his friend behind him and it was hard to tell was more enthusiastic about the discovery. Kyle grabbed a kitchen knife and had Zach lift up his shirt while he stabbed it right into his abs. Instead of cutting him Zach saw the knife simply bend and break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How're you going to explain that to your parents?\" Zach asked while Kyle looked around and ended up just tossing the broken knife out an open window to the sound of a cat screeching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that's how,\" Kyle said brightly, \"I wonder if there're any more gems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could go look,\" Zach suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then back to the lot!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well I can't find anything,\" Zach said after a while, leaning against the lot's fence while he watched Kyle search over the lot for about the fifth time. Zach had already overturned  all the heavy rocks and logs in the place and they still found no more gems, but Kyle insisted in scanning the place over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess we should call it quits here,\" Kyle sighed, \"But where else do we search?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, let's go to the park or something,\" Zach suggested, putting his hands behind his head. Kyle nodded and they set off towards the park, talking chit-chat while Kyle would occasionally suggest spots more gems might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we don't even know what we're looking for,\" Kyle said, sounding somewhat annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can run to anywhere in the city in a few minutes,\" Zach said, easily scooping up his friend and proving his point by running to the park, making a normally ten minute walk take five seconds. When he set Kyle down the boy stumbled around for a moment and shook his head to regain his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that was awesome and yet makes me want to throw up,\" Kyle said. \"Oh no it's Brad,\" he muttered, seeing a large twelve year old boy approaching from across the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey fagnerds,\" he said. He was just as built as the two of them, but he was older and larger. They usually didn't encounter him too often and he didn't seem to go out of his way to bully them usually, if he did it meant he was bored. On the other hand they weren't helpless and were able to fight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a neat glove, can I have it?\" Brad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sorry,\" Zach said. \"And please don't try and take it or anything either, because that would end really badly for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really badly for me?\" Brad laughed. \"I think you have that backwards dweeb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't. If you punch me you'll be sorry,\" Zach said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just test that then,\" the older boy said and swung his fist right towards Zach's face. Instead of Zach's nose breaking he felt Brad's fist break against his nose. Brad cried out and looked at his broken hand, then at his victim's face. \"H-how did you-\" he muttered before running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to warn him,\" Zach muttered and dashed into the park, heading for the basketball spot. Halfway there he saw a twinkle on the ground and ran over to see a blue gem on the ground identical to the red one in his gauntlet, save the colour. He quickly picked it up, and saw it was perfectly clean despite being on the ground. Then he snapped it into place on the gauntlet and felt a strange sensation move through him, but this time through his head. All of a sudden he felt like everything he'd ever been confused about made perfect sense to him, he understood what he'd failed in his school tests, and in general he felt really smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh cool he found another one!' Kyle seemed to say as he dashed over, but Zach didn't see his mouth move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I did find another one,\" Zach said, \"I believe it's made me more intelligent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And telepathic,\" Kyle added, \"I never said anything, but you responded to something I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so cool,\" Zach said joyfully. \"If I'm correct in my analysis, and I most definitely am, than I think that this is the Infinity Gauntlet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Kyle cried, \"How can that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously it crossed dimensions,\" Zach stated. \"So far we have the Red Gem of Power and the Blue Gem of Mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we find them all...\" Kyle started, \"Aw man you'll be able to do anything! I can't believe my best friend will become a god.\" Kyle sounded giddy at the prospect, though Zach didn't really care. Each gem was pretty cool though, and being able to do anything he wanted could be pretty fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazed at a stick on the ground and reached out to it with his mind, like extending an invisible hand, and using that 'invisible hand' he picked the stick up and twirled it around in the air. \"Look Kyle, telekinesis,\" Zach said, pointing to the stick. Doing this little parlour trick didn't even feel taxing, it was just like he was picking the stick up normally with one of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you pick me up?\" Kyle asked, to which Zach scooped him up again. \"No you numbskull, with telekinesis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that here. Nobody notices the stick unless I point it out, but they'll notice a person,\" Zach protested, dropping the stick and putting his friend down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The blue gem gets stronger with the red one right? You should be able to read the mind of anyone in the universe right?\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Zach agreed, but he didn't have the foggiest whose mind he should look into. \"You want me to access the mind of Jodie at school?\" Zach teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Kyle said, punching his friend lightly in the arm, being careful not to hurt himself. \"No, I want you to look at Justin and Lee's minds to see where they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Zach said. He opened his mind to the universe around him, like opening an internet search engine. He would've thought it would hurt his head, but it was fine. Then he searched through the uncountable mass of minds and quickly found his two other friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stupid chores,' Justin was thinking, 'I hate mowing the lawn.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time Lee was babysitting his younger brother while their mom went to the store. Lee didn't mind it, but he still wanted to be out with his friends. 'I should call and let them know,' Lee thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lee's going to phone us in a bit, he's babysitting,\" Zach said. \"And Justin's mowing the lawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we go over and help them?\" Kyle asked, \"Then they can help turn you into a god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno about the last part, but sure,\" Zach said brightly, scooping up his friend and dashing off.</span></div></div>",

Somehow it crossed over into our universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...\" Justin muttered, completely speechless. \"Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has the Red Gem and Blue Gem, we're hoping we can find all six of them and make him the superest of superheroes,\" Kyle explained. \"You wanna help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to, but I have chores to do,\" Justin added bitterly. \"Don't suppose you could help me out eh Zach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach grinned, \"Why do you think I'm here? Oh and Lee's going to call right now.\" Right on queue Kyle's cellphone rang and he picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know, you're babysitting,\" Kyle said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you-?\" Lee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll tell you in a bit, we're helping Justin finish his chores and we'll be right over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay let's go,\" Zach said within minutes of Kyle hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're done already?\" Justin asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, mowed lawn, cleaned your room, put your dirty clothes in the laundry and swept the hall. Oh and look what somehow found its way into your pig-stye,\" Zach added, showing a green gem now set into his gauntlet. \"Green Gem of Soul, I was wondering if it might make it easier to carry you guys all around, but I think it only takes out your souls, not your bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I don't think it has much domestic use,\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it supposed to be a perfect world in there though?\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious,\" Zach said, though knew he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can restore me right? So just put me in there until we reach Lee's,\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerplexed, but not one to ignore an offer from a friend, Zach held up his gauntlet and used his new power to pull Justin's soul from his body, seeing a stream of green energy flow from his friend and into the gem. The moment the energy vanished inside the gem Zach suddenly felt memories well up inside his mind that weren't his. They were... Justin's! He saw his friend, though viewed the memories from Justin's point of view, sitting in a hospital and feeling extremely worried and terrified. He was only five, so this was about a year and a half before they met him, and then a nurse came into the waiting room with a sad expression. Immediately Justin knew what had happened; his twin brother was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin had a twin,\" Zach said with surprise, \"He died just over a year before we met him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- why,\" Kyle stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He never told us because he wanted to forget it, apparently,\" Zach said. Then he saw his friend's body slumped on the lawn, soulless and looking like an unused puppet. \"And I'm still stuck carrying him. I don't have eight hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use your-\" Kyle began, but Zach was one step ahead of him and was holding Justin's body using telekinesis, having it float close to him while Kyle practically jumped into his arms. \"Just thought I should mention I love this part,\" Kyle said as Zach prepared to run. Zach sped through the blocks and in seconds they were standing in front of Lee's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it occurs to me that I probably shouldn't have mentioned Justin's brother out loud,\" Zach said as he set Kyle down and turned to Justin's body as he set it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but it's not exactly like you were trying to search his memories, it's just a side-effect of your lack of experience with the Green Gem,\" Kyle said logically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess.\" With that Zach raised his gauntlet and the stream of green energy flowed out and back into its body. \"We're here Justin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fun,\" Justin said as he stood up and stretched. \"It's great once you're in there, it really is perfect, but the transition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was your brother in there?\" Zach asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, wait, how do you... oh right Green Gem. Must've taken my brother's soul on its way here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle can you knock, I don't want to break the door down by accident,\" Zach said. Kyle did so and Lee answered the door, his six year old brother close behind. They let themselves and quickly updated the two on the situation and waited while Lee overcame his shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you already have three!?\" Lee asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really cool,\" Lee's little brother, Tristan said, echoing his brother's feelings perfectly. \"So where could the other three be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been looking into that,\" Zach said, \"Scanning the minds of everyone in town and the purple one is at the base of the tower, the orange one is in the corner of a clock shop and the yellow one is in a warehouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And nobody's picked them up?\" Lee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a little suggestion in the backs of their minds that it's probably nothing but play jewelery,\" Zach said with a bright grin. \"Aww I have to carry four of you now,\" he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, me and Justin will stay here and look after Trist,\" Lee said, \"You and Kyle go get those gems and then we can have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so which one first Kyle?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's go for the purple one,\" Kyle suggested. Zach scooped him up again and dashed out the door before picking up speed to make it downtown in under a minute, stopping right in front of the round glass entrance to the Calgary Tower before setting him down. The base was a round, lobby like glass building with an information desk and gift shop and other meaningless things for tourists. Zach personally loved the tower, while Kyle said he'd seen it enough to last him a lifetime. Above them the tower rose into the sky like a pillar with the large, round observation deck at the top making it look top heavy. \"So I'm going to guess the person who saw the gem only got a vague look at it and you have no actual idea where it is,\" Kyle said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I really that predictable?\" Zach asked, astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it was this side?\" Kyle asked after about half an hour of looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to check inside,\" Zach said, speeding off. Seconds later he returned with a purple gem held triumphantly between his fingers. He grinned as he placed it in the gauntlet and felt the already incredible power within him surge even further. \"This is cool,\" he muttered with awe. With simply a thought, and a slight gesture with his hand, Lee, Justin and Tristan all appeared right in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" they cried together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this a bit public for that?\" Lee asked quietly. Zach shrugged, nobody seemed to have noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go anywhere now,\" Zach said \"Makes carrying your guys around easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go to Australia?\" Justin asked. He'd barely finished talking when the group was standing on the streets of Sydney, Australia. \"Woah,\" Justin added, seeing the Opera House on the skyline. Before the others knew it they were back in Calgary, only now they were near a clock shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's really cool is I'm also looking for the Reality Gem right now,\" Zach said. It was weird, like using telekinesis being in multiple places at once was strange, but was like having another arm, or another two in this case. Even weirder was he could see things from the warehouse at the same time as he saw his friends in front of him. He was even talking to himself in the warehouse, but silently following his friends into the clock shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" the owner of the small shop said. \"Any way I can help you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're just looking,\" Kyle said. The shop was quite small and in no time Lee spotted the orange gem, while Zach found the yellow one in the warehouse. He placed the yellow one in its socket while Lee placed the orange one in the final spot. Zach felt a monumental surge of power flow through him, more power than was universally imaginable. He grinned as absolute power coursed through him...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This is totally awesome,\" Zach cried, feeling overjoyed. \"So, you guys want powers right? Wait let me do this first.\" Immediately all their bodies, even Tristan's, lost all their fat and bulked up with muscle. Not so much that they looked large or bulky, but enough that they looked very toned and athletic, something like a gymnast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" Justin said, flexing his newly enlarged biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I added some super-strength with that too. Hey Tristan, do you want to be older?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I want me and Lee to be twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fraternal twins coming up,\" Zach said and Tristan immediately grew to the same age as his brother, though with darker, wavy hair that he wore long, while Lee wore his hair short. \"Let's see, invulnerability, super-speed, flight, you already have strength.\" With those words said each of the boys felt more powerful and Kyle grinned as he ran to his house and back in a few seconds, while Justin soared into the air. Zach took some time to enjoy his new omnipotence while they enjoyed their new powers. He could see everything in the universe in his mind. He could see space, millions of planets and stars, countless species, and he could see them, <i>hear</i> them talking. In fact while he could feel his physical body here in front of his friends, his actual self was literally everywhere. According to his newly gained infinite knowledge, most people took time to master the gauntlet, so for a little kid like him to master it almost instantaneously was surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Zach!\" Kyle said, \"Let's do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Zach asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go find some beat up dead planet and fix it up into a huge place for fun,\" Justin suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a planet the Terlins of Terlia call Mortem, it's a good ways from Earth and it's about the same size, but it's all dead rock with an atmosphere like car exhaust,\" Zach said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fix that place up,\" Tristan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah something I forgot to give you guys! Super-intellect,\" Zach said, giving it to them with that word. Then in the blink of an eye they were standing on a barren wasteland under a roiling grey-brown sky, standing next to a vast valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we still breathing?\" Kyle asked, \"This atmosphere is clearly composed of sulfuric acid, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still breathing because I will it. Just like I will this!\" Zach raised his hands dramatically, though he really didn't need to, and at his simple thoughts the world around them changed. The sky morphed and changed with the brown leaving it and they grey becoming the grey of storm clouds. Rain poured down and water collected near them filling up the valley and changing it into an ocean, while his power kept them all perfectly dry. Zach could see the whole world filling up with water, lakes and oceans forming at his command. When that was done the clouds vanished and sunlight poured down from the blue sky while Zach added habitats to the planet; trees, grass, vegetation forming forests, savannahs, grasslands and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were now standing on a sandy beach next to the ocean under a warm sun that put all tropical locations on Earth to shame. Within seconds there were also animals all across the planet and after a few final tweaks, including changes to the planet's interior, they were standing on a planet very much like Earth in every way, except the arrangement and shapes of continents and tectonic plates, but with themselves as the sole occupants. \"This is totally cool!\" all Zach's friends cried at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now we have a whole planet to ourselves,\" Zach said, \"What do you want to do? I can make anything here. Well I can do anything anywhere, but you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we need somewhere indoors here,\" Tristan said. Zach grinned and at the top of the beach appeared a mansion that looked like it was straight out of Los Angeles, only larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three pools, eight bedrooms, five bathrooms, two kitchens, I could go on,\" Zach said, teleporting them into one of the cosy looking bedrooms and immediately lying down on the king sized bed. \"And three rec rooms with every game console imaginable, with every game and a full arcade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... you're a god!\" Justin cried happily, being a huge gamer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I am,\" Zach said with a grin, \"Oh and all the clothes in here will fit each of us no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're gonna explore,\" Kyle said, secretly wanting to check his newly muscled body, \"Are you going to stay here and rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Zach said. \"I'll catch up with you guys later.\" With that his friends left the room and he shifted his clothes to a simple pair of boxers, looking down at his newly muscled form with appreciation. He definitely looked like a superhero now, and he loved the look of his muscles. \"So what to do now?\" he thought aloud.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After flexing a few times in a mirror in the room, and enjoying his new physique, Zach grinned as he came up with some other ideas. He could operate many physical forms at once if he wanted, so with a blink of an eye he had four more bodies appear around him. They were all exactly identical to him and he controlled all of them. \"Hey Zach, looking good,\" one of them said to him, though in truth this was simply him talking from another mouth. The other Zach who'd spoken ran his hand across Zach's abs and grinned. \"You look amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Zach said happily from his original. He'd need ways of differentiating them all though so he decided to use Greek letters and change the colours of their boxers. He himself would of course be Zach Prime and kept his blue plaid boxers. The one who'd felt his abs was Zach Alpha and he gave that body green boxers. He gave another body red boxers and decided that would be Zach Beta. He gave another body black boxers and that would be Zach Gamma, and finally finished off by giving Zach Delta white boxers. He hadn't noticed that, despite retaining his child-like cheerfulness and light-hearted spirit, he was nonetheless mentally maturing enough to have some sexual and romantic thoughts, and his friends were actually the same with their super advanced intellects. Before he knew it he was making out with Alpha and despite it being all levels of weird, it was also incredibly awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what about us?\" Beta pouted, to which Zach quickly kissed each of his other bodies. Despite his make out session with himself he was wondering, with another part of his now vast mind, if he should reveal himself to Earth and help humanity into a Golden Age. As an all-powerful entity now he would feel no greater happiness than helping his planet overcome its faults and soar to new, peaceful heights. On the other hand he wasn't sure if he could make it work correctly. Even with all his infinite power and knowledge, he knew he wasn't perfect, especially since only hours ago he was just a simple mortal. \"So... what next?\" Beta mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... this experiment was for experimenting with my power,\" Zach said, \"I guess I got sidetracked by my sexiness.\" With a blink of his eye all his other bodies changed. Alpha aged to about fifteen, Beta aged to sixteen and became a very well endowed girl, Gamma grew to six feet tall, and aged slightly to about twelve years old, and Delta bulked up with several more pounds of muscle until he looked more like a bodybuilder than a gymnast, and gained a few extra inches in height so he grew to almost five foot. Zach's Prime body, at four feet five inches was a bit tall for his age, but the shortest in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are awesome,\" Delta said, flexing his huge muscles, while as Beta Zach was busy feeling up his slim, athletic body, large perky breasts and round, firm butt, and Alpha was just enjoying the extra height and muscle age afforded him, while Gamma towered over all of them. \"So now what?\" Delta asked, slinging a massive arm across the shoulders of his main body.</span></div></div>",

He was cute, or handsome in Alpha's case and beautiful in Beta's case, but he wanted to take that further. In a single second his entire facial structure had smoothed out, altered, while his lean, muscular body became slightly more tan and all blemishes and scars vanished. In that one second he'd become incredibly adorable, incredibly attractive, inhumanly so. Which made sense because he wasn't merely human anymore. His other bodies had changed too, and he grinned at the massively muscular Delta and his gorgeous visage. \"Aw man I'm hot,\" Zach said, at which he wrapped his arms around his Delta body, feeling up every massive muscle while he had his Delta body do the same to him and then they were kissing each other again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty minutes, in which all his bodies had been with each other, he dismissed all of them and slipped back on some clothes. He had no idea what had come over him, but he'd apparently had sex several times, though he wasn't entirely sure if it counted since it was himself. He shrugged off the confusing technicalities and, once fully dressed, he teleported to right in the middle of his group of friends, who were all lifting weights in the mansion's weight room, and finding them all extremely easy with their new super strength. \"What were you up to?\" Kyle asked, \"And why are you sweaty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Zach said, quickly changing his body to be just showered and clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to make a wild guess and say he was having sex with himself,\" Justin said, \"You made different bodies of yourself right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah kinda,\" Zach muttered sheepishly, at which his friends rolled their eyes, but as he knew their super-intellects had matured their minds to adulthood, though they maintained their child-like cheeriness and general personalities. \"So how've you guys been making out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well these weights don't do anything,\" Kyle said, standing up and easily holding a barbell with at least two hundred pounds on it, he shifted it to one hand and easily held it over his head. \"You couldn't give us something a little more difficult?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How strong are we anyways?\" Tristan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can all lift about five thousand tonnes,\" Zach said, \"I just gave you guys shapeshifting too, because I think it'll be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind?\" Lee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything, change your size, change your age, change into someone else, give yourself wings, anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! You look different by the way,\" Justin added, \"I can't put my finger on it, but you seem better looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did some little tweaks. So what else do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we have a beach, why not go there?\" Kyle suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Zach said cheerfully, teleporting them to the beach where he had a small wooden hut appear over five towels and changed them all into their boardshorts. \"Man we're hot,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but just to make it better I'm going to do this,\" Kyle said, changing himself into a thirteen year old version of himself and now standing about a foot taller than his friends, though they all quickly joined him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely a good idea dude,\" Zach said, \"Last one in the water is a rotten egg!\" He was first in the water, and once they were all there he wondered what they could do next.</span></div></div>",

The Infinity Gauntlet was still on him, but he'd made it become part of him and thus left no sign of its presence on him. The feeling of being able to do anything was a great one. Just this morning he'd been a little kid, now he was a young teenager with a boyish face and still slightly boyish voice. And his friends were all almost as powerful as himself, and he watched as they experimented with their own incredible power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he'd had enough with cheap tricks, shapeshifting was so mundane to him now. He didn't even really have a single shape, but he preferred his current one. With a simple thought he had another body, this one deep in the ocean. This body was almost identical to his main one, or what he considered his main one, except he bore a royal blue merman tail from the waist down, and carried a golden trident in his hand, and golden bracers, amulet and crown on the appropriate parts of his body. His bracers were studded with sapphires while his crown bore lapis lazulis, sapphires and opals, plus a diamond at its center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his trident and immediately a vast undersea palace rose up, looking like giant seashells mixed with a coral reef to form spires and walls and towers. At his command a whole city of similar coral and shell structures appeared and a second later the city was populated with merpeople. Unlike before these weren't extensions of himself, but new lifeforms he'd willed into existence. Before him was the outer gate of the palace, guarded by two armoured mermen holding spears. They bowed to Zach as he approached and opened the gate for him. \"King Neptune, it is good to see you returning home,\" they said and Zach, or King Neptune as this body was known as, swam through the gate and into the palace grounds, largely occupied by kelp and coral gardens. Colourful fish swam through it and Neptune found himself very pleased with his handiwork; the whole thing was very beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeptune swam into the entrance hall of the palace and up to a grand door of gold and coolourful coral that opened into his throne room. He took his seat on the gold and coral throne and leaned back to relax, his trident beside the throne. It wasn't necessary for anything of course, but he liked having a weapon to accentuate his form. So now he was King of the Merpeople, but he needed a name for his kingdom. Aquaria seemed to fit, and so he willed it and it was done. Now Neptune had to decide what to do next...</span></div></div>",

He made shapes of water form in front of him and had them swirl around and morph into a hundred different shapes. \"Maybe I'll go explore,\" he decided, making the water forms dissipate and preparing to leave. But on the other hand he'd just gotten here, and being omniscient he didn't actually need to explore. But he figured he might find something fun from being present in person. So in the blink of an eye he had yet another body appear in the middle of the city. This body was as athletic and muscular as his others, but beyond the build and age this body didn't resemble him at all. This body bore short, brown hair, green eyes, and a different face and appearance. \"Alton,\" he muttered to himself from this body, \"I like that name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlton flicked his green tail and swam around the square, looking at strange underwater delicacies being sold from stands. He saw a couple hippocampi swim by above and went to go check them out. Half white stallion and half fish, with shiny scales, they swam by like currents. Alton grinned and decided to follow them. Their path led him across the city to a field of seagrass next to a kelp forest. The hippocampi joined together with another couple of their kind and began to feed, while, much to Alton's 'surprise', a mermaid girl about his age watched over them. She was slim, and shapely for her age with blonde hair that floated lazily in the water, a seashell bra and a turquoise tail. \"Oh, uh,\" the girl stuttered shyly, hiding her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there,\" Alton said pleasantly, \"How're you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm fine,\" the mermaid said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to startle you, I was just following those hippocampi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, well I, um, I have to get going,\" the girl muttered before swimming off in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlton decided to...</span></div></div>",

In an instant he had another one, this one miles from the island that he and his friends were on. This new body stood in a large office atop a massive, futuristic skyscraper at the center of a vast, futuristic metropolis that spanned both sides of a lake at the center of this continent, while the building he was in was on an island in the middle of the lake.  It towered above the rest of the city, allowing him to look down on it from his window. This body was, like the rest of his, perfectly muscled and tanned, and extremely attractive, and also only thirteen years old. He was dressed in a fancy black suit and tie and the name on his desk identified him as Blake Bauer, Corporate Controller of Supercorp, a giant globe-spanning conglomerate that worked tirelessly to make the lives of people better. And it just so happened that he was also Mayor of Centropolis, and President of the United Nations of Altrion, a vast, powerful and rich nation that in the blink of an eye was formed. That made him the most powerful person on the planet. Everything ran on navidum, a crystal that could be charged with huge amounts of energy that would last for decades, possibly centuries. Flying cars zipped around the city, people were happy, and Blake was grinning from ear to ear.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's a lovely morning when Katy wakes up with a present on her lap. She doesn't know why there is a present on her lap although it's neither her birthday nor Christmas. She also doesn't know who placed it there because she lives alone. Although she is still very connected to her family she didn't gave anyone else keys to her apartment. A little freaked out she opens the box carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the box are six fancy looking stones with no information or letter to them. She wants to take one and is suddenly struck by a strange feeling. It feels like the red stone she just picked up emits an indescribable power that feels kind of arousing to her. After that feeling seems to fade she picks up another. No other stone emits this strange energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" she sighs at the look of the yellow stone. \"Those are so beautiful. I wish I had a necklace made out of them.\" Suddenly the stone lights up and the all the other some start levitating right in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bright flash they seem to be gone. Katy sighs in disappointment, although what she witnessed was kinda terrifying. She stretches and scratches her back while doing so. All of a sudden she feels a chain hanging around her neck. She looks down at her and all six stones have combined to a good-looking necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... Sweet.\" She exclaims and gets out of bed. She looks at herself in the mirror and admires the necklace hanging from her neck containing all of the fancy stones she got from the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks nice,\" Katy says and admires herself more. \"I only wish I had hotter curves.\" Once again the yellow stone lights up and flashes her for a second. When she can see again a tingly feeling rushes through her body and ends up in her hips and chest. Suddenly her top seems to become tighter as well as her undies. Confused she looks at her reflection again and can't believe her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boobs balloon up, her hips become wider and her ass expands while her waist shrinks thinner. She gasps as her body transforms into a much sexier version of herself. Additionally her skin becomes smooth and firm and her hair perfectly clean and all styled up. Few seconds pass and her whole body transformed into a supermodel. Her petite B-cups have grown to firm and perfectly stiff DD-cups. Her waist lost a bit of mass while her hips and ass grew to perfectly round and big proportions. Right now, everyone would be attracted or jealous of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised she looks at the necklace and asks out loud : \"Did you do this?\" She expects no answer but is a hundred percent sure the stones did it. While looking at them her eyes wander to her boobs over and over again. After short while of gazing at her new beauty, a feeling of power fills her body. She feels like she could do anything, but isn't aware that that's the case. Her surprised and kinda cute face, changes expression to a devilish and sinful grin... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The last bell of the day rang; yet another school day gone.   Miranda packed up her books and made her to her locker, careful not to look anyone in the eye.  If she made eye contact, then she might be forced to talk to them, and there was no way she would be able to do that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to get to her locker without incident, though she wasn't too worried that there'd be one.  This school ignored Miranda as much as she wanted to ignore it.  She wished that she could be comfortable being alone all the time, but it wasn't that easy.  She wanted to be noticed, she wanted to have friends and hang out with people and do all the things high school girls do.  But she just couldn't.  She couldn't even make eye contact with someone without freezing up.  Actually talking to them?  Never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda opened her locker and pulled out her backpack, but quickly noticed something was off.  Most of her school books were either in her arms or on the \"floor\" of her locker, so why was her bag so heavy?  Setting down on the floor, she unzipped the main compartment and found the culprit.  It was a... glove?  No, a gauntlet.  It looked like gold, but it hadn't felt that heavy.  She slowly turned the item over in her hands, noticing six small indentations on the back of the hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity got the better of her and she slowly slid the gauntlet over her left forearm.  It was much too big for her, but as soon as it was completely on it began changing.  Miranda watched wide-eyed as the gauntlet slowly shrunk down to fit her snugly.  She quickly looked around to see if anyone else had noticed, but the halls were mostly empty.  And even if they weren't, she was Miranda.  She wasn't noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda put her books into her bag, still wearing the gauntlet, and made her way out of the building.  The gauntlet was strange alright, and she didn't know how she was going to explain to her mother where it came from.  Heck, she didn't even know where it came from.  The fact that it was already in her backpack was concerning, since it meant someone had been able to get into her locker.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was walking home thinking about the gauntlet, she heard what sounded like a fight off to her right.  Looking over, she saw two men struggling.  One wasn't much taller than her and wore a white hood that concealed his face, while the other was a very big man with impossible-looking muscles.  Seriously, this guy looked like he was out of a cartoon or something.  Despite this, the hooded man was clearly winning.  He forced the big man to the ground and, to Miranda's horror, plunged a long dagger right through his neck.  While the big man was thrashing his final movements, the hooded man bent down and took his ring.  It was a simple gold band, with what looked like a ruby.  The hooded man ripped the red gem free from the ring, then bent down to take his dagger from the now motionless body.  Incredibly, those impossible muscles slowly started shrinking.  Within seconds, the \"big man\" was small and downright scrawny.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda had been just too shocked to react to any of that, and now the hooded man turned around and spotted her.  She wanted to run, to scream, anything, but she was just frozen with fear.  The man stood motionless for a few seconds, before holding up both his hands.  In one was the red gem he'd taken from the man he'd killed.  In the other was an identical looking blue gem he'd taken from his pocket.  Without looking away from Miranda, he slowly tipped his hands until the two gems fell to the ground.  He then stepped backward until he was out of sight behind a nearby tree, after which point he was just gone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute of just standing still in shock, Miranda finally approached the body and the gems.  Trying not to look at the corpse, she picked up the two gems and held them in her non-gauntlet hand.  She had to admit, they did look very pretty...    </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">A person within a universe (namely ours) has gotten ahold of one or more Infinity Gems (and possibly the Infinity Gauntlet with them) from the Marvel universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow each Infinity Gem is quite powerful by itself, but all six together make the wielder (commonly with the above mentioned Infinity Gauntlet) omnipotent, and quite literally able to do ANYTHING. Here are the six individual gems (taken from Wikipedia):<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpace (Purple)- Allows the user to exist in any location (or all locations), move any object anywhere throughout the universe and warp or rearrange space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind (Blue)- Allows the user to boost mental power and access the thoughts and dreams of other beings. Backed by the Power Gem, the Mind Gem can access all minds in existence simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul (Green)- This gem is sentient and has a hunger for souls. Allows the user to steal, manipulate and alter souls, living or dead. The gem is the gateway to an idyllic pocket-universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality (Yellow)- Allows the user to fulfill wishes, even if the wish is in direct contradiction with scientific laws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime (Orange)- Allows the user total control over the past, present and future. Allows time travel, can age and de-age beings and also be used as a weapon by trapping enemies or entire worlds in unending loops of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower (Red)- Accesses all power and energy that ever has or will exist, and can back the other gems and boost their effects. Allows the user to duplicate almost any physical superhuman ability and become invincible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow like I said, you can have the person who finds the gem(s) do whatever they want. There's no restrictions at all. Go as wild and crazy as you like. I'd prefer if you keep the storylines as original as possible; you can have similar things happen in different storylines, but try not to repeat the same general ideas again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for how they come across them, I really don't care either. You can have a group of six people become heroes (or villians) each with one gem, or have one person with all six and able to do whatever they want.<br>\r\n</td>",
