He then finds a young baby in the carriage and feels an unusual moment of empathy. The first of many to come. He takes the girl away to his home in Death's realm (a nice little cottage where he keeps bees) and 'allows her to have lived her life' (meaning that she becomes the girl she would have been if she had lived sixteen years of life, which is to say that she is wistfully romantic but unfortunately much too plump for the role of the typical gothic romance) then stops her aging or maturing anymore for a few millenia or so, till he realises that she should go back and live a normal mortal life. So he hires an apprentice and 'arranges' things so that they fall in love and elope, becoming the ruling nobility of the country of Sto Helit. They have a daughter, Susan Sto Helit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the usual canon Susan then 'inherits' some of her grandfather's traits magically. She becomes very slim, unlike her mother, and her hair is black with a single, prominent white streak and it moves by itself. Her skin is pale and her face even has stripes on it (right where her mother slapped Death) that stay utterly pale even when she gets flush with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, does her mother never get adopted by Death?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr does someone else give birth to Susan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr something else?</span></div></div>",

She was getting used to her magical sword's constant hunger for blood, and was controlling it, but he didn't make good conversation. She decided for target practice with her bow, Telmarril, the heart-seeker. She went up to the cliffs above the cavernous halls, and set up some dummies of cloth and straw. Twang, twang, twang! Crash, crash, crash! All three dummies went down, arrows placed squarely in the bulls-eyes in their heads. \"This will get old fast....\" Catti'Brie said, and went back down to the alchemist, to see if he had something new he'd like her to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I'm going to make up the alchemist, since I don't know any alchemists beside one gnome whose name I cannot remember.)<br>\r\n\"Hello, old Fizzlewick!\" Catti'Brie called happily as she stepped into the alchemist shop. A wizened old gnome turned from a shelf of potions to smile broadly at the young woman as she stepped into his shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why 'ello there, Catti!\" The gnome said, in an odd cross between a gnomish accent and a dwarven one, probably from spending so much time with the dwarves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything new you wanted to show me?\" The young girl asked, a glint in her eye. She looked to old Fizzlewick Graydraught like a grandfather, a very friendly, potion-making grandfather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As it just so 'appens, I've got a potion 'ere that may just 'elp you fall in a bit wif that elf friend o yers.\" Fizzlewick said, pulling out a small pink vial from a shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: What if Catti'Brie was a bit more 'voluptuous'? This could be her just gaining weight from the potion, or getting a nice hourglass figure. Either way, there's more up top and down below. This is just whether there's something in the middle or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: What if Catti'Brie and Drizzt fell more in love than they already were?

With only women around the house who weren't all that interested in fighting he'd been forced to let himself go a little. Not to the degree that he looked fat but if you'd known him year's before then you'd notice that his once solid muscle gained from year's of something which he couldn't really discuss were now softer and less defined. His attitude hadn't changed that much but that didn't mean he didn't miss his son terribly and could only hope that he had been sent to soul society rather than bear the 'other' fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu and Karin were both too young at the time for the lose of Ichigo to really effect them.

Putting up a false smile to try and black out th pain and shield the twin's from the truth until they could understand. Though every night for a year without fail she'd go into his room which had become a shrine to her late son and cried for hour's until either Isshin came in or one of the girl'd did and innocently asked her what was wrong.

Isshin was now awake inside the house and quickly headed outside to find the hollowfied Ichigo which suddenly stirred something in the hollow \"DAAAAAAA\" it roared and rushed at Isshin to his suprise, he readied to fight the hollow off but instead to his suprise he found the hollow just standing there and watching him. It spoke with a cry but tried it's best to speak clearly as he was never good at it \"Da? Moe? Fam?\" the hollow ichigo smelled the air and then smiled a wicked yet non-evil smile. \"Wait could you be\" Isshin asked still suprised \"Ichigo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hollow knew only a few things from before he was a monster, when he was human. He remebererd the face of his mother, the cheers of his father and even the cute looks of his little sisters. \"Daaad?\" Ichigo asked then Isshin hugged him and began to cry \"Ichigo how we've missed you\" Isshin cried. Then the two walked along the streets, Ichigo trying to resist eating all the (what he thought) delcious souls. Isshin told him no every time Ichigo would try and then the two would contiue to walk to a framiar shop know to Isshin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello is any one awake\" Isshin yelled? \"Uh can't this wait til morning when every one is awake\" yawned a blond haired man with wooden clogs. The man looked at Isshin and said \"Why hello Isshin! Haven't seen you in ages what brings you here at such a late hour?\" \"Take a look for yourself Kisuke\" Isshin stepped aside to reveal Ichigo who just had a strange look on his face which ment happiness if hollows could be happy. \"Wait is that...\" \"Yes Kisuke\" Isshin replied with a smile \"It's my son, Ichigo!\" Ichigo hearing his name approuched his father and hugged him \"Hm this is...well i can't really explain it\" Kisuke said slightly amazed by the sight. Kisuke invited the two inside and the three walked through the shop to the underground room where Ichigo would in another reality train to re-become a soul reaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Isshin what is it that you want me to do\" asked Kisuke as he took a seat on a stone. Isshin gulped as he knew what he was about to say might be imposible even for the mighty Kisuke Urahara \"Kisuke I want you to turn my son back into human!\" Kisuke gasped at the reply as if the wind had just been knocked out of him \"Well now that was something I should have expected but none the less I'll try but...\" Isshin leans in so Ichigo doesn't hear. Kisuke begins to whisper something into Isshin's ear and his face turns to a all business like look. \"Alright Kisuke if that's what it will take\" Isshin says as he backs up to Ichigo and then crouches down to his level \"Now Ichigo i'm going to leave you with Mr. Urahara for a bit but don't worry I'll be back to get you in no time.\" Isshin brushes Ichigo's hair  and Ichigo smiled his same hollow smile then hugged Isshin. \"Now, now don't worry you'll see him again in a week so no need to worry about a thing\" Kisuke said for reasurense. Isshin nods and hands Ichigo over to Urahara before leaving.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Every year On this day is the single greatest event in the Joketsuzoku village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach year the young girl's (because men were forbidden to be warrior's) who had reached the age of maturity by this time would compete against each other for the honour of being named the strongest young warrior to date. A title which they would hold until they were defeated by another amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis year the favourite to win was the many times great granddaughter of village elder Cologne, Shampoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer years of tutalage under the ancient warrior woman had made it all to easy for the purple haired young beauty to sweep away the compitition. Even the giant she faced in the last round toppled off the challange log with a single blow from the girl who was at least 2 times smaller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar overcame the crowd as she was declared the village champion like she knew she would be. Not only was this a great honour, but now she could get her hand's on the second half of her prize. A feast prepared by the tribe's greatest cook's. Cooked only once a year and made with the finest spice's, freshest ingrediant's and the meat's of animal's which they had been fattening up since last year for such an occassion. Her mouth watered in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to gaze upon  her feast. Before her vision turned red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in 'HER' seat. Eating 'HER' well earned banquete was a foriegn 'male' in a dirty gi and what appeared to be his pet panda. Half the plate's which had taken the cook's hour's to fill up were empty already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leapt of the challenge log and raised her Bonbori (melon hammer) before bringing it down on the table and roughly splitting it in two before pointing the mace dangerously at the 'male' who to add to the insult looked at her without any hint of fear at what she just did. Didn't he know to fear a mighty amazon warrior?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there Panda and Boy. Why did you eat my prize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked at in confused before turning to the jusenkyo guide who had accompanied them who she could only guess translated for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prize?\" He said. She kicked herself for just understanding what he said. All those hours of learning japanese had paid off like her great grandmother had said when she herself said it was pointless. Anyway it was now apparant that this boy had no idea what he had just done. She was to angry to speak his language so she blurted in chinese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every year on this day is the martial art's show. I am now it's champion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guide translated for the boy before he stood up and grinned. Wiping the food stuff's away from his cheek's she now got a good look at him. Right before blushing along with several other amazon's. Despite never being picky about their choices of men since none in the village or nearby could really be called attractive (Mousse was passable but those coke bottle lenses ruined it) they did know what a handsome man looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo shook her head lightly to banish 'certain thought's' she was having and listened to what the guide was telling her about the male challenging her for the food. She looked at the japanese boy before cracking her knuckles and making her way onto the challange log followed second's later by the boy. She took up her Bonbori stance while he arrogently stood their with no  stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice called out 'BEGIN'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShapoo charged him ready to turn his head into pulp but just as she reached him a sharp and powerful pain explodedin her jaw as his foot shot up and nailed her on the chin causing her to drop the hammer's and go flying off the log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audiance watched with eye's wide and jaw's dropping. This, this MAN had just defeated their newly crowned champion with only one move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo was equally shocked. She never expected this man to beat her at all let alone so easily. No male expect those hybrid abomination's of the 'musk' were supposed to be even remotly skilled in combat. It was a disgrace, it was shameful it was......................perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up shakily and made her way over to the handsome and 'strong' man with eyes full of anything but anger. He was about a head taller than her so she had to look up into his deep blue and confused eye's. She turned to face the audiance and shot a look which silenced their jealous murmuring before turning to face the boy again and before wrapping her arm's around his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wo ai ni Airen.\" She said before pulling him down into a needy kiss.</span></div></div>",

More like creaked open, his desire for more sleep fighting with his desire to wake up making rising for the new day most difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't remember much about last night, he didn't remembe much of anything after that purple haired girl jammed her tongue into his mouth and tried ripping his tonsils out. He remembered cheering, unusual because nobody ever cheered when he won a fight, only yelled at him to bring back their money. She...she took him somewhere, probably her house or hut or wherever it was she lived. Well that was nice of her, then again she was obviously into him if she was bold enough to kiss him 5 seconds after he booted her in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked slightly at the thought of all of his idiot fathers talk of making him the 'manliest man alive'. Maybe it wasn't such garbage after all, well until he could find a better reason for all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being used to a bed (it's cushiony softness a pleasent change from the folded tissue Genma called a sleeping bag) Ranma knew he really wouldn't be able to think straight if he stayed in it. So with monumental effort he tried to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got about a fifth of the way until an unknown mass on his chest forced him back down.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nConfused the teen pulled the covers down further and almost choked on his own breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat girl from yesterday was lying on top of him chest. Peacefully snoozing away while gently nuzzling into his bare chest, her arms wrapped around his mid section like a teddy bare with a six pack, he flushed red as he felt her own abundant chest press firmly against him right down to their rock hard points. Going down further he could feel a supple leg intertwined with his own but fortunatly nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned slightly when his movement woke her up, the sensation of her own movement as she pulled herself up, dragging herself slightly against him made his body react in slightly embarressing ways. She opened her eyes and looked up at him, big brown eyes filled to the brim with something he'd only ever seen in couples he'd pickpocketed in the park. She moved herself again much to the aggrivation of a deepening blush, which went nuclear as he saw the only thing seperating her from indeceny was a lacy pink nighty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked deeply into his eyes, her all consuming gaze divertng attention away from the clear smirk she had as she continued to tease her new husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wo ai ni.\" She said before pulling herself up further to bringing the neon red boy into another kiss. Her other hand sneaking down the covers towards his boxers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another hut an old woman cackled. The man bound and gagged across from her shivering as she did so.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Akane didn't cough up the lifetime pill after Ranma saved her, and thus, after looking into his eyes, Akane is now helplessly in love with Ranma. She's still herself for the most part, but is unable to get angry at Ranma, can't deny her feelings for him, will take his side instead of automatically assuming he's guilty, and highly affectionate, openly displaying and announcing her love for her fiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. In canon, the engagement was temporarily shifted from Akane to Nabiki. Nabiki, in her typical fashion, saw this as a chance to exploit Ranma, and get more money, while acting like she liked him, before secretly shifting it back to Akane after he found out, in order to avoid his planned 'revenge,' but what if it happened like this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Nabiki and Kasumi forced the engagement to be between Ranma and Alane due to reeling from the knowledge of his curse, Nabiki realized she overreacted, and soon fell for him. After trying to subtly create a rift between Ranma and Akane that she could slip into. When she gets to the point where it was shifted in canon, instead of exploiting Ranma, she takes the chance and runs with it, being loving and affectionate with him. While she'll still try to exploit others to make money, she won't with Ranma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The vengeful doll that takes revenge upon being  wronged by hijacking a body and killing them, instead of being accidentally knocked over by Ranma chasing after Genma for stealing from him and deciding the full blame goes to Ranma, it is knocked over and broken by Ranma being slammed into it due to being hit by Akane because of Shampoo and Ukyo fighting over him, while he's innocent, like usual. The spirit of the doll follows them, blaming Akane, but curious about how this abuse towards Ranma is treated as normal. The doll sees the unfairness that is Ranma's life, and how it's shaped his attitude, and decides to get revenge by stealing her body, and being a better Akane, and a better fiancee than it believes the original could ever hope to be. Due to having left the inn to go home before her body was stolen, Akane has no ability to get back as she's trapped in the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.

He was happily Neutral. Doing neither bad nor good in anything he was average. It was this averageness that had him completly off the radar to even his teachers. Like he was invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it was this invisibility that ensured that he had few friends. It was also the reason that on school club day that he was 'unlike the rest of the student body' both not asked to join any club's and rejected by any he wanted to join. Even his 'friends' were picked for club's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whole life of being ignored had changed in seconds as he now felt he had practically the entire body of 50,000 students looking at him with shocked eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason? A bananna peel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bananna peel that caused him to slip, fall, hit someone and land on not concrete but rather something very soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew in all liklihood what he probably landed on but that didn't mean he wouldn't fear it any less when he opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying below him was an amazingly beautiful girl that looked a year or so older than him, a second or third year mabye.  She was much taller than quite a few students at the school and had grey/brown eyes and long purple hair spilling everywhere. However he was more concerned by the fact he was correct that he should be afraid of where he had landed. Namely her large (big to the point of ridiculous) chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he'd stayed focused on her face he would have noticed that she didn't look embarressed or scared like an ordinary girl would in this situation. Instead she was grinning from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant he moved to run away from this situation less the guy's beat him out of jealousy and the girls beat him for being  pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I...\" But as he moved to get up he felt a pair of hands wrap around his wrists and not only hold them where they where but actually made them press down harder on the things he really knew he shouldn't he touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think your going Densuke? I've been looking for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement stumped the boy enough for him to almost forget the girl was practically forcing him to grope her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to say...\" She said right before he suddenly felt his wrists being twisted and the next thing he knew he was the one on his back with her sitting on top of him. Her breasts pressing into his chest and her face inch's from his. \"...Welcome to the Eiken club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats when their lips met.</span></div></div>",

And 3 you have a boy wedged between your breasts struggling to breath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true enough. Kirika had (like so many other things) crammed the boy between her breasts before dashing off to the club, wrapping her arms around his body (and her hands of his behind) while burying his head between her mammorys so deeply that he couldn't breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d She said simply and let him down.

Why did you bring me here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored the 'big boobed giant' comment. It wasn't like she didn't consider it a compliment anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I did was bring you to your new clubhouse.\" She grinned before spreading her arms wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and saw the clubhouse, it wasn't all that different from an ordinary house, if you ignore the giant robot in the corner that is.\u201dWelcome to the Eiken club\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Eiken club.' He thought. \u201cHey wait I've never heard of this club. It wasn't on the school club list anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn her grin was getting annoying. \u201cOh that's because were a very exclusive club. Only the best, brightest and most 'talented' individuals get to join.\u201d She hefted her frontal area to show what she meant by talents. \u201cAnd now I'm proud to say your a member.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brain was scrambled for a few instants before he could say anything. \u201cH-how? I'm not exactly good at anything, I'm average in all my class's and I'm not good looking or anything. So why did I join?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the remainder of that day yesterday she had whisked him all across campus. Taking him to every spot couples gather around the school and proceeded with rather extreme versions of romantic acts. Hugging him hard enough into her bosom to choke him again while staring out over the amazing view of the academy island. Forcing enough food down his throat to fill up a horse using and touching every bite to her mouth before she feed him it to give him an indirect kiss. She had never let his hand go once as he was pulled about and always made sure to be as public as possible. Calling him 'her Den den' and kissing him in front of crowds so everyone knew he belonged to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't all that surprised at how many glares he had gotten from guys. If he was a guy who didn't know how crazy this girl was he would have glared at a guy on her arm too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was yesterday. Today she had called him at home and told him that he was taking her on a date today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had tried to back out of it but she had twisted his words to mean that he wanted her to met his parents. Something he definetly didn't want. So he had dressed in his best weekend cloths and went to the designated meeting place. Ready for a day in marshmallow hell (marshmallow hell- tv trope)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* I just wish she'd hurry up. The sooner we do this the sooner its over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You don't enjoy spending time with me honey?\" A feminine voice asked right before arms cirlced him and he was pulled back into a massive female chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kirika?\" He stuttered out. His answer was a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shynes is so cute....for now at least.\" She whispered the last part into his ear and let him go. Twirling him about to come face to chest with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDensuke sorely wished he was taller, then he wouldn't be rushing to cover up a nosebleed at the sight of his.....you know. Her 99cm G cups were stuffed into a shiny black top that clearly was made for a less developed girl that didn't come close to looking decent. Moreso when he realised that almost the entire lower part of her breasts (I ran out of metaphors and analogies) was visible, and she clearly wasn't wearing a bra *gulp*. Her shorts where pretty much the same, too short and tight to look decent and showing the lower part of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say more than a few relationships were ruined that day by the uninhibited amazon, and probably any future ones he may have with other girls as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Den Den. You ready to paint the town red?\" She grinned widely. Her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he should try to protest but in all honesty he knew it wouldn't work. Besides what more could she do to him that she didn't already do yesterday?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he put on a somewhat genuine smile and said \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin widened. \"Great! Now come one I've got a ton of places we can go!\" So she grabbed onto the apparent love of her life and flung an arm around him, pressing her immense boobs into his side and making many a man groan at the unfairness of life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDensuke tensed up at the contact as his girlfriend started walking. Red as a tomato at all the stares and at the intiment contact she was giving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt his uneasiness and addressed it immediatly. \"Don't be so tense honey. Were on a date, relax.\" She said before taking the smaller ones free arms and manuvering his hand to grasp her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped as his unease and the staring only increased. Oh what a day.</span></div></div>",

Staring up at the ceiling poster of Ms September for a few moments he got up.....or at least he tried to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting his head to either side he couldn't help but give a big shit eating grin when he remembered the situation last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo either side of him was a beautiful, huge breasted blonde, both cuddled up to him quite snuggly with their heads on his chest and breasts in his sides. Both identical in appearance right down to their night clothing...nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one on the right shifted a little in her sleep before waking up, tiredly looking up at her lover before closing the distance and giving him a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both started moaning and she tried pushing it deeper, but felt herself being tugged off him by her twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now Rai.\" She mumbled. \"Tired. Go back too sleep.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl just smiled and pushed foward again onto Densukes lips. Her hands going behind his head and under the covers respectivly. This caused him to jolt enough that the other girl grunted in frustration and raised herself up, unintentionally putting her spectacular rack inches from his face..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it you two I sa...eh..ah...ah...AGGHHHH!!!\" Whatever she had been about to say was quickly forgotten when Densuke put the breast so close to his face in his mouth and act like a baby. Whatever she was wanting to do was lost as pleasure built up in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister looked hurt \"Hey me too, me too!\" She whined before moving Rai aside and pushing her own breast in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this may seem like your typical male fantasy. Having blonde twins with breasts the size of their head sharing you in a bed may seem like a dream come true, but for Densuke Mifune...twas but Tuesday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasanova, ladies man, stud, Romeo, babe magnet. Any way you want to say it, it all meant the same thing. Densuke Mifune could have any girl he wanted, as many girls as he wanted, wherever he wanted at any time he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had met these two in school just last week at the academy gym. He'd been working out and scoping out some of the prospects when he spotted the two having a demonstration wrestling match for their club. He introduced himself, and a few days later they were busy trying to pin each other in his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord knows how or why he has it, it certainly didn't run in the family since his mom was the only girl dad had ever even kissed (and not that he would say it, but she was just average in the looks department), and he would know if any of his relatives had a hundred kids from a hundred different girls. All he knew was that no girl he was interested in had ever went more than two days in his company without falling head over heels for him. In his few short weeks at Zashono academy he'd spent more time getting laid than he had in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had met the track and field president Nadeshiko Gojyo on one of her laps round the island. He certainly had not improved her belief in relationships after he'd added a few seconds onto her time with weak knees and jelly legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne afternoon and a flawless audition as Romeo that set every female viewing a quiver, theater club president Yuu Kurumeno had him join her in a private audition for an R rated version of 'the emperors new cloths'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin Grace was still showering him with many gifts, and has him fly out to her 'room' every weekend, along with any 'guests' he might want to bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirika though was proving to be a problem. If he didn't keep a big gulp and protein bars next to his bed then he would be starving and dehydrated by the time she was sated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, out of all the girls he had ever met there was only one who had held out for more than a week on him, and was still holding out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo it wasn't Komon the teacher, he didn't want to get her in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr Komoe or Kyoko, one was still a kid despite was an early estrogen explosion said otherwise, and he was waiting for the blunettes growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly wasn't Yuriko...her small chest did not counter balance her personality and make a lay 'worth it' like it did with Kirika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo his prize was the one girl who had enough strength of will, and shyness to overcome his sexual charisma. Chiharu Shinonome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn though if he wasn't still going to try. She was the last one left in the 'sexiest girls in Zashono' list printed in the newsletter that he didn't have eating out of his hand yet, and Densuke Mifune always got the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone wanna wake Hikaru up?\" He nodded towards the legs sticking out of the bed, leading up under the covers until it reached his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis reply was to have the boobs returned to his mouth to resume sucking. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Note: This story starts in chapter 8 of the Eiken manga and continues on from there.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirika was definitely a strange girl. The leader of the Eiken club, Kirkia was a young girl with over sized breasts and a very mischievous personality. She had no inhibitions, often teased her fellow club members and would grope their large breasts as well. She also treated Densuke like a boy toy, often crushing him in her breasts, or dressing him up in girl outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the strangest thing about Kirika were her allergies. Whenever she got sick or her allergies acted up, Kirika's personality would become sweet, innocent, and childish. Apparently, whenever she got sick, her brain would become altered slightly, resulting in a different personality. This had happened so many times now that the Eiken club was used to it and just waited for it go away. But the episodes became more frequent, and the switching of personalities started to have a strain on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Kirika got sick and changed back into her nice girl persona. While she was like this, she encountered Densuke, and spend some time with him before she passed from her fever. But this time was different. After so many times of changing personalities, her mind became stuck on its nice persona. The mind could only handle some much personality switching before it finally gave up and had one of the two personalities of Kirika become the dominant one, in this case the nice one. This was the start of a brand new Kirika, and a whole new life for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut none of that was going through Densuke's mind at that moment as he was watching Kirika, sleeping in a hospital bed. The other Eiken club members had explained to Densuke about Kirika's different personalities on the way to the hospital. The doctor had assured them that Kirika would be find, but she would need plenty of rest. the other Eiken members had already left, leaving Densuke to look after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kirika slept, Densuke recalled all of the days events. He remembered how sweet Kirika was, how she cleaned and washed, and made snacks for him. he enjoyed Kirika acting like that, and for the first time he realized how beautiful Kirika was. She had a great body, a pretty face, and to him, she was beautiful. She was even more beautiful then Chiharu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat started an argument in Densuke's mind. For months, he had been crushing on the shy and beautiful Chiharu. But when Kirika started acting sweet to him, it reminded him of Chiharu, except even more beautiful. Densuke didn't want to admit it, but he was developing feelings for Kirika. But wouldn't lead anywhere, he decided. any minute now, Kirika would wake up and be her old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Where am I?\" Densuke was snapped out of his thoughts by Kirika waking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your in the hospital. You fainted, remember/\" Densuke was confused at how Kirka was acting. Wasn't she supposed to be back to normal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you brought me here?\" When Densuke nodded, Kirika started sobbing tears of joy and and Densuke a big hug. 'Thank you so much, Densuke!\" I didn't know you carried about me so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDnesuke, who was being smothered in Kirika's giant breasts, was startled by what was going on. According to what the others told him, Kirika should have started acting like her old self, but she still acting different. Even the way she hugged him was different. Instead of forcibly stuffing him into her breasts, Kirika was gently pushing him into them, making it more enjoyable then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Densuke...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Densuke, trying but failing not to blush. The way she sound so nervous was cute, and didn't help that he was in her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I get out of the hospital...  do you want to hang out sometime?\" Startled, Densuke pulled himself of her cleavage. Did Kirika just ask him out? Kirika, upset that she may have said the wrong thing started panicking. \"It's okay if you don't want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Densuke was becoming upset after seeing tears in Kirika's eyes. \"I mean, of course I want to hang around you. I really like you, Kirika.\" Densuke found himself in another hug by Kirika, who was giggling happily. He had no idea what was going on, but decided to let thing work themselves out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside the room, the other members of the Eiken club were confused. \"\"What's wrong with Kirika?\" Komoe voiced the concern of the entire club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko just shrugged. 'Whatever. I'm sure she will be back to normal soon enough.\" The other members agreed with Kyoko on her opinion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept Chiharu. When she heard Kirika ask Densuke out, she felt a rush of jealousy. She hoped that Kyoko was right and that Kirika would start acting like her old self again soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do follow next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So all Oak needed year after year were those three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the induction's were over he could get back to his reasearch on that pokemon he found this morning that after hours of combined effort from every pokemon he had at the farm he managed to catch D....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEEEYYYY WAAAIIITTT!!!\" Came a shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOak turned around and saw a boy running up to him as fast as he could. Stopping right in front of him gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Huff* *Huff* Sorry I'm late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Late? Oh wait your delilah's boy Ash right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep that's me. I've come for my first pokeon. A Squirtle.\" He said hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOak gave him a sad smile. He could see the eagerness in the young man's eye's and this was something he hated to do. \"I'm sorry Ash but squirtle was already taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" He said disipointed. \"Bulbasaur then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but Bulbasaur to. I'm afraid they were all taken quite a bit before you got here. Judging by your look I'd say you slept in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" The boy slouched over before looking at him pitifully. \"You mean theyre arn't any pokemon left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOak was about to cpnfirm when he stopped. Didn't he catch a Pikachu this morning to test out his new pokeball's. Electric types weren't the best starter's but it would have to do. \"Well I do have one.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ==================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the lab proffesor Oak brought the pajama clad boy in front of the terminal were trainer's take their first pokemon. He pressed the center and a hidden foursth ball rose up from the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's name is Pikachu. Be careful now it's rather difficult with new trainer's.\" He said smiling as the young man's eye's lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this is great.\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just be careful not to release it yet. Remember I did say it was difficult with people and I'd rather it not destroy my equipment.\" He said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded. \"Thank's for everything proffesor.\" He then ran out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved after him til he was gone. He alway's got a lot of joy with helping trainer's start their journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then time to begin work with.....were'd the pokeball go?\" He'd left it on the table just hours ago and he was sure no-one had touched it.<br>\r\n======================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye mom.\" Ash said as he hefted his bag over hius shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Ash. Stay safe and on't forget to change your underwear.\" Delilah Ketchum shouted out happily much to the displeasure of her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the pokeball containing his new pokemon. \"Well Pikachu this is the start of our journey buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long to get out of town were he almost immediatly saw an oppertunity to get more pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey a pidgey.\" He said and whipped out his pokedex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pidgey: The Tiny bird Pokemon*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Very docile. If attacked, it will often kick up sand to protect itself rather than fight back. *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've just got to catch this.\" He pulled out his pokeball and threw it into the air. \"GGGOOO PIKACHU!!!\" He shouted before the ball split in mid air releasing white light which would take the form of his new pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah there it is. It just fell under the table.\" Oak sighed with relief. He'd been searching for hours in every nock and cranny but even a genius can sometimes overlook the obvious. He picked up the pokeball and faced it away from himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get to work.\" He said as light erupted from the ball and took form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikachu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared with wide eye's. Both of the ball's containing this Pikachu and the other pokemon were identical. He'd just caught the electric mouse to test them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your here. *ACK* THEN THAT MEAN'S THAT ASH HAS....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pi-ka-CHHHUUU!!!!\" Said the pokemon as it filled the room as well as the nearby human with electricity.<br>\r\n============================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your....not  Pikachu.\" Ash said in slight fear at the pokemon that had materialised in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon stared at him with it's one glowing turquise eye. The rest of it's head was hidden by what seemed to be white hair that whipped up against a non existant wind. It's body was mostly black and vagely humanoid and had a red collar around it's head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon spoke in a voice that couldn't sound anything but sinister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..am..Darkrai.\" </span></div></div>",

Most people never even see a legendary Pokemon, yet he had actually been 'given' one as his starter Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou....your my starter Pokemon.\u201d He didn't want to find out that the professor had made a horrible mistake, which in all likelihood he probably did do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am now.\u201d Said the Pokemon that seemed to stare into the boys soul. \u201cWhat was doesnt  matter now.

Darkrai did the same, he turned his back to Ash to look over at the Pidgy in the field still happily digging up breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let us catch another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.

Their wasn't even a sign of struggle of the Pidgy trying to free itself from the ball as it locked itself, securing his capture of the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh ran over and picked up the ball proudly. Looking over to Darkrai who had what he could only guess was a pleased expression as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES! I caught a Pidgy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkrai looked at his trainers display of merriment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could tell that things were going to be very interesting for the foreseeable future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOak wallowed in despair in his lab,  sitting at his desk while half lying across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d He said sadly. \u201cA once in a lifetime chance to study a darkrai up close and I just give it away.

His hands passing over the 6 full pokeballs on his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pidgey was easy enough to capture with legendary power at his disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came a Spearow from a flock that had tried to attack the boy when he had tried to single one of them out for capture. He'd had Darkrai use disable to render them statues before picking out that one Spearow he wanted in the first place. The one with the unusual and rare colouring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was a Caterpie followed shortly by a Magicarp when he caught the little green bug by a river. He decided to use one of his new bird pokemon for these two relativly weak pokemon. He couldn't rely on Darkrai too much after all, no matter how tempting it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis last and most surprising capture was not one of the many common Pokemon that litter the path between the towns. No instead he'd come across a Pincer! An honest to horned, rare as can be in these parts Pincer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunatly for him the Pokemons physical attacks had no effect on the phantom like Darkrai. A single nightshade had taken the stubborn pokemon down like it was a Smochum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made the trip uneventful was that there had been no challange. He'd heard the professor tell storys all the time about when he was starting his first journey, along with tales of other trainers. Working hard to catch their first pokemon, to gain the trust of the starters they chosen and proving themselves to their friends and themselves. Catching a full belt of pokemon on the first day as a trainer with little effort left Ash feeling like he'd cheated somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the pokemon centre with a crude mix of a cocky stride and a shameful shuffle. He felt pleased about his aquisitions but felt that he didn't really deserve them. He walked up to the front counter and had his first encounter with a face he would meet again and again in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. How can I help you today?\" The pink haired pokemon nurse said cheerfully. The ever present smile making the boy blush slightly before unclipping his pokeball belt and handing it to the pinkette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you heal my pokemon please?\" He said politly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and took the belt, unclipping each ball and putting them on a special tray so they didn't roll all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to take these into the next room for a checkup and any care they might need. You should get them back shortly.\" She said before turning and heading into the backroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sighed and went to sit down on a nearby chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe he was here already. Even his dad took a few days to get to Viridian (Or so his mom told him) but then again Dad probably took that time to train his starter and any pokemon he caught. Ash on the other hand caught them almost without stopping to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY YOU!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pulled out of his musings when a loud female voice rang through the centre. His and a dozen other heads turned to see.....</span></div></div>",

Mismagius chants incantations, and while some cause misery, some give happiness as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA purple, robe-like shadow floated above the makeshift camp formed by Ash and his friends, having noticed their campfire, unseen by any of them. Many saw Mismagius as a sinister Pokemon, due to it's pure Ghost-type. But some weren't malevolent; just playful. And this was one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch-like creature watched as the group, consisting of two boys, a girl and a Pikachu, got up and headed to their respective tents. The taller boy looked over at his two friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, Dawn, you guys go to bed. I'm gonna put out this fire; we don't want to attract any wild Pokemon in the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMismagius silently chuckled at this. Too late, it thought to itself. After watching the group, it floated over to one tent, close enough to here what was happening, but not enough to give itself away. A yawn was fairly audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, Pikachu, I'm beat!\" It was the second boy's tent. Mismagius waited until it was certain the two of them were asleep, before poking it's head inside. It floated over to the boy and giggled. Her mouth opened and a lilac coloured powder drifted from it, over the boys body, before dissipating. At this, Mismagius left. She couldn't wait to see the boy's reaction in the morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Ash awoke and stretched. He had a really wierd dream last night... like something was in his tent with him and Pikachu, and that something happened. \"Eh... not important.\" he dismissed it. He looked around; Pikachu must've already gotten up, as his spot was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stripped of his pyjamas, and pulled on his usual outfit: his white t-shirt, his black and yellow waistcoat, his blue cargo pants, his red shoes, his dark gloves and his prized hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash began to leave his tent, he failed to notice the changes happening to his outfit. His cargo pants tightened and shortened, become a pair of denim short-shorts. His waistcoat opened by itself and split down the back, becoming two parts and shrinking down into a pair of red suspenders that went over Ash's shoulders. His white t-shirt's sleeves vanished and it slowly shrank until it exposed his midriff and turned yellow, becoming a crop top. His shoes changed as well, becoming a pair of red and white girl's sneakers. Finally, his hat became a small blue hairtie, and it pulled his unkempt black hair into a side ponytail, which was far longer than it should be regarding his hair's length. Ash's outfit and hairstyle not resembled that of his old friend, Misty of the Celadon Gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, completely oblivious to the change, exited his tent and looked around. He spotted a small note on the ground:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Ash,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone to town to get supplies. Dawn is at stream, getting washed with Pikachu. See you when I get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigned,<br>\r\nBrock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded and crumpled up his note. He decided to wait until one of them came back, and sat near their extinguished campfire.</span></div></div>",

Not to mention these girls were unaccustomed to a heavy chest from their blimped breasts. Many of the girls were turning red as they struggled with their tight uniforms becoming quite flustered as they tried to manage their clothes in vain. Buttons popped, shirts untucked exposing their cute bellies, skirts rode up, and small panties produced wedgies which the fatties would have to deal with in open sight much to their humiliation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez!

Their unfamiliar weight constantly hindered them even the simple task of walking proved troublesome. The girls hung their heads low as they looked upon one another's ruined body. The girls tried to find solace in their equally fat friends. The sporadic wailing of a girl breaking down from her clumsy girth became very common at the school. Girls would hold each other in their fluffy arms, their fat flesh squishing against each other in the process. At least when they were under the spell, they were distracted by a relentless hunger, now their fatness was unavoidable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those poor girls.\" Momoko spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its all that Omamba's fault, cursing the rice to make all the girls fat.\" Hinagiku growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look so uncomfortable.\" Yuri said staring at a girl bursting from her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really going to be like this from now on?\" Hinagiku pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe gym class will slim the girls down.\" Momoko hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Momoko's light of hope would become dim at what transpired at gym class. Yukiko the most athletic girl at school, also the first victim, was desparately trying to shed the weight. Yukiko stood there in a tight tank top and a pair of undersized shorts. Yukiko's face was red being aware of her belly hanging out from underneath her cumbersome tank top which once hung loosely on her slim figure. Her gym shorts which had fit her perfectly merely days earlier were painfully tight, riding high on her wobbly thighs as they dug deeply into her soft flesh. The other girls were in the same conundrum as poor Yukiko. Further frustrating Yukiko was the fact that she was the fattest of the lot, being the formerly ideal girl this weighed heavily on the lass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Yukiko's going to jump hurdles.\" stated a surprised girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Yukiko for you, even fat she still gives it her all.\" added an impressed girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you can do this.\" Yukiko said to herself looking at the hurdles ahead of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko began to run immediately burdened by her weight. Her fellow hefty peers cheered her on.  Having only begun, Yukiko was already sweating and rapidly losing her breath. Her body ostensibly jiggled, her belly bounced, her fat buttocks profusely swayed, her thighs quaked, and her breasts flopped up and down. A run which would have been effortless for her former body was now difficult. Filled with determination the fat girl pressed on. It was then that the strugglung Yukiko faced the hurdle. The old Yukiko could easily hop over it, but the current obese Yukiko ended up toppling over it barely lifting her heavy body off the ground. Yukiko was too exhausted to get up and expressed her distraught through wailing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah I'm so fat!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Yukiko\" Yuri said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least she tried...\" Momoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah the other girls didn't even try.\" Hinagiku pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least they stopped eating so much.\" Momoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, eating less will make them lose weight.\" Yuri reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they'll be skinny in no time.\" Momoko cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Momoko's optimism would fall short, for a month later all of the girls were still fat. Not one of them had lost a single pound. </span></div></div>",

The computer brought up Yukiko Kawai, an ambitious, hard working athlete. \"Wow she's so thin! It's no wonder all the boys like her.\" spoke Momoko. \"Totally she must exercise like crazy.\" blurted Hinagiku. \"She must also eat very little.\" added Yuri. Yukiko's image made the three girls feel somewhat insecure about themselves, each one of them carrying an extra pound or two too many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls than went to see this Yukiko Kawai in person. Yukiko was with her boyfriend Takashi as they exercised. Yukiko was jumping over hurdles, her slim, light body gave her a gazelle like ability to gracefully flutter about. \"Wow she's even thinner than I thought!\" exclaimed Momoko. \"Yay great job Yukiko!\" clapped Takashi who was captivated by Yukiko's nimble exposition. \"Just wait until I raise the bar another 15 cm.\" Yukiko confidently answered.  Momoko and her friends than interrogated Takashi over his interest in Yukiko. Takashi smirked as he answered \"Isn't it obvious her body is so slim and supple and can make all these jumps. That's why I fell in love with her.\" The girls than studied Yukiko's physique in her tank top and shorts. She had a slender waist, rail thin arms, stick-like legs, and a tight firm butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomoko, Hinagiku, and Yuri followed Yukiko home. Apparently Yukiko's family ran a rice shop, the best one in town. \"Yukiko must have incredible will power to resist her rice. It's so yummy!\" stated Hinagiku. \"It sure is I eat there all the time.\" confirmed Yuri. \"I'll have to try it. Although I should go on a diet...\"Momoko groaned. \"Bye Takashi!\" shouted Yukiko waving goodbye to her boyfriend. Momoko and her friends took one last glimpse of the enviable Yukiko and her thin figure dressed in her school uniform. \"Boy I wish I was that thin.\" Momoko confessed as her companions nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Momoko arrived at school. She was starving from abstaining from food the night prior in attempt of losing weight to look like Yukiko Kawai. All Momoko could think of was food, images of savory meats appeared. Momoko kept visualizing mouth watering foods all the way to school. Her mirages stopped when she noticed a crowd of students had gathered to see something. \"Hey whatcha looking at?\" asked the pink haired girl. \"Just look at her will ya!\" answered the green haired Hinagiku. Momoko than laid eyes upon an obese girl waddling by stuffing her face with rice cakes. \"Ahhh Just who is that fat girl?!\" Momoko cried. \"They're saying that its Yukiko Kawai.\" replied Yuri. \"What!? No way!\" Momoko responded. However it was Yukiko, the thin, graceful athlete that they studied yesterday. Yukiko's sought after slim figure was smothered in jiggly fat. Her slender legs were thick and chunky, those boney arms of hers were flabby, her thin hands were pudgy, her small breasts had ballooned, now resting heavily upon her huge portruding belly no longer the flat stomach of yesterday. Her narrow waist was now fat and wide accompanied by a bulbous muffintop. The ass which was so tone was now big and gelatinous, shaking with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi approached \"What happened Yukiko? Why are you so fat and eating so much?\" \"Nom Nom I can't help myself.\" Yukiko answered with a mouth full of rice. \"Its just so good.\" she added before taking more bites. \"Fine do what you want.\" Takashi grunted as he ran off in disgust. \"Wait don't go! Nom Nom\" Yukiko wailed as she chomped into more rice. Momoko and the others approached the feasting Yukiko. Up close they saw how taut her uniform was. Buttons neared popping, the seams were tearing, the fabric was straining, her shirt was able to be tucked, and her skirt was incapable of covering her seeping ass which wore a pair of riping undersized panties. \"Why don't you just stop eating?\" suggested Yuri. \"Nom nom I can't help myself.\" said Yukiko munching on her snacks. \"It happened this morning I started eating breakfast and I couldn't stop. Food has never tasted so good. I keep eating and eating and my body gets fatter and fatter but I want to keep eating nom.\" Yukiko divulged her morning experience. \"I just have to eat more!\" bellowed the hungry Yukiko reaching in her pink backpack for more. Her backpack was crammed full of her family's rice cakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomoko, Hinagiku, and Yuri...</span></div></div>",

The three inquisitive girls trailed the fat Yukiko, curious of the girl's sudden weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its just so unusual.\" remarked Yuri focusing on Yukiko's quaking buttocks. \"Yeah how could a thin girl like Yukiko fatten up so much over night?\" Hinagiku wondered. <br>\r\n\"She keeps making a pig of herself.\" added Momoko. \"Yeah if she keeps eating like that Yukiko's going to be the fattest girl in the city.\" commented Hinagiku. \"Yukiko forced herself to stick to a strict diet her whole life up until today, I bet you anything she couldn't handle the pressure anymore, so she snapped and started chowing like crazy.\" reasoned a collective Yuri. \"But doesn't that seem strange.\" retorted Momoko watching Yukiko get out of breath from merely walking. \"Totally it doesn't matter how much you eat, you shouldn't get that gigantic in a single night.\" Hinagiku stated staring at Yukiko's peeking butt crack. \"You should never underestimate the metabolic mysteries of the female body.\" Yuri advised pulling out a rice cake from Yukiko's family shop. \"Yuri's right we shouldn't worry about being thin. Yukiko did and look what happened to her.\" Momoko said. \"Yeah diets are stupid!\" Hinagiku concurred. \"Agreed.\" chirped Yuri handing each of her friends a rice cake.  \"Thanks Yuri!\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls took a bite out of the rice cakes and experienced a sudden hunger unusually intense.  \"Hey you were right Yuri these are great!\" Momoko declared. \"Yeah I can see why Yukiko snapped, depriving yourself of these for so long would drive a girl to madness.\" muffled Hinagiku. \"Oh my! This is better than usual.\" Yuri stated. The girls rapidly finished their snack and were left craving more. \"Yuri you got more right?\" begged Momoko. \"No I don't. Oh I should've purchased more.\" pouted Yuri. \"Ugghh I'm so hungry!!!!\" whined Hinagiku. \"Me too I just have to have more.\" Yuri resolved. \"Should we go buy more? Or maybe ask Yukiko for some.\" Momoko suggested watching Yukiko cram rice in her mullet with envy.</span></div></div>",

Upon arrival the three girls found themselves in a long line of hungry school girls. Waves of chattering girls begging for rice cakes swarmed into the shop with the three friends squeezing their way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez what's with all these girls?\" asked Hinagiku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess they thought Yukiko's family rice cakes were yummy too.\" Momoko grunted squished beleaguered by clamoring school girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiraculously the shop had an enormous supply of rice and manage to satisfy each girl. Girls were exiting the shop carrying carts of rice each already munching on the yummy cakes. Some of them were already chubby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Momoko exclaimed as it was her turn to order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri and Hinagiku followed all of whom placed massive orders. The girls wasting no time in satisfying their taste buds, began eating.  Quickly the rice cakes vanished, each girl rapidly growing chunky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey does anyone else's clothes feel tighter?\" asked Momoko reaching for another rice cake after finishing another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah wierd huh?\" Hinagiku replied ignorant of her swelling body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri raised a finger in the air to illustrate her hypothesis \"It's most likely all in our minds. Afterall we've been deprived of such scrumptious food for so long, our developing teenage bodies are still adjusting to a dietfree lifestyle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" the other girls agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls left the shop, each carrying a huge supply of rice cakes. Their plump bodies finding their shrinking uniforms uncomfortable. Their movements were stiff from the tight jackets, buttons were stressed from their swelling chests. Their shirts were rolling up from their ballooning tummies while their skirts were stretched exposing their widened tushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nggh My underwear keeps digging into me.\" whined Momoko reaching behind to pick out her tight underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My shirt's too tight.\" groaned Yuri unbuttoning her shirt allowing her breasts to ooze out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My thighs are rubbing together.\" pouted Hinagiku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking now posed new dilemmas for the girls as their bodies were no longer petite. They also found that their capability to walk was diminishing, no longer a casual stroll but a arduous experience that only made them even hungrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking along the path, still eating, the girls encountered Yukiko who would normally be at track practice sprinting around the track at this time. Instead Yukiko was waddling home stuffing her face with rice cakes fatter than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yukiko walked up to the signaling trio. \"Mmmph oh hi girls, eating some of my family's rice cakes huh.\" Yukiko muffled through her rice filled mouth. \"Mm-Hmm We were so surprised at how tasty your family's rice cakes are.\" complimented the pink haired girl with Hinagiku nodding in agreement. \"Yes, who knew that your rice cakes would be so yummy.\" Yuri said staring at the rice cake she was holding in her hands. \"It's so funny, I used to eat them all the time, but it wasn't until breakfast that they tasted this good. They were so good that I kept eating them. I kept eating and eating and before I knew it I was fat.\" Yukiko grabbed her belly demonstrating her gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the girls kept eating despite finding Yukiko's new addiction unsettling. \"Hey Yukiko shouldn't you be at track practice?\" Momoko inquired. Yukiko lowered her head in shame \"I left early. I was so exhausted from running and I couldn't even jump over the lowest hurdle. Even my track clothes were too small. I couldn't cover anything!\" cried Yukiko covering her body subconsciously reacting to her memories of the practice. \"Yukiko...\" A sympathetic Momoko spoke. \"Wah!\" Yukiko wailed before instantly quelling her emotions with nourishing rice cakes. \"Umm Yukiko don't you think eating is the reason for your weight problems?\" Yuri asked. \"Yeah don't you think that eating all those rice cakes has made you fat.\" added a blunt Hinagiku. \"I don't know why, but eating these rice cakes makes me feel super happy. Every time my fat body upsets me, I eat a rice cake and I feel better.\" Yukiko shoved another rice cake in her mouth before finishing her description.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what she means, every rice cake I eat makes me feel good too.\" Yuri admitted picking up another treat \"Honestly I can't stop.\"  \"I feel better than ever.\" Hinagiku cheered as she raised a rice cake in the air. \"Yukiko didn't you work really hard to be so thin?\" Momoko asked. \"Yes, I ate as little as I could and exercised all the time.\" Yukiko answered. \"Yep, I knew Yukiko you clearly over did it, forcing your body to diet has caused it to revolt against you.\" Yuri explained.  \"Yep, diets only hurt you in the end.\" Momoko joyfully said feeding herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former slim track star reflected upon her past. \"You know you're right! I overworked myself and this fat proves it! I wish I never exercised in the first place.\" Yukiko declared popping a whole cake in her mouth. \"That's the spirit!\" Momoko cheered. \"Yay!\" the other two joined. However the revelry came to a halt as they found themselves bereft of the delicious rice. \"Out of rice huh? How bout you all come over? We can eat all the rice we want.\" suggested Yukiko. The other girls enthusiastically consented to Yukiko's idea.</span></div></div>",

He thought to himself, \"What is this kid planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, the tide was turning on Torchman. Lan was handing Megaman battle chips at a more frequent pace than before. Lan looked like he was exhausted, but he was nowhere as exhausted as he was before. Match growled, not understanding how the battle was turning around in Lan's favor. Fortunately for him, Lan eventually seemed to be exhausted once more, which allowed Torchman to turn the tide again. Match smiled as victory seemed assured to him once more. There's no way Lan could win at this rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan smiled, \"You think you're going to win this? Think again! I've dealt with worse sunrays on the beach, and you want to know the best way to beat the summer heat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatch raised an eyebrow quizzically. \"You think you enjoy heat more than me brat? You shouldn't be giving me, the number one pyromaniac a lesson about heat boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan chuckled, \"The best way to beat the summer heat is to enjoy it, and I enjoy it by embracing it with every portion of my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Lan took off his shirt, leaving him only in his black shorts, with the waistband of his underwear showing a bit. Match finally realized what Lan was doing. He was acting as if the orb of light was nothing more than the sun and he was on the beach. Lan's netbattling skills was too impressive for Match.

There's no way the kid will take off his pants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan breathed heavily. The heat was getting to him. Sweat trickled down his body, and he couldn't take it. This was like one of those moments in summer where all he did was lay on the floor at home because of the heat waves- it was unbearable. He just wanted to lie down and sleep off the heat like he usually does, but that wasn't an option this time. Usually, when a heat wave came to him and he was at home, he would just lie down on the cold floor in just his underwear. Lan growled, thinking that there was no way left for him to win, he surprised everyone when he took off his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatch widened his eyes, \"What the hell? Is his determination to win this battle that great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Megaman, let's finish this quickly before I get underwear tan lines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman smiled, \"Alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as they predicted, they won the match. Mr. Match fell down on his knees. \"Impossible. How did I lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman yelled, \"Lan! We did it! Lan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan had collapsed on the floor, and everyone gasped. Mayl ran and jumped off the stadium seats and landed in the battle arena. She saw that Lan was still conscious, he was just heavily breathing while smiling at the same time. Mayl's face of worry turned to a face of happiness as she realized Lan was happy that he finally won. She picked up Lan by the arm and wrapped it around her neck, and the two of them proceeded to walk out of the stadium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Lan and Mayl heard and saw Yai, Tory, and Dex running to them. \"What happened,\" asked Tory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex yelled, \"Did he lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayl shook her head, \"He won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang sighed, and then there was a moment of silence until they heard clapping. Chaud laughed, \"That was some victory out there. I can't believe how far you went to win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan chuckled, \"You're next kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud smirked and walked away. \"How admirable of you to detest losing so much and to go to such lengths to win, but how naive of you to think you can beat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked away. Mayl continued to try to take Lan to his private room, which all participants in the tournament had. Lan had fallen asleep a few moments after his encounter with Chaud, still being supported by Mayl. She excused herself to take Lan to his room. Dex tried to help, but Yai and Tory told him to give Mayl and Lan a moment. Dex hesitantly did so, not understanding why they wouldn't let him help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayl dropped Lan on a couch in his room and realized that he was still only in his underwear. She had forgotten to pick up his clothes too out of fright that any moment longer in the heated room would be detrimental to his health. Her thoughts were interrupted when she found that her neck was covered in Lan's sweat that had came from his arms while she was carrying him. She grabbed a towel and wiped Lan's body of his sweat when she came back to the situation she was in before: she realized that he was only in his white briefs, which had become slightly transparent due to the sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulped... what does she do next?</span></div></div>",

The scroll was just as large as the Forbidden scroll he stole from the Hokage's office before becoming a ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut what made it different from the large red scroll he learned the Shadow clone Jutsu from was that it had a purple cover with the symbol of the snake on it, Naruto looked around to see if anyone was around before holding the scroll close to him and running as fast as his legs could carry him to a secret place he knew about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had arrived at his secret grove with the new scroll in his arms, he looked around to make sure that he wasn't followed before opening the scroll and unrolling across the ground, Naruto's eye's went wide in a funny anime way as he beheld the amazing jutsu's written in it, but then he caught the name of the author as he skimmed through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orochimaru!\" he cried out in both anger and surprise, it hadn't been long since the sound's invasion of the leaf and the 3rd's death which still left a hole in everyone's hearts, even after Tsunade's took office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naruto would've liked to destroyed anything close to the traitorous sanin he was far more interested in seeing what this scroll contained and if it'll make him a better ninja, pushing aside his hatred and anger he studied the contents of the scroll and came upon a Jutsu that looked good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mate curse mark, a variation of the curse mark that when applied to a woman turns them into the user's obedient wife and heals any damage inflicted before they were marked, on a side note in the hands of a jinchuuriki (Tail beast hosts) it turns the marked women into hybrid demons that match their personality should the user inject tail beast chakra into them when marked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs he interested in this jutsu?</span></div></div>",

I'm gonna have to fight.\" Tsunade thought as she stands her ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade runs towards Sakura in an effort to bring her back to her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresent time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I managed to bring her back to normal and knocked her out long enough to bring her here. I run some test on her and I put a special seal on her just in case it might happen again.\" Tsunade finished explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you knew about this the whole time and never said anything.\" Kakashi said in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know and I'm sorry. I don't want the pressure getting to you having to deal with Naruto and all.\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which reminds me.

If he did, he would've said anything about it to me by now.\" Jiraya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should keep it that way for now. He'll go insane if he finds out.\" Kakashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. That's why I'm placing you as Leader of Team 7, Yamato. You're the only one in the Leaf that has the ability to keep the Tailed Beast in check.\" Tsunade stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. Where's the seal on Sakura, by the way?\" Yamato wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On her core. The same place where Naruto's seal is placed.\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" Yamato said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're counting on you, Yamato. Good luck and keep my student alive.\" Tsunade said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back at Tenchi Bridge, Yamato remained behind everyone and watches how this will unfold. Sai keeps his emotionless expression on him while Naruto tries to wrap his mind on what's going on. Sakura still has the cloak of the Nine-Tailed Fox surrounding her and Kabuto just stand there with an impressive look on his face at what he's seeing. They then hear footsteps coming towards them and they all turned to see Orochimaru coming back to the bridge with his face sliced to reveal another face. Orochimaru fixes his own face by putting his skin back on him and looks back in at the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, I am intrigued by you, my little pink flower. I'd never thought that the Leaf would be possessing two Jinchurikis of the Nine-Tails. Looks like you found yourself a fellow Jinchuriki sister, Naruto.\" Orochimaru chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was infuriated by that comment while still trying to figure out how Sakura has the Nine-Tails's Chakra too. Sakura was looking straight in Orochimaru's eyes with blood lust in hers while crouching on the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I wonder how Sasuke would feel if he sees the pink kunoichi holding such power and never realized it before? Maybe we'll put her against him so he can stretch his wings for a bit.\" Orochimaru suggested with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it.\" Sakura said in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Orochimaru thought in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when two more tails grew behind her and Sakura looks like she's ready to unleash Hell on Orochimaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop talking about Sasuke like that!\" Sakura demanded in rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, except Orochimaru, was then shocked as Sakura realised more of the Nine-Tails Chakra and the aura around her gets more bubbly as her anger grew. Orochimaru was impressed that Sakura can handle such power like this. Her eyes glow even more red as she looks at Orochimaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you ever talk about Sasuke like he's your toy! Especially in front of me, you son of a bitch!\" Sakura roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air starts to get thick as the Chakra starts getting out of control. Everyone tried to hold on tight as Sakura gets ready to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura. What's happening to you?\" Naruto thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want to see Sasuke, you'll just have to force that information out of me. Though, I don't think that's possible for someone like you.\" Orochimaru challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get over here and I'll prove you wrong!\" Sakura said as she goes after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura! Wait!\" Naruto called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru decided to play a game of cat and mouse with Sakura as he retreats into the forest with her following him. Naruto looks at the forest in shock at what he had just witnessed. His good friend, Sakura, somehow uses the Nine-Tails's Chakra to bring the pain to Orochimaru. Naruto now knows what he has to do as he goes after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto! Where are you going?!\" Yamato called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going after them. I need to know how Sakura got the Nine-Tails's Chakra and make sure that she's alright.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamato wanted to tell him not to go, but he knows that once he's made up his mind on something, nothing is gonna change it. So, there's no point in arguing with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But I'm coming with you. Sai. Keep an eye on Kabuto for us until we get back.\" Yamato ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" Sai said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamato goes with Naruto to go right after the angry Sakura fighting Orochimaru.</span></div></div>",

Oh yes and here,\" Syaoran's mom said taking off her wedding ring and handing it to Syaoran.  \"Put this on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyaoran did as he was told and the ring went on easily.   He didn't know how that happen4d since his mom had thicker fingers than he did.  But the ring went on easily and stayed on as it it was sized for his finger.  Syaoran went to his mother's room to put on her clothes.  He took off his tie first, then jumper and blouse next.  Finally he removed his maryjanes and his white tights.  He was only wearing a yellow bikini styled nylon panty and a matching cami.  He suspected that his underwear had changed too, but this was the first time he saw them.  He pulled the cami over his head, but left his panty on.  Then he ;looked for what to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyaoran looked for the 'boyiest' clothing he could find.  he selected a pair of his mother's jeans and a trex t-shirt that she often wore.  he put them on and then a pair of white socks and his mom's sneakers.  The sneakers were mostly white with a little bit of pink, but not too bad.  Once he got dressed, he thought he looked like himself.  None of the clothes changed since there were already 'girls' clothing.  Except their size that is, they all fit him like they were bought in his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/JCPenney/DP0702201417504449M.tif?wid=350&amp;hei=350&amp;op_usm=.4,.8,0,0&amp;resmode=sharp2\" target=\"_blank\">https://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/JCPenne...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/JCPenney/DP0609201717514654M?\" target=\"_blank\">https://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/JCPenne...</a>$product_pdp$<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/JCPenney/DP1220201717200736M?\" target=\"_blank\">https://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/JCPenne...</a>$product_pdp$<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/JCPenney/DP0214201717031569M?\" target=\"_blank\">https://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/JCPenne...</a>$product_pdp$<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dressed, Syaoran returned to the living room to wait for his mother.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All his clothing was sized to fit his mother heavier and curvier frame.  None of the clothes had been converted to female versions of what he owned.  There was sort of a problem since his mother wasn't wearing a bra.  Her boobs sagged quite noticeably.  It didn't look right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice choices,\" Syaoran mom said.

Syaoran asked exasperatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a touch of makeup.  If you are going to go outside people will expect that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to wear makeup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a touch.  Not very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me and I'll show you.  All you need are two little things that are very easy to put on.  As a woman my age no one expects you to have your face made up all the time like you were a teenager.  But there is a couple of things you just can't go without.  The first is lipstick.  It's pretty easy to put on, just follow your lips that is all.\"  Yelan showed him how to put it on.  She said it didn't have to be perfect, it just had to give color to the lips and put on with a little care.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Syaoran was comfortable with the lipstick he asked, \"OK what else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little eye shadow. It doesn't have to be exotic.  We will use a neutral shade that goes with anything you want to wear.  Just put it on your eyelid until it is fully covered and that is it.\"  Yelan knew that to look her best there was more to it, but this was enough to just get by without anyone saying anything.  Besides Syaoran still had his own body even though people think he is her, so it didn't matter too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelan showed Syaoran how to wash the makeup off his face and told him to practice putting it on for himself.  Then the doorbell rang.  \"I'll go get it, you continue making up your face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Yelan reappeared.  \"Mom,\" she said \"it's Keyko she wants to talk to you.\"  Syaoran knew Keyko was his mother's best friend.  She comes over often.  Syaoran wasn't sure what he should do, when Yelan entered the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, everyone thinks you are me.  Just go out there and say hi.  She won't know anything is wrong, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I screw it up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't.  As long as you don't do anything totally...well something  I would never do, like say you name is Syaoran or try and go into the men's restroom, no one will think twice about anything you do.  Yelan waited in the bathroom for Syaoran to greet her friend.  Yelan knew why Keyko was here and it wouldn't take long to get rid of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Syaoran returned he had confidence that he could pull it off.  But then he wondered, \"Mom, how will you figure out who did this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple.  I'll wear you clothes.  These are guy clothes so they won't shift.  The person to put the curse on you will wonder what happened and try again.  When he does then I'll catch him.  Since you are already wearing 'girls' clothes nothing will happen to them.  This works for both of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"</span></div></div>",

He knew he had performed the spell correctly, although there Syaoran was and he wasn't wearing girl's clothing.  But something didn't seem quite right.  Eriol was looking closer at Syaoran than anyone else.  Syaoran long black hair was just as it always had been, just like his soft round face and narrow shoulders.  Nothing looked out of the ordinary, Syaoran was wearing a t-shirt that Eriol had seen on him dozens of times before.  Syaoran breasts sagged underneath it as they always had.  Syaoran's jeans were loose around his waist but taught around his hips and thighs as they always had been.  Eriol thought that Syaoran should buy some clothes that fit, but the clothes he was wearing were just regular boy clothes.  Eriol could not see even the slightest hint of feminine clothes at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelan's body underneath the clothes looked perfectly normal to Eriol and everyone else.  Yelan had swapped identities with her son not bodies so everyone expected Syaoran to look like an adult woman even though they treated him like a teenaged boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEriol was staring so intently at Syaoran's clothing that it took a moment for him to notice.  Syaoran may be dressed like a boy, but he didn't move like one.  There was something slightly feminine in the way in his manner.  \"Maybe the spell did work,\" Eriol thought.  But it didn't work the way that he had expected.  It wasn't the clothes that had been made feminine, it was his mannerisms that were effected instead.  But Eriol couldn't be sure.  Maybe the wording of the spell was wrong in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEriol approached Yelan looking intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you following me?\" Yelan asked.  Something didn't seem right with Eriol, but Yelan didn't know him well enough to know if this was normal.  He wasn't trying to use magic on her so she couldn't be sure this was the right person.  She didn't want to cast a spell on an innocent student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just wanted to say Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi then, you don't have to be so mysterious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made small talk trying to feel each other out.

You have to help me feminzies him.\" Said Eriol , grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelan could force him to remove the cursed but she felt what ever game he wanted to play.

When a spell that was directed right at Eriol wouldn't work, Yelan tried something that was directed at all the people in a certain area.  This would include her but she was sure it would work.  Yelan used a youthening spell which made everyone within say 20 feet of her younger (including herself).  Eriol was on the defense for a spell that was directed against him, but wouldn't look for something that was directed against everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the game went on, both Yelan and Eriol got younger.

Reading at a grade many time's his year group and coming up with idea's that to most adult's upon hearing it would mearly sound like the humourous rambling's of a child, if you actually thought about what he said you would realise he had a great idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunatly this intelligence would fall into disuse. Surfacing only as a flash of inspiration and a stroke of genius. Why? Well it's because of the first day he went to pre-k. The day he met Kim Possible, his first real friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis intellectual growth began to slow when he became the red head's freind. No longer did he have to pass the time by learning and studying. Not when their were games to be played. Another factor in his stagnating intellect were Kim's family. Alway's telling her that 'anything's possible for a possible'. Alway's helping her along and encouraging her. While at the same time unintentionally sending Ron who at this pint was though still highly observent if not naive a message. In his young mind he deduced that 'If anything was Possible for a Possible. Then since he was not a possible then he was capable of nothing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't go exactly like that but it was pretty much th same thing. This new lack of studying coupled with this naive realisation stuck with him and ended up turning him into the high potentialed slacker he was today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then. Let's see what would happen if Ron met someone else if pre-k. Someone like, Oh I don't know, how about....Bonnie Rockwaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung Ron Stoppable looked out over the playground looking for something to do. His parent's hadn't let him bring that 'the return of the king' book he'd been reading and insisted he try to make some friend's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a bunch of boy's playing soccer. That was out since it was already 3 against three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome girl's playing jump rope. He was a kindergartener and even he knew that would brand him a girl for a considerable period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's see. Girl's playing jack's. Some kid's hanging from the jungle jim. A red head girl getting piked on by bully's. Boy's playing with acti....what was the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to the tree near the corner of the yard and saw a red haired girl getting picked on by three, rather strange looking boy's. The girl looked like she was going to cry. If his parent's had taught him anything that he hadn't already learned himself it was that making people, especially girl's was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steeled himself and took only two step's when a cry broke over the playground. He saw one of the kid's that had been holding onto the jungle jim had somehow got herself stuck. Well not so much stuck as she was hanging from the highest point and looked to scarred to jump down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Ron's mind some one who was already crying was more in need than someone who has yet two so he rushed over to help the girl on the climbing frame and called up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jump.\" The girl hanging on for dear life shook her head furiously. \"Uh uh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon just said back. \"It's alright. I'll catch you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at him for a few second's befroe replying.\"Promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and held his small arm's out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to be good enough for the girl as she let go and fell down to be caught by him...actually not caught by him as much as him grabbing underneath her just before she hit the ground to cushion her fall which wasn't all that big to anyone who wasn't a small child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saved me.\" The girl cheered happily as she gave the boy his first non familial hug. She pulled away and said to the boy with a wide smile. \"Wanna be friend's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked at her for a few moment's. His mom and da d did say he needed some rel freind's instead of just Rufus. He nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Let's go play on the tetter totter.\" The girl said pulling him in a demanding way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ron.\" The boy said as the girl pulled him. The girl turned again to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Bonnie.\" She said before continuing to drag him to the yard toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with the young red head it was not thank's to the help of a young blonde boy that saved her but a small african american girl. The two quickly became friend's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the playground an older redhead looked into it in confusion. That was not how thing's were meant to happen. She hoped this wouldn't effect her own timeline before she disipeared in a swirling vortex.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now I know what your thinking. Won't Ron growing up with Bonnie instead of Kim just make the problem of his growth being stunted worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf weve learned anything about Bonnie from the show through her rivalry with Kim that she like to be the best but from her little speech about the food chain that she believe's that the best should only associate with the best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo a Ron Stoppable who act's more like a comic bumbler would most certainly not count as the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the day they met Bonnie Rockwaller and Ron Stoppable were the best of friend's. They'd do everything together they could. Even when it was something girly like a tea party Ron just gritted his teeth and smiled. Likewise when Ron would say or do something that was beyond the young girl's understanding she would just smile and nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of their parent's thoght it was wonderful that the two had become friend's. The Stoppable's because it got the boy out of the house when he went to play at Bonnie's or was allowed to sleep over. (the kid's were young so they had  no problem with it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie's father Alex Rockwaller howeever had a differant reason. Well of course it was good that Bonnie was making freind's. What really caught the author's eye though was that the boy was far more intelligent than even some adult's. Three thing's were obvious to him one was that this boy had an enormous amount of potential. Second was that his parent's didn't seem to notice or care and third was that it seemed to be rubbing off on Bonnie. Which was exactly what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie was alway's trying to follow what Ron was trying to say or do. He would explain it to her and she'd try to copy him. Even after he went home the boy's intelligence and mannerism's were starting to show in his daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time past however he noticed that Ron was exibiting less intelligence as Bonnie got moreso and older. He realised that she was starting to act like her mother and bratty older sister's which she was left to when Ron wasn't around and he was researching for a novel. This had the side effect of pushing around the blonde boy and giving him less and less room to speak or do what he want's. If this kept up then he might turn into a repressive. Someone with a genius mind but almost an idiot on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't let that happen. The boy was to smart and had too much potential for him to become his daughter's sidekick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo whenever she started acting like her sister's or mother he always made sure to admonish her, then immediatly afterward's try to give Ron a confidence boost in the hope's the boy wouldn't repress his genius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed in relief when it started to work. Ron came back full force and his daughter was saved the horror's of becoming like her sister's and mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly he loved the woman but she was to much of a perfectionist for his liking and alway's acted like her daughter's wouldn't harm a fly even if they were pulling off it's wing's right in front of her. He loved his older girl's as well but he hated the way their mother's attitude had ruined them. They literally did whatever they wanted when he wasn't around and if he knew what they did and tried to punish them that was the only time he'd ever see his wife get angry. Those girl's could kick a kitten in front of her but she'd just comment how nicely they were playing with the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it continued this way. Where he would stagnate with Kim Possible as his best friend he would now continue to grow. His ability and intelligence would skyrocket in the upcoming year's. He became particularly skilled in the field of engineering which was discovered by both his parent's and the Rockwaller's when he was over one day and fixed Mr Rockwaller's car in only ten minute's. He also became a whiz at cooking. His mother had more than willingly handed him her apron when she tried a cake he'd made with her help. Of course she was still their to help him with the more dangerous stuff. Just because she wasn't all that intersted in her son didn't mean she didn't love him and wanted him to get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth family's had been struggling to fit their pant's until the boy started making healthier foods that were no less mouth watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he planned Bonnie also benifitted from her friend's mind. Alway's scoring in the top 5 in school. She had yet to show any specific interest's in an intellectual subject but was quite good at the thing's she did do. She was doing very well in her ballet lesson's and he was proud when she aked him about his writing and chuckled when she looked like she was trying to understand what he was talking about yet failing miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow. What's say we skip ahead a few year's to middle school were Bonnie met's Kim when she tries out for cheerleading.</span></div></div>",

It was clear that all she saw when she looked at the boy was the girl she never had and that was the end it for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you asked Mr Stoppable he'd say he was special in the essence that they're wasn't anyone quite like his son. Again that wasn't meant positively but he wasn't nearly as bad as his wife. He had wanted a son after all. Of course not quite like Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was a walking eccentricity. His mannerisms, seemingly inbuilt perpetual frustration and boredom and his fixations with things to the point of obsession made his parents believe he had some form of handicap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctors could find nothing wrong with him physically so they suggested a child psychologist, much to Mrs Stoppable's dismay at the money they had to pay for it they sent him for a session the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they came to pick Ron up the therapist said he had found the source of Ron's apparent 'condition'. They were stunned that it had been found so quickly... (with Mrs Stoppable only reinforcing the feeling that money had been wasted.) \u2026 and asked him what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled before leading them inside and pointing to the couch their son was on. Giving them the shock of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir in the middle of a pile of toys sat Ron. For the first time since they could remember he looked to be enjoying himself. Which was strange since he already had as many toys as any other child. He was playing with the colourful cube in his hand, effortlessly matching the....colours..in ...se-conds.....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealisation hit them like a freight train as they got a good look at the toys. No, not toys, puzzles. Ron was surrounded by just about every puzzle game you could get your hands on. The rubik's cube he had just picked up and finished, a jigsaw that they would take hours to complete themselves, a chain link game that sat scattered about the room. Puzzles of almost every size and difficulty lay about their son each showing that they had been completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe's a prodigy.\u201d Said the therapist. \u201cThe reason he's so bored and frustrated is because the environment he's forced to live in doesn't present enough challenge for a mind like his to properly push itself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoppable's minds kicked into high gear. This was actually the furthest thing from their minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ron continued with his games the Stoppable's talked with the therapist about what they should do. He explained that if left alone then Ron would eventually conform to the world around him, his genius would suffer greatly though and leave them with a son with a repressed genius, one who would most likely be prone to only fits of brilliance in between long periods of laziness, prolonged childishness and feelings of inferiority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir second option was to capitalise on his genius. If they encourage him and get the right education for him then they're was no limit to what Ron could do. This option might cost them now but it will 'definitely' pay off in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the Stoppable's  this was the silver lining they'd been looking for. One that took the silver lining right out of their pockets and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts name was the 'Zavier' pre-school for the gifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I know, bad joke.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt cost them a pretty penny. Six hundred thousand pretty pennies they couldn't argue with the school's apparent results. Within the relatively short period of the 2 decades the school had been running every graduate had went on to prestigious schools and the first few class's when it first opened ended up in the ivy league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this is where we find Young Ron Stoppable. In a pre school for the gifted on the other side of town to the one he 'would' have been going to. One where a certain young girl was being rescued by a dark skinned young girl from three 'weird' looking little kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside 'that pre- school a teenage redhead looked puzzled at the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where the heck is Ron?'<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since early childhood was able to grasp concepts some adults let alone a chilld his age should be able to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents though did not seem to notice their young prodigy. They were to caught up in their own lives and happiness to notice when their son was able to read his father's advanced algebra books as easily as reading 'green egg's and ham'. They never asked his opinion about anything even when it was something to do with him like most parents do to develop their childs social skills and made those decisions without even telling him. They alway's found a way to not be around him even on day's important to him like school play's and the like. Usually leaving him with a babysitter while they went out to enjoy the life that they believed was cut short because of their son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis intelligence was also a subject for ridicule by children his age who thought the big words he used or they way he talked about things they couldn't understand was strange so they left him alone. His only friend was an imaginary one he created named Rufus. It was one of the best days in his life when he met Kim Possible and the two became best friends for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was neglect like this along with several other key traumatic experiences that scarred the little genius to such a degree that it changed him from a prodigy into the lazy seemingly dim witted slacker that he was today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever what if we remove the key Trauma from his life that was most likley the breaking point for him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if Ron Stoppable never went to Camp Wannaweep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat means no fear of bug's. No bullying from both the campers and the camp counciler's. No ignored phone calls from his mom as proof she didn't care and most important of all no fear of monkey's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he stayed at home. His mind in tact and untouched by the many fears that would encompass him and hinder his intelligence to such a degree that he would be known as the school loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow.

He was back to being the school lay about who'd never had a girl so much as have a romantic thought about him (except Tara but that didn't make sense to her either). He hadn't been exposed to anything on a mission that she'd known about and his 'devil may care' attitude hadn't changed. So why was the schools female population so interested in her best friend now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief from the comments and sighing came moment's later in the form of the school's constant substitute. Steve Barkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis man was yet another one on the 'Possible' weird list tight up their with Drakken's skin, the content's of mystery meat and Ron's...everything. For the past year since Barkin had first subbed for her math's class he had somehow subbed for every other class she'd had since then. He was even the coach for the school football team and cheer squad. Stranger still was from what she heard in the halls and from other kid's were no mentions of any other teacher except Barkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she thought about it he was the 'only' teacher she'd ever seen even around the school. Next to him, the librarian, the janitor and the lunch lady there were no other adult to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangeness aside his presence did it's job of focusing the attention of of Ron and onto himself.

Wade even 'Bonnie' is head over heel's for him. I saw her squeling like a little girl when she smiled at him. He has two girls on his arm at any time and Tara actually 'fainted' when he kissed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah.\" Said the boy simply. \"Well I did all the test's I could using the scan's you gave me and the feedback I got from Ron's tracker chip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that just told you were he was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It also tell's give me info on your health and conditions just in case.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh then...wait. Do you have 'me' chipped?\" She said with a voice that could turn hair white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe coughed into his hand nervously \"Anyway, I looked over all the info and from what I could tell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" She leaned in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at the screen for who knows how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That can't be right. What about some kind of ray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy shook his head \"No energy signiture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some kind of chemical, an airborne pheremone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy shook his head again \"His system's clean and no pheremones detected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting desperate. \"Hypnosis, his Monkey magic is hypnotising them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked at her like she was crazy but shook his head. \"Even 'magic' gives off an energy signiture Kim, if he'd used it I woulda known, besides his brain signiure is actually 'under' normal parameters, you'd need at least 50 times the normal parameter to even try to use hypnosise without a device.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! He's using a machine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kim I...\" But the kimmunicator was turned off before he could explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Ron.\" She sid with an edged tone. \"Time to end this nightmare.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In retrospect carrying 99 million dollars around with you was a rather stupid move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again those where the kind of moves that Ron Stoppable was famous for. It was for his new money which he didn't have the sense to leave with his cash concious father it was all to simple for Drakken to take it for himself. Or he would have if he'd rembembered to pick up the cash on the way out of his exploding lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim and Wade were still wondering about Ron's claim about carrying the cash everywhere on his person. His cloth's didn't bulge from the bill's. None of his new posse carried a case or anything which might contain the money and Ron had no card or cheque book to make transactions with. He just seemed to pull the money out of thin air. Yet another thing about him that defied the law's of science.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they'd gotten back to middleton Ron had made several realisations about his big headyness that occoured every time something cool happened to him. This time though he'd managed to make the discovery 'without' losing the thing that made him big headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all he'd broken up with Bonnie when he realised that a girl who was admittedly going out with him just for his money could never work in the long run no matter if she is one of the hottest girl's in school. She'd tried to get him to change his mind using her 'girlish' charm but he'd been adamant and she'd immediatly fell back into calling him a loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the posse. Though they did make him look cooler all they did was live off his money and make him buy things he didn't need. He was down to 64 million as it was including the pricy 15 million dollar jet and robot pilot that got scrapped. They'd been surprisingly cool about it and went off to be the posse of 'some other rich dude' as they called him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that he'd talked with his parent's who took it well..........okay well was not the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom had fainted at the prospect of her son being rich. His dad though had turned so red from anger he almost turned into a redhead before exploding. He was an actuary and worked with math and money for a living. He couldn't believe that his son could blow so much money in such a short time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the scolding of a lifetime (see bleeding out of ear's from ceaseless talk) he agreed with his parent's to put some of the money into investmant's for the future to make up for the money he 'wasted' and most of it into a secure account that requiered both of them to access. He also got two week's grounding. It was three month's but he'd cut it down considerably when he offered to pay of the rest of the mortgage on the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also allowed to use the money for several other purpose's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's find out those purpose's shall we?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With whom he had been best friend's since Pre K. Who had never even made a joking comment about dating him, had today all but declared that she was completly and totally in love with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier she had ben all over the place. One minute happy and the next angry then crying her eye's out. Now he knew that some girl's had mood swing's but he was pretty sure that those didn't occur every 5 second's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo somehow he'd ended up taking her to the fair on a date. It was here that she'd ran off crying  after he had to reject her. He'd thought about this sort of thing for a long time but this really wasn't how he'd pictured it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediatly after she ran aay he ran into Dr Bortle. A scientist who specialised in mind manipulation who told him that his Moodulator chip was controlling her. Unfortunatly that's all Drakken needed to here as he attached a device that supercharged machine's to the moodulator controller and fried it's circuit's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fool do you have any idea what you've done?\" Shouted Bortle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I've taken control of Kim Possible.\" Sneered Drakken in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBortle snatched the controller away and went slack jawed in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. It is as I feared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's as you feared?\" Asked Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The incredible surge of power resulting from when this blue skinned idiot...\" \"Hey.\" \"...attached the supercharger to the controller has resulted in the chip amplifying her current emotional state a hundred fold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can just you know, get the chip off right.\" Asked a nervous Ron who grew more nervous when Bortle shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not. The power surge also blew out the chip. However since the chip was working with the brain it has merged the programme with the girl's mind leaving no chance bar brain surgery to corect it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBortle then looked away from the controller and up too Ron and showed him the image on the small screen indicating Kim's current emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless treated with that surgery.

Trying to show both fear and joy at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head snapped to the right and his face made it's decision. Shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople where flying left and right as something made it's way through the fair crowd until it threw the last person seprating it from Ron to the curb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Kim. Standing their with a look 10 times more prounonced than what she had been giving him all day. Her breathing was laboured though she was not tired and if theyre was any more love evident in her eyes he feared they might take the shape of hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ronnie...\" She sayed slowly and filled with intent. She began taking the last few step's toward's him with a gate to her walk fo emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped audibly. It 'was' every hormonal teenage boy's dream to have a girl come on to them like this but not like this. Not because of mind control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim I don't think...\" He was silenced when the girl pressd her finger to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh. Nothing you say will get me to stop.\" She said as she reached for his arm only for him to yank it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Kim but I can't. Your not you right now and it wouldn't be right. We gotta go see your mom to get you fixed.\" He said calmly. Too which the response from the red head was for her to quickly grab his arm and force him into a wall and pin him down. She looked into his eye's. Were their was once gentle admiration in them there was now crazy love. Like the people who stalk someone they like and collect their hairs and garbage in a shrine to them. They had the same love in them but now their was more than a hint of anger and what scared Ron most. Lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your going to accept my feeling for you Ron Stoppable.\" She pressed him harder to the wall. Her face inch's from his. \"Even if I have to force you too!\" She said seethingly before forcing her lip's onto his in a powerful to the point of painful kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was caught off guard when this seemingly angry girl forcefully pressed her lips to his into a very 'unenjoyable kiss. If she pressed any harder he felt like if and when she pulled away that his lip's would be blue and bruised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustering all he could he managed to give one mighty twist of his whole body and shoot down between the girl's arm's to escape them before breaking off into a run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was surprised for all but a few second's before chasing after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two ran away the too older scientist's who had been gaping a moment ago regained control of their jaw's. Drakken smiled his toothy grin before laughing maniaclly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is even better than controlling her. With Kim Possible too enamored with her buffoon to care about anything else my global conquest is assured. HA HA HA!!!\" He laughed wickedly while Dr Bortle just looked at the moodulator's controller in a confused manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Kim Possible has moodulator number 1 then where is number 2?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...HA HA HA H- wait. Number 2?\" He said slightly scared. Flashbacks of how Shego had been acting today came to mind and he suddenly realised where number 2 was. \"Uh oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of people crying in terror filled the air as once more people where roughly flung to the side by a powerful force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh Dreeww.\" An all to known voice called out in a 'come hither' fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even bothering to turn around he ran in the same direction the Bufoon and his most hated enemy went. Soon followed by a now psychotically in love with him Shego.</span></div></div>",

Most ignoring the scene thinking it just a part of the fair and totally ingormant of the hanky panky that would soon be happening just shy of their sight. Just one sign of someone frantically running through the...THERE!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped off the float and with years of practiced martial arts effortlessly flowed through the crowd.

Baby goats ate my pants....AHA!\" He had a eureka moment and ran for the Ferris wheel. Pulling some money out he flashed enough at the guy to stay on for an hour and dived into the little room. Pulling the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box slowly moved up as he slid down into the floor away from the window. He saw the lights fade  from view when he hit the top of the ride and sighed in relief. With any luck Kim would give up and grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*KRUUUCKKK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bone jarring movement the ride stopped. Up in the corner a little box sounded with static.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not be alarmed. We are experiencing technical difficulties which prevent us from returning you to the ground. Keep calm and your ride will resume shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been bad news if he wanted back down on the ground at this point but he was in no hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Wonder what the problem is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be that iron rod I shoved into the cogwheels.\" A muffled voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it c....\" He turned and there was a click.

Oh you shouldn't have.\" Sjhe said before dragging him up onto one of the seats and planting herself right next to him. Hip to hip contact and a hand placed on his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped at the look in the one eye not hidden by hair. It was the kind of half lidded expression any teenage boy had seen on the 'after hours' channel when his parents were out. Plus the hand that was not very subtly drifting upward towards his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Ron Stoppable.\" He said and used her other arm to pull his head in and kiss him, far more assionatly than her last one. Her tongue stabbed between his teeth and wrestled with his own. Leaning more and more foward he soon fell back and she was laying on top of him. Moaning both soft and loudly but refusing to let him up until she was the one running out of air. \"I love you so much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for breath Ron tried to reason with her. Which was hard considering....he was hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim...It's not you.....It's the...moodulator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moodulator?\" She said playfully. Rolling her hip deliberatly from her seat on his pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little chip on the back of your neck. Made you feel all those crazy mood swings today. It caused you to fall inlove with the first dude you saw. Which was me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" He brushed the back of her neck and found no bump. She smiled and leaned down til her face was directly over his, her hair cascading over his face and bliccking out everything else but her beautful eyes \"Nope no emotion chip. Guess what I feel is genuine....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Kim It uh, guh uh.\" He lost language when she reached down and 'patted' him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....and what I feel is genuinly hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said she traced her fingers up....and his zipper down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim don't....\" He pleaded with her. This was one of his wet dreams brought to life, but he couldn't do it. Not when  it was because of some brain washing tech. He'd never forgive himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried struggling, but was quickly stopped when she grabbed him other arm and pressed herself fully on top of him capturing his lips again hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is happening Ron. Whether you want it or not...\" He said with an edged tone \"...So I'd get wanting it soon. With what I did to this thing before I climbed up we've got a good hour before it's fixed. And I mean to make it the best hour of our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed him onto the larger space of the floor. Following soon after....</span></div></div>",

Theyre cloths beneath and atop them but most certainly not 'on' them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nestled her head further into his shoulder and looked up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you still going to try and get away from me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis answer was a smile and a kiss on her lips that she just melted into. She reached up and pulled in his head to deepen it before letting go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From my number 1 Best Girlfriend? Not happening.\" He put his arms behind his hand and sighed in deep contentment which was mirrored by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CHA-CHUNK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*WHHHIIIRRR*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth suddenly moved beneath them for a second (technically fifth) time as the ride started working again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap. this things moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" The redhead asked while casually tracing a finger in her boyfriends jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we have to get up and dressed before they find to teens buck nakeds in a booth smelling like a *oof*\" He tried to get up and get ready only to find a problem, namely Kims refusal to let him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Kim. Have to get dressed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh. Don't wanna.\" She said and goosed him for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim I'm not kidding. Do you want the whole state fair to find world famous hero Kim Possible did the freaky monkey with her sidekick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutly.\" She said without a moments hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonnie will make fun of you for the next fifty years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't care.

The ride operator unlocked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright kid you can get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid?\" He looke inside only to find no one there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.

Kim held on tight to the man she loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fooled you.\" She giggled and kissed the nerve wracked boy on the nose, before pulling out her grappling gun and swinging off into the night with him in arms like a reverse Spider-Man<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere. The vivacious green vixen snuggled into her beating pillow with sheer satisfaction. The cheers of the croud onto a dozen feet away only increasing the experience for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez my back is killing me. I think blue is my new favourite colour.\" She said in a tired and breathy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it as good for you as it was for me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........decided not.\" A voice like a a chipmunk on helium who ran a marathon answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come one Drewby.\" She kissed his jaw \"You can't say you didn't enjoy that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The part where I threw my back out? Where I almost passed out from oxygen starvation when you jammed your tongue down my throat? Or the part where your powers flared up in a very sensitive area?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.

Which was kinda weird since earlier that day they'd been arguing about who had the easier life like it alway's started out in those movies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh sure they'd been able to reverse the switch between the mad scientist and the soldier he'd switched with and foiled his scheme. However their was the teeny tiny problem of the same machine 'EXPLODING' before they could get to it. Resulting in their current problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got home both their parent's were there. Mr Possible had hardly been happy that a boy, even if it was Kim's best friend was parading around in his daughter's body. Then the tweeb's butted in asking Him/her what it was like to be a girl before their mother shushed them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got progressivly worse as the day continued. Neither of them had so much as went to the bathroom during the whole change for fear of seeing 'far' more than they should have and as previously mentioned Mr Possible was quite against Ron and to a lesser extent Kim seeing what they shouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did eventually get to relieve themselves without them feeling anything. How exactly It's best not to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Ron said he needed to get home to his parent's but that was out of the question since yet again. So they ended up having to bunk with each other until they could get their hand's on another brain switching device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorst of all. Despite the complete insanuity of the situation they were 'still' expected to go to school the next day. A little more Kim style in Ron's life would do wonder's for his position on the food chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon in Kim's body however....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl/boy rubbed her/his temple and just hoped that the hours of brutal cheer practice she'd/he'd forced Ron to go through for hours all weekend would at least save some of her 'rep'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStage 1 of depression - Denial</span></div></div>",

All we remember is laying in our bed and suddenly finding ourselves in situations so fantastic that we realise it has to be a dream, which usually ends results in us waking up. Or sometimes we feel like our heads have only just hit the pillows since we have no knowledge of our time asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it's not always like that, when we lose conciousness through unatural means like fainting or in our protagonists case a fist to the head they can actually see darkness spread across their eyes until they see no more and all sense of hearing vanishs. Finding themselves in akward positions once awake once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(That was based on my own single time fainting in my life. Why do schools have to keep the windows closed and trhe heating on all the way when its the middle of freaking summer?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the case of one Ron Stoppable he had a pretty good idea of when he blacked out, and sadly found himself in a place he'd never been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room looed like it had been carved out of rock, and I mean the walls themselves not the furniture or anything, that was much more stylish. It looked minimalist. A vanity of square dimensions rather than the round ones like he'd seen in Kims room told him this was a girls bedroom. The single dresser and relativly small wardrobe told him this was a girl that probably didn't care much about fashion....or colour since it was all black and green..............uh oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Shego's room.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riight you are.\" Came a female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoom turned his head, he couldn't do much else since he was apparently tied down to whatever he was lying on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Shego, wow! He knew she was evil and all after their first encounter mere hours (or days) before but hot damn she was fine, physically he had seen other girls who had similiar figures or even better so he wasn't to blown away by that, and the pale green skin while a definite plus to her sheer exoticness, he'd been friends with Kim long enough to have resistance to a pretty girl.<br>\r\nIt was just the 'aura' she exuded. It...it was hard to describe. The way she moved, the way she talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything about her just gave off the vibe that said \"I'm bad, I'm better than any other girl,and you know it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shego? What the heck am I doing here?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snorted but walked closer to him, swaying her hips slowly until she was standing right over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Princess doesn't find you of course.\u201d She said as if it should be obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made him jump, if he could that is. \u201cKim! What did you do to her!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on what he now realised was her bed....gulp. She picked up the clock at the side of the bed and showed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:12AM<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. No one knows your even gone. I decided to hang around Middleton until you were alone and took you. Kimmy won't even know your missing til she wakes up hours from now. And by them I'll have gotten what I wanted.\u201d She purred out while holding his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-and Wha-what would that-that b-be?\u201d He stammered while her face drew closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I mention earlier how cute I thought you were?\" She whispered close to his ear. She was now sitting on his stomach and slowly unzipping her costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to get something out. But being a typical teen boy in this sort of situation he was barely able to mumble out \u201c16.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShego eyed him for a moment before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I care? And besides....\u201d She said with her faces inch's away from his. \u201c....I'm 17.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't talk for the foreseeable future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(au: De-ageing her a little makes it seem less 'wrong sick' as Ron would put it)</span></div></div>",

Through this test you can  determine who to be friends with and even determine who is your 'perfect match'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nblue fox: a born leader who can't resist a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\npink sloth: a socially inept outcast and follower, who smells of overripe fruit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Kim of course was a blue fox, she totally bought into the fad. That is until she found that 'her' perfect match was the narcissistic Senior Senior Junior. If the book said someone like her had to spend the rest of her life with someone like him then it was just a total crook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Ron was the pink sloth, right down to the old fruit waste in his pockets. No one likes being called a sloth of course and from the beginning said the test was bogus, but Kim ignored him until the whole Junior thing. He was never more relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon smiled as he watched Kim throw her book in the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're is no way a book that tells me Junior us my perfect match is something I should follow.\" She told her best friend. Although she had to admit she was digging the flowers, candy and other things the billionaire playboy was sending to win her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd tell him no later, after he sent a car that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was pleased with his best friends statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on KP. Who says we should follow a book just because it says your a blue fox and I'm a pink sloth. Ron Stoppable I....'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Your the pink sloth. *Sigh* finally.' Came a exasperated female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon turned to face the voice and almost tripped despite standing still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Amelia, 'the' Amelia. The hottest and most popular girl in school despite not even being a cheerleader. Even Bonnie went out of her way to tey and be this girls friend. She 'swayed' over to the two friends, parking herself near Ron to the point they were almost in contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh, H-hey Am-Amelia.' He stuttered as the girl looked right into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So your the pink sloth huh? I guess that means were dating now.' The girl stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone else was in the hall at that time you would have heard all become silent, instead you have to settle for Kim's jaw hanging lose and Ron's heart stopping for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim found her voice first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait wait wait. dating? You mean the pink sloth is your....'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perfect match? Yeah it totally is.' She said while taking Ron's arm and snaking hers around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And your okay with letting a book tell you who you could be with?' The teen heroine said heatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older girl nodded. 'Sure, it's got like a 99% accuracy rate. Besides I heard from this guy who heard it from this other guy that if you 'don't' date who the book says tothen you'll be cursed to never find anyone and be alone forever.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim thought for a minute, unsure what to say since that argument pretty much negated the whole 'the book isn't always right' speech she had been about to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon on the other hand was starting to come out of his trance. Of course feeling his crush holding his side nearly put him back into one but he was just barely able to stay focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You seriously plan to date me? For real!?!' The boy said in an increasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure. I mean the book did say that the pink sloth was my perfect match. You are the pink sloth right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon had to think about that. He looked at Kim who seemed to want to say something but wouldn't say it. Then he looked back at Amelia who looked ready to leave as soon as he denied it, but also ready to go with him should he accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I Ronald Stoppable and the pink sloth.' He said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia smiled. 'Perfect.' Then with no warning she moved in and kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon tensed up, like he'd been hit with a freeze ray.....again. Kim just stared at the scene with saucer eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 10 seconds later Amelia broke the kiss and let go of her new boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Since were dating now, how bout you come by my place tonight and pick me up? we'll go to the movies.' The girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Y-y-y-y-y-y-yh' The boy stammered in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled. 'Great, come by around 7. See you later....Ron.' She pecked the stupified boy on the cheek and walked away. Putting a little extra swing into her hips and looking over her shoulder smiling as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero duo just stood they're. Too far into their own states of disbelief to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be until a while later that a 'WOOOOOO HOOOO!' would erupt in the halls.</span></div></div>",

Jumba I'm not that big.\" Said Lilo a little annoyed that he'd make fun of her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet but will be. 062's flaw is that he will never stop in the fattening of you. You will get fatter and fatter until you are bigger than whole house and you cannot be moving even eyelids because they are so fat. But even then 062 will not stop fattening you until it is being contained. Is good evil experiment no\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT! I thought the 0 series was just your help. Not evil destructive one's\" Said the girl as she patted her huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True but then I am thinking that 062 could be used to make enemy's fat and helpless. Is first idea in evil series of experiments. Look Lilo best thing you can do is try to get 062 under control before he is making you too large. Underwise 'Hoo hoo' you will be thanking Jumba for making everyone'sclothing out of indestructable substance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Jumba I....\" She stopped as she heard the phone go dead. She turned and saw Frenchfry holding a pair of scissors and a cut phone. A malicous grin on it's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't 'gulp' make me bigger than the house? Would you frenchfry?\" She grew even more worried as she saw his grin widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oui.\" He said curtly as he brought his spatula like tail against the girls belly. Causing her to bounce around the room before he hit her ahagain through the skylight and outside. Landing next to stitch in a poor wooden cage.

What's worse was that when the food on the table was done all the cook experiment had to do was a tasmanian spin and Hey Presto he was holding more goody's for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the rest of the day they found with every bite that their will power was slipping and their urge to eat was growing even though they knew what would happen. Pleeki inside was a formless blob who couldnt move but he still grabbed for whatever Frenchfry gave him without hesitation. If they didn't get help soon then pretty soon they'd be gigantic blobs just like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact that was already happening. Frenchfry's food made you gain weight almost instantly so the ten minutes of constant eating had reallydone a number on them and like Jumba said Lilo was grateful that he made everyone's loth's indestructable because they should have burst a few hundred pounds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd lost the rounds and ball shaped look now looking more like their one eyed friend inside. Their huge gut's pressing down on their leg's stopping Lilo from standing even if she wanted to. Their arms were thicker than adult thighs which considering how short they were meant they could could barley move them. Their fingers looked tlike saudage's ready to burst out of the casing and unable to even wiggle them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir necks had disipeared as several chins formed and moved to rest on their shoulders and flabby chests which were now bigger than most adult womens. Their butt's big were big enough that a family of four could use them as comfertably as couch's and their gut's were so massive that not even Gantu could wrap his giant arms's around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of the last bite of cake that went down their frosting covered face's they both weighed a whopping 700lbs and were showing no signs of stopping. In fact since none of the food they were eating had even the smallest amount of nutritional value their stomach's were still growling in hunger and the longer they went on only FrenchFry's zero nutrition food the hungrier they got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they swallowed another quintuple fudge browny they saw the little french experiment whip up another plate which they were both staring at with obvious hunger. He made his way over to them when suddenly he was swatted to the side via a broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away from my little sister!.\" Threatened Nani before turning to Lilo with wide eye's. \"Well at least she used to be little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The young hawian girl and her blue dog were completly at the mercy of the experiment and now completly powerless to resist it's food. Especially now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to describe their entire bodies since their entire lower half's had completly disipeared under a wave of blubber that spread out 8 feet in every foward direction...wait make that 81/2 feet they just ate two whole birthday cakes a piece. Their arm's couldn't even reach their face's, heck they couldn't move at all since they were so short that the fat packed in them had turned them spherical, they could barely move their them a few inch's before the fat bounces them back to where they were. Not to mention their finger's were now to thick that the fat was trying to push each finger away from the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now had 6 chin's which like before pooled on their shoulder's and chest's which by the way were now guarenteed to beat even the most outragous of surgical implants and I swear you could drive a truck into either of their backside's and it would just bounce off since it had all but doubled since last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also had difficulty seeing or speaking. It didn't bother Stitch much since both his eye's and mouth took up most of his face and had very little capacity for getting fat. Lilo on the other hand looke like she had grapefruit stuffed in her cheek's. This fat forced the rest of her face up forciblymaking her shut her eye's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an absolute miracle that Lilo's cloth's han't burst right now. Jumba was a genius!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenchfry watched in glee as his  feedee's of 1512lb (Lilo) and 1678lb (Stitch is naturally heavy already) continued to expand. Watching in wonder as their gut's crep foward inch by inch across the grass, as their head sank lower and lower into the ever rising fat and they grew more and more helpless and dependent on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tazmanian spinned and produced two more plates of his namesake, with lightning speed he scaled the ever expanding mount Lilo and held the fries over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl whose vision was now little more than a squint saw the food and did her best to open her mouth with all that was frocing it to stay closed. That was all the experiment needed as he grabbed handful after handful of fries with the same quickness he cooks with and stuffing them into the girl's mouth. He grinned when he heard her 'mmmmm' in delight. Which is what he did when he felt the mountain he was standing on rise to 1524lb. He repeated the process with his cousin who grew to 1690lb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed into the house and repeated the process for a third time and watched the one eyed alien grow to 9045lb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlike looked almost the exact same as he did in the show. Despite his colossal weight his species elastic bodies allowed his to conyinually grow without fear of it inhibiting anything but his ability to walk. He could still take whatever Frenchfry made and shovel it down, he just had to feel for it since his fat had actually grown over his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlike while not as enjoyable to watch as Lilo and Stitch was still plenty enjoyable to watch. His descent into blubbery helplessness was incredibly slow but you could hear the floorboard's groan under his weight. The wall's cracking and buckling as a growing force pushed against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Frenchfry's favourite thing's about his hobby was watching as a person slowly destroyed where they were with their constant expanding. He didn't keep Lilo and Stitch in the house because with three fatty's it would have been destroyed to quickly. No he wanted this to happen slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rusjed back outside to his two favourite blob's and making two huge bowl's of ice cream for them. Stitch looked at it with a watering mouth while Lilo was just able to barely get her tongue out of her mouth to lick her lip's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenchfry smirked while on the inside he was positivly giddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could do this.......forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe probably would too<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something the little chef basically living on one of his many jowls was taking advantage of, glutting the helpless cyclops as much as he could as fast as he could, causing him to visibly swell out even further, expanded by inches in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh....Bon Appitite.\" The little experiment said in a bored tone, shoving a dozen or so doughnuts into the food hole he'd forced to stay open with some deliberatly overcooked baguets haphazardly. Sadly looking out into the yard were a much smaller blue blob and floral patterned blob were. Neither moving, neither speaking, or seeing for that matter as both were so peposorously obese that the build up of lard had made their eye lids heavier than shot puts. Even with his super strength Stitch with 13,000 pounds restricting blubber hampering his every move was able to do little more than squirm ever so slightly, and only out of desperate hunger as all of his victims were beyond starving at the moment as a result of his zero nutrition, all fat food.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As French Fry mulled around in his head about his current stagnation, a light bulb shone above his head; an idea that he couldn't believe he had forgotten. 'The birthday boy!' He remembered how Gantu had come by earlier to catch him and his efforts had failed when the chef had spun up a birthday cake to inflate the creature up. Preoccupied with Lilo, Stitch, and Pleakly, the whole affair was irrelevant to him until now. Cackling in his french tone, he pushed the bread loaves holding Pleakly's mouth open, sliding down the gelatinous yellow mass until he got to the ground with a thud. It was a shame he had to leave his three trophies behind but he knew full well he could come back and play with them later. Not to mention when Jumba came back, he could try and get the scientist to increase the girth capacity on Lilo so she could reach Pleakly's size. But for now, there was no time to waste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though they were on an island, it took French Fry a while to locate the hidden ship base of Gantu deep in the jungles of the inland. Rubbing his hands in delight, he knew there would be more fight to Gantu as well as since he loved watching his victims destroy their homes with their fat, a space ship would be a challenge to burst out of. Sneaking aboard, he began his search for the bloated shark alien as Gantu was distraught at the weight he had put on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's impossible for a creature to cause this in less than a few weeks.\" Gantu bellowed, poking his stomach gingerly as he still was retaining the fat from the birthday cake earlier. \"I'll have to go back and make that annoying experiment reverse these effects.\" He began to waddle and bounce his way to his equipment locker, the added pounds making it harder for his mass to move properly. Even holding his ray guns and capsules in his thicker hands was cumbersome. However, he didn't have to go far as the moment he turned around, Gantu found his mouth at the end of a pie the size of a manhole cover being pushed into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon Appitite!\" French Fry cheered out, tackling Gantu to the ground as the pie was shoved in to his maw, swallowing the mess as he felt his body surge with a new coating of blubber. Sitting on Gantu's puffy chest, French Fry began his new onslaught with vigor, shoving more and more sugary items into his new victim's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ergh..ppffttt...I hate...sweets!\" Gantu sputtered out from the parade of food being tossed in him, his body rapidly growing thicker and wider with each moment he had French Fry on top of him. Grasping the situation, he got a thick arm around the chef, pushing him aside as he headed for the door. \"I have to get out of here. Get the security system lock down initiated!\" Gantu yelled out, knowing full well his alien acquaintance Experiment 625, or Reuben, had shut it off since it drained power from his useless television and sandwich making devices. There was a problem though as the door slid open and Gantu exited: he couldn't move. To be more precise, his width had outgrown the parameters of the door and caused him to be wedged tightly in similar to how Lilo was thrown through the sky light of her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...stuck...Reubun! Get out here and help me!\" Gantu yelled out, pushing hard on the walls to un-pry himself, his fat legs kicking the air behind him. He felt something brush against his stomach as he saw French Fry crawl through the space between his gut and the floor with relative ease. Gantu cursed the experiment with a passion as he struggled more in his surrogate prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vile trog! Get me out of here before I blast you to ashes!\" Were the idle threats that were spewed as French Fry was loving this scenario. There was plenty of fight and resistance left in Gantu but stuck in the door, he could milk the helplessness for all it was worth. Still thinking it was his birthday, French Fry retrieved a cone party hat, tying it around the rounded face of Gantu while tying loosely around his neck a table cloth sized napkin as he whipped up a few dozen cakes with ease. Gantu's eyes widened, now knowing full well what was about to happen. \"No...please, it's not my birthday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no... Joyeux Anniversaire.\" French Fry spoke happily, shoving a fudge cake right into Gantu's pleading mouth. \"Bon Appitite!\" He was going to enjoy this. Letting the fun take hold of him, French Fry decided to...</span></div></div>",

French Fry was soaking up the fun to be had here, not rushing it like he did earlier as he let Gantu chew what was in his mouth, swallow, resist some more and then playfully feed him more much to his chagrin. Repeating the cycle again and again was perfect for the mad feeder, watching as the space between Gantu's drooping gut closing the gap between his body and the floor; doing the same with his rolls of back fat and the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gulp..stop it...gulp...I demand it...gulp...stop!\" Gantu cried out between every forcible swallow he had to endure in order to get the message across. French Fry laughed, humming his usual cooking songs as he whipped up a few dozen cookies the size of dinner plates, flinging them like frisbees into the giant maw as they traveled down his gullet and straight to his thighs, and rear, and stomach, and any other place that required the obligatory fat rolls French Fry loved to see pile up. Gantu, of course, was still determined to unwedge himself, shutting his mouth to the barage of candies in order to focus on squeezing out of his predicament; which was getting harder now that he could feed the cold plated floor brushing against his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" French Fry pondered on what to do as he wanted to check on Gantu's progress but not at the sacrifice of the feeding stopping. Getting an idea, he set up a gerry rigged hose from a bowl the size of a kiddie pool filled to the brim with ice cream. Priming the pump, he tried to get Gantu to open his mouth, tickling the plentiful chins of the alien. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha...knock it off ullp!\" Gantu was plugged up with the hose, the ice cream flowing in to him like a water balloon as the force didn't allow him to spit it out. Feeling his stomach fill with the cold treat, he tried to protest once more of his disdain for sweets as French Fry let out a blissful sigh, watching Gantu hit his first ton as his top fat was bulging out of the sides of the door on this end. Taking the opportunity before the gap closed, he slipped under the flab that was pressing down on the floor, wiggling with enough room to get into the bigger control deck that Gantu's giant rear was sticking out in, closer to the ceiling than before as the spheres of blubber jiggled madly. Watching his thick legs kick in the air from the tube feeding, French Fry teasingly gave them a tickle and his butt a slap just for his own entertainment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while taking it nice and slow, he knew that it would take much longer than before to have Gantu break out of his prison in the door as well as the whole space ship, metal not being as pliable as wood. French Fry wanted to have some additional fun but was unsure how to go about it. Thinking about it, he decided...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the creature reached her, it clamped its snout over the woman's mouth, and took in a very deep breath, puffing itself up. The woman blinked in surprise, but didn't have long to react as the creature released the air inside it through its snout and into the woman's mouth.

You'd be right of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a fourteen year old new yorker of half chinese descent and half....whatever his dad was. He enjoyed extreme sports, video games and spouting street talk that more often than not sounded like complete gibberish. He had to best friend's, Trixie who her friends and family secretly thought was better at acting like a boy than being a girl. They never tell her that though. his other friend was Arthur Spudinski who on the outside was a kid strange enough to be commited was actually just covering up the fact that he's one of if not 'the' smartest person in the city so that he could enjoy being a kid. The only thing about Jake that people wonder is why he dyes his hair green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer would be, It's not dye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Jake has a secret that 'no'one' know's about. He comes from a family of dragon's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic exists you see. All over the world is a hidden comunity of magical creatures hidden in plain sight and it's dragon's job's to defend it from the force's of evil. A job that would have went to Jake as the American Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he'd been a dragon that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some unfathomable reason Jake had been born without the magical gene that allows people to turn into dragon's just like his mother. His family except his unknowing father had waited with baited breath for him to show any sign's. Smoke from his mouth or accidental partial change's were the usual signs but he'd expressed none of these traits by his 14th birthday which is the latest you could get it. He couldn't understand what his grandfather looked so disipointed in until he saw Haley turn into a mini dragon before his very eye's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been shocked to find out the family secret so say the least. He'd been told by his grandpa that he was supposed to take the mantle of american dragon. However since he didn't have a dragon form that mantle had went to his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he'd been somewhat jealous. Not because of the whole 'save the day' thing Haley did cause he shuddered at some of the situations she got herslef into. No he had been jealous that his siter had yet 'another' thing she better at doing to lord over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat soon changed when he found that while he had free time to do as he pleased she had to focus all of her free time and some of her other time to being a magical crime fighter. Her grades slipped while his improved since less of the focus of the family was on him now. He still did all the things he enjoyed but without haveing to rush off after a call from gramps he foubd a 'lot' more time to study while she was becoming a nervous wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill sometimes he looked at his sister and wished that he was the one saving the world on a daily basis. That grampa and the rest of the family paid all their attention to while they all but forgot his name. That he was the one revered by the magical community that he'd barley even seen for 'his own safety'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes even if it's just for a second he wished he was the 'American Dragon'</span></div></div>",

An orange set of overalls stretched over him outlining his every perfectly delicious muscle, every pec and line of his 6 no 8 PACK and it still needed to be partially unzipped so it would fit. A long tail swept from side to side quickly but looking to her more like it flowed as wind it's phantom grace entrancing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brilliantly white perfect teeth would blind her if she hadn't moved her gaze into his perfect forest green eyes, challenging her to come deeper into them, deeper into his embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the dog she was going to Marry.

Since you can't go back in the sack and this place is kinda gross why don't I invite you to stay in my place for the flight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk this time he did properly blush, cluelessness only got you so far after all \"N-n-no t-thanks I HEY!\" She ignored his denials and simply pulled him over to the carrier. Ducking his head down and gently pushing him into her ultra girly pet carrier without even the slightest bit of effort. Ducking in moments later herself and closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you s-s-sure bout this.\" He muttered. \"It's kinda cramped in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind.\" She said in a sing song voice. \"I'll just shift a little and....ah there we go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Brandy your heads lying on my ch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I don't mind.\"</span></div></div>",

They like you.\" She made a 'dismissive' gesture with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually it wasn't quite that smooth. Mrs Harrington was not exactly pleased to find a grown male dog in the same carrier as and being held like a teddy by her Brandykins. Despite having a physic that most would associate with the american stereotype taking up to eleven the woman was in actuality all muscle and after ripping the metal dog carrier apart like tissue paper she made to do the same to Whiskers.....until Brandy bit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was thick skinned, her childhood having been spent doing things that would put hair on any mans chest so a bite from a spaniel mix was nothing, but she still reeled in shock when her pride and joy who she had hand picked from the family litter as her personnel companion, who she had spoiled and raised like a daughter had actually bit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched when Brandy almost immediatly returned to the huge white furred male, wrapping her arms around him again and nuzzling the exposed fur on his chest with open affection just as the blurry eyed pooch was still half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the woman wanted to do nothing more than tear Whiskers away from Brandy but the overwhelming need to pamper and spoil her little pooch soon overtook her, and she was filled with dread at the idea of Brandy atually attacking her again, hating her even for taking away a companion she so clearly desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo 4 hours later and we arrive here. Relaxing in a 5 star luxury spa with aolmost every female in sight following his every moment, the diamond studded collar dangling around his neck which unfortunatly read 'Lawrence' clinking slightly when he lay back on a deck chair next to Brandy in her polka dot swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was that about 'laying around' and 'been waited on'?\" She said while drinking a cocktail with more colours than the rainbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EH I like roughing it like camping, great from time ta time but I still want a roof and a bed ta go home to.\" He picked up his own drink from a try given to him by a winking waitress which only the growling Brandy noticed. \"Besides it was either this or the circus.....clowns.\" He shuddered before upending the entire glass into his mouth in one gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww is the puppy scared of clowns.\" She reached up ad scratchd behind his ear, causing his leg to kick drawing looks of jealousy from other girls that she just drank up.

Nothing could spoil this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCue spoiled moment in 5...4...3...2....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well Whiny Hairy-tonne....\" A nasily voice sneered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandys formally blissful expression instantly turned hard as steel. Her grip tightening on Whiskers head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Guh* Bran-dy.

A poodle with shining silver fur save for the short curls on top of her head, the puff on her tail and ends of her ears which where darker grey, dazzling green eyes and small black nose. <br>\r\nWhile brandy wore a pink bikini with black spots she wore a blue one with sea foam green wavy stripes, which many other pampered male pooches and serving stewards took notice of as she swayed over to her 'friend', her eyes locked onto the male the blonde was squeezing to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Champy!\" She said with a Stepford smile in a voice that made the great Dane heading in their direction turn 180. \"Surprise to see you here. I thought they stopped Mongrels at the door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChampagne waved her off \"Funny I see you every time I come here for my annual beauty treatments. Though I suppose with the amount of work you need you can't afford to ever leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandies hold on Whiskers tightened all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Champy lowered herself to sit on the lounger Whiskers was occupying. Without skipping a beat she raised a hand and started running her manicured paws through his fur. \"And who are you big blue and yummy?\" She punctuated the last word with a flutter of her extra long lashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandy growled \"Hey paws off you.....wait blue?\" Looking down and cringing slightly she released her mans (once again if she had her say.) throat, returning him to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Huff* Thanks.\" He gasped out while taking in air like it was going out of style. The poodle sitting next to him enjoying the look and feel of his chest rising greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like you to try squeezing the life out of a man Harrington. Afraid he'll run away if you let go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm warning you Champagne. Back off Whiskers, he's mine!\" Her growl as low and menacing as a junkyard pitbull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whiskers? Oh how cute.\" The silver poodle coed over the male and reached for one of the namesakes at the end of his nose, his tail wagged happily at the feeling, which rendered him oblivious to the look of death Ms Harrington was giving the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\" Suddenly the massive former show dog was ripped from his position and his silver would be seductress fell onto the tiles of the poolside. Brandy wrapped her arms around Whiskers perfectly chiseled bicep and dragged him inside, allowing him no more than a confused expression and a friendly wave goodbye to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChampange looked over the two as they vanished from sight with some interest. Thinking things over for a few moments before a cruel sneer marred her otherwise pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Challenge accepted you mongrel bitch.\"</span></div></div>",

Even the way she obbessed about that Jeremy boy she liked was more like that of a stalker than an actual girl interested in a guy. She put serious thought to having the girl commited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she went into the backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous structure, reaching over a hundred feet in height jutted out of her back yard casting everything in shadow. All of the neighbourhoods children, soon teens and even a few adults were swarming over it, a gigantic slide complete with loops, bumps, coffee stops and a member of the american Luge team at the top giving pointers to riders while using it as a training course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared wide eyed at the structure. Suddenly all those 'mad' stories Candace told her came rushing back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Phineus and Ferb made an elevator to the moon'<br>\r\n'Built a giant roller coaster'<br>\r\n'Giant carwash'<br>\r\n'beach in the backyard'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt......it was all true.

Eager to see the massive punishment they would get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys shot out of the slide to land at their mothers feet. Scoring perfect tens from the judges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom.\" Said the triangle head boy. \"How do you like the slide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth to speak but her daughter jumped in front of her \"AHA! BUSTED! You guys are in so much trouble. All summer, every day of being thought of as crazy was just building to this moment! Go on mom! Punish them! Hehehehehehehe.\"  She once more laughed insanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked at her boys. Looking for all the world like they didn't think they'd done anything wrong, like they hadn't been hiding these projects all summer. When she thought about it she realised that they hadn't, they'd told her and she past it off as their imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hands on her hips and and looked at them sternly. \"Well boys. Now that I know about what youve been doing all summer. I have to say that......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'YES!' Candace screamed in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here it comes!

Birds stopped singing, cars stopped passing buy, a plane passing low overhead suddenly went silent. Even the strong winds of the day suddenly dropped to nothing. It was a complete absence of noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas and Ferb, and Baljeet and Buford, Isabeela and her underlings (which is what they were), even Stacy who was usually a chatterbox stopped and stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace had sucked in her lips, but to keep her anger in check rather than be quiet. Her eye twitching, forehead vein bulging, cheeks inflating with words she very much wanted to scream at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy, not able to keep her words in for long anyway decided to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PH-IN-EA-S AND FERB!!!!!!\" Everyone was blown back by the sheer force of the scream. The world quaked around them like the fat of Candace's 400 pounds of obesity quaked on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas managed to look away from his massive, jiggling sister and up to his step brother with an expression that said he wanted answers. The green haired boy shrugged and tapped the gauge of the gigantifying ray they'd built, the meter on the control panel showing it wasn't even close to being fully charged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey never noticed a thin trail of smoke rising from the tall, oddly shaped purple building in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached forward with thickened fingers and and clutched at the enormous stomach protruding a few feet in front of her. The straining candy apple red of her top making it look like she was clutching a very overinflated dodge ball. Kneading it and feeling the soft, warm flab in between her swollen palms to her horror. She was twitching like she'd taken the jar of french roast in the kitchen and downed the whole thing raw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy walked up (cautiously) to her best friend and dared put a hand on her shoulder in what she knew was a weak attempt to comfort her. \"Candace, I need you to stay calm now ok? It's not a good idea to get super stressed right now..\" 'At your size right now too much stress might cause a heart attack' she thought but didn't say \"....Trust me everything will be o.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO IT WON'T!\" She violently pulled herself out of Stacy's grip \"NOTHING WILL EVER BE OK! NOTHING 'IS' OK! NOTHING HAS EVER 'BEEN' OK! NOTHING'S OK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm. Down. Candace.\" Stacy said gently \"So your brothers zapped you and made you bigger in all the wrong places.....\" As well as the right places since the formally pencil shaped girl now had a chest like two soccer balls, which she would be fine with if she didn't have a stomach like a beachball \"...but I'm sure with their smarts it'll be fixed in no time. Right guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids geniuses looked at each other for a second then back to Stacy. \"Well this really wasn't what the growth or 'gigantifying' ray as we like to call it, was supposed to do. But it shouldn't be to hard to come up with an ultimate weight lose ray. Ferb....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....You know what your gonna do today\" \"Aw snap.\" Buford grumbled when his Nerd/ Best friend Baljeet beat him to the punch in beating Phineas to the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Candace? Everything will be back to normal in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S THE PROBLEM STACY!\" The girl screamed, before all her anger left her like a deflating, overinflated balloon. She whispered out her next words. \"Nothings ever normal around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe best friend stayed quiet and let her get things of her well endowed chest \"My life isn't normal. It hasn't been normal since those two first learned to read.\" She pointed at her brothers. \"Every day Stacy, every single day those two defy what kids should be able to do. They revolutionise the world as we know it for 'fun'. The push the boundaries of logic and expectation........and I always end up paying for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I want Stacy.....all I ever wanted was just one day that goes as I expect it to. Wake up, have breakfast...\" Her huge stomach rumbled at the idea of food \".....spend time with Jeremy. Worry about regular stuff like if Mom made meatloaf for dinner or if I'm late for a date. One day where I haven't been turned into a giant or a platypus or....FAT!, or go to outer space or have submarines in my blood! One day where I get to be a normal teenager!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Candace the last time your brothers didn't do anything you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW! *Sigh* I know. I went totally crazy. But can you blame me.\" Her shoulder sagged even more and she started shuffling towards the house. \"I'm not an idiot. I know I act like I'm crazy all the time. That my desire to bust my brothers make me look like a whack job in front of everyone. Maybe their right....maybe I am a nutcase.\" She looked over her shoulder and watched her brothers go over the machines blueprints. Her sausage like fingers curling into her ham like fist, tearing pricking at the sides of her eyes \"...But can you blame me? It's so frustrating to go through all this and every time have no one believe me that....I...I just..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lost whatever she was going to say and just ran for the house. He immense form bouncing and jiggling and swaying with every waddled step \"I HATE MY LIFE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candace stop I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT ITS LIKE! YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS EVERY DAY! NO ONE ELSE HAS GO GO THROUGH THIS ALL THE TIME!  NO ONE KNOWS WHAT ITS LIKE!\" With that she ran into the house, caught in the patio door for only a second before slamming it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy wanted to say she did, she did know what it was like. She'd seen enough of the boys zany antics after all. However she'd always loved their inventions and plans, going along with them because they were so cool. She didn't have to live in a house with the two mega genius kids while she was just trying to be the normal kid while having her siblings intellectual superiority pushing away her every chance at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace didn't need sympathy right now. Or a shoulder to cry on. She needed someone she could relate to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the gun. Then down at herself, a hand on her flat stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys.\" She called to the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Stacy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gun fixed yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhineas shook his head \"It'll take a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy nodded \"Then I need you to do something else for me.....\"</span></div></div>",

When the more mature twin asked why, they'd given some cock and bull story about them needing to get out of the house and see the great outdoors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly Dipper suspected it had something to do with the tickets to Hawaii his dad had won the other day and thought his son knew nothing about, and probably didn't trust his twin sister to be able to spend that long alone without destroying the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't say it was a bad point, but the least they could have done is tell them more than an hour in advance before handing them luggage and booting them out the door. They didn't even get tell them were the place was. He had to google it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours of aggravating, backwoods, narrow road at the edge of a cliff face driving later and they arrived in podunk, I mean Gravity Falls Oregon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up to the front of the shack Dipper took in what would be his new home for the next several weeks while chewing his lip. He really didn't have much confidence in a place where the sign hadn't been fixed in so long there was moss growing in the space where the S should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out of the car and went to go get their luggage, because Mabel was already running towards the shack like an overexcited 8 year old and he could already here the reasons why she shouldn't have to lift her own luggage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there. Need any help?\" A feminine voice asked behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be happy for it. But I'd probably never here the end of it from my sister if I didn't do it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't deal with a little ribbing?\" The voice joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to live with her.\" He smiled and looked over his shoulder. He paused for a moment as he took in the fact he'd been talking to a very cute red haired girl his age. \"Names Dipper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled back \"Wendy. And from all that I'm guessing your the niece and nephew staying for the summer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great niece and nephew. Our parents didn't trust us to stay home by ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least they didn't threaten you with logging camp if you didn't get a job. though if your Stan's family then you might not be avoiding employment either way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you don't need help?

Kicking herself for not before just  how huge this guy actually was. He was easily six feet tall or more, and built like Hercules or Samson or The Rock or something. Muscles on his muscles all hidden behind an orange t-shirt that did nothing to hid his pecs or abs and a pair of jeans so big she and Tambrey could probably fit in a leg each that he filled so well they were like skinny jeans on him. She had to shake her head a little when she realized she was staring at the way his biceps bulged like footballs as he lifted the cases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um...yeah. I work out.\" He fumbled over his words. Rubbing his scruffy goatee a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso really cute when he's embarressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly.\" She laughed nervously. Though that didn't stop her from looking as he carried the two loaded luggage cases to the front door like they were empty. \"Now I 'know' they'res no way Stan's gonna let you relax this summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't expecting to.\" He replied in a half joking half resigned tone. \"So I'm guessing by your opinion of him that you work for great uncle Stand to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead snorted \"Work is such a strong word. I'd prefer to say that I receive money in exchange for lending my time to aid his place of business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats the textbook definition of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the way I do it.\" She countered while pushing at his arm. Which she totally did as a friendly gesture and not to cope a feel of his muscles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a crash in the shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MABEL LET HIM GO!\" Came a yell from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEVER!\" Came the reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge teen groaned a little and hung his head \"Seriously Mabel. Five minutes and your already in romance mode?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? You just got here and your sister already found a boyfriend?\" Wendy asked half smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mabel's a love freak and so called 'romance expert'.

Likely he'd said something nice about her, and being Mabel had taken it as a declaration of love. Hugging the boy as tightly as tourists oooo'ed and 'awww'ed and took photo's while Stan, who'd recovered from the action to start charging them for the privilage of taking photo's made round on them to take money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's pause however was from shock.

No. Stop.\" Stan yelled at his great-niece as he held out a large sack in front of his customers which they mindlessly chucked money in at the sight of one of their own being suffocated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel ignored it and held the total cutie to her chest like he'd vanish if she let go. Hopping from one foot to the other as she listed all the things they could do as a couple while his face purpled. Going both blue from the lack of oxygen and red from how deep he was being held into the thick sweater and thick cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's jaw hung loosely at the site of the girl as her brother strode over to pull her apart from the poor lucky guy. This was Mabel?! That nurse from Animaniacs had a less impressive figure than this girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were long and went into.....you know what. Let's get this out of the way first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the biggest f**king TITS she'd ever seen in her entire life! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, people leave them at the end of their description of another woman and even then dance around the subject, but they were so huge they 'demanded' to be first! Yeah yeah sure, the rest of her was curvy and everything, but what that drew everyone in the room except her family's attention was the girl's gargantuan Majumbos! She was as stacked as her brother was buff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen some cocky ass perv bragged about seeing a girl with breasts bigger than their head, they don't quite realize 'how' large that would have to be. Yet now Wendy had a perfect idea of that if not more because when those guys talk about it they usually mean that the total mass of both boobs 'combined' was bigger than the girl's head. not that each 'individual' boob was bigger than their head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd question (and kind of hope) if they were fake, but she was too worried that the answer was probably no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glad that the hottest guy she'd ever met was the new girl's brother and not her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook that thought out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick tug, Dipper pulled the air starved guy out of his sister's bosom with a deep gasp. The girl staggered back a little and landed on her plush butt sending her giant tata's quaking so much if she were wearing anything but a bulky sweater it would have torn open<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's the big idea!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great uncle Stan doesn't need to be sued because you nearly murdered a guy on day one Mabel.\" He folded his arms across his broad chest. It wasn't as interesting an action as it would be if his sister did it, but it drew the attention of more than a few of the female tourists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. \" She grunted and dusted herself off <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious Mabel. Your not a little kid anymore. You can't just latch onto the nearest guy you think is cute and expect them to just smile about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh hello.\" She gestured to herself \"Have you met me? I'm Mabel Pines. Hottest girl in Piedmont. No man can resist me. Isn't that right sweetie?\" She asked the empty space where her new boyfriend had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" She looked around \"Where'd he go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he ran off while you two were arguing. Stan got him up the moment you said sue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette disgested the words, then seemed to fold in on herself \"Seriously? Again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain? Wendy would have found it hard to believe someone who looked like Mabel would have a hard time getting a guy. Then again if she smothered every guy she met then maybe it wasn't that hard to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she got a good look at her, it really didn't match up with everything below the neck. While her body radiated sexual hotness in waves, her face was 'cute', possibly even 'adorable'. Her cheeks were still as pinchable as a granny would like and had a button nose that was begging to be 'booped'. She was a teenager yet If all you saw of her was her face then you could easily mistake her for a girl a few years younger than she was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I wouldn't worry about it. With how regular we get tourists your bound to see a cute boy or two at least twice a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head whipped back up to look at the lumber jane \"Really?! Score! Mabel is BACK on top!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper sighed \"And once again she learns nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy waved him off \"Let her enjoy herself for now. It'll be easier for when Stan puts you both to work.\" She smiled up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel stopped jumping and looked at the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way her cheeks blew up as she looked at the two didn't make her look any less immature <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! How come you get to get a girlfriend on day one but I don't get to keep my new boy toy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two blinked. Looked at each other then backed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! Your at that stage already?....not fair.\" She pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed again. Wendy chuckled and held out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy Corduroy. Your  great uncle's cashier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mabel Pines. Future world-famous artist.\" The girl smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mind if I ask you a question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their real.\" The Pines girl said automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ser!?.... I mean no. A different question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two eating and where can I get some?\" She asked dead serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.

He got up just in time to see the woman keel backwards baby in toe, managing to grab their little\u2026.whatever before she hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Pines looked over the midwife and breathed a sigh of relief she looked ok. Thank you exspensive shag carpeting. Seeing that the man was safe he turned his attention to the baby to see what the problem was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018It took them 10 minutes to realise I was a boy. Though considering it only took them  5 seconds to realise there was a small deer torso were chubby baby legs should be, and 20 seconds for that to sink in, I\u2019d say I\u2019d say not knowing my gender for a few minutes was reasonable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a \u2018really\u2019 good thing that my mom wanted us to \u2018be born in our warm and loving home rather than a cold and sterile hospital\u2019, or else I\u2019d be giving this monologue from behind a two way mirror with some guy in a lab coat poking me with a stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey \u2018somehow\u2019 managed to convince the midwife not to tell the world about the mutant deer boy. Though I\u2019m pretty sure it must have involved a lot of money or a lot of bullcrap. Though even with her promising not to run to the press, or a symposium or anything that was only really the first of the many, many, many questions my bizarre birth brought up. How was this possible? why didn\u2019t my legs show up on ultrasound? why was Mabel not a doe girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally the only question it answered was why mom kept eating the flowers dad brought home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there was the biggest question. What were they going to do with me? You couldn\u2019t raise someone who was half boy half petting zoo attraction in the middle of suburbia. But neither of their jobs were things they could just uproot at a moments notice. Conveniantly I just so happened to have a great uncle who lives in a cabin in the woods in the middle of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward twelve year from here to just the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day I met my sister.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leaving behind a cloud of dust, a little girl dressed like she was ready for winter despite it being the start of summer and a luggage carrier so colourful it hurt to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took in a deep breath and exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Mabel, let\u2019s do this.\u201d She grabbed the handle of her rather large luggage case and started pulling it up the dirt path into the dark, scary woods, past the signs reading \u2018?\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a complete accident that she found it. She\u2019d blown her allowance on that bulk order of wool she used to make the sweater she was wearing now, so she had to raid the house for old scraps for her parents anniversary gift. Now that mind sound tacky, in fact to most people that most is tacky, but Mabel was the kind of child whose sheer adorableness allowed her to do things like this without being seen as too old for such gifs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d searched high and low, every corner of every room. Every discarded newspaper. Every opened envelope. She looked in closets, boxes, the basement. However as she was looking over the top of her mom\u2019s dresser, something slipped out from between the wallpaper roll and a twenty year old monopoly set weighed down by a foot of dust. A picture she really should never have found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a picture of great uncle (or Grunkle as she liked to call him) Stan. Not anything she hadn\u2019t seen before. It looked really recent as well . It was a sort of close up of him. He standing in front of his awesome sauce cabin/ weird museum with a giant hairless beaver, a boy who looked almost exactly like her, and a red haired girl dressed like a lumberjack. All mugging for the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling she\u2019d put the picture back and went down to join her parents for lunch. Finishing the meal peacefully, and then letting rip an ear splitting \u201cWHAT?\u201d when they had loaded up their arms with dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little bit of weedling, but once she showed them the photo they broke down. She had a brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the squeeing died down with her sugar crash they managed to sit her down and explain. Dipper (Or at least that was the name he insisted he be called by, given his\u2026\u2019other\u2019 name she understood completely) had been sent to live with Grunkle Stan at almost the moment they were born cause of some rare \u2018condition\u2019 he had. They wouldn\u2019t tell her what it was, but it meant it would have made it difficult for him to live in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had begged them to let her visit him. Like literal hands and knees begging, with big puppy dog eyes and quivering lip. She was mildly shocked that they were able to resist and flat out turn her down. Telling her that she wasn\u2019t ready to meet her brother yet. When she asked when she\u2019d be ready they responded\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen your older.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much older?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOlder than your mom or me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel would say she was rather displeased with that answer. In fact she might go as far to say she was quite displeased indeed\u2026..in fact she couldn\u2019t remember a time she was more displeased than she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo displeased in fact that she raided her dads wallet during the night, packed up as much of her stuff as she could wheel out and caught book herself on a bus out of state at the crack of dawn. It was surprisingly easy with it being the start of summer and there were parents eager to send their children out of state as it was already. All she needed to do was get on with some other kids close enough that the driver wouldnt ask questions. She was an hour out of California before she thought she may have made a stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had to do math, she guessed she had a good\u2026.ehhhhhh\u2026.the second she gets to the shack before she finds her parents on the other side of the door ready to whisk her back home and lock her in the basement til she was 37.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she\u2019d get to see her bro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuuhhh so, heavy. Why did I pack 20 pounds of glitter? It\u2019s not \u2018that\u2019 isolated out here, it\u2019s not like I couldn\u2019t buy some in town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe case fell from her fingers into the dirt right before she flopped onto it. She\u2019d been walking down this weird path forever and she still couldn\u2019t see the shack. he found her gaze turning up to the sky. Looked like the clouds where in a match with the sun to see whether or not it rained, and here she was with her coat in a case with a sticky zipper and buried under ten more sweaters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c....I wonder what he\u2019s like.\u201d She said to herself. It occoured to her that she hadn\u2019t thought about who this guy she was dying to meet actually was. She\u2019d spent the entire bus ride thinking \u201c I HAVE A BROTHER! I HAVE A BROTHER! I HAVE A BROTHER!\u201d, but didn\u2019t stop to think that she knew next to nothing about him except his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPffft what are you worried about Mabel. Your \u2018awesome\u2019 at talking to boy\u2019s, even if they are your brother. Just treat it like your meeting a new boyfriend and you\u2019ll be fine\u2026\u2026\u2026.ok that sounded waaaaay less awkward in my head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah not something you really wanna say out loud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shot back up\u2026.or at least tried to, but with the way she was lying on the case she ended up tumbling onto the dirty, dirty ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Hack Hack* She spewed up some dirt and got back to her feet. Though not before getting an eye on a pair of heavy work boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one ounce of the red hairs clothing was  feminine. An oversized plaid shirt, loose fit jeans and oh oh oh one of those adorble floppy ear far that made you look like a puppy I want it I want...*ahem* focus Mabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked far too pretty to be wearing such manly cloths, but at the same time seemed to fit them perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look like your conventional tourist. You lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. Looking for the mystery shack.\u201d She held out a hand in greeting \u201cName\u2019s Mabel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy.\u201d She took the hand \u201cSo what\u2019s a non tourist doing looking for that road side dump?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing much. See the sights. Having a summer romance. Reuniting with her long lost twin brother, Adding to her enormous knick knack collection,. That sort of thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder girl nodded her head \u201cCool that\u2019s\u2026.wait. Long lost twin brother? You don\u2019t mean Dipper do you?\u201d The girl questioned...and then she looked the younger girl up and down, stopping several times on her legs for some reason.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno. You know any other twelve year old boys who live in an isolated shack in the woods of this tiny little town?\u201d She asked with a smile sweeter than sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u2026that sentence. It\u2019s clearly sarcastic, but the tone is way too sincere. I can\u2019t tell if your kidding or not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I get that a lot.\u201d She smiled \u201cSo you know my bro-bro and grunkle right?\u201d She asked as she picked up the handle of her case and tried to resume dragging it before it was lifted up effortlessly by the unusually powerful arms of the teenage girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince I was eight. I\u2019m doing a sentence there for summer cash right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome. Lead the way!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sign was damaged and had a giant S just waiting for some unlucky rube  to stand under it so it could crush them. Windows were cracked, and there was a goat chewing on some fat guys pants while he was trying to fix the outside toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh. This. place. looks. INCREDIBLE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s incredible alright.\u201d The older girl snarked, spotting a group of people armed with cameras, out of place hawaiian shirts and badly guarded wallets entering the museum part doors. \u201cJust great.\u201d She sighed \u201cListen I gotta go woman the register in the gift shop. You gonna\u2026.wait where\u2019d?\u201d She said to the empty space that once contained a little girl, before spotting her moving inside with the tour group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWWoooowww.\u201d It was all so tacky and fake looking. It was like all her arts and crafts dreams coming true at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStep right up folks! Be amazed at the genuine wonders found only in my house of mystery!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that voice anywhere. Like someone had been gargling sand and cigarettes for half their life.  Racing up to meet the group she recognised her \u2018Grunkle\u2019 Stan instantly. The heavy built mature gentlemen in a dusty suit and ratty old fez was busy doing what he did best. Razzling and sometimes even dazzling patron\u2019s of his establishment with fantastic tales of his many adventures and exhibits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here we have the terror of Canada! The horrific beast that gummed a trail of death and destruction from Toronto to some other french sounding city. The great toothless beaver!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old curtain was pulled away, revealing a ratty old stuffed beaver with it\u2019s prominent teeth removed surrounded by signs covered in question marks. It wasn\u2019t just fake. It was cheap fake. The kind of fake that wouldn\u2019t fool the biggest idiot in the remedial class of the dumbest school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Stanford Pines, the shack accomodated for a \u2018special\u2019 kind of idiot. The Tourist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera snapping, crowd ate it up like it was a chicken dinner and literally throwing money at the ratty former decoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right folks. Make sure to save some to buy your very own mini toothless beaver figurine. All yours for only \u00a339.95 before tax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could practically see the money leaping into her great uncles sweaty palms like wallet shaped salmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd over here we have a rare picture of the mythical Goat riding a walrus while playing the banjo! How is it possible? Why is the walrus letting the goat ride it? How did a goat get that far into the frozen north? How can it play a banjo with hooves? It\u2019s crazy am I right?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed behind the group with just as much awe and wonder as the families he continued to bleed dry. Amazed at how cheap and fake everything was. Showing them poorly carved wood sculptures, hastily glued folk art and paintings where the canvas was still wet. Until he brought the group to a spot near the end of the exibits blocked off by a large red curtain. The kids in the group started to get a giddy look in their eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now folks! The moment you\u2019ve all been waiting for! The star attraction of the Mystery Shack! The culmination of my years of painstaking adventure and research into mystery! The last of his kind! The PRRRINCE of the forest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Majestic Deer Boy!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pushing through she just managed to make out a boy in front of them with one hand on his waist and the other on a carved and shamany looking wood staff that totally went with the inked on tribal tats he had on his chest and arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he was. Her brother. He looked even more like her in person than he did the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t really understand why her brother dressed like a cliche native american was level 3 gasp worthy from anyone but her, until she went round and got a better look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the waist down rather than deer skin pants, it was just deer. He stood on four spindly legs that were longer and thinner than any human leg with hooves that clicked against the floor with every step. Atop his head was a crown of majestic antlers that made him look like a real prince of the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood there trying to look proud and magnificant. Unfortunatly he also had big floppy ears,  a smattering of freckles on highly pinchable cheeks and a cute little tail that wiggled from side to side, soooooo\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwwww\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s so cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh look at his little tail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t his antlers make him look so manly. Yes they do, they do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMama can I pet the deer boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if he tried to maintain his \u2018proud warrior man\u2019 look, it was as easy to see how annoyed he was at the reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ah ah no petting kids. We don\u2019t want to startle the prince do we. He spooks easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore likely he didn\u2019t want them to find out those not so hidden zippers and crude stitches. Though she had to admit he looked adorable. Camera phone, flashless click, save but do \u2018not\u2019 send...yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan gives them his \u2018story\u2019, about how he found me injured in the woods in some far off land and brought me here to nurse me back to health, and in exchange I would bless him with eternal wealth, which is why he was \u2018blessed\u2019 to have such wonderful customers. That got a laugh along with several fistfuls of cash thrown into nearby buckets. The old man wow\u2019d them for a little longer before leading them off, the curtain falling back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel hung back, neither the group or curator noticing while she ducked under the velvet rope. Wait is this even velvet? Mmm Texture is off, and it feels like\u2026.! That dirty\u2026.this is old felt! There\u2019s cheap and then theirs cheap, but this is just, just WRONG! You can\u2019t just fake a velvet rope, it goes against like, all the laws of glamourousness! I outta\u2026.wait what was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe filed away her outrage at the crime against extravagence for now and inched towards the not so silk curtain. Peeking her eye through she saw the adoraboy slouching forward..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh.\u201d He rubbed the small of his human back. \u201cBeing majestic hurts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the price you pay to be awesome dude.\u201d The chubby handyman commented as he picked up the money buckets and hauled them in back before grabbing  a plaid shirt and tossing it at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t like that he could no longer wear t-shirts or anything that required to be pulled over the head. Thats the price he guessed he had to pay to have this regal crown he ha\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAntlers slipping dude.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh.\u201d He gasped and reached up, shifting his regal crown til it sat straight. Only to let out a human and totally not deer like bleet as the crown was ripped from his skull and a fat hand started mussing up his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You totally killed today. They must have thrown like half their wallets in here. Doing your uncle proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll probably just whine that they didn't throw more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably but....woah!\" The older man gasped before shoving the Antlers back onto the boys head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW. Hey what the big.....\" He went quiet when he noticed Soos looking past his shoulder. He looked behind him and spotted a girl his age wearing a sweater at the height of summer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh hey. Didn't see you in the group. Must have shoved you to the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to stare at him. It was nothing new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll....\" He held his arms out wide. Trotting around a little before coming to a stop. \"Here I am. Prince of the forest and whatever. Blessing the shack with my graceful presence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept staring at him. Ok this was getting kind of creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook the tours already moved ahead so if you want to ask something and catch up\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tackled him in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH MY GOSH!!! YOU LOOK SO ADORABLE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAH! GREAT UNCLE STAN! IT\u2019S HAPPENING AGAIN!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mine\u2019s rainbow. Do you love glitter. Wait don\u2019t answer that, of course you do! Whats school like here. Do you have a racoon for a pet? Can I name it bandit? How do you walk in that costume?

What's in these things anyway? Rocks?\u201d She groaned before tripping over a loose floorboard. The top box tipped off the stack and fell to the floor. Spilling dozens of odd shaped rocks with question marks crudely painted on them across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy laughed \u201cOne of our best sellers.\u201d She laughed before picking them up and tossing them haphazardly onto a shelf marked \u2018Mystery Rocks\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel dragged herself into the kitchen where her Grunkle was having a late breakfast in between his tours. She walked slmped against the wall,  she used the surface as a guide towards her location in leu of opening her eyes, as she was determined to get as much sleep as possible. One of the many things she did not factor on, on her poorly factored plan. That little sleep and hard work made you tired<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled into the kitchen, groaning and holding her back. Stan looked over his paper for a second and chuckled. Mumbling something about her waiting a few decades for whole new kinds of back ache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan didn't even bother looking up again. \"Ok so I called your parents.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How mad are they?\" She mumbled as her face planted on the table into a brick of cold, cold butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was more like 'yell through the phone at your dad' because your moms yelling in the background made it hard to speak to each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burbling sound came from the slowly meling yellow brick where her mouth was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not being punished right now. But only because they can't decide on 'infinite grounding' or 'military school'. So for the time being their letting you stay. But I wouldn't count on a summer long adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a better deal than she'd hoped for, she supposed. With herculean effort, the little sweater girl lifted herself into a slightly to tall chair and pulled up a box of cereal. Grimacing a little at the 'sugerless, unfrosted laxa-o's- the breakfast of 'regular' champion' she poured herself a bowl for the lack of anything better and dug in. Taking two bites before she noticed the boy next to her. She noticed two things that were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne. He was still wearing his costume. He'd put on a shirt and washed off the tattoos. Had a blue and white hat on instead of those antlers, but he was still wearing the deer parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you eating a salad for breakfast?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper stopped chewing and Stan pulled the paper down. They both glance at the bowl, then to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner of the shack cracks a smile. \u201cYeah. Crazy huh? kids a total health freak. I try to get him to eat bacon one time and what does he do? All over my new shoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk first off those things haven\u2019t been new since the Reagan administration. Secondly I told you I couldn\u2019t eat animal products.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard that all the time in the sixties kid. How was I supposed to know you, your parents and that doctor  meant it literally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the contents of his bowl. She saw lettuce, carrots, peppers and..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that grass and pine needles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bolked in his mouth. Shooting her a shocked look before....eeewww....swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm uh, really dedicated to my diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was unsure but didn't chase it. Turning back to her old man cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had two spoonfuls before she decided she'd had enough forever. Looking over to her bro-bro she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. You not have any pants? If you need to wear that costume now you totally must have any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" He stated bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned. It was an expression that didn\u2019t look like it belonged on her face. Slowly she walked over to him, closing the distance between them until they were nose to chin. He inched back a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the gap again. Then hugged him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would say he was getting used to it by now. He\u2019d been hugged a lot over his unfortunately long career as a side show attraction. Unlike all the other ones this wasn\u2019t actually some sort of death grip and he felt he could actually break out of it. Though oddly enough he didn\u2019t want to.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The second Marco tried to rub the 'paint' and failed, her whole world dropped to fear. It took everything she could to not freak out 'too much' when giving her guide/friend a good enough summary about how weird things were going to get......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean typical Star weird or......like....destroy the school weird?\" With only a beat lost, Star belted out the best awsner she could give. \"Destroy the school.\" \"Yeah, that's what i was afraid of..\" The rest of Marco's words were lost on his friend as he led her along. Within her mind, Star was freaking out. Even now just looking at Marco was enough to stir up urges, horrible, unlike her urges about this....boy....Star shook her head as she tried to keep calm. \"Try to relax....try not too look at the boooys...\" An eerie grin came to Star's face as her eyes saw boys all around her. Tough boys, weak boys, boys walking and standing at lockers, opening them with thier <b>boy</b> hands.  Every second of thought brought another heart to the magical girl's face, drifting to her thoughts of what to do with them starting with her friends...friends...boys who were friends.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco looked back to where Star should have been and found beside a drinking fountain eyeing a guys having his fill. With a quick step of worry, Marco rushed to his friend and pulled the dazed girl away. Star's eyes quickly cleared up, a sure sign the girl was snapped back into reality. As they two leaned away, Star's arm shot out into a purple strand hitting a nearby locker. The surprised duo could only scream in surprise and fear over the 'destroy the school' level weirdness showed itself. In the midst of his screaming, Marco realized his hand was stuck to the strand itself and tried to pull it off. As Star tried to free herself from the locker, Marco heard the light tearing indocating his efforts of freedom were rewarded. The boy looked to hand and saw residue of the sticky purple substance was on his hand and attempted to get it off. <br>\r\n\"Ugggh..\" Star grunted as she pulled once more, hoping the webbing would rip so she could get away from all these <b>boys.</b> Star heard a moaning sound coming from Marco and looked to see him rubbing head. \"Something up boo...ugghh...Marco?\" \"Yeah, Star. I just feel a little light headed all of a sudden....\" Star gulped silently in fear, fear which became worse when she realized he was rubbing his head with a hand coated in her webbing. Marco opened his eyes, the small purple hearts replacing his eyes not helping the fear Star was feeling at all. \"Ya know Star....\" Marco said as his hand grabbed his friends free arm, \"....why have I never told you how gorgeous you look?\" \"No...nonononono...\" It was happening already, the webbing was affecting his mind. Slowly falling for her, it wouldn't stop until.....until...the really weird. Star could feel the hearts popping up faster and faster on her body, Marco inching closer and closer. Star looked to the covered hand, it was only a small bit, maybe the effects weren't permanent yet and could be brushed off. Oh but it was get so hard to think.....</span></div></div>",

It was obvious he didn't really want to go on this road trip with her any more than she with him. Of course being a girl she hid her disipointment inside while he being an immature little boy made his irritation public. So being the bigger of the two she left him to stew and went somewhat deep into the wood they were parked in until Grandpa called for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had started to read but something was still distracting her. A whistling sound like something falling out of the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and twirled around to shout \"Very funny dweeb!\" Only to become silent when she saw she was yelling at thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the whistling grew louder a sudden chill raced up her spine. If Ben wasn't here making that sound.......then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked skyward, and froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large fireball was quickly filling up the sky. Racing for her at what must be a thousand miles an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a rabbit and most other humans her first instinct was to stand still and stare at the pretty light. Before the more rational part of her bring argued that watching the large flaming ball of death may sting a little and smartly ran out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to get a considerable distance between her and the metaphorical big red x were she'd been standing before the meteorite struck leveling that spot as well as a twenty foot radius around it. Gwen was still knocked off her feet and sent face first into the forest floor, fortunatly freshly fallen pine needles cushioned her fall and she was able to get up with only a mild disorientation and a slight ringing in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way towards the crash sight. Curiousity in a situation like this always won out against common sense which said going near a burning and possibly radioactive hunk of space rock might not be the best idea. She slide down the impressive crater and landed near the rock, which up close looked far to rounded to actually be a rock at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is this thing? It's not even hot.\" She wondered aloud. Despite being on fire a second ago the air in the crater was freezing, and stranger still the metal sphere that she thought a meteorite was still glowing but not the red got it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubconciously she raised a hand and reached foward to touch it. However inchs before she did so the sphere suddenly opened up revealing it to be a box or chest of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright green glow emanated from inside and for a second she thought it was radiation, but it died away quickly allowing Gwen to see inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like a watch, a big, gaudy, butt ugly watch that no one but the flashiest of boys would wear. Though considering where it had came from she could hazard that it wasn't a watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached in closer to get a better look, going to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing she expected was for it to reach out and grab her. Faster than she could blink it had jumped at her wrist and latched on, moving like liquid and tightening until only cutting her arm off could remove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she knew that. Her first instict was to grab at it and pull it off. Her small fingers working at the watch trying to pry it loose with no success. She grabed everywhere on it, including the watchface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a green flash</span></div></div>",

Her fat made her slow and tired from the slightest activity, not exactly good for a spy, getting winded from walking up a case of stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover had also developed a huge appetite and appreciation for food. Not to mention that she'd never felt sexier. Her boobs had grown huge and soft inspiring her to want to show off her cleavage,her ass fattened up and jiggled with every step swaying and bouncing, her arms and legs had fat hanging from them jiggling like gelatin, her belly was hanging low filled with fat. For some reason Clover loved jiggling her body and bursting out of outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at headquarters Clover took off her spy suit and stripped down to her pink bra and panties which were full of tears due to her weight gain. \"Ugh none of my clothes fit me\" Clover said as she just split a pair of pants trying to pull them up. \"Thats okay Clover in a few minutes you'll be thin again, Jerry will cure you\" said Sam rubbing Clover's back fat. Clover than looked in the mirror at her self in her underwear grabbing her boobs massaging her belly. \"Come on Clover lets go get you skinny again\" Sam said as she grabbed Clover's fat arm.

You Can't just let her walk out\" Shouts Alex. \"There's nothing we can do girls, she doesn't want to return to her normal size so we just have to let her go.\" Jerry says puzzled.<br>\r\n\" Why does she want to stay fat so badly!?

How could they fire me?! After all I've done? After all I've been through?\" Clover scowled to herself. \"I mean seriously, what's wrong with a girl being fat?\" her angry mutterings drawing attention to herself. \"Oh please, you've never seen a fat girl before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover then headed directly to the mall's food court. She was craving something greasy. A fried chicken stand caught the mad girl's gaze. Clover promptly got in land unabashed by any judgmental eyes, impatiently waiting to place her order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Beverly chicken, how can I take your order?\" asked the cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll take a bucket of chicken, 4 biscuits, a carton of gravy, a side of slaw, and an extra large soda.\"  Clover ordered void of any hesistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Clover's size, the order was impressive, not many people can consume such a filling order.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover quickly received her order \"Yeah thanks.\" she said, her words lacked sincere appreciation, moreso out of customary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover than got herself a seat, plopping her wide buttocks soundly in the chair. Clover than set her eyes on the meal. Unimpeded, Clover tore into the fried chicken. It was unapolegetically greasy, smearing the teen's lips and fingers. After rapidly devouring four pieces, Clover turned to the biscuits, deeply dipping them in the smothering gravy. Clover then shoved the gravy laden biscuits down her impatient maw. Eight more pieces of chicken were eaten next before Clover shoveled slaw down her throat, tapping it off with a hearty chug of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! That was delicious!\" Clover exhaling while placing her licked clean hands on her belly. \"Man I never got to eat like that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover than reflected on her decision to stay fat. When she was skinny she had placed too much energy on being thin and avoiding tasty foods. Obsessing over the size of her clothes, declining cute outfits, like that hat. Being thin made her feel small, something she didn't realize until getting fat. Being that large made her feel more confident and able to push aside anything that got in her way. She always felt more glamorous than others and being heavier made it more real. Especially compared to her teammates. Seeing Sam and Alex smaller than herself bolstered her ego. Being fat really did make her feel like the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Whoop wouldn't allow it and fired her. Clover went through so much for Whoop, putting up with so much from those missions. And now that she actually enjoyed an effect of a mission, they go and fire her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unacceptable.\" Clover muttered. \"I'll get them. I'll make them regret letting me go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGROWL<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite filling her stomach with greasy foods, Clover's belly quaked for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I guess revenge can wait a bit. Girl's gotta eat ya know.\"  Clover smiled finally able to eat the things she always fantasized about. </span></div></div>",

Can you like unlock the door!\" She kindly yelled wiping away some sweat from her forehead.<br>\r\nWhile waiting, she realised her mom doesn't know about her very sudden weight gain and worried about how she might react.<br>\r\n\"Oh man.. How am I gonna explain this?\" She wondered shaking her belly fat. Then, thoughts of the passion patties she had indulged on earlier came into her mind. \"That's it!\" Clover pulled out a passion patty from a box she had stolen while back at Whoop. \"Oh cookies where have you been all my life!?\"<br>\r\nWhile lost in her own mind, Clover's mother came to the door.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Honey, I was just busy out in the AHHH!!!\" She froze in shock, as Clover stood there with a shy smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"Hey mom...\" she said quietly.<br>\r\n\"Clover... Is that.. is that You!? What happened to my little angel!? She asked not comprehending just how her daughter doubled in weight.<br>\r\n\"Mom... it's okay, What happened to me was a good thing! Here!...\" Clover responds by pulling out a cookie.<br>\r\nClover's Mother looked at the cookie Clover held out and watched her fat arm jiggle in the process.<br>\r\n\"These cookies did this to you? But how? You were thin yesterday how is this possible?\" She asks trying to understand.<br>\r\n\"Mom these are Passion Patties, they will make you feel really at peace with yourself! Sure you'll gain a little weight like me<br>\r\nBut you know what? I LOVE being fat. It is the greatest thing to ever happen to me, here try one!\"<br>\r\nClover forcefully shoved it into her mothers mouth out of fear of being rejected. Before her mother could even respond the cookie touched her tastebuds and her eyes lit up and her body shook all over from the adrenaline of the addiction setting in.<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds her mom regathered her thoughts coming down from her 'sugargasm'.<br>\r\n\"Clover... Please come inside and tell me more about these cookies and where we can get them!\"<br>\r\nClover, for the first time since being fired gave a big smile making her way in with her mother pulling by her forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Woohp, Jerry and the girls were still going over what had happened.<br>\r\n\"I just don't get it... Clover would never say anything like that it's just not like her at all.\" Alex said pouting. <br>\r\n\"Hmm..Well maybe Clover did, Maybe she actually is happy with being a larger woman, a BBW if you will.\" Jerry said looking for the simple explination.<br>\r\n\"No that can't be it! When we were back at the factory she ditched us for cookies, then later barely helped us fight the employees...\"<br>\r\nIt's like something changed in her mind, I watched her attitude change the more she ate them.\" Sam added as if she was on to something.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps there was something in the formula that did more than just make us fat. But why wasn't I effected?... I could not wait to take the cure and get rid of all that fat.\" Jerry replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night Dr. Bittersweet lay in her cell, also reflecting over the last 24 hours. She was furious over being caught and that Woohp used her own formula against her.<br>\r\n\"They will all pay, all of them. Little do they know, that my cookies contained small amounts of mind control!<br>\r\nIf only i had waited longer i could have made the doses stronger and I wouldn't be in this mess!\" She claimed slamming her hand down.<br>\r\n\"I just hope there were a few left uncured...then i could break out of here and seek my ultimate revenge!.\"<br>\r\nWith in minutes a guard approached the doctor. \"Hey you fat-ass! You have a visitor.\" he said carelessly.<br>\r\n\"What? Who?\" the doctor asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"Hello Doctor Bittersweet, remember me?\" In walked Clover, looking a little fatter than earlier she was Determined to get answers.<br>\r\n\"What!? It's you! Haven't you done Enough!?\" The doctor yelled.<br>\r\n\" No it's not like that... I need to talk to you, see look I'm still fat, i never took the cure.\" Clover showed her body as she stood closer.<br>\r\nA lightbulb went over Inga's head.<br>\r\n\"Maybe she will be the one!\" Inga thought.<br>\r\n\"Please go on...\"<br>\r\n\"Well, Your cookies are the greatest thing to ever happen to me, I never knew just how wonderful it is being fat, I am for once at peace with my life and my body and it's all thanks to you. I will do anything for you Doctor because like your my hero. I just didn't realise it yesterday because of my friends. They kept me on the mission and like i was just doing my job... But then they fired me anyway!\" Clover confessed.<br>\r\n\"I have a proposition for you, my dear.\" Inga responded.<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Clover asked curiously as she grabbed at some of her fat, Still intimidated by the doctor.<br>\r\n\"Become MY spy and together we will be unstoppable! You can have all the cookies you want as pay. But first You need to break me out! What do you say? We both get our revenge and will be able to move on once we settle the score!\" Inga stated very convincingly.<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes i will do it! I will help you doctor!\" Clover tried not to shout from excitement almost getting the attention of the guards.<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Now i need you to break me out of here. Find others who are still hooked on my cookies and we can build my empire once again!\"<br>\r\nInga said with a maniacal smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the blonde female Spy from WOOHP known as Clover, that  price came in the form of losing her physical human appearance. To elaborate, Clover and her two friends/fellow Spies, Sam and Alex, were sent out on a mission to locate a missing cruise liner full of passengers and crew, and  find out what made them disappear in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the trio uncovered was a secret plot to transform the crew and passengers into Human-Animal hybrids, then turn them into fur coats for commercial use, and all of this was concocted by Helga Von Guggen, a fashion designer. Unfortunately, Clover was injected with the serum as well, progressively changing her into a Human-Cat hybrid. However, although they did put a grinding halt to Helga's sadistic scheme, the antidote that Sam and Alex used to change Helga and Trode's animalistic victims back to being human once more, the serum was....ineffective in reverting Clover back into her original form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\nWOOHP Headquarters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 &amp; a half weeks after the <br>\r\nevents in \"Wild Style\"<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the highly-guarded interior of WOOHP Headquarters, Jerry was reviewing the accumulated data gathered from the WOOHP scientists performing numerous examinations on the Human-Feline hybrid known as Clover. Shortly after the mission was completed with success, he, Sam, and Alex quickly became of Clover still sporting fur, claws, and various other feline physical features, especially since the blonde Spy was very upset that she was still stuck as a cat-girl. From the aging man's perspective, what had transpired during that mission weighed a good deal on Jerry's subconscious, despite not having any hand in Clover's inhuman transformation other than sending her, Sam, and Alex out there to investigate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while he thoroughly searched through the data results the scientists received from examining Clover, Jerry was waiting for Sam and Alex to arrive. After all, like him, the two Spies felt guilty about being unable to prevent Clover from turning into what she has now become; an inhuman freak, a creature that could exist only in fiction, treading a fragile line between man....and beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of the ginger-haired and raven-haired agents from WOOHP, Sam and Alex managed to arrive at WOOHP HQ. Though, unlike the usual method that they unintentionally use to get to WOOHP, the two Spies were given an escort to the organization's base of operations, due to their reconciliation over a friend who could no longer be fully human anymore. Besides the two girls became more concerned for Clover's overall well-being by the minute. The whole 2 and a half weeks waiting for results was like a knife to the gut that was still twisting little by little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jerry; Is there, um.....is there anyway to, you know, cure Clover?\" Alex asked, leaning forward on the couch she and Sam were sitting in, crouched in a hunched position as if she was bored or tired, unable to stop worrying about the transformed Clover. Though one couldn't blame her for feeling so restless. After all, she and Sam were very concerned about their blonde-haired friend's afflicted condition. So, in response to Alex's question, Jerry rubbed the bridge of his nose for a moment or two, then stood up from his chair looking at the two Spies with a grim tone and answered......</span></div></div>",

So uh Bye.\" He said and broke into a run back to the jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex looked confused for a second before her muscles exploded in size from anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More ripped. *More* *RIPPED*.\" She growled in anger as she continued to grow. She felt her best friends grab her enormous arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy their beefcake. Youll probably never see him again.\" Said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer biceps began to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah your so buff that you won't need to go to the gym for the rest of the year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms balloned again as she struggled against her two best friends who though having smiles were actually pulling her back as hard as they could. Fortunatly they were saved by Jerry who was coming over for the traditional pat on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls well done. Youve saved the world from foul play and the threat of rampaging bpdy builders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank's Jer. Wish more missions were like this one.\" Said Clover in a dreamy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry nodded before turning back to Alex. \"And Alex I see your taking the bad news rather well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well it's only a few weeks like this right. It's not that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her the girls were making warding signs at Jerry he missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few weeks. Oh I see the girl's forgot to tell you that your condition is permanent.\" He said as a mnatter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!!!\" She growled in rage as she assumed once again her full giant muscled form. Jerry had turned away with his eye's closed and his hand under his chin as he often does when speaking for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The test's show an irreversable change in your body due to eating those bar's which were according to Wernerstein because they were 'not' meant for female consumption. Which is also the reason why your mass is fluctuating with your mental state. Something to do with the female hormones and adrenaline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glaring at her two 'tiny' friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Alex but the data say's that no matter what you do, no matter what you eat or how liitle you excercise will never be any less fit and muscular than in the calm state you are in now.\" He turned to see the girls expression and his eyes widened in surprise as she saw a huge version of Alex  chasing her two best friend's into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm not the worst reaction I've ever seen from an agent getting bad new's.\" He said plainly as he turned to enter the jet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trio was back at Woohp headquarters sitting on the expensive english couch that they always landed on then they were 'woohped' while Jerry was sitting behind his desk while still wearing their mission cloths. Over head was the computer that ran the entire complex the 'Gadget Lending And Distributing Interactive System' or g.l.a.d.i.s as she likes to be called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was midway between her minimal muscular form and her she hulk impersonation. She was staring straight ahead at Jerry instead of looking at her two friends. She wasn't that angry anymore after she'd worked it off at them but she was still pretty upset that she had too find it out from Jerry and not them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her were her two best friends who had seen much better day's. They hadn't been savagly beaten fortunatly. They didn't have any major bruises or injury's but Alex had chased them to the point of exhaustion were they promptly collapsed only to find themselves on this very couch moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from then Jerry coughed into his fist and tried to work up some courage to speak without provoking the amazon in front of him. When she had been done with the girls she'd brought them both back to the jet with one under each arm. When he'd asked if they were all right her response was to kick him into Wernerstein's fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then girl's. As I said earlier on her own there is absolutly no chance of the changes on Alex to revert on their own. Nor will lack of excercise or a horrible diet do anything to change your currant state of health.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrr.\" Said Alex as their was a noticable bulge in her muscle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled a little straining her tired face. \"Well on the plus side you can eat whatever you want and never have to worry about getting fat.\" 'Not that you couldn't do that before.' Thought the smartest of the three jealously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact her other best friend didn't shrink told Sam that Alex knew that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover yawned and rubbed her eye a little. \"So what's the big new's Jer. You wouldn't just bing us back here just to do a recap on the bad new's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry nodded before a mechanical hand brought moved out of the wall holding an injection gun with a capsule full of clear green liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While we can't completly remove the muscle we can stop your fluctuating mass problem.\" Jerry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Said the brawny girl. She shrunk a little as her confusion overroad her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can stop you from getting more and less muscular based on your emotional state. You'll also be able to control your emotions as well as you could before your change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smiled and leaned foward in her seat. \" Well what are we waiting for. The sooner I don't have to be a moving mountain the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Jerry's face told her he also had some bad news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Alex. This chemical will cause you to remain that 'moving mountain' as you call it.\" Jerry said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and the girls eye's widened in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry's sad look only frew grimer. \"I'm sorry Alex but as much as we tried for some blasted reason we couldn't get the formula to stick with your minimal muscled state or any state between. The only simulation it worked in was were you are in your 'maxmum' muscle state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex can't go out looking like that. Do you know how hard it is for a girl like that to find a guy who isn't afraid she'll hurt him?\" Clover said in a hush hush motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah isn't their another way.\" Said sam with her hands in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry sighed. \"I'm sorry girl's but this is indeed the only other option. If Alex take's this formula she will remain in her full muscled body for the rest of her life but she will be in total control of her emotions and she won't have to worry about changing size. Were as if she refuses she can still pass for normal but she will have to keep herself under control which right now is hard for her too do judging from her constant chaging since we boarded the jet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sighed but nodded. She was finding it a 'lot' harder to keep herslef in check and the smallest things would make her angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Alex whats your descision?\" Asked Jerry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alex had decided she would rather be a giant for the rest of her life and be in control than a fluctuating mass of muscle that got mad enough to smash anything that annoyed her. The only effect was that she momentarily felt extreme rage to cause her to go maximum muscle before the anger was swept away but leaving her in that state. Trapping her like this for life. They'd road home in silence and had made for seperate areas in the house. Clover was in her room looking for something. Sam was watching TV trying to push the whole day out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RRRIIIPPP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the third pair of pants she'd ruined just trying to put them on. All over her room were the remnents of clothing that 'used to' fit perfectly now she could barley get them over her huge calves. Her tops were the same. She could barley button the ones over her rock hard abs now never mind her chest and the tops she used to slip over her head always got stuck when they reached her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been reduced to wearing the cloth's she wore when she went to visit her parent's. A very big and conservative top and a loose fitting pair of jeans which hid all clues that she was a girl back when she was smaller. Now they fit her perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed before turning to her full length mirror. She flexed her arm and her frown deepened when she heard her cloth's creak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is a nightmare' She thought. She was a seven foot tall teenage girl with more muscle and strength than even a mister universe possessed if how easily she beat Wernerstien was anything to go by. She could just imagine how her dating life was going to be now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her head she imagined she was in the hallway at Beverly Hills high. She came up behind a boy she liked and tapped his shoulder. He'd turn around and she'd ask \"Hey you wanna go out this saturday.\" Then he'd fall to his knees crying \"Please don't hurt me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Mandy. Their was no way whatsoever that she'd be able to even walk in the door without the purple wearing witch making fun of her with names to numerous to mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd have to treat the world like it's made of glass. She'd opened the door to the house and it'd broken right off the hinge's. She'd tried to pour some juice earlier and every time she tried she broke the glass between her finger's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only plus she could see was that the gym coach would probably worship the ground she walked on since soccer and gym would be a snap now. No doubt that part of her in her life would be good but the rest looked like it was going to suck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alex.\" Called Clover from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know you should knock before coming into a person's room?\" Said the girl as she continued to look sadly at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that only counted if the door was still attached to the doorway?\" Said the blonde as she pointed to the door laying against a  wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex groaned and looked at one of her two best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Clover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay hear it is. What do I do to make myself feel better when I'm depressed?\" She said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick a boy at random from your little black book to take you out then dump him three hours later?\" Said Alex in her usual way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover's eyebrow twitched a little but her smile stayed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I go SHOPPING!\" She said loudly as she whipped out a handfull of credit card's and spread them like a fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Clover I don't think that I should go out like this.\" Alex said apprehensivly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you'll go out when your normal again. Okay that should only take, gee I don't know, NEVER!\" She got in her friends face. \"Look Alex I know you don't want to face it but sooner or later your going to have to leave this house and it might as well be doing something you like to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I...\" Alex started half heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but's Ms Muscles. Unless you plan to wear that ugly top for the rest of your life you need new cloth's. Now grab your card's and let's go!.\" Said the blonde with a tone of finality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looke at the torn cloth's littered about her room. \"Well I guess I do need new stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover smiled and made for the door. \"Perfect. See you downstairs in five minutes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sighed before smiling a little. 'Thanks Clover' She thought before she moved to grab her own card filled wallet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or rather Alex was the centre of attention. Since getting here all she'd gotten were blatent stare's and not so hushed whisper's. On either side of her Sam and Clover were shooting angry glares at the gaping crwod who seemed to wilt as soon as they looked at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Alex's stopped walk as a sign of depression Clover smiled reassurinly and spoke. \"Relax Alex. It's Beverly hill's, just give them a week and you 'know' they'll find something 'else' to stare at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just raised her head slightly. \"Do you think in a week's time can turn into 'right now?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend's moaned slightly at the lack of progress they were making with her when they spotted their favourite cloth's shop. They grabbed a hand each and somehow managed to drag thier muscular friend into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey set to work immediatly. Well morso Clover than Sam. They dashed about the store like hyperactive blur's. Grabbing whatever they thought would look good on their giant friend who they'd shoved into a changing room.  By the end of it they'd handed in no less than thirty articles of clothing to Alex. They were both pleased with themselves for the moment until the girl's response came from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of this stuff fit's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover replyied. \"Huh? Are you sure? I mean all that stuff is 'large'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn annoyed voice shot back at her. \"Well this 'Large' blouse feel's like a 'small'. It's barley any better than the stuff I had at home. And their was some really cute stuff in here I liked \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Alex jusrt hand us out the stuff you like and well just ask the manager to get you the next size up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girl's searched the store for a few second's before finding the manageress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um excuse me.\" Said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman turned. She looked a few yars older than then and had a slight air of a snob about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes how can I help you today?\" She said in a voice that people stereotypically associate with wealth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled a little before lifting up the cloth's that Alex said she liked. \"We were wondering if you could get us the next size up for these cloth's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked over the cloth's for a second, examining the tags before he raised her hand to her mouth and started laughing. \"Are you serious. These are the biggest size we have. What are you trying to dress a bull elephant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girl's glared at the woman who continued to laugh. Clover turned back to the dressing room and shouted a little.\" Hey Alex could you come out here for a sec?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and out came the muscular girl dressed as she was when she came in. She walked over to the girl's and the woman who was now coughing rather badly as soon as she saw Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Clover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde smiled before turning back to the manageress and hid her malicousness behind a happy smile. \"Tell her what you just told us a second ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nearly fainted as Alex fixed her sight on her. All semblance of her superiority over the cusomer she usually had was gone as she tried to stammer out a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We we we d-d-don't have a bi-big-bigger size of the cl-cloth's you asked for.\" Her fear grew as the girl zoomed in to meet her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked distressed. \"What! But I really like these cloth's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So-sorry bu-but the only pla-pl-place that you c-c-c-could go would be the bi-big and t-t-tall store across for here.\" She stammered out. As soon as she mentioned the 'big and tall' Alex's brow went into a frown and she promptly fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover and Sam grinned at each other fo a moment before their friend turned around. Her face once again slack from depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The big and tall? That's were I have to shop now? Being like this really stink's, I bet they don't even have any cute stuff.\" She found her friends taking either side of her as they once again pulled her out of her formally favourite store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. I'm sure that they have some really good stuff in here too.\" Said Clover trying to cheer her friend up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just sighed and let her friend's drag her into the store were the two found themsselves to be the smallest one's there.</span></div></div>",

They really did have a good selection of cute cloth's rather than the bland or just plain manish stuff she'd been expecting/ Not to mention that the other customer's were more her size if not 'taller' which made her feel more normal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also kinda funny to se Sam and Clover feel like midget's in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now she was testing out her new cloth's that she'd bought and was pleased that they did not strain or tear when she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you it wouldn't be so bad. Theyre were even some cute boy's you got to talk to\" Said Clover once again standing in the to be fixed doorway with her arm's crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those were bodybuilder's. They asked me about my routine to get my abs so ripped.\" The girl sighed. She'd been talked to a couple of grade A hunk's in the store today, but it turned out that they were only interested in how she got so big before walking off with a pair of girl's who were 5'5 and curvy. Unlike her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now even if she finds a guy who's not intimidated by her  the chances of her actually being attractive to him are slim since she was about as curvy as the incredible hulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey at least they talked to you.\" The blonde said in a good natured fashion only to be silenced by a glare. \"Look on the bright side you'll have plenty more chances tommorrow at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's eye's bugged out. \"School? I can't go to school looking like this.\" She made herpoint by flexing causing the football sized bicep to jut out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover groaned before giving the girl a heated look. \"Didn't we have this talk a while ago. You 'need' to accept your stuck like this and get on with your life or else you'll totally end up a loner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger girl tried to come up with an arguement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they'll stare Alex. Just give them a while and and make something up when they ask how it happened and they'll treat you like they alway's have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duh. Mandy take's crack's at us whenever possible. You being muscular won't make her act any more like the evil queen she already is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just need to control yo strength soyou don't hurt anyone. Besides you did say that coach would worship the ground you walk on  when he see's this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to come up with a good arguement. She really did but Clover had shot down anything she was about to say even before she'd said it. So she just lowered her head in an obvious sign of defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover smirke before going to leave the room. \"See you tommorrow for school.\" Then she left<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just stared at the floor for a few second's in deep thought. The mall was bad enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh school on the other hand? She'd be eaten alive.</span></div></div>",

No people disipearing. No stolen technnology. No plot to take over anywhere or revenge on anyone/anything. Just find their secret and if they were cheating the girls should stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they didn't expect was for the coach to be impplanting them with robotic bugs that improved the teams performance through a combination of brain stimulation and chemical realese. They didn't expect the coach to be an evil maniac who was not only willing to let one of his team die but tie the girls up and send them to an icy death. Nor did they expect him to take one of them as a replacement for the dying team member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunatly Alex and Sam managed to escape the death trap. Which consisted of tying them to chairs with ski's and pushing them of in a random direction so it really wasn't much of a trap. They managed to get back to the lodge were all the competitors were staying and save the dying girl by having her sneeze out the robot bug before going to bring the coach in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived they found him watching the figure skating match witch was being prformed by one of his own team and an 'incredibly' buff Clover. The girls gaped for a few seconds as their ridiculously muscled friend before dealing with the evil coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were seriously considering that these villians just dumped a bunch of jobs in a hat before picking one and tacking on 'evil' to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say they caught the bad guy and got Clover to sneeze out her three bugs causing her to lose the skating talent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course their was a small problem left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't I be shrinking or something?\" Said Clover now in her i'll fitting spy uniform. When she had sneezed out the bug's she'd immediatly lost the skill and agility to skate like she was. Though for some reason she hadn't lost any muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I mean we got all your bugs.\" Said Sam holding up a plastic bag containing the bug's. The girl's looked close and they could see out of the three all of them had a sort of crack along their casing or broken away parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think it's got something to do with the banged up one?\" Asked Alex. She shrunk away as the girls gave her a 'duh' look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry came over for their traditional 'well done'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls I wanted to say well...Clover shouldn't you have shrunk by now.?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe muscled girl spoke up. \"Yeah I know. We think it's got something to do with these broken bugs.\" She said as she held up the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry looked at it for a few seconds before calling over the agents who had the coach restrained and motioned for him to be brought over. He titlted his head to face the man and spoke with a voice full of authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You created the bugs right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach glared at him but nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would prevent reversion if ll the bugs were removed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach looked to the side and saw Clover still as brawny as he made her and grinned.\" Looks like my bugs broke open inside you little missy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover hit her fist into her palm. \"I knew it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach nodded and grinned at his small revenge. \"Those bugs worrk through both stimulation of synapses in the brain to increase skill and reaction time and by releasing chemicals to induce muscle growth in the body in microscopic doses. You however took three doses of the whole thing at once when they broke open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when can our friend go back to being normal instead of a beefcake?\" Asked Alex in a hopeful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover glared at her. The coach laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revert? 'Hah hah' Mabye if the dose had been what it was supposed to be then she'd have changed back immediatly. But she took all three bugs worth of chemicals. It's completly flodded her systems. There's absolutly no chance of her changing back ever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry glared at him before motioning for him to be taken away. He turned to Clover who was frozen in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you Clover that woohp will do anything it can you turn you back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl relaaxed a little at the comforting word's. Then Alex joined in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And even if they can't and you have to spend the rest of your life musclebound I'm sure boy's will still like you. And just think of how easy gym will be now.\" The girl said in an excited tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Jerry groaned as Clover went back to being frozen like a statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be a long day.</span></div></div>",

Stop the villian with the silly theme with the stpid grudge from changing the world in some ridiculous way. This time it was doctor Inga Bittersweet who through the use of her hyper addictive and ultra fattening cookie's planned to turn the whole world into obese cookie addict's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover tried one to see why they were so addicted and before she knew it was having difficulty putting on her belt after only several box's. She'd gotten fatter and fatter throughout the mission until she reach'ed the four hundred plus mark she was at now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mused that it was something of a pattern that she always seemed to be the one who underwent the fantastically impossible transformations, just once why couldn't Alex or Sam become the freaks of nature?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunatly they stopped Bittersweet's evil plan and Whoop had created a cure that broke down all the cookie fat and returning people to their original weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone except her at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason her body 'rejected' the cure and any variation they made. When she screamed at Jerry who had just recently lost his own cookie induced obesity who said they were going to fix this, He pointed to the Whoop gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd run out of the room immediatly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here she was excersicing her brains out for over a week and she had yet to lose even an ounce. No matter how hard she tried she could lose any weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered on why she wasn't losing the weight as she raced on the excercise bike and took another bite of her 'fifth' candy bar of the hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething's were a 'mystery'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't.</span></div></div>",

They turned away from the TV to see the hefty girl in a much larger version of the stylish clothing she would normally wear. Only with a cap, sunglasses and a scarf so no one would recognise her. She was carrying her purse on one shoulder and her gym bag in another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was the gym today Clover?\" Said  Alex in a happy voice which was shoot down when the 400lb+ girl glared her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not lose as much as you'd like then?\" Said Sam with her attention back to the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover sighed then threw herself onto the couch. Causing the other girl's to jump a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try nothing. I've been going to that stupid Whoop gym every day for weeks now and I haven't even lost an ounce.\" The girl said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing we've been bringing you your homework.\" Said Sam which only made the overly chubby girl feel worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so not fair. Everyone else get's to just let all this fat melt away but I have to work at it to be thin again.\" She sighed before reaching into her gym bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But you should have lost something by now.\" Said Alex curiously. They knew a week wasn't enough time to lose a great deal of wait but their should have been some preogress. If anything Clover actually looked to be 'gaining' the weight she should have been losing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. I should have lost at least five pounds by now but when I went to check the scales since last week I,I,I\" She sounded like she was choking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Said Sam trying to coax her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I GAINED 8 POUNDS!!! I'm actually gaining the weight I'm supposed to be losing. At this rate I'm gonna be a blob.\" The girl said pathetically as she pulled the jumbo chocolate bar she'd beenn reaching for out of her purse and began inhaling i like it was air. \"I mean *chomp* what's wrong with me.\" She said as she finished off a candy bar big enough for two in seconds before reaching for another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two other's looked at each other before looking back at thier depressed friend who was biting into her second candy bar. They both looked into her purse and found it full of nothing 'but' chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Clover. This is kinda going out on a limb but mabye your not losing any weight because you won't stop eating.\" Said Sam trying to put it gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\" Said the confused girl as she licked her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wellll, Uh. Weve noticed that since youve stopped eating those cookies youve been eating everything else you can get your hands on.\" Said Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that is so not true.\" Said Clover as she reached for yet another bar. Alex assumed the 'stern lecture' stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really. For breakfast you usually have toast and mabye a grapfruit. This morning you cleaned out the fridge of everything but the humis. And you took that for your lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey if I wanna cut loose once in a while I...\" She was cut off by Sam who was also in lecture mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once in a while is fine. But not all week. Since you can't get passion patties anymore youve been grabbing for everything you can fit in your mouth as a substitute. You haven't went 10 minutes without eating since we got back from that mission. It's no wonder your not losing any weight. All your time at the gym is doing is slowing your weight gain down a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover stood up to give her friends a piece of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is ridiculous, I do not have an eating problem.\" She shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. Say's the girl with the purse full of candy who's eaten 4 bars in 2 minutes. Said Sam angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did the trick. With a final angry look Clover grabbed her purse and gym bag before stomping up stair's loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two plopped back down on the sofa and sighed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could have gone better.\" Said Alex as she reclined her head and looked up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam didn't even need to move her head for Alex to know that she agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night as they were both going to bed they had the tell tale sign's of eating coming from Clover's room. They both shook their head's in shame before heading to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Au.I. I know the girl's didn't start living together til a later series but I liked it better his way.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They'd tried to get Clover to come down and study too. They knocked her door and asked her to join them with Alex using her sweetest tone without any mention to her wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer response was and I quote \"Sorry but my FAT won't fit through the door.\" She said through the door venomously before the sound's of munching resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this stage they weren't sure if she said that completly out of spite or because it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't really sensitive about her weight a few night's ago. In fact she was desperate to lose it. Now with only an observation to her eating habit's she'd done a comlete 180. She used to go to the gym as soon as it opened and stayed until the staff made her leave so she wouldn't get overexerted and injure herself on thier property. Now she just spend's all day in her room with the sound of eating the only thing they can hear. They hadn't seen her in day's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were nose deep in the school book's when a familiar beeping sound echoed from somewhere and one of the painting's on the wall suddenly turned to static fuzz before the face of the head of Woohp and thier boss apppeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning girl's. I'm afraid weve got a situation.\" Said Jerry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's just closed their book's before turning to face their boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it this time Jerry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to speak when he blinked and looked side to side. \"I'm sorry but were's Clover. I really don't like repeating myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's frowned before speaking. \"Look Jerry you really should just tell us. Clover's in no condition to go anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. What's wrong. Flu? Chickenpox? A boy break up with her before she could break up with him?\" Jerry said with a tace of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...It's about that weight that she...\" She was interupted by an annoyed Jerry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? Really now that's hardly something that should hinder her perforamnce in a mission. Provided she followed the weight loss routine she should be fit to....\" Ths time he was interupted by Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not lost any weight Jer. She's gained it.\" The reaction from the older man was his eye's to bulge in shock before his hand's flew across his desk's computer. He looked to the left away from the moniter he was looking at the girl's through to look at another before he paled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir lying on her bed surrounded by dozen's upon dozen's of junk food rapper's was Clover. It was true that she'd lost not a single ounce of her cookie weight. In fact she was easily another 5 to 10 pound's heavier than when the girl's had last seen her. Probably because  all of her attention was now on eating rather than losing the weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also looked like she hadn't washed in day's. Her hair had lost it's luster. Her cloth's which she had bought to fit her large body were tighter than should be and had that dirty and worn look cloth's you don't wash get. The blush and eyeliner she expertly applies had smeared and dry black streak mark's rann from her eyes and down her cheek's showing she had been upset with what the girl's said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of her cheek's they were now a rather sickly shade of brown. Not from a bad tan but from all the chocolate covering it from the way she just crammed more in even before she'd swallowd the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was sad to say but this wasn't the first time he'd seen this. Clover was like a handful of people he'd known in his lifetime. When upset they would go do something to the point of insanity. His mother once knitted a sweater for him that could cover a bull when he brought her a failing report card. A retired agent he knew whittled a tree into a toothpick when he had to be let go. Unfortunatly Clover's habit was not nearly as safe for her health as the other's were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly he didn't have time for the girl's to be distracted  by their friend. He needed them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then It'll just be you two going then. The problem is...\"</span></div></div>",

But we just locked her up how could she get out?\" Asked Alex in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry explained \"She apparently had some cookies left over and had one of her henchmen mail them as a care package. One of the guard's ate one and instantly got hooked. From theyre it should have been easy for Bittersweet to control him with the promise of more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think she's planning.\" Asked Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I don't plan to give her the luxury of starting a new plan to begin with.\" Said Jerry. \"I'm sending you two girl's to track her down wherever she may be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nodded. It was their past experience with the few baddies they fought more than once that they alwways stuck to their theme. If they didn't catch Bittersweet soon then the world would once again be in danger of mass obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry nodded back and pressed a button on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the floor opened up and swallowed the two girrl's who barely had time to scream. Really they should be used to it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ===================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover didn't get briefed on the mission. She was far to busy packing caramel down her throat to really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been isolated in her room for the past few day doing nothing but stuffing her face with junk. Luckily it was a holiday week so she didn't have to go to school. Or mabye unluckily it was a holiday week otherwise she would have actually had to leave the room and take a brek from her constant eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally she'd been hurt by her friend's word's. Not many people like to be called fat, which she knew she was but the fact that her friend's thought she wasn't really trying to control herself and she just ate and ate like a pig. That had hurt. It wasn't the sort of thing you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still mad at her friend's but she did realise that they may be right. She really couldn't stop. She'd seen herself in the mirror a while ago and was horrified that she looked so dirty, her hair, cloth's, make up, face, everything was a mess. However instead of using this epiphany to sort herself out she just sat their and continued eating. The desire to stuff herself even when she wasn't hungry was greater than the desire to clean up her act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you may be wondering exactly how someone can constantly eat while never leaving their room and still have food to scarf down? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell if you remember Clover has been keeping a rather large supply of candy bar's in her purse. Those bar's are actually part of a stach she'd been building up since she came home fat. Almost every place in her room had at least 5 pound's of candy hidden in it. Her drawer's were full of chcolate. Her closet had nothing but bags of chip's in at and the secret Whoop comparments for all the spy stuff they had were filled with gummi's. Theyre was a lot more but let's stop theyre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Clover lay's on her bed with a mouthful of caramel and her hands already bringing nachos up to her mouth. She eyed them with great eagerness but a small part of her held disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ===================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the house an old woman and a rather fat man stood dressed in loose sweat cloths to hide themselves. The old woman smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to exact my revenge on those troublesome girl's.\" Said the woman in a european accent.</span></div></div>",

We go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure nodded \"*Munch* Uh huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two got out and headed towards the house. Bittersweet dressed in a gunky green grandma sweater that stretched over her swollen midsection and inflated bosom, and long skirt with her hair down, while the walking man mountain of blubber waddled up the path with a cart holdding several boxes, one of which was open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped his reaching pork pie hand \"And don't eat them all. We need every cookie for my plan!\" Looking around the outside and seeing no one Bittersweet pushed the door open and walked in followed by her henchmen....who got stuck in the doorway since he was half a times bigger than her for several seconds before pulling himself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBittersweet scanned the living room for a moment before hearing a loud thumping coming from right abve her, a glance at the stairs drew attention to a discarded candy wrapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned and took one of the boxes into her own hands. \"Wait here.\" She whispered and climbed the stairs. Growing jiggier yet angrier with each step since she felt a strain that a few days ago she would have never known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover was still lying on her bed looking throughly glutted. A mountain of candy wrappers surrounding her. Chocolate smearing her face being cleaned away only by long tracts of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RUMBLE* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a fit of immaturity usually saved for a ninety percent sale at a frnch sounding store she thrashed in bed baging her fists and feet against the mattress, \"I just feed you 5 pounds of herssssshys! Stop wanting mooooore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach whined back at her, its arguement being far more aggresive and animalistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clutched her swelling mid section and sobbed a little as the demands to be filled grew louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So hungry.' She turned to her side and felt her blubberous belly hit the bed a moment later. She looked across her room and saw boxes and bags and parcels and wrappers and foils covering every inch of the floor and every surface, yet she knew a ton of more hinding spots in this room alone where she hid more sweets. Sweets which she was fighting herself against getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screwed her eyes shut and threw herself flt on her back again gripping her sheets as it went from loud to painful to ignore her stomach. Frustration and hunger clear on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So hungry.\" She whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe thats so sad. You poor dear you look famished.\" A kindly and unfortunatly familiar voice came from her door just as it opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover recognoised who it was. Te grey hair, the mole, the germanic features, the huge fat stomach tat sprang into existence in only a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bittersweet.\" Clover said coldly and shot up......yeah right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evil cook smiled evily when the red spy flopped back down onto her bed with a floor shaking crash. She walked over to the bed, slowly opening the box and allowing the smell of cookies to fill the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLearning from her mistake the blonde swung onto her side and managed to toss herself off the bed, landing with a thump and causing shooting pains in her arms to suddenly brace so much weight. She bit her lip and sucked it up before standing in what may have pereviouslybeen a valid martial arts pose before her body became built for sumo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you got out of prison Doc.  But your going...right..ba....\" The heveanly smell hit her like a cruise missle. The rich delicous aroma attacking her nostrils and assaulting the pleasure centers of her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'doc' fully opened the box and held out the minty chocolate goodness. \"Thats right my sweet. Passion Patties, all for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover wiped the speck of drool that escaped her mouth away and gave the doctor a hard look. \"Not gonna work creep. It's gonna take more than a few cookies to beat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GGGRROOWWWLL!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your stomach disagrees with you.\" She held the cookie under her nose and sniffed it slowly. Her own chemically induced hunger screaming at her to forget revenge and just gorge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover blushed and moved a hand closer to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big....how FAT are you now Clover? 400, no I'd say close to 500 pounds?\" She kicked a soda can at her feet. \"I'm about a hundred pounds lighter than you and my legs feel the strain. Yours must feel like they're going to break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh huh.'Her eyed still on the cookie, I mean Bittersweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step closer. \"Poor sweety. No passion patties to fill that ever growing tummy of yours so you fill it with whatever inferior junk you could find.\" She looked at the patty for a second lomger before wolfing it down in a single bite, delighting in the the horrified look Clover tried covering up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmm. Wouldn't you rather have a chocolatly, gooey, minty piece of hevean. Hevean knows I do.\" She popped another and another in her mouth. Savouring every bite almost as much as she enjoyed the ever growing look of hunger on her enemies face. The sounds the teens belly made near constant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up another and waggled it in front of her. Blue eyes following chemically drugged goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on. One more tiny little cookie won't do won't hurt will it.\" She tossed it down on the bed covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spy held out for twenty whole seconds before she dove at the bed, the frame snapping in half under the sudden weight. The drawers in the sides smashing open and hershy kisses rushing out, the  metal snapping suddenly and tubes of gumbools and caramels poured onto a torn open pillow with a mix of feathers and cotton candy. The girl ignored all these sweets and gobbled down the cookie with haste. Moaning with delight as she did so and looking up at Bittersweet hopefully when she'd finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman grinned evily and threw another cookie, biting into one herself with duel satisfaction.</span></div></div>",

How is that like possible?\" Clover frowned, wiping the sweat from her face.<br>\r\n\"Alex and Sam told me about one of Bittersweet's inventions 'The Feeder'\" Jerry revealed.<br>\r\n\"Oh? now that you mention it the batch of cookies from the feeder were much more yummier than the boxed ones!\" <br>\r\nClover Revealed.<br>\r\n\"Hmm... yes, maybe there was something in those cookies that has prevented you.... Clover?\"-<br>\r\n\"So chocolatey.....Mmmm.. So heavenly!...\" Clover mumbles to herself.<br>\r\n\"Clover!\" Jerry shouts.<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry i just remembered how yummy they were once you made me remember them.\" She says innocently<br>\r\n\"Are you craving for them?\" Jerry asks carefully.<br>\r\n\"No! are you kidding? They were so delicious but im not hooked anymore! I just wish i wasn't this 320 pound blob!\" <br>\r\nClover confessed, making her arm fat jiggle so Jerry got her point.<br>\r\n\"Okay I understand, but I just wanted to be sure.\" Jerry said scratching his head.<br>\r\n\"Theres like one other thing i don't understand Jerry\"- \"Oh? What is that?\" <br>\r\n\"Well, When we were like tied down at the feeder and Bittersweet left, Sam and Alex both spit out the cookies that the machine forced into their mouths!<br>\r\nI don't know about you but the second a passion patty touched my tongue i was like so addicted like straight away! And they spat it out like it was nothing!\"<br>\r\nClover yelled in anger because the cookies only affected her and not her best friends.<br>\r\n\"Really? Thank you for telling me that Clover that is strange indeed!... How about you head on home for the day and try to relax\" Jerry offered.<br>\r\n\"Relax? I'm 320 pounds Jerry how can I? Like i don't even fit into my own clothes anymore I can't go home in my spy uniform\" She says confused.<br>\r\n\"Put these back on, it's the outfit you wore at the factory, It shall do for now\" Jerry handed her the outfit and smiled.<br>\r\n\"And don't worry take this sleeping gas cookie and use it on your mother, if you are that worried she will spot you in this condition she'll wake up thinking it was a dream\" He continued with his hand over her fattened shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover threw on the Swedish outfit only to discover it was very tight on her. She was only 280 pounds when she last wore it but had continued to gain another 50 while in the warehouse. WOOHP flies her home and she hoped her mother wasnt home so she could lock herself in her room and hide until they could cure her.<br>\r\nHer large body swayed and her stomach bounced every step she took, she searched for the cookie only to find it hiding in her stomach fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ugh here goes...\" Clover said with a little fear.<br>\r\n*Ding Dong*<br>\r\n\"... Hello?\" her mother answered not recognizing it was her own daughter.<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" Clover pouted.<br>\r\n\"Clover?... Is that you!?\" She says dumbfounded.<br>\r\n\"...Nooooo! I'm a girl scout for The Happy girls and I'm here to offer you a free sample of our new cookies!\" Clover spits out as a knee-jerk reaction.<br>\r\n\"My goodness you have such a likeness to my Clover only you're more... heavyset\" Her mother says in a slightly obnoxious tone. Clover went red in the face but kept her fake smile and handed her the cookie. Her mother took a bite and got a face full of knockout gas and fell almost comically to the floor.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god that was so embarrassing!....\" Clover grabbed her mother and struggled to drag her inside, she still wasn't used to being so big as she was so thin just 2 days before.</span></div></div>",

She made her way near the mirror cabinet to prepare for the day. She took off her pajama and revealed her naked, unfeminine body that she almost instantly covered with some nerdy clothes that included white sneakers, white socks, long checked skirt and white buttoned shirt. She finished her look by tucking her hair into low pony tail, but one thing still seemed off. She looked once again in the mirror and the image was still blurry. Her glasses, that she now have to wear, were waiting on her desk. Moment later those black rimmed, square spectacles rested on her acne covered face. She was now ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been several days since the spy mission, that changed the trio into total nerds. They've stopped possessed Arnold, but even after Cat's Eye Ring was destroyed the affected people weren't changed back. Jerry and the whole agency are working on an antidote, but their efforts haven't been successful so far. He advised the girls to go back to their daily lives until they can be changed back. All affected people, except the girls, had their memory modified so they though, that they were always nerds to prevent panic in the city. Sam knew that Jerry won't let them down after everything good they did as spies so she wasn't worried about this whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam didn't like the changes at first, but she slowly warmed up to them. She knew, she always was a nerd inside, but didn't want to admit it before Alex and Clover. For now she just embraced and went with her true nature as the brain of the team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was going downstairs to the kitchen she noticed one of her housemates in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</div></span></div></div>",

My cookie's are being sent to every corner of the globe. I trust that's because my machine tok care of those girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Trove smiled. \"Yep. The other two fought it but in the end they ended upp going the same way as their addicted friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so they exploded? Come I want to see the splatter for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Inga Bittersweet walked away she noticed her henchwoman didn't follow her. She turned and show the fat woman rubbing the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah. About the whole exploding thing.\" Troove said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBittersweet raised an eyebrow in confusion. Five minutes later she raised the other in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girl's were still in the room she was looking into through a two way window. They were a 'LOT' in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three gir's were now obvious;y adicted to the cookie's since they showed no resistance whatsoever when the feeder placed another one in their mouth's. They'd also filled out conderably since she left hours before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two who weren't addicted when they same in were now as big as their friend was when she'd been tyied to the chair. Both of them straining against the fabric of their cloths as with every eagerly awaited cookie they grew larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for their friend. Inga was grateful that those dress's she'd had made for her giftshop were 'deisigned' to hold in rapidly inflating people. She just didn't consider by how much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was a least twice they size she had been hour's ago. The buckle holding her their snmapped cleanly in two. The shear amount of fat in her body causing the highly durable dress to rip in several place's yet still managing to contain her. The only thing that really showed how fat she'd gotten was she had four chins whereas befor she'd only had a very soft one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBittersweet looked into the room in shock for a few minutes before cackling maniacly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look (Troove?). This is the future of the world. Completly helpless and under my complete control. Soon every one in the world will be like her.\" She grinned with all her teeth showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that these girl's were out of the way nothing would stop her.</span></div></div>",

They had also grown large enough were even the simplist task's were proving difficult. At 500lb+ Their once flattering stereotypically swedish dress's now acted as hillbilly like brassiere shirt's and their large victorianesque shorts acting as tight short's. Their large belly's sticking out so far they couldn't even see thier toe's and their flabby arms and leg's forcing them into a waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet despite the inhuman amount of mind beding super fattening cookie's they had consumed they still retained their free will and control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is far more than they could say for their blonde friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Gulp*..........*Chomp*........*chew*......*munch*.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girl's spared a glance at their beyond morbidly obese friend.

All in all she weighed about three hundred pounds more than the girl's making her well over 800lb's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had stopped saying 'cookies'. She had stopped speaking entirly. Her entire mind had all but shut down save for the most basic of voulintary function's. Namely breathing and eating anything that was put in her mouth. Right now you could put a plastic disc in her mouth and she would try to chew and swallow it like a cookie. She had become a completly mindless eating machine whose sole purpose was to open her mouth, chew and swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Clover.

This is how she normally look's. But she was discovered half an hour ago in a back street in Paris like this.\" He pressed another button. The girl's eye's widend in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl they had seen in the last picture was now hovering 20 feet above a street and built like a ball. Her entire torso was a perfect sphere with the blue outfit she was wewaring tight and stretched to the limit. Her arm's and leg's had been pulled in to the balll and she was left with stubby hand's and feet flaining about. She appeared to be shouting for help and the girl's couldn't help but notice she had a much higher voice than anyone should nortmally have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She look's like she's been blown up like a balloon.\" Said Alex in her usual point out the obvious fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly right Alex.\"Jerry pressed a few more button's and other picture's came up. \"Ms LeBeu and several other woman in Paris have literally been inflated like Balloon's. Test's have shown them to be full of some kind of helium that doesn't disipate. Your mission will be to discover who's been doing this and why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flipped a switch and his desk flipped over revealing several gadget's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For this mission you'll be getting the laser nail file, the tornado blast hairdryer, the eye spy x-ray lenses and in the chance you inflated you'll be getting these.\" He held up three thick grey shirt's. \"Simply put these on under your cloth's and they'll increase you personel gravity field.

He didn't expect for the dark hand to try to steal it. Himself to be kidnapped by a private collecter who also wanted the statue or to be fighting the dark hand thug's and the collector's thug's while a half cat Valmont fight his half cat niece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had quickly dispatched the henhmen with his usual way. Which when he thought about it always ended up being less serious and more comedic in nature. He'd then caught up with Jade who had managed to trick Valmont by using his new cat like thought pattern's against him. He was pleasently surprised to see that she actually knew she had to change back for once. They found the collecter - Cardif zenlo with the statue and a hiss from Jade made him hand it over smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnforunatly as they were contemplating what the riddle for the cure to the cat curse meant they were ambushed by Valmont who hoisted Jade up and threw her against a far wall were she landed in a heap. It was at this moment that Jackie realised how dangerous the Staue was and knew what he had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. This is to dangerous to be in a museum.\" He sid venomously and she threw the statue against the ground and shattered it into a thousand pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenlo shouted at him asking if he knew what he was doing and Jackie responded that the Cat of Katomb was to dangerous. Then he watched as he saw smoke erupt from the statue's pieces and covered Valmont. Almost immediatly he started getting less hairy and his claws turned back into fingernails. His fangs receeded and his slitted eyes rounded out again. By the time all the smoke was all gone he was human once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled at the revelation. \"The anidote lies within. Within the statue.\" He turned when he heard a moan from the corner of the room his niece was thrown into. \"Jade the...\" He stopped as he saw her stand and raise her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair still reached down her back. Her eyes still slitted and her nails still claws. Her top lip split, her nose a pink triangle and most obvious she was still covered in golden blonde fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Jackie?\" The cat girl asked. She then noted the smashed statue and a hairless Valmont. She looked back at Jackie again. \"Whoah does this mean you found the cure? Where is it?\" Th girl said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, how, when, Why arn't you.\" He stumbled over his words before his eyes opened wide as he suddenly realised. The smoke that cured Valmont. It never got to Jade since she was far across the room at the time. Meaning she she couldn't be cured of the cat curse. If he wanted to cure her now he'd have to find another cat of Katomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thought entered his head. 'Their was only one statue.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his catty niece who was looking up at him expectedly. At her feet a white cat was rubbing itself against her leg's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steeled himself as he prepared for the worst. \"Uh Jade....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later Jackie was searching for bandages to cover the cat scratches that covered his face</span></div></div>",

Their niece trudging in behind him with a large scarf sovering her whole head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes good to see you to Uncle.\" Jackie said nervously. Jade just stood behind him with her arms crossed angrily. Her hand's in glove's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me for asking. \"Said the gentle giant Tohru. \"But why is Jade wrapped head to toe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle observed this two. \"Indeed. You woul almsot think that she did not want to show hert f....Jackieeee you did manage to 'cure' her of the cat of cartombs curse did you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie scratched the base of his neck nervously. \"Wellll.\" He reached over and pulled off Jade's scarf. Letting her new mass of hair fall and her kitty face be revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men had differant reaction's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww kitty.\" Cooed Tohru, a sucker for cat's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAIIIIIYYYYAAAHHHH!!!\" Screamed uncle in his usual fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest covere their ear's. Especially Jade with her new hypersensitive sense of hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww. Okay cat ear's, not the geatest thing about being like this.\" Muttered Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle was lready in his nephew's face. \"How could you not find the cure. You want Jade to be hairy cat woman for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did find the cure uncle but....\" He butted in but was swatted by the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT! Then why did you not use it...\" Uncle continued his rant. Jackie knew if he didn't keep butting in he could stay this way for hour's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cure was inside the statue and was released as gas when I broke it. Valmont changed back but Jade wasn't even close to it before it disipated. I  didn't know breaking the statue would do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle looked at him for several second's before calming down. He looked over Jade how seemed very uncomfertable. Unlike past transformations she seemed to not be enjoying it as much. Then again she always knew she could change back before. This if he didn't do something could be for life and with the disticnt lack of catfirl's in the world it wouldn't be much of a life to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off his glass''s and sighed. \"In the absense of the true cure I will try to create my own. I will do research but it would be greatly helpful if you were able to bring back a fragment of the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled. \"I thought you might need it so it's in the backpack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle nodded. \"Good. Then let us get to work.\" He and Jackie left for his study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohru g;lanced over at Jade who still looked rather upset. Not being her usual self. He was her best friend so he had to try and fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm. Would you like something to eat Jade.\" He questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I guess.\" She said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. We have some tuna in the fridge and cream.\" He said thoughtlessly before catching himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tuna?! Cream!?\" The girl perked up considerably and darte into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohru sighed in relief. He didn't hurt the girl's feeling's....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....and he got rid of that god awful fish. </span></div></div>",

Dark blue and light green lightning spreading from her ankle and dancing over her as she ceased levitating and hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohru felt a large pang of guilt at causing his friend such pain, But it was either this or letting her remain an evil demon of the shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to grow worried however when, Rather than stretch and fade away black lightning started to spark out from the tattoo, before enveloping the girl in a sinister electric aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShendu displaying his usual blend of opportunism and cowardice decided now was the perfect time to grab the archive. The younger male Chan saw this and reluctantly tore himself away from the sight of his niece to focus on the dragon wearing a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShendu sneered \"Thank you for disposing of the girl Chan. Now my minions are back where they belong, under my control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie grit him teeth. Readying himself to make a lunge for the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then ATTACK MY MINIONS!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie braced himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....Only nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShendu blinked and turned to look at the Shadowkhan. Utterly motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did not please the fire demon \"I possess the book! You must obey! NOW DESTROY JACKIE CHAN!\" He shouted and held the book aloft to illustrate his proof of ownership....only for a demon ninja to swoop down from the walkway above and snatch it from him. Dropping it down before skating it across the floor where it bumped into the still screaming Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to everyones collective horror the volume of black lightning tripled. Tohru backpedaled as fast as his bulk would allow to avoid getting zapped. Jades spasming form was slowly being obscured as she and were....cocooned for a lack of a better term in shadow energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JJJAAADDDEEE!!!\" Jackie yelled before lunging at the closing sphere of crackling darkness. He managed to reach in and brush the tip of his finger against her brow gently before he was sent flying back like he'd been kicked by a bull. His form lightly smoldering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei what...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man cut his student off \"Uncle has no idea. Removal spell should have worked.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly it did not. And clearly since I won't be getting the archive back.....\" The body of Valmont jumped up to the second floor \"...It's time for me to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked when he saw Jackie's scowl \"Me or your niece Chan. If I were unfortunate enough to be you. I'd wouldn't leave the child alone while she was mutating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mutating!?\" Tohru stammered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mutating. Ascending.  Banishing. Or maybe your spell will just outright kill her. Difficult to say really. But you probably don't want to follow me and risk not finding out.\" With that the robed sorcerer bolted down the walkway and out of site. The sound of his footsteps vanishing all the faster as the dark lightnings only grew stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chan clan looked to each other. Fear, anger and confusion all present in their expression with varying amounts. They turned back to the sphere as it continued to grow and swell. Unsure of what would happen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then another jump pushed out and went back in. Then another, and another and another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three watched with morbid curiosity as the orb became covered with dozens of undulating lumps. Pushing out around around, which gave them all the idea that maybe dozens of hands were pushing from the inside.

Watchin helplessly as his nieces cocoon collapsed in a singularity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt churned and heaved as it was pulled into a smaller and smaller space. It was as big as a beach ball, a watermelon, a football, baseball. When it reached the size of a marble a small crack barely as long as the head of a pin opened up, and sinister purple light spilled forth from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JJJJJJAA<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">ACCCCCC</font><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">KKKIIIIIIIE</font><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">EEEEE EE!!!!!! </font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere ached out towards it like he was in a trace and said \"Jade\" weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light sputtered, and with a final flash Jade Chan was gone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie stumbled forward for a few steps, his Uncle catching him before he collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle...\" He gasped out. \"Is....is Jade?\" He didn't want to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older chinese man looked down at his  nephew, and in an uncharacteristic act, pulled him close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle does't know.\" He said, sounding old as he was for once. He turned to see his apprentice, his head bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He grasped Jackies shoulders and pushed him out to arms length. Staring into the young mans eyes with deadly focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he will find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Jade felt......was.......sticky?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers twitched. Something went *SQELLCH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uuuuhhhh hooo-k. Thas grosss' Her head felt fuzzy. Like when she accidentally downed that coke and rum last new year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning she tried pushing herself up, only to slide back when the mud gave way beneath her hands. Her eyes flung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hihihihihihiihi\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade shot up as an eerie laugh echoed all about her. Sh looked around and took everything in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a forest. A creepy, creepy first were the trees were al twisted and bare of foliage. The sky above was full of clouds coloured blood red, with deep purple lightning flashing across frequently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning that struck down at that exact moment. Revealing a bunch of child sized silhouettes hiding among the tree's. Their large, buggy eyes all pointed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hihihihihihihi\" She was up on her feet in a moment. Barely recognising that her hands were blue when she pushed herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughing came back. Joined by voices she swore were pulled out of a movie about killer kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a sprite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sprites aren't blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hate sprites. Taste like nymphs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a sprite! Maybe a gnome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices came from all around her. She turned and turned but another flash showed nothing. She slipped into a stance and started mentally going over what Jackie had taught her about fighting multiple opponents. Shifting the loose parts of the weird dress she was wearing out the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off!\" She barked into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chatter only increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It talks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means its got good brains!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talky brains taste better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, this was seriously freaking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm warning you! I've got serious mojo going on. You try anything and I'll go all shadow khan on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chattering stopped. The noise in the forest went dead for a moment save for the sound of rolling thunder, and her own heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the chatter exploded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadowkhan?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes Shadowkhan!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only oni make Shadowkhan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ONI! ONI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oni not taste like sprite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oni taste good good good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasty tasty Oni!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EAT NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a chorus of agreement, they swarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozen's upon dozens of childlike forms swarmed into the small clearing from every direction. They shot out from the tree's like wild cats. Running across the ground at breakneck speed, or lunging from treetops. She could see eyes gleaming with mad hunger, and teeth like pirahna glinting in pal light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe punched the first one to grasp her, sending it sprawling to the ground. then kicked another who tried wrapping its long fingers around her k, however neck. One by one she was able to push then back, however evert one she pushed away was replaced by two more. The room she had to move shrank rapidly, and they grasping was growing. She managed to throw off two pulling at each of her arms but was immediately beset upon by four more. Then her legs were pulled out from under her, and even her hair was being painfully tugged on. She was trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pinned her back to the mud just as one of them pulled its face close to hers. It looked like a starving kid. Its body was thin almost to seeing its ribs. Its face however looked like an old mans with deep winkles and a bald head. It's mouth was naturally wide and showed off an array of long and thin needle like teeth. A long Aardvark like tongue reached out of it's dripping mouth an shed against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's already wide grin puled further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It IS oni!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIA joyous giggle rippled through the crowd. Those holding her gripped even tighter. The one looming over her lowered it's head, drool dripping uncaringly from its mouth as it peered into Jade's terrified red orbs. A sickly looking finger with a jagged nail raising up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get eye.\" It whispered before reaching down to claim it's prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RRRRRROOOOOAAAAARRRRR!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour dozen head's shot up. The gnarled nail was still dangerously close to Jade's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRASH* *FWOOM* *WHATEVER A TREE  FALLING OVER SOUNDS LIKE*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade's eyes ficked to were the...wharvers were looking. Just barely she was able to make out the sight of tree's not to far off toppling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing hovering over her flicked it's gaze back to her, then the tree's, then back to her. It snarled and growled hatefully before darting off to the side. She found herself unceremoniously dropped back into the mud just as these things vanished back into the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRASH* \"RRAAGGHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped herself over and tried running too, but in a panic she tried so hard she ended up slipping and falling in face first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer actions grew more frantic the louder the noise got. This wasn't Jade Chan, the smart, plucky girl who stared down Shen Du without flinching. This was Jade Chan, the girl who was freaking out about almost getting eaten alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried again and again to frantically get up. Not thinking about anything but escaping. In fact she was so focused on that, that she hard;y noticed when the sound of tree's falling stopped, and only halted herself when a very large inhuman shadow loomed over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat ran her brow. She gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ok Jade just, just calm down. Now get up slowly. Maybe if you don't make any sudden movement you can get away and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow shifted, and its castor lunged down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was lifted up unceremoniously by her leg by something and lifted into the air. she hung upside down as she screamed and screamed until she ran out of breath, drew in another and started screaming again until she started coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finished?\" A voice asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Slowly she opened her right eyes, then her left. Another flash of lightning struck nearby and gave her a clear view of the beast that was holding her.</span></div></div>",

Flawless skin, perfect hair, perfect curves and a face out of your deepest fantasies. Far, far more attractive than any mortal woman, even the most famous beauties like Helen of Troy or Audrey Hepburn could ever hope to make themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one  was nowhere near that beautiful. She only looked like a supermodel. Minus a few small scars across her brow and under her chin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPartially covering her steer like horns and floppy cow ears was long dirty blonde hair that looked like she'd been spending to much time near an open flame, reaching down past her - holy hell how does she stand upright with 'those' sticking out of her chest!? -  breasts to brush against her hips where she spotted a holstien tail swinging back and forth behind a human rear end that tapered down into  clove footed cow legs. Really her legs were the only part of her with fur aside from the fur garb she was wearing since her muck coated skin was either a light black or the worlds best tan. She stared at Jade with orange/ red eyes and a smirk on her lips that showed a few fangs poking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(For reference <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://12-beast.wikia.com/wiki/Minotaurus\" target=\"_blank\">http://12-beast.wikia.com/wiki/Minotauru...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah.\" She said meekly, looking over the giantess's shoulder and spying the tree she was hefting as a club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Was the minotaurs curt replay before she let go and uncerimoniously dropped the girl from more than twice her height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aagh!\" Screamed the littlest oni as she crashed to the forest floor. Glaring up at the massive woman who had already turned around and began striding at a speed only someone who was mostly leg could acheive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey HEY where'd you think your going!?\" Jade yelled after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home. Try not to let the vermin get you. I'm not likely to be around to save your tiny blue behind again.\" The giant called back without turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this is the point where Jade would normally have yelled back something snarky or boasting. Right now however she was still reeling from the fact a horde of blue Gollum's had tried to eat her, so she was not feeling as brave as she normally let on. After a quick look from right to left before she jumped at the sound of troubled breathing coming from just past the visible tree line and bolted til she was in her 'saviour's' shadow, having to jog to keep up with the 9 foot tall womans lazy pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the minotaur cared at all she was being followed she made no show of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept walking for what felt like forever Jade felt she had to break the silence, or keep listening to the horrible giggling following them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey uh thanks for saving me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman didn't even incline her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were those things anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one peep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade huffed and went back to silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vermin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head cracked back up to the woman. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're vermin. Bottom feeders who are too weak to pose a threat to anything. Even a runt like you should have been able to take them on no trouble. 'Should' at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY I had em!\u201d The young oni\u2019s pride as a warrior would not let her take that insult lying down club or no club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was unable to keep a smirk from her face before she let out a very bull like snort. \u201cYeah I saw. The way you were going to let that one tear off your face was you luring them into your trap no doubt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl glowered but said nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur's smile dropped. \"Now from those fancy clothes you got I take it you don't exactly live around here. So unless you can magic yourself up a fortress from the ground you'll be needing a place to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch I still say I had em.\" She grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nher saviour shrugged and continued on.  The tiny girl continued alongside the horned giant until they reached the mouth of a very deep cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman glanced over her shoulder at Jade with bored eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think you can handle things on your own then I wont stop ya. Those things have been following us all the way back. S\u2019wat happens when bottomfeeders get a taste of real quality food.\u201d She grinned. Revealing a mouth full of more canines than a someone who was half herbivore should have \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t get much more quality than Oni.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite trying to hide it. Jade shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you change your mind about my offer there\u2019s food inside.\u201d And with that the taller woman walked into the\u2026\u2026dank, cave Where Instead of slowly fading Into the Darkness It's swallowed her up immediately as though it were not the absence of light but thick black tar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade hung back only for a moment before another round of all encompassing giggling jolted her forward and sent her running after the horned giantess into the darkness<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We must all be ready to fight. One way or other. Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men didn't want know what to say. Of course they wanted to argue. To tell the older man off for saying such callous things.......yet......they had just had to fight off a horde of supernatural ninjas controlled by the girl.

Then another jump pushed out and went back in. Then another, and another and another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three watched with morbid curiosity as the orb became covered with dozens of undulating lumps. Pushing out around around, which gave them all the idea that maybe  dozens of hands were pushing from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SSK--KKLTTTCCCHHHHH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey cringed as the sphere made a sound like wet tearing filled the room. They watched as the tip-top of the orb began to separate as neatly a someone trying to rip a steak apart with their bear hands. The slow ripping left long, thin lines of sinew holding the half together before they tore with a sloppy 'snap'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie went slightly green, Tohru's cheeks bulged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the grizzley opening was halfway down, they were able to peer into the darkness inside....and all but the wizard took a step back unconsciously as a blue, misshapen hand reached out and grabbed the dripping darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaaaackieeeeeee.\" An all to familiar voice spoke with the sound of a hundred other voices reverberating through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade.\" Her uncle whispered and took a step forward, only to be blocked by 'his' uncle. He turned to glare at the man, only to see that the chi wizards eyes were still locked on the....we'll it was clear a cocoon by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother inhuman hand reached out of the darkness and grasped the other side of the tear, and then began to push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disturbing noise only increased as the process was sped up. The front of the cocoon split open wider and wider. A demonic groan growing louder and louder from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UuuuuuuugghhhhhHHHHHHHHHAAAAAGGHHHH!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one might heave, the tearing reached the bottom and the mangled sphere....exploded outwards with a wave of darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adults were all knocked off their feet. Even Uncle who had been ready for anything had not prepared for such a powerful backlash. All round them stone floor cracked. Metal walkways warped, glass shattered and doors tore from their hinges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie groaned. The blast had knocked him back but fortunately not out. He rubbed his head and pulled himself into a seated position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, bad day.\" He groaned. He looked back to see who he had to thank for bracing him. The air was thick with black smoke like shadow. He waved his hand to clear it away somewhat, only to find Tohru was quite out cold. Dread an up him spine as he looked over to Uncle and saw the senior moaning quietly. Not out but clearly disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very bad day.\" He said seriously. What would he do now if.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie paused, gulped audibly, then slowly turned to face whatever it wa that had Jade's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened.

One of those moments where you know your screwed, but not as badly as you thought you\u2019d be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was still blue. That was bad. Her screwed up eyes were still solid red. That was worse. However from what he could hear from her coughing, the demonic distortion in her voice was gone. That was good. Also they weren\u2019t immediately swarming with Khan so that was a good sign that the potion had at least \u2018somewhat\u2019 worked. That was great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew\u201d The older man beside him slouched a little in relief \u201cUncle was afraid something worse would happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe \u2018is\u2019 still blue sensei.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTch, blue is nothing. Uncle turned every colour in rainbow when in training under master Fong, but is uncle strange colour today? No!

He continued edging forward \u201cI\u2019m not mad at you. In fact I\u2019m proud of what you did with the book. It looks like some lucky girl has earned a trip to Moose World.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhhhh shudup.

It would not have been so bad\u2026...if another smaller pair of eyes hadn't opened up where her eyebrows should be\u2026...and a smaller pair above those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body turned around to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*clack, click click click click, clack*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men in the rooms eyes widened as a large form hidden beneath the dust and smoke cleared the obscuring shroud away. Though their expressions of shocked could not hope to match Jades. Those horrified look was magnified three fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the waist down, Jade was an insect. Like a centaur from someone's darkest nightmares the blue skinned girls lower body stretched out longer behind her than she was tall. A deep black segmented exoskeleton that shined with every fractal of light it managed to pull in. Two powerful looking and heavily spiked pincers   clacked feverishly at her sides where her hip bone used to be.  Six long, powerful quadruple jointed legs jutted from the sides and ended in thick spears sharpened to the point where you could see holes in the concrete where they had last stepped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJade\u2026...don\u2019t panic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAIIYAAHHH NIECE IS GIANT BUG!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl jumped, and a long tail tipped with a curved barb jabbed itself in the ground in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watched the concrete around the stinger melt into green sludge before she slowly retracted the barb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow comes the part where we would iris out after Jade makes a witty or funny retort. Making light of her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat does not happen here. No snark. No jokes. Instead the girl stared up at her stinger with wide, horrified eyes as it dripped neon green venom.

Beside him were the unoffical resident archaeologist and  his aging uncle. They all stood in a medical observation room. In the room below doctors, very open minded doctors examined a patient who looked like a mix between bored and mortified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ugly dress had been removed. Though for what they found beneath she thinks she\u2019d rather have kept it on. The exoskeleton had not simply stopped at her waist. The ebony plating stretched up a good bit and rather than just a straight cut off, the plating grew smaller and more numerous. The plates looking more like snake scales before giving way to blue skin at her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two mind sharing with the class?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientists shared a nervous look before the one on the right spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell. We\u2019ve ran every possible test. Cross examined the results innumerable times\u2026\u2026.it all seems pretty conclusive\u2026...and at the same time can\u2019t possibly be right. She both is and is not a giant scorpion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Black quirked half his remaining hair and looked down into the room below were Jade\u2019s sides were being prodded with a pen. Apparently she was still ticklish since her tail lashed out and struck the doctor!\u2026\u2026..Or it would have if it wasn\u2019t shackled from tip to torso by chains. They\u2019re inquisitive not suicidal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeem\u2019s to be pretty clear she is. Or is this you \u2018genius\u2019s\u2019 way of saying she\u2019s turned into some sort of hybrid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSadly sir, we only \u2018wish\u2019 is was something as straightforward as hybridisation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe readings keep changing from one extreme to the other captain. One minute it reads as full human. The next it\u2019s saying she\u2019s 100% scorpion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just any one kind of scorpion either. We've got matches for black, emperor, sand, whip. We\u2019ve identified pretty much \u2018every\u2019 species and subspecies of scorpion D.N.A within a single host being.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd at the same time her \u2018human\u2019 genes, or whatever it is I\u2019m looking at right now,  is staying entirely separate from the insect genes. It\u2019s like we took samples from two entirely different subjects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked back in on Jade. A doctor was waving his finger in front of her eyes while all six red orbs followed the digit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what does that say about turning her back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist \u2018mmmm ed \u201cOn paper it should be as easy as peeling off the exoskeleton and pulling her out. But really it really isn\u2019t.\u201d He pulled out several pictures from his folder and pinned them up on a wall. \u201cThese X-rays not only show that the scorpion really has replaced everything below her waist, but several organs in her \u2018upper half\u2019 have migrated from her torso. She\u2019s grown about a dozen new  ones, only a few of which we recognise from scorpion anatomy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other one continued \u201cShe has a human skeleton. But only from the waist up before endo turns to exo. Everything we get from one test is invalidated by the next one. There\u2019s no scientific reason how this is possible and if you say magic \u2018one more time\u2019 old man were gonna\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLab boys are like small children. Have to explain obvious many times before they sink into thick heads!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk that is it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cENOUGH!\u201d Knowing how to keep your cool in a tense situation was a prerequisite of being a secret agent, let alone the leader of a secret agency. He had seen things over the past year that would drive other men to the point of madness and (regardless of what his superiors thought) came out sane. However there was only so far his patience would last, and the sight of two supposedly brilliant men arguing semantics while a little girl in the next room is trying to deal with being a freakish abomination wore him very thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Uncle <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about magically. There anything you can do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man glared at the scientist as he snorted but sighed when he turned back to black,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUncle has no idea where to begin. Potion to help Jade reacted in ways as far outside what Uncle was expecting to happen as can get. Will keep looking, but will not risk further changes until certain will not affect niece worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard looked through the glass towards his grand niece, feeling his every years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil cure is found.

Yawning, her family backed off a step when her mouth opened wider than anything with a jawbone should be able to and revealed not one, but two rows of thick, razor sharp fangs that looked like they could easily tear apart rock like it was rock 'candy'.

He was almost positive he heard Tohru do the same, while Uncle sounded like someone stepped on his little toe with cleats. His eyes watered as they refused to blink before his brain could permanently etch this sight into his memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, without a doubt, the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in his life. No, beautiful couldn't even begin to describe her. A thousand poets contemplating her beauty for a thousand years could not never conceive a worthy enough description of her beauty. Any word relating to beauty in any language felt woefully inaccurate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer flawlessness of her alabaster skin. The way her lustrous veil of black hair that fell to her knees framed a face the greatest sculptors in history would weep over being unable to replicate. How it cascaded of her delicate shoulders like a gentle stream, sweeping over a perfectly formed figure covered in a beautiful and elaborate Japanese kimono that, while it hid everything from view, appeared to have been designed for a woman who wasn\u2019t as\u2026..naturally gifted as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were so enthralled by the human beauty of the smirking woman they almost didn\u2019t notice her very inhuman features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe marble like skin they had been admiring was indeed the colour of alabaster, however it was like pale \u2018blue\u2019 alabaster like someone had tried to bleach a ninja khan. The sheer volume of her flowing mane disguised two tufts atop her head that he realised were in fact a set of vulpine ears. Her eye\u2019s which he first felt piercing his very soul were red as blood and held both warmth and a wicked amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to drink in her presence, something moved behind her. Jackie\u2019s eyes bulged as a form twice her height lifted up and, with a \u2018whoosh\u2019 sound that sounded like extra emphasis was out on the \u2018whoosh\u2019, the tips of her 9 dark furred tails lit up with ghostly blue fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohru, who moments ago had been dumbstruck by the vision in front of him was backing away from it slowly. A look of terror slowly spreading across his features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKitsune.\u201d He whispered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTohru, Uncle will admit he does not know Japanese lore, but will guess that \u2018Kitsune\u2019 is like Huli Jing. A Fox spirit yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pupil nodded. \u201cTricksters who take the form of beautiful women, and whose power is reflected in the number of tails they have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd nine is many?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe most they can have.\u201d The small sumo said grimly. His eyes still utterly focused on the inhumanly beautiful woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Replied his master dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archeologist gulped audibly, never breaking his view of the woman who continued to stare at him with those inhuman, yet impossibly gorgeous eyes that stared back at him with an expression he had seen far too much of. The kind that choked the air with a sense of bemused superiority. Like she found it funny that mere humans were standing before her. The only difference was this one seemed less bemused and more mischievous than superior\u2026\u2026...there was something disturbingly familiar about that smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colour ran out of Jackie Chan\u2019s face like someone had poked a hole in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJade?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that single word question. The vision of loveliness perfect lips pulled up to one side. Transforming her smile from haughty to cocky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh. Hey uncle Jackie.\u201d She half giggled with a voice that was all at once delicate, alluring and commanding all at once. A voice that could have drawn any other men to her like a siren song<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo \u2018these\u2019 men, who had now found out who the woman they had been staring at with unabashed desire was however\u2026\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohru fainted. Hitting the floor with a loud \u2018thud\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle turned green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie\u2019s cheeks bulged and he started coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's smirk turned into a full blown grin, revealing her enlarged incisors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s flattering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From the most mundane and most hoped for, to dread images of unimaginable horrors like out of your darkest nightmares<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA floating blue mermaid? Yeah no surprise he didn't expect that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the waist down his niece had a black scaled fish tail. A wicked looking frill of black and dark, dark blue sprung up from below her tailbone and a jagged silvery black finn waved gently back and forth as she floated in mid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes mid-air. Jackie found himself staring up at Jade as she lay in mid air half conscious. However it didn\u2019t look like it did when she used the Rooster talisman. Her tail swished gently back and forward as though she was submerged in deep water, with the sound of water rushing over her fin echoing from nowhere with every pass. Her now waist length hair floated about like a jet black halo in a gentle unseen current. her dress once long enough to brush the floor had been reduced to a  top that stretched only to her hips, with the many of the long dark strips of the  cloth that made it up hanging freely,  tangling and coiling around her like a school of eels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men flinched when the girls gazes focused on them. Looking down on them, blinking slowly and lazily as her brain came up to speed. Jackie turned a little green as he noticed the slats in either side of her neck opening and closing in the rhythm of her breath.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie unconsciously took a deep breath and a surprisingly heavy step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so strange. This was Jade. His niece. His very excitable, very talkative niece. Any second now he was expecting her to start babbling about how cool it was to be a mermaid, or complain about how her favourite sneakers won\u2019t fit anymore. Hell he\u2019d even settle for that demonic overlord speech she had been spewing not that long ago. The way she was just silently staring at him. Regarding him with as much interest as when she watch that dust mote in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped 2 feet away from her. Looking up at her nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a calming breath\u2026...and suddenly he was struggling to breath as he felt the rush of  non existent water sweep past his lips and into his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archaeologist's gasped and held his mouth shut as he suddenly found himself struggling to breath on dry land. His clothes began to sway in a non existent current just as he was being lifted into the air. The laws of gravity becoming a mere suggestion to the men who were being lifted up by invisible tides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade continued to simply float there for a few seconds more, before with the sound of moving water she \u2018swam\u2019 past her uncle, his uncle and her friend and rushing towards the doors with the speed of a pike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie tried reaching out to her. To grab her as she passed him, but it was like trying to grab a fish underwater. His fingers didn\u2019t come anywhere near her as she passed him like a bullet before heading out the door. Only when she was out of sight did the men suddenly drop to the floor, gasping for breath and hacking violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the men\u2019s brains finally registered their wasn\u2019t actually any water in their lungs to force out, the young mermaid was long gone from section 13.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Tattoe of the shadow Khan symbol feeling as though it was stretching her skin to near transparency as it grew up over her leg before fading from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Chan clan and the demon ninjas were distracted Shen Du in the body ofthe much fallen crime boss Valmont snatched up the dark tome that Jade had used to gain supernatural power. Almost instantly the Shadow Khan attacked, springing forth from every place where light does not fall to strike at him for daring to defy thier queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I command you to stop!\" Shen Du Sneered while holding the book right in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe army of darkness froze in place, eve those lunging in mod air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon in human skin smirked and glared over at the Chans who where helping the girl up. \"Now destroy the Chans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninjas about faced and attacked so quickly you'd think hey sprouted faces on the back on thier heads rather than turn around, but not fast enough for Jade not to make what should be a final order of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO DESTROY THE BOOK!\" She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore mystical ninjas spring up into the air, one pulling out a small metal sphere and throwing it at Valmont. Now I say Valmont because Shen Du would not be stupid enough to hold the object targeted for destruction up in front of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explsion wasn't very big but effective, every page, evert piece of leather from cover to cover even the gold decorations were reduced to black ash holding their retangular form for but a moment longer before piling on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ash didn't even finish falling before Jade barked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD HIM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled ropes out from their clothing which was clealry not htier before and lassoed Valmont. With an amaxzing display on acrobatics they got more rope and suspended hiim near the very top of the open area of the section 13 complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled at the sight of both of his greatest enemies tied up in such a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did something bad didn't I.\" Jade said sadly from behind him, her voice but of regret and worry about the punishment she was sure to recievie in the near fututre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you mean getting a Tattoe against my permission, yes you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around. \"If you mean detroying the demon archive then thWWWAAAGGHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you WOOOOOHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohru just stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade looked confused at her uncles and the sumos horrified expressions. She checked over herself. A shadowKhan appearing beside her with a mirror just to be sure. Woah she looked awesome! Her eyes made her lok like some sort of mutant bug monster, and they just popped with the contrast of the blue skin. She ran a hand through her hair which seemed to styyle itself into spikes despite the lack of gel, she tried flattening it but the cursed locks just moved back into place. She didn't like her nails either which were girlishly long even if they were sharp as knives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The dress has to go to.' She picked at her collar with a pointed index, which caused a ShadowKhan to rush to her side with a needle and thread, in no time restoring the damage to its previous immaculate state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave it a rye look and turned back to her still horror striken elders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know you guys will catch flys if you keep your mouths open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was the first to recover. \"Wha, how di, ubu wha!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JADE IS STILL BLUE!!\" Uncle screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her hands. \"Uh yeah. So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade. That spell was supposed to free you from the evil.\" Explained Tohru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Right thats me. The totally not evil Jade Chan. Queen of the shadowKhan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade you should not still have that power at all!\" Continued the japanese titan. \"The removal of the tatooe should have severed the link to the dark power that control the ShadowKhan. Without that mark you should have turned back to normal in seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few seconds for her to process this. Looking about the room at the army of ninjas that she could 'feel' would obey her without question. She waved her arm and with silent subserviance they merged back with the shadows from which they came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back down at her hands, not getting any less blue, her nails no less sharp. Her massive pure red eyes no more human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean.......'that' was what was supposed to make me normal again.\" She said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie recognised the tone and crouched to Jades level, reaching ut for her shoulder only for her to flinch away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually stuck like this?!\" The worry in her tone increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men had a fairly good idea as to why. Jade always enjoyed her transformations while they lasted. Making a fuss whenever she changed back but always knowing that she 'had' to change back if she wanted to live her life instead of holding away like a hunchback in Paris. She always knew that her crazy relatives would bail her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept this was different. They had just tried to change her back and failed. It wasn't a matter of finding the right ingrediant or making the wrong potion. The cure had done exactly what it was supposed to do and get rid of the tattoe, but for some reason that didn't mean she would turn human again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must do research.\" The old Chi wizard said without his usual emphasis on the r word. Doing quite the opposite to ease the girl from her worries.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wind demon-infused Jade jumped away from Drago but the son of Shendu was too quick for the unprepared Jade.  His scaly hands grabbed her arm and drew her in.  She could feel his magical powers growing and screamed for help<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all went white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade opened her eyes.  She looked at the ceiling above her and lifted her hands to her face.  They were hers . . . And they were human!  Gasping with joy, she jumped to her feet and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle's shop!\" she cried out.  But something was odd.  Where was Uncle or Uncle Jackie or Toru?  If she just got that demon chi out of her, they would be next to her for her own protection.  Were they off running after Drago because he escaped with it?  Then why no note?  Or even Section 13 agents?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" came a deep voice.  Jade turned and saw an old man with  a trimmed beard smiling at her.  He leaned on a walking stick and fanned himself with a fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Jade asked as  she looked at the man in white and gold cloth.  He chuckled at her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i-I'm Jade Chan!  Awesome martial artist and able to kick your butt!\" Jade yelled.  The man smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, such energy.  It is good to finally speak with you Jade Chan.  We have much to discuss,\" he said.  He stopped fanning himself and held the fan up.  \"Do you recognize this?\"  Jade looked at it and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the fan used to banish Xiao Fung!\" Jade yelled.  The man shook his head and his fingers tapped the walking stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know this?\"  Jade looked at the walking stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the walking stick of the Chosen One!  Why do you have it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought it with me.  Much as you brought this place with you,\" he said.  Jade shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Jade asked with fear in her tone.  The man smiled.  Jade knew that smile.  She gave it all the time.  The sparkle in his brown eyes . . . was like her's.  Oh no.  Oh no.  It couldn't be . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand,\" the man said.  \"I am the Chosen One.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you hear?\" Jade asked in a soft voice, worried what was about to be said wouldn't be so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you are the Chosen One.  You are me.  You are who came before me.  You will be those who come after you,\" the man said.  \"I am the image of your soul speaking to your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So . .  So this is all in my head?\" Jade asked.  The Chosen One nodded.  \"Then, why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To talk to you about your destiny.  Though fighting is disliked by my old friends, sometimes it is a necessary action.  Especially when it can remove a dark stain from the world,\" the Chosen One said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Jade asked.  A bowl appeared by the man and a pitcher of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"come,\" he said softly.  Jade moved towards him and stood on the stool to watch.  He set the fan into the bowl of water and the water turned dark.  The pitcher had her face on it and he poured.  The bowl began to overflow and the dark water was dilluted before becoming clear once more.  He pulled out the fan and it seemed cleaner, brighter than before.  \"Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . . . I think so.  You're saying my super pure soul is actually purifying the demon chi?\" Jade asked.  The Chosen One nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The powers will become bound to you and grant you incredible abilities.  Just do not give in to the darkness they hold or . . .\"  The basin's water turned black.  Jade shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right . . . Hey, how come you're just telling me this and not just giving me all those memories of my past life?\"  The chosen one touched her face with kindness and warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, Jade, are still growing, developing.  If you were to remember everything now, yes the task of purifying the demon chi would be easy but at the cost of who you are here and now.  I do not wish that, so I would be quiet about this fact and tell only a few,\" he said.  Jade nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.  Thank me,\" Jade said with a smile.  The Chosen One nodded and the world turned white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade could feel Drago's scales once more and something hit him from behind.  Jade flew forward and landed.  She turned and looked at the confused demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can this be?\" he asked.  \"Why couldn't I remove the Wind Demon Chi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, maybe it doesn't like you,\" Jade said before letting loose another belch and slamming Drago into the wall.  He growled but saw Uncle and Toru coming to the school.  With a scream of frustration, he stripped Fin, Chow, and Ratso of his blessing and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade!\" Jackie said as he came to her side.  \"You're still green.  How?  I thought-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk later!  Magic now,\" Uncle said before he began his chant.  Jade could feel his power come onto her but no change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ayyaaah!  What is wrong with spell?\" Uncle yelled.  \"Toru!  Did you use pickled ginger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sensei,\" Toru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I know what happened.  Can we talk about this back at the shop?\" Jade pipped up.  The adults looked at her but agreed to leave.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jade shuddered again.  The power of the wind demon was still settling within her.  Her body was still changing from its dark power.  The short girl now stood equal to Jackie with a bulging belly.  Her clothes were tight across her larger body as she hopped into Uncle's Shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohru closed the door and locked it as the other two adults looked at the changed Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Jade, what is going on?\" Jackie asked with some desperation.  Uncle peered at Jade with focused eyes.  Tohru looked at her with concerned eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm . . . I'm the Chosen One of the Ben-Shui order,\" Jade confessed.  Her uncles eyes widened with shock.  Tohru, however, seemed less shocked.  Jade took a moment before telling them of her vision, of the man and the walking stick, and how she purify the demon chi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade . . . This is crazy.  We need to get the chi out of you before it's too late!\" Jackie exclaimed when she was done, and had grown another foot.   Before she could respond, Jade covered her mouth as her cheeks bulged.  She swallowed the gale before it could blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie, if it could be removed, wouldn't Uncle's spell have worked?\" Jade asked.  Jackie looked at Uncle, who was doing research with Tohru.  Degrading his work was not a wise choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade, I saw Xiao Fung.  He was huge.  What are we going to do if you become that big?\"  Jade looked down.  She didn't want to think about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhaaa!\" Uncle said.  \"Uncle has found it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how to cure Jade?\" Jackie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Uncle find ancient prophecy.  When the Dark Chi stars rise, light rises to fight it, turning the darkness into light.\" Uncle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me!\" Jade exclaimed happily as a strong breeze came from her mouth.  Papers were ruslted and moved inches before Tohru put weights on them.  \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jade has to contain these demon chis in her?!\" Jackie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Uncle said.  \"Now, Uncle has theory.  Demons have the power to look human.  If Jade has Xiao Fung's wind power, perhaps she has his shape shifting power as well.\"  Eyes fell on Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  Let me try,\" Jade said as she closed her eyes.  \"Change shape.  Change shape.  Change shape.\"  She said them like a spell.  Her body shuddered once more.  But this time it was different.  The previous changes were like dams breaking from the pressure of water being too great.  Now it felt like she was rebuilding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the outside, smoke enveloped her and dissipated quickly.  Standing there was not the toad-Jade, but normal Jade, short and pink skinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" she yelled as a gust of wind came from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie, Jade needs training,\" Uncle said.  \"Better control her power . . . And the powers she will gain.\"  Jackie just nodded as he wondered what Jade could be like if she learned to master the power of every demon chi.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jade was always one who could eat a large amount.  Jackie knew this.  Come the next morning when she ate twice that, he was worried but Uncle dismissed it.  Jade was unskilled in magic and keeping her small form was draining.  She needed the food to keep using her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, Jackie and Jade packed for the camping trip.  From food to tarps to act as clothes if Jade's clothes didn't grow with her.  All the while, Uncle was doing research on how to find the demon chi -infused items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so drive, and the pair came to a secluded part of the woods.  Jackie looked at Jade.  She nodded and set her pack down and released her form.  Smoke enveloped her and she was just like  Xiao Fung.  Her body was shaped like a squatting toad.  Her front green hands were big enough for Tohru to sit in.  The top of her head was over twice Jackie's height.  Her mouth was much larger now.  Her clothes stretched to their limits as they clung to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.  That felt good,\" Jade said as she rolled her neck.  Jackie looked at her and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Jade, let's start with meditation first,\" Jackie said.  Jade said nothing but then nodded her large head.  She sat back on her hind legs and put her hands together.   \"Focus on your breathing.  Your breath is likely to be your main weapon.  Feel its power.\"  Jade nodded before laughing.  \"Jade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Jackie, but I just realized I could use some other form of breaking wind to attack with,\" Jade said.  Jackie just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly have an open mind Jade,\" Jackie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to embrace my destiny,\" Jade said happily.  She, Jade Chan, would help save the world (again).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour of Jade meditating happened while Jackie set up a tent for him and a tarp for both an eating area and, if Jade couldn't maintain her small form, where Jade could sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just wasted time for Jade.  With each breath, she could feel the power of the wind within and around her.  Short breaths.  Long breaths.  Breaths so long her belly swelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the meditation was over, Jade smiled once more.  \"Okay Jackie, let's have some fun,\" Jade said.  Jackie walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind Jade?\" Jackie asked.  Her large hand reached out and touched him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tag!\" she cried out, knocking Jackie on his but with a sudden gale and she hopped off into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was happy Jade was not there as he chuckled at her joke.  It showed she was still her inside.  Getting up, he turned and ran after the hopping Jade.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade found her body acting quickly.  Her limbs seemed to know how to move without too much thought.  Move left and her body shifted enough to do it.  Turn right.  It did the same.    She stopped and looked around for Jackie.  He wasn't anywhere around her.  But then she felt something hit her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your it Jade!\" Jackie yelled as he bolted away from the demonic girl.  Jade focused and gave chase.  Her powerful limbs making a straight chase easy for her.  But Jackie seemed to sense this and he began zigzagging through the trees.  He crossed through some too small for Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached the trees, she focused her mind and shrank to her human form in a flash and easily passed through.  Once on the other side, she went back to Toad Jade and gave chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bad day,\" Jackie muttered as he saw Jade running.  Currently, he was in a tree, looking down.  Jade stopped near him and looked around.  Her eyes closed her eyes.  Suddenly she turned in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade focused the power in her mouth.  She didn't want to make a stream.  Just a single burst of wind shaped like a ball.  She let it focus, and in a manner similar to spitting a loogie, she blasted the ball at Jackie.  Her uncle dodged it by dropping.  In midair, he was met by a leaping Jade.  She held him close as she landed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you back,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade,\" Jackie said with strained breath, \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.   I'll call it spit wind,\" Jade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it could be very dangerous.  Don't use it unless you have to,\" Jackie said.  Jade nodded and kept Jackie in one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Jade said before she began moving back to camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Jade, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting used to carrying people like this,\" Jade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and they returned to camp where Tohru was sitting at camp.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey T,\" Jade said as she looked down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade.  Jackie,\" Tohru said.  \"Uncle wanted me to bring a few items to help Jade maintain balance.\"  He brought out a few glyphs and looked around the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.  Are you staying the night?\" Jade asked.  Tohru nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Tohru said.  Jade gave a big smile as her stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh.  I need something to eat,\" Jade said.  Jackie slipped out of Jade's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tohru, do you know how demons sustained themselves?\" Jackie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My research told me they could eat but also draw sustenance from the area around them.  I presume it would be from their element,\" Tohru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there's a way I can feed from wind?\" Jade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so.  But the records were very old.  I might have misread it,\" Tohru explained.  Jade looked away , wondering if her past life could tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.  Well, let's get cooking,\" Jackie said.  Jade became small and helped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch was a light meal, but it satisfied Jade.  The afternoon was much like the morning.  Jade meditated and focused her mind.  She tried to focus on the breeze passing by her.  Tried to see if she could draw power from it, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter meditating, physical training began again.  Chasing Jackie and Tohru.  After a few rounds, Jade worked on carrying the hefty Tohru on her shoulders.  Up and down the two mile long mountain trail she went.  The first two trips were easy.  But by the seventh time, Jade was sweating cold and hopped slowly back to camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade,\" Tohru said to the giant green hopping girl.  She stopped and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you shift to your small form?  I'll carry you,\"  Jade smiled and focused her mind.  It took a lot of effort but she was able to transform and welcomed Tohru's warm embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was finishing up on the phone and looked at Jade.  She fell near the roaring fire.  \"Ohh yeah.  That feels good,\" Jade said contently.    Her eyes closed and she snored softly.  Tohru put a blanket over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty eight miles in a little over four hours,\" Tohru said to Jackie.  He looked at the resting.  She certainly was much stronger than a child should be.  At that rate, she could be doing a marathon easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tohru, did your research say if Jade is still growing?  I mean physically.  She is still a child.  If she were to grow to be over five feet tall, how would that change her demon form?\"  Tohru gave a soft sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know Jackie,\" Tohru said.  \"Who were you on the phone with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Black.  He told me the school would be repaired tomorrow.  They have the story that Jade was attacked by some arsonist who hates public schooling,\" Jackie said.  Tohru nodded.  That makes sense.  Working to keep government secrets secret made them good at covering things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And her absence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trauma,\" Jackie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive days passed since that first night in the woods.  Jade developed her demonic skills and control.  Now with little effort, she could shift between her toad and human forms.  She even could fire her wind spit even in human form.  Her inhuman strength showed through in her small form too, as Jackie found in their sparing lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd most importantly, she did develop the power to feed from the wind.  It sustained her enough that her old meals she ate when she was a normal human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as they sat around for lunch.  Jade skipped away from the camp to use the little girl's room.  Jackie's cell rang.  Picking it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie!!\" came Uncle's voice.  \"The next chi has activated!  Get home quickly!  We need to move before Drago gets there first!\"  Jackie nodded and hung up.  Jade came running back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get to the car and get home fast,\" Jackie said.  \"Another-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chi activated!  I know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know?  How?\" Jackie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sensed it,\" Jade said as she rushed to the tent and started taking it down.  Thankfully her years of living with Jackie taught her how to take down a tent in quick time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot ten minutes later, with the fire put out, they were on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade, Uncle didn't tell me which power activated.  Do you know?\" Jackie asked.  Jade nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw  . . . .\"</span></div></div>",

Pushing the real mind to the back while filling it with a hundred percent grade A numbskull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they opened their eyes, to the rest of the world it was as if nothing had changed and giggled in their own voice.

He was almost always used by his two genius sisters Susan and Marie as a human lab rat. Testing experimental invention's on him that they would never think to use on themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough he never had a problem with that. Since he always tended to need something from them which they always gave him provided he test stuff for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was no exception. He had just found out that a secret underground race of mole people planning an invasion of the surface world and for some reason it was up to him and his super talking dog Dukey and not the military to save the day. He knew his sister's had a giant drilling machine that could get them to the underground kingdom and his sisters were happy to lend him it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProvided he do them a small favour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not salt.\" Said marie the one with the red curl's<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theyre specially engineered 'mega hottie' flakes deisigned to bring out the maximum amount of hotness genetically possible for the body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Said their as always clueless brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.\" Went Marie annoyed. \"Just eat it and you'll turn into a hunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then if it work's we can use them to become mega hottie's ourselves so we can finally get *Sigh* Gil Nexdor.\" Said Mary dreamily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sigh Gil.\" Thy said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I eat the salt and youll give me the drilling machine so I can save the world from the mole people..\" He was cut off as Susan butted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeahsurewhatever.\" She said and gave him a look showing she wanted him to start the testing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the salt shaker then shrugged. He picked it up and tipped it over his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It even taste's like salt' He thought. Almost instantly he felt weird. Like a tingling all over. That tingling built up into a feeling like electricity and when it reached it's peak their was a blinding flash of light which caused his sister's and dog to look away briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they looked back. Their jaws were slack with awe. Dukey was the first to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny. I always' thought the word 'hunk' met a hot 'guy'.\" Said the dog sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. What are...\" Johnny stopped as he heard himself. That wasn't his voice. It was more like the voice of a teenage g.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't remember those being there.' He now she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding were Jonny Test once was, was now as the genius twin's put it a 'mega hottie'. The embodiment of the absolute maximum amount of 'hotness' the young test had in his d.n.a. Of course I think they were expecting a chiseled hunk instead of the curvacous teenage babe looking herself over curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Opp's.\" Went Mary. \"I guess we were so busy making sure it would turn us into mega hottie's that we forgot to factor in male consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" Johnny said in his new soprano voice. \"I ate the salt now you have to give us the drill.\" She paused before speaking again. \"And while your at it turn me back to normal. I'm still to young to even like girl's nevermind 'be ' a girl.\" She said while looking down at her now shorter and seemingly younger looking sister's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Relax. This formula was supposed to last a minute so. Now we see it work's we can make a stronger batch.\" Said Mary smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny sighed and she smiled. \"Oh that's a relief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS IS SO NOT A RELIEF!!!\" Said the still babeified Johnny Test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked nervous. \"I guess the effect's on a male subject are mmore profound than we thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm stuck like this FOREVER!!!\" Screamed Johny as she waved her hand's around wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Johnny.\" Said susan in a calming tone. \"It's unlikly the effect's are permanent. And even if they are I'm pretty sure we can whip up an antidote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wadaya mean 'pretty sure'?\" Said the super dog with an eyebrow raised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have a mole army to stop?\" Said Susan eager to get off the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny moaned a little but conceeded. She and Dukey cimbed up into the earth digger  before it burrowed right through the house and into the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how to make an antidote do you.\" Mary said while still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a clue.\" Said Susan while ciopying her sisters action's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hoped the moles kept their rother/sister down their for long enough</span></div></div>",

Nothing special.\" Said Johnny sarcastically. \"Boreing into th center of the earth, saving Porkbelly from a moleman invasion. Ther usual.\" She placed her finger on her lip in a mocking gesture. \"Oh wait. I also got turned into a teenage girl and *heh *heh* here's thje good part. According to my genius sister the transformation IS PERMANENT!!!\" The flame headed hottie slammed her fists on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr and Mrs Tests heads whipped to face the red haired teins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl's is this true. Did you turn your brother into a teenage girl with no way to tun him back?!\" Dad said as he burned a hole into them with his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's shrank back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, kinda.\" Mary said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't think that the 'Hottie flakes' would bond so completly with Johnnys D.N.A\" Susan chipped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary picked up. \"They arn't all bad new's. I were not complaining about 'our' result's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Susan and Mary no longer looked like 'non hotties' as Johnny called them. Instead of the short curveless geek girl's, they now looked like the very definition of the word 'babe'. (right along with their brother who was hardly as positive about it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Johnny they were still dressed like normal. However they had to get larger sizes to fit over their new curves, and bra's that for once didn't have the word 'training' in front of them. Their eyesight had cleared up and their complexion's were now flawless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact if Johnny tamed her locks and dyed them red you'd swear they were triplet's and not twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither am I.\" Came a dumbstruck voice from next to Susan. The chubby genius known as 'Bling Bling Boy' (or Eugene to his mother).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the change he was already love struck with Susan. Now he was seriously considering opening up a church just to worship her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it a rest Eugene.\" The object of his affections shot him down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* Even your rejections with that voice sound di-vine\" He continued staring at her blatantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway long story short. We can't actually change Johhny back. We can change ourselves back to normal if we wanted but effects on the male chromosome were to damaging. Johnny's pretty much stuck like this.\" Said Mary<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are we gonna do know.\" Asked Mr Test while still glaring at the two model-esque girls. \"Johnny can't just be a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny smiled \"You tell em dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not without the proper paperwork at least.\" Quipped his Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM!\" cried Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You heard them Johnny. Your stuck like this. That mean's your not a little boy any more your a teenage girl. I wonder if we can get you into high school at this time of year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HIGH SCHOOL! I'm barel making it elementary.\" Johnny jumped out of her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother shot back a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to be the only mother in town with a 16 year old still in the fourth grade. Your sister's will just have to tutor you to high school level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins looked like they were going to protest but their mother continued. \"You can consider it part of your punishment for destroying your brothers whole life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sank down into their chairs. Johnny continued standing. Unbelieving what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll also have to go down to city hall and get your record's changed. How do you feel about being Jonni Test?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easy to remember 'and' it sounds the same.\" Said her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny clenched her teeth and slammed her fist on the table. \"My name is Jonny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother stood up. \"I will not be talked to that way young lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M A BOY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore Johnny.\" Said Susan. \"Trust us we did all we could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only worked for a few hour's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took us an hour to find the cure for the common cold. This was barely marginaly harder.\" Said Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look we don't like you being like this anymore than you do but there's nothing we can do. Your just going to have to live with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LIVE WITH IT!\" Jonny/Jonni hollered befor pointing to her profound chest \"How do you expect me to live like this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is it!\" Said Ms Test in a tone that demanded slience. \"You are going to your room and you are not to come down until tommorow to go to city hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT IS FINAL YOUNG LADY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny/ Jonni cringed back slightly beofre relenting and trudging upstair's.

She gabbed away with the crew she had charged with giving her daughter a whole new, completely feminine wardrobe. Lapping up the duel praise and jealousy of Jonni's perfect figure, lavishing in the dozens of outfits both practical and cute she and the sales assistant had picked and those they had yet to decide on, and loving the sense of pride she felt that Jonni for once in her formally his life was standing still while cloths shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's so nice to finally have a daughter to do these things with.\u201d She said dreamily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey were right here ya know!\u201d Mary said angrily from the seat directly left of her mother.

They had went home for a refill but sadly they had already developed an immunity to it, reworking the flakes formula to bypass that would take another two months at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI keep telling you it's too tight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness!

Not the thing that someone who til recently was only concerned with skateboarding, video games and messing with his sisters inventions wanted to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah she knew that the girl in the surrounding mirrors was hot, the hottest thing she'd ever seen in fact. Just because Johnny didn't put girls in his top 5 priority\u2019s didn't mean he couldn't tell a good looking one from Susan and Mary. The problem was that this total babe happened to be him she means her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't really noticed until now because she was either angry or in battle or angry again but Jonni had only now realised how different her form truly was. On a minor note she several feet taller than Johnny had been but he had already dealt with changes to his height in the past<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The roof exploded when a titanic boy burst through the Test house, roaring like a wild beast with psychedelic rays firing from his eyes.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo the problem Jonni noticeable now because...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChest out dear.\u201d The lady with the tape said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flame headed blonde moaned in annoyance and pushed her chest out, causing her to bite her lip when everything started digging into her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI keep telling you it's too tight!\u201d She snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than retort the woman only smiled at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness! Not even done growing and that big already! Oh you must be holding the boys back was a 50 foot poll.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Mary glared death at their 'older' sister, obviously thinking about one boy in particular the perky blonde/ redhead might steal from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced down at the primary and prominent offenders that blocked the previously A to B view of her feet. These things messed with her balance something terrible. She'd been holding onto walls at home discretely because she kept tipping over. The shifting in her rear she could handle, even after the combination of an expanded posterior and Hartman class hips had caused a complete split in her favourite pants the first time she bent down. She just couldn't take the fact she had a much higher....and much 'larger' centre of gravity that kept shifting every time she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt....them bounce free of the torture device when the seamstress removed it after taking down her....blouse. Quickly flinging on a new and ever frillier one with record speed and pulling the....blouse back up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at what her mother was making her wear. Her favourite shirt and t-shirt were laying across a chair over in the corner. Right now she was wearing a form fitting blue blouse the same tone as her shirt with sleeves that reached her elbows and a trim  that stopped only just above her bellybutton. A black *shudder* skirt in a fashion like her mom's suit covered everything til just above the knees allowing some of her ever permanently hair free legs to show until they reached her high heeled feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we please by some gunky loaf around stuff now?! I'm hardly going to need this laying around watching tv.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don't worry Joh Jonni. Just a few dozen  more and we can go to your stores.\u201d She said without blinking or sincerity. Telling Jonni her mother was rather enjoying playing dress up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned again and reached her her backside, shifting uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't fidget please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan't help it. It keeps...ya know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies wait til they're in private dear. Your not a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose last four words drove into the buxom young lass like stakes</span></div></div>",

Jonni would have been delighted if she had not been immediately dragged into a body care store were they loaded up on acne potions and soft skin lotions and face masks and scrubs and make up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had barely had the stuff paid for before she found herself tied to a salon chair and a chatty woman blowing bubbles blurred her hands around Jonni's flaming locks. Causing only the front parts to remain aloft while the rest of the once proud head of hair that moved in the wind like real living fire was flowing down to just past her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, finally after three hours of tortuously girly shopping Lila deemed that her beautiful girl could go to whatever stores she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sagged in relief. \u201cFinally! All this girl stuff you made me do is so exhausting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeast...you aren\u2019t...carrying...it.\u201d Mary gasped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two younger though technically older Test sisters had been relegated to bag duty, given that Jonni was far too attractive to be seen carrying her own  purchases the two plain red heads were given the task since their father was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonni chuckled cruelly \u201cOK maybe this isn't so bad.\u201d She said remembering all the times Johnny was left holding the bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew were she wanted to head. She really didn't want to try boarding until she got the whole balance thing down, that left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVideo games WooHoo!\u201d She cheered and ran to her favourite game shop. Totally ignorant of how the extra leg movement from the run tightened the skirt she was wearing against her backside which caused one unlucky/happy blader to skate straight into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store owner, a rotund man guy the name of Lenny was quite contrary to stereotype actually doing some work behind the counter, an ever present smile on his face as he happily spoke with his customers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenny tried his very best not to act like the stereotype he came across as. His store was clean and organised. He treated his customers like people not annoyances. His appearance was both casual enough to be approachable but had an air of professionalism. All in all he was not your average private game store owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever even someone as determined to break the stereotype as he  was not prepared for was a smoking hot supermodel busting through the door....or any other of the guys in the store were for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonni grinned from ear to ear and blurred down the aisles, passing as little more than a gust of wind. Grabbing games even as one unlucky souls fingers had brushed against the box. Taking her choices the flaming headed blonde zoomed towards the cash desk, bumped past several love struck adolescents and dumped the boxes on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll these to go my man! I've got a LOT of anger to work off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh ehhh. C-Can....\u201d His glasses fogged over while he stammered his way through words he had forgotten how to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHellooooo.\u201d She waved a smallish hands in front of his face. \u201cJonni wanna buy these HEY!\u201d She was pushed aside by her own mother who took over the purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi I'm her mom so let me get those for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-S-sure.\u201d He gasped out now no longer under the threat of a pretty girl. He started scanning the games when he noticed something weird. Call of honour: Future warfare, Deity of War 3, Grand Theft Moto 5, Older scrolls: Skyedge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls that came in here, albeit most younger and the older ones being no wear near as gorgeous or well endowed always bought JRPG'S, dancing or music games. Yet besides older scrolls this one picked up every game no other would go within a country mile of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is the coolest girl I've ever seen.\u201d A scratchy voiced almost teen  said behind Lila while (like every other guy in store) staring at Jonni who had taken to actually looking at the other games. Lenny breathed in relief that he wasn't the one to say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rang up the games and came up with the total. \u201cThat will be 54.99\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila groaned a little internally but decided that the ex-boy needed this at least. She reached to put her card in the machine when she noticed the price tags on the boxes and did the maths. \u201cWait why only that when it should come to...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust pay what I said please.\u201d He said strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one will buy anything if she doesn't leave.\u201d He said, eyes flickering to the aforementioned girl while straining to stay on Lila. Who only then noticed that every other pair of eyes in the room was focused on the girl....well parts of her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh.\u201d She said evenly, quietly picking up her purchases and grabbing her eldest/youngest with a squeak of complaint. Susan and Mary had just made it inside when they were shoved out again. Before they left Lila turned to Jonni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJonni could you do me a teensy favour for getting these for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have argued that paying back for something she was getting as compensation didn't make sense but she relented in fear her mother would take away the games. \u201cFine what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to look back in their, smile, and wink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook back in the store. Smile and wink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut wh...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a weird thing to ask but little to do so she relented. Looking back into the store were many a pair of eyes was still on her Jonni smiled brilliantly and winked at no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone yelled when he dropped a console on his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom of a slurpie cup fell off when its holders arm went slack, he continued sucking on the straw like nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cardboard display was knocked over when a 14 year old with bad acme developed jelly legs and fell into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenny held his gut from the cash registers drawer smacking into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonni shrugged and left the shop, ignorantly leaving a room full of love struck males in her wake as she did.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then turned to his controller who was watching the actions not with the salivating excitement of a 11 year old boy being allowed to play an ultra violent game, but of a moody teenage girl too distracted by her own thoughts to pay attention to award winning mayhem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat thier on the floor leaning against the foot of her bed. A pair of pyjama shorts (they used to be full length bottoms) loosely tied and being held up snugly by her behind and a puke green tank top which stretched across her chest enough that much of the junk food she was hap hazardly munching on disipeared into a place no man dareth go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know two days ago you would have sold your kidney to play Sky edge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would have if the 'doctor' hadn't 'required' a consent from my parents.\" She tilted the controller and killed 'another' dragon \"For nigh unstoppable dragons they sure are easily to kill with third hand weaponry.\" She murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying that you were obsessed with it. I've seen you with games you want Joh...nie...\" Man that felt weird. \"...But this isn't how you normally act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a game dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDukey spat out his soda \"JUST A GAME! Johnny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonnie.\" She corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHATEVER!\" He got up and stood on the bed in leu of a soap box. \"Last game you got you spent the whole weekend with your eyes pressing against the TV. Your sisters had to tranq you to go to sleep and tie you down like that Chuck Jones Cartoon about force feeding pigs to get you to eat! This isn't the Johnny Test I know! The Johnny Test I know is the hyperactive, scheming embodiment of a boy! He wears his cloths til they disintegrate and had to be carted around like Hannibal Lecter to get new ones. He's a thoughtless, destructive, manipulative genius, the best friend I've ever had and the embodiment of fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While all I've seen you do is mope and whine about the house, even after your mom caved and got you every, and I do mean 'every' thing you wanted that you used to have to beg for without complaint yet still aren't happy. You smell of soeap and exspensive shampoo, you spent an hour in the bathroom this morning getting ready to go nowhere. This room is spotless because you have the energy of  a sloth. You threw out all the red gush. Your not fighting this! Your talking like a girl, your acting like a girl, and judging from the way your hips swing like a pendulum....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went a little pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Your moving like a girl! The Johnny Test I know....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonnie.\" She corrected again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....MOST CERTAINLY WOULDN'T JUST LET HIMSELF BE CALLED JONNI!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL I'M NOT JOHNNY TEST ANYMORE AM I !?!\" She threw the remote on the floor and glared at her dog, who matched her until he saw the pinpricks of tears in her eyes. Crying, yet another thing Johnny never did (without faking) Her attempt to look angry and menacing only making her look adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Johnny Test anymore am I?! I'm not a little boy anymore am I?! This change is 100% permanent remember? Thanks to my sisters I lost nearly all of the best years of my life! I'll never be eleven again! I'll never be Johnny Test again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe panted and straightened herself up. Going to reach up and fix her hair like her Mom showed her but stopped herself letting it go back to it's natural gravity defying flame look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every thing is different now. The dorks said that even my brain is wired like a girls.\" She looked down. \"They said the longer I'm like this the more I'm gonna be a regular girl. All that sugar energy I had before is gone and the parts of me that said ignoring warnings and doing dangerous stuff is fun aren't as loud anymore. The way scariest thing though the longer I'm like it feels less and less weird and more normal. Like someones dumping in all the 'growing up' teens are supposed to do in the 5 years I missed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed deeply \"The girls said it themselves, I'm Jonni for good. If I think about it all I was or could have been I'm gonna end up depressing myself. And I can't pretend like nothings different.\" She held up her impressive chest and letting them drop for emphasis. \"So right now its all about trying to keep things as normal as I can, and deal with the new stuff as it comes instead of sweating it. Otherwise I'll never get anything done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDukey looked at his old pal for a  while before answering. \"Wow, that's surprisingly mature of you...Jonni.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said it's like all the stuff I missed is coming at the same time. I zoomed right past the 'awkward' part of the teenage years and into the 'young adult' which believe it or not Mom and Dad are actually helping, they're treating me like more of a grown up than Susan or Mary. I heard them talking about driving lessons the other day and my own house keys.\" She picked the controller again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you already know how to drive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. A space ship, motorboat, mechanical sea monster, moon buggy, plane and high tech go cart....and an actual car are two different things dog.\" She said in a 'for sure' manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...k....so they either they're trying to make you feel good about your situation...or more realistically bribe you into staying a more mature and responsible girl so you won't 'want' to turn back into the 11 year old who destroys the town on a daily basis should a cure ever turn up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno. Probably the latter.\" She mumbled before handing the dog another controller. \"Now play dog. The Drake Child needs someone to carry his burdens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile deep in the lab to much more intelligent but less physically (and as of now, perhaps even mentally) mature tweenage girls worked feverishly over beakers of bubbling chemicals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Testing of variation 57 is will be ready in 10, 9, 8,.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls observed a hamster in its cage. It's fur unnaturally silky and its eyes more adorable than even a normal hamster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"7, 6...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe animal shuddered and morphed. Shrinking in size Its fur lost its shine and it's eyes no longer lighting up the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAGGHH!\" Susan screamed and snapped the board over her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary jotted the results down. \"Original female pre-pubescent subject reverts to original state after 45 minutes and 27 seconds. Approximatly 5 seconds faster than with flake variation 56. And approximetly 7 minutes and 2 seconds quicker than in fully grown adult subject of same gender. As well as 4 minutes and 13 seconds quicker than adult male subject\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" All while The non fully grown male subject once again remains altered.\" Mary growled at another Hamster in a nearby cage. It's fur still shiny and its eyes deep as oceon's of huggability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At our current rate of progress we'll have working hottie flakes that work permanently on us iiiiiiiiiiin negative three hundred years.\" Mary said annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have three hundred years ago. We don't have even a week before GIL SEES OUR LITTLE BROTHER!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Older Sister.\" Mary corrected with a bitter taste in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. The second Gil see's Jonni we might as well pack up the lab and open a froghurt shop.\" She snarled. \"I refuse to lose *SIGH* Gil Nexdor to a girl who still chews like a chipmunk and laughs at fart jokes just because she finds it hard to breath in a D-cup bra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double D.\" Her sister corrected again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHATEVER!!!\" She screamed and swept her arms across the table throwing chemical to the floor causing a toxic mixture to form. \"IT'S NOT FAIR!!! WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE GIL FAWNING OVER 'US' BY NOW!!!! WERE SUPPOSED TO BE MEGA HOTTIES THAT MAKES HELEN OF TROY LOOK UGLY!!! NOT 'JONNI' TESTS NERDY SERVENT SISTERS!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary gasped and ran to the wall hitting the 'emergency clean up' button' which caused several robots to rush out of their storage room and scrub up to spill at the sub atomic level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful.\" The more stylishly haired twin warned. \"Those were mutagens remember? The last thing we want is getting a of bunch of flesh bending toxins in our systems right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Susan rolled her eyes and went to get more chemicals for variation 58. Snorting a little as she did so when something irritated her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Some familiar dudes voice yelled out \"No!\" for some reason before a blonde with red highlights opened the door.....just....not the blonde with red highlights he'd thought it would be<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde heart throb's jaw fell open. The ridiculously hot girl standing in the doorway mirroring him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gil?!\" She blurted out before correcting herself \"I mean..hey boy I've never met before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once in his life, Gil Nexdor was utterly speechless in the presence of a girl \"H-hey Uh. I...uh.girl....who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnni Test.\" She lied. Remembering to say the first to letters of her name as 'joe' instead of 'jaw' after only 30 tries. Now for the backstory she'd finally remembered \"Johnny's....cousin.....from Canada.....ay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost remembered. It was meant to be California.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hardly the greatest lie ever told, but with how Gil was just staring at her without blinking and nodding along she realized she could have told him she was the rabbit eared cookie empress of the frog men of Neptune and she would have gotten the same response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed from embarrassment when it caught up to her that the boy was 'staring' at her. Looking her up and down a few times in the way all guys did with hot girls without realizing before catching himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" He smiled the smile that always made her now younger sisters melt \"I..uh...was looking for Johnny-brah. I know he's dying to tear up that new skate park next week, and I won two tickets to shred up the pace before anyone else does 'today'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohhh.\" Crud! Johnny had been dreaming of that place for months, ever since he..she heard they were pulling in an eighty foot ramp! The youngest Test had been pacing a hole in his floor waiting, and now Gil comes along saying he could get in early?! Seriously!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssorry.But Johnny can't go to the park.\" The word hurt to drag out \"Johnny ah, were on aaaaa cousin exchange right now. His folks wanted him up north to get some 'mounty discipline', and I wanted to visit my down south family while they had the spare room. Long story short he's gonna be gone and I'm gonna be here instead for a while........ay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" The blonde said with a smile...before he developed a sudden interest in the sky \"I mean, bogus. Guess I'll have to christen the park in his honor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gil!...why don't...I go with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused \"You skate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cocked her hip and put a fist on it. Reaching behind the door for her trusty ride \"Did Tony Hawk's last game crash and burn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGil stared at the blonde babe who he just found out is a board jockette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I love you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough because he blurted it out she didn't quite catch it \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said lets go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Last one to the park has to get jumped over.\" She smiled before jumping out the door. Landing on her board as she races down the path and onto the sidewalk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Hey wait up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's teeth ground together loudly at the sight or her new older sister and long time crush board out of sight through the magic of close circuit camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First you take my beauty. Now you think you can just take MY Gil. Your crossing the line 'Johnny'.\" She growled out. Before coughing violently. Grasping the nearby table to keep herself steady. Her knees buckled under her and she almost went to her knees before catching herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The flakes turn you into a Gil stealing hottie, while it makes me sick? Your so gonna get it <b>Joh</b>ny.\" She growled out as she stood up. Walking back over to continue to experiment not noticing or ignoring the marks in the solid wood surface she'd grabbed onto now having four holes in it, like someone had tried driving nails into it</span></div></div>",

Johnny was below average, trouble making and actually ran away in terror at the thought of hard work. Not exactly someone who his parents were proud of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't to say he wasn't smart. He was known for tricking his sisters whenever he wanted something, and he did often come up with idea that got them out of trouble.......right after he got them into trouble. He wasn't stupid per say, he just put all his effort into having fun and not into the things that were important like school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the thing about genetics is the smallest of changes in the d.n.a can cause drastic differances to a person.

Mabye he's not coming around today.\" She said sadly. Next to her yet another similiarly dressed, simialiar bodied girl disagreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He coming alright. This is the direction the guards chase him every day.\" Said the one called Kaylee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to princess Jasmine (whose beauty brought suitors from far and wide) these three sisters where he most saught after women in all of Agrabah. There were a number of reasons for this, aside from there obvious looks. Despite their incredible beauty they were considered a mere close second to the breath taking loveliness of the princess. They compensated for this by having much more curvacious bodies than her. Though that wasn't to say their weren't other reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters despite dressing like Harem girls Aisha, Leila and Kaylee where in fact the triplet daughters of the most successful caravan trader in Agrabah. A man whose wealth came close to the level of royalty. Allowing them to live in the lap of luxury, which could be said for any suitors they might take a shine to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthis meant the one they chose to marry would become the heir apparent to their father Yasir's. Inheriting a large portion of his fortune and taking over his buiness when the marriage was finalized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you'll notice I said 'the one ''they'' chose to marry'. This brings us to the third and greatest reason these girls had suitors lining up around Agrabah. They simply didn't want to be seperated when they married. Growing up constantly at each others side made them somewhat 'reluctant' to be part, so in his infinite wisdom Yasir came up with a rather simple solution to this girl's dileema.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girl's would all marry one boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not unheard of. In fact they knew one or two girls who had married polygamously. However the idea of marrying all three beauties may have brought men to the door. It was also what kept them from marrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf one sister did not like the suitor then all three rejected him. It was either they all liked him. Or none of them did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo suitors came and went. Yasir growing increasingly worried that he would have to start bringing in men from out of Agrabah because they were starting to rn out of unrejected men in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when they saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was out at market one day, they had been eyeing a few of the stalls when a boy caught there eye from the tarp above a food stall. He intrigued them with his cunning in stealing from the vendor without getting caught. He made them giggle at his antics as well as at his monkey, he amazed them with his deftifying acrobatic feats when he was spotted by the guards and he outran them with as much agility as his pet. Finally when he turned and he saw his face he made them swoon at how handsome he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the man they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey told their father. He was a little weary that a 'street rat' had caught his precious girl's eye's. Though he supposed that them agreeing on a suitor again wouldn't happen in his lifetime so he relented. As long as he was healthy 'and' the girls could get him themselves then he had no problem with this boy. The guard's wouldn't exactly hand him over in one piece iif they found him and his mmerchants weren't being paid to track down one man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee was the first to notice he always passed by their home when running from the guards. Which happened every day in what Aladdin considered sport. Each time a little differant, guards would useually be blocking the road since the routing had become predictable so the young thief always had to escape differantly. Sometimes even jumping through house windows. They just had to be patient and leave the wooden shutters open so he'd jump in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he'd be there's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girl's are wasting your time with that street rat!\" Came a gruff reply from their rather stout housekeeper. \"If it was me I'd turn him over to the guards.\" She turned and left with disgust evident on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'good thing were not you.' They thought as one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAisha continued her surveying the street. Not much here. Some carts, a shepherd herding sheep, rigging for a new bui....\"THERE!\" She cried to her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two crowded round the window. They saw a handsome young man effortlessly climbing the rigging, one hand clutched around a loaf of bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain they were amazed by his ability's. It wasn't just anybody who could make the guards look foolish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when they saw it, as the guards started shaking the rigging he lept over...towards 'their' window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, act normal.\" Said Leila before they moved away from the window and took phony stances to look occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere hearts leapt as they met Aladdin face to face. In there home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ladies.\" He said right as a monkey landed on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey swooned a little. There happiness was short lived as he made for the other window in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla's hand shot out. \"Wait.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy turned to face her. Just as they heard a mass number of footsteps running up the houses stairs. The guards saw him and were coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no thought behind her actions Kayla pulled him back from the window and threw him into the large pile of pillows in the corner, her sisters covering him then sitting down causing him to go \"Oomph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree guards burst through the door. Scimitars poised to do some serious cutting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head guard turned to the girl's.

But did a 'street rat' come through here?\" He said in forced sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla nodded with her nose upturned before pointing out the window. \"That 'filthy' vermin jumped in here and tried to 'do things' to us. After him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaul's eye's widened in surprise \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Just. GET. HIM!\" She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards couldn't get out fast enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAisha and Leila both reached in to the pillows and pulled the boy and his monkey out.

I'll remember it.\" He put his hand on the window frame but was once more pulled back by Kayla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back. A little uncomfortable at how they were looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We saved your life right?\" Said Kayla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That mean's you owe us.\" Aisha said while giving him a sultry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin smiled nervously as the girls continued to advance on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry girl's but I'm afraid I don't have much to give. Street rat remember?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls cornered him and continued boxing him in. Abu was to busy stuffing his face with fruit to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there is something you could do.\" Said Leila who along with her sietrs were pressing right against him. The young man suppressed a low groan as he felt their combined chests rub against him. Thank the sands he was wearing baggy pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm..wh-what would th-that b-be?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir looks turned predatory for a moment, before breaking out into joyous grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marry us!\" They said in unison right before they all moved in to kiss him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo you are the famous Aladdin.\u201d Said the firm  and commanding voice of Rasir, father of the triplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here was a man who looked infinity more like the sultan than the sultan. He was tall and imposing, built like a brick wall and looked like he'd really was made of granite. He wore lavish and colourful robes made of expensive materials such as silk, a symbol of his status and wealth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither was he an ugly man, he was not boyishly handsome like Aladdin, if he had ever been. No this was the kind of rugged good looks that could allow a man just to point at a woman to make her his. He had aged gracefully since those days, only bearing a few wrinkle's he could do nothing about and only a few inches off his impressive height, his eyes still a piercing green bored into Aladdin's very sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin for his part definitely felt that as he was seated across the table from the man, pulling his imaginary collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He said cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that despite your 'fame...\u201d Rasir left it hanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy gulped, knowing full well what the man who could easily break him in half meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...despite it my daughters appear to be very taken with you. If your face is anything to go by.\u201d The man said dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, Aladdin's face had more lipstick on it than the girls had on their lips. A small trail leading down his neck let Rasir know the boys constraint since they stop just short of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou realise how lucky you are boy? My daughters have turned away countless individual suitors only to all settle on a...street rat.\u201d He said in distaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!!!\u201d Barked Aladdin. He didn't care if the man was more than twice his size he wouldn't be insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRasir just laughed. Shaking whatever was not nailed down. \u201cSettle boy, I'm just grateful that my daughters have finally decided on a suitor.\u201d He leaned over to face Aladdin. \u201cYou 'are' planning on marrying them right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo its not a grammar error. That wasn't a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn reflex the boy would have said \u201cno\u201d, but he's be lying if he said he wasn't considering it, three girls, triplets no less wanted to all marry him. Not just any triplets either but Rasirs daughters. Everyone in Agrabah knew about them, who were known throughout the seven sands as the most beautiful girls for miles around. They're unattainably only added to their fame drawing in any and all single males from the farthest reaches of the unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually part of his day, whenever a rich noble entered Agrabah people would always bet on whether they were heading to the palace for the princess or here. He'd sit with Abu and time how long it would take for the idiot to be tossed out by the walking mountain of a father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what time he'd spent with the girls befre meeting their father he could tell theyre was more to them than just looks, theyre room was lined with intricate woven fabric and art that Aisha claimed to have made herself. Leila was apparetnly the smart one since her father would always ask her for help with the finances. Kaylee was the funny and athletic one if the way she could literally bend over backwards to reach an apple from the fruit bowl was any indication <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I had to flesh them out so Aladdin wouldn't seem shallow)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that they wanted to marry him was unbelievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when faced with that, all the street boy could utter was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis pleased the giant man. \u201cGood. Now before you marry them I'm afraid I must press some conditions for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here we go. Thought Aladdin bitterly. He was going to give Aladdin some impossible task so he couldn't marry the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow like I did for my wife's father, which he did for his wife's father and so forth. I require you to bring me a dowry of 20 gold coins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGold? In case you haven't noticed I'm not exactly well off. Plus I only steal food\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you think I was n better when I was asked to do this by my father in law? No I was dirt poor but I managed it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw the distress on the boys face and sighed. \u201cAladdin, I have never seen my girls so happy to be around a boy but this is tradition, this marriage will also make you my heir so I need to know that you can acquire money without stealing it. Understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy slowly nodded, understanding even though he didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent. Oh by the way, I need that money to be with me within a week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the heck am I going to earn 20 gold coins in a week.\u201d Wondered Aladdin as he walked down the streets of Agrabah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I can help?\u201d Came an old and grating voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin looked up to see a hunched over old man standing in his path, grey rags covering him and a beaten old stick to support him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know were you can get a 'lot' of gold.\u201d The old man grinned with a mouth full of crocked teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Aladdin's hopeful look Jafar internally sneered. He had found his diamond in the rough.</span></div></div>",

No food or water and the only thing to eat was each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd already had to swat Abu away when he start chewing on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I got us both trapped down here.

When Aladdin whispered to him Monkey that this confirmed he was dreaming the Genie decided to make the mother of all sales pitch3s with a killer show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was too much to accuratly describe without him stumbling over his words a million times or just stopping after sounding crazy. Things were going great....up until this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can your friends do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie juggled him head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can your friends do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed his head towards his master who then developed the skills of a globetrotter and spun it around on his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can your freinds pull this....out their little haaaattt?\" He transformed into a rabbit which rapidly became a dragon. \"Can your friends go Poof?.....\" He breathed fire in Aladdins direction, the boy moved to shield himself, but instead it moved around him and took shape......a very shapely shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Lookie here AHAHA!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree absolutly gorgeous girls probably about his age formed from the genies flame, dressed in scandelously revealing outfits that hit barely anything beautiful women would wear only when dancing for the rich and the royal to show of their rolling hips, long legs, bejeweled navals and *pardon* frankly enormous assets in dances made to arouse. Why would the genie make.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls weren't confused for even an instant about their sudden existance, the moment their eyes formed they were locked onto him, their expression's making their intentions clear as they conveyed loyalty, adoration and a few other emotions he wasn't sure about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey glided over to him like they were still living flame, their every movement from the swing of their pelvis to the bounce of their breasts hypnotised him like a man staring into a roaring flame in bitter cold, in a mere moment the fire was upon him, surrounding him and consuming him. Their dance was to much to fully describe with mere words, words being imposible to form at this point. The bodies bodies exciting him to phenomonal levels, he felt a perfect heart shaped rear brush up against him crotch in a manner that was quick but felt like a joyous eternity which she repeated with the rhytmic bounce of her dance, every brush of skin and press of soft chest against him would give him the urge to groan, this could have gone on for an eternity or just a moment as<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took his head into her hands without any fight, his eyes boy this point as half lidded as her, the emotions he'd seen before still theyre but now he could bravely identify the mere adoration as full blown love, love mixed with a lust that promised that this dance was only the begining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moistened her lips and leaned foward, her sisters watching with inviting and eager expressions as she drew his head closer to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can your friends go abra cadabra LET A RIP and make this sucker DISIPEAR!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO don.............huh...........HUH?!?!?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al.....AL!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy opened his eyes, picked himself up off the floor and out of the lap of the girl he'd just collapsed onto after her seering kiss had ripped the strength out of his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, wha. Genie!?\" He mumbled as the girls surronded him. One circling a perfectly manicured finger on his chest, anotherhugging his head up and kissing his face and the last one running her fingers through her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Al....HA HA Ha ha..listen I  uh, can't help but notice those three babes I conjured out of nowhere......still being here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it seems.\" He replied dreamily as he was pulled in for another unbelievable lip lock. \"No problems here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually yeah Al big problems. You see they were supposed to Disipear when I said Disipear, which is why I said DISIPEAR!\"The girls looked up at him for a second in confusion before fusing over their man again. \"Plus you know I notice they appear to be......totally gaga for you!\" He didn't blame the boy for not responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't know whats wrong.\" He reached behind his back and whipped out a huge book. \"Lets see, lets see. Magical glitches, no not that....not that either. Forbidden wishes....nah I'd get that fart sound like those fairies.......ah ha were we go, borderline magic, for when we get forbidden results without trying........let see now......can't make existing people fyadda yadda created life feel whatever blah blah  careful not to create new l....crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk so the rule's wet he couldnt kill anyone.

CRafting unbelievable sites, esquiete foods and girls so lovely and realistic in their movements and actions that you'd fall in love with them on eye-sight....he'd put quite a lot of work into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough that popping them out of existance would come under the 'can't kill anyone' rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd created three, gorgous flesh and blood girls for the express purpose of being in love with Aladdin, which he could do since he wasn't forcing anyone that existed at the time to love him but three what he thought were shells filled with magic whose minds he could shape in any way he wanted before releasing them into existance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose that even though you didn't say 'I wish' you'll still let me count this as wish numero uno?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to take he sounds of lips smacking as three sultry visions worshipping him in a real life enactment of pretty much every male fantasy ever thought up as confirmation, but Carpet just gave him that 'look' of his.</span></div></div>",

Two scantily dressed beauties massaged his feet while one rubbed at knots in his neck, making sure her large breasts were pressing at the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the tent Abu found himself in a like-wise situation, Albeit one he would rather leave if he could. Pressing all around him stopping his escape was his own group of loving females. While he'd enjoy it if it were as he was before and it was a bevy of female monkies, Instead it was a group of six beautiful lady elephants pressing him from all sides. Giving him the goo goo eyes, tickling his trunk or pulling at his little tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did not tickle the former monkey's fancy like the girls tickled Aladdins, and since he was now several tons of hard to move elephant instead of an agile little monkey the girls didn't have to worry about their mate gatting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNor did it tickle Genie, who was busy pacing a hole to the desert floor, despite not having legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok genie ok. Relax relax relaxrelaxrelax!\" Carpet followed his rapid movements as though it had eyes. \"Its no big deal. You just...poofed like 30 young women (more if you include the elephants) into flesh and blood existence for the sole purpose of loving and serving one man. Its not like it's that bad? Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at carpet who just shrugged his tasles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't give me that? It was an easy mistake. They ain't hurting nobody? Whats the worst that could happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world suddenly went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey who turned out the sun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a switch being pulled in a large hall came from nowhere and the blue Djinn was standing underneath a spotlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped \"Uh oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground rumbled and he fell back onto his now none whispy butt and in a tiny uncomfortable school chair. The darkness in front of him somehow became more solid as a large dark shape like a semi circle towered over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shirt appeared on him so he could tug at the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7 lights appeared behind the top of the shape, 7 lights given off by 7 glowing bodies. 7 bodies with 7 unique colours and manacles around their wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree women and three men sat at 6 podiums reaching the middle of the massive tribunal stand. All looking down at him with a mixture of anger and sadness. In the middle a final figure rose up, one that had the blue man almost gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was not the most massive of the Djinn before him, that belonged to the violet one at the far left, nor was he the most regal, that distinction belonged to the oriental magenta genie in the kimono. However what this Djinn gave off was far more dangerous, an aura of pure force that made cosmic power seem like a cheap card trick by a newbie stage magician. The genie was a brilliant gold in colour, hair braided into a ponytail that stretched down his back, on his head a band made from the metal that pounded the galaxy into shape and adorned with gems that came in as many colours as his species did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grand high Djinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down on him with terrifying indifference the leader of all genies spoke in a terrifyingly dull monotone that made him soul itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think the rules were made to be bent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh, you see, your, your supreme highness what happened was....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" A voice like a thunder clap blew him back onto his posterior. The massive Nordic look Djinn dressed in furs slammed his ham like hand on the podium \"THE RULES ARE FIRM! RIGID! UNBREAKABLE AND UNYIELDING! NO LOOPHOLES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female genie, one of arabian dress and cream white skin tittered behind a hand \"Though blunt Onska has a point, The rules are meant to be honored in both word and spirit. As they are meant to be taken, Not how they 'can' be taken. You would not try and find away around the rule of no killing would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie gave a long sufering sigh and wiped ran a cloth over his brow, emptiing the sweat into a nearby bucket. \"C'mon! I didn't mean to do it! I just put a little to much detail into my work and it took on a life of its own. You can't tell me thats never happened before right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has\" The mint green genie dressed in native American garb nodded sagely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie huffed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we also visited punishment upon them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat huff was sucked right back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time another female spoke, a deep blue one in the style of a north born scottish woman , looking down at his with apologetic and sad eyes. \"Ye cannae jus create life \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u064a(genie- I got it from the google translator). Such a hing is forbidden to all but tha power tha be an has far reachin' consequences not even our powers can predict. Accident or no we canae just leave ye to yer carelessness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well said Guidhe.\" The lord spoke up, his gaze never leaving the accused \"Though not the most severe of charges against him.\" He turned from his confused court to the accused \"You do not fully comptehend just what you have done, do you?\" Genie shook his head slowly, too scared to even think of correcting him. \"Creating true life is not only taboo because it can be used to circumvent the rules. Because true life, unlike a construc, has another ability.\" He gripped his staff audibly tighter. \"The ability to be granted wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lead weight suddenly dropped in genie's stomach. Guidhe gasped while Onska glared at him with teeth bared. He would have backed away, but unlike a second ago the full scope of what he did came to bare. He'd created those girls with the mindset of being in love with, and totally loyal to Aladdin. He'd certainly never meant to make them real, but they were. Which meant he'd created twenty four new potential masters who, being loyal and in love with Aladdin, the boy could easily convince them to make wishes for him, and thats if they don't decide to make those wishes for him without telling him 'out of love'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWishes that make Aladdin better, or improve the current girls standing with Aladdin over their 'sisters'. Make him stronger, make him richer, make him a king, an emporer, a demi-god! Make themselves Aladdins favourite, no me, I want that job! The sky was the limit....and all of them would have something to do with his current master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats seventy-three extra wishes Aladdin possibly had before he used his last to free him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with dread genie realised the full weight of everything. If he could create girls who could make wishes like that? What was to stopping him from creating a new master, who could wish him free?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would stop any genie from creating a master that could wish for whatever the genie 'tells' them to wish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great one's gaze softened as genie'sfell to the ground. \"I see now you understand the full gravity of this situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have anything to say before we pass punishment upon you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie stood theyre for a second. Looked around the never ending darkness, scratched his head and said \"Well since your gonna stick it to me anyway....just....don't make it to messy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lord nodded \"Such a crime, born from gnorance as it was, is not fitting of a gruesome fate, and the ten thousand years you spent locked away in the cave of wonders only to keep your humour shows that locking you away for another eon could cause no ill effect. So it is the decision of this tribunal...\" He turned his gaze to all his lesser judges who nodded \"...The decision of this tribunal that your nature be changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changed?\" Please don't be a toaster, please don't be a toaster, please don't be a toaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" The world filled with like brighter than a thousand suns, yellow lightning dancing between the genie lords fingertips before it struck the blue one \"Now and forever let your true form be changed. Immutable and uncompromising. This form shall exceed all other magics and can never be undone....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie felt himself warping into a new shape, except when he did that himself he could still feel his regular form at the core of his being, the central part of himself that he would become when not flexing his shape changing magic. That part of him was being over-ridden by the incredible force being unleashed on him. Changing what made him him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pain subsided the darkness that filled up the oasis faded back into the light of day. A final echo of his lords voice filled his ears before all went quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the punishment fit the crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie wondered what he meant. Grasping at the sand beneath him he blinked away any wooziness from being zapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarpet drifted over to him, clearly distressed. Then even more so when the rug seemed to take a fit at the sight of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats got your weave in a kn....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up, and felt something very different about himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(All genie names were either translated as 'wish' or 'genie'. Genie's name is just 'genie' in Arabic. I thought it would be strange for genies to refer to another one of them as genie. Also I'm sorry about the Scottish or Scandinavian genies portrayal, I just wanted the Scottish one to have an accent (which I find hard to write) and the viking one to be big and tough.)</span></div></div>",

The reflection in the mirror wasn't so much goofy, fun loving party animal as it was sultry, sexy and sensual. The curves were all in the right places, the stomach more hypnotising than the ones he'd given the girls literally born to dance. Her ass was a perfect peach stuffed into a tight pair of see through harem pants, through which she could see her long luscious legs tapering into little feet. Thin delicate arms leading to dainty hands with manicured red nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face screamed 'seductress'. No matter how hard she tried be it by force or magic she couldn't make her long lashed eyelids open more than half way leaving her with unchangable 'bedroom eyes', One of which was hidden behind thick, volumous black curls that reached down her mid back. Her full ruby lips pouted sexily without any concious effort. Full cheek bones and a delicate chin, a smooth neck adorned with several pieces of mystically beautiful jewelry. All of this coming together to give her an unchangeable expression of 'come hither my love'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course no one would notice that expression given the twenty pounds of perfectly shaped chest flesh jutting out from her slim torso. Firm and perky as though they were full of helium without a hint of sag. The only thing keeping them from floating away was the tight harem top she was wearing, and even that looked like it would explode off her with any sudden movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie looked down, watching with what only she could know  was worry as her massive chest bounces and jiggled enticingly with the slightest movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok..........ok I can fix this.\" She whispered with a soprano that sounded like the cross between a whisper and a moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed to herself and willed a clothing change. Something in an eskimo attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer top changes from purple to green, but showed no less flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping a little she tried the pants. Desiring them to be less transparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey became more so, the bikini panties which were the only none see through part of the bottoms became a little skimpier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair flashed with magic intended to make it straighter and shorter. They instead grew to touch her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tore the necklaces off, even more beautiful ones took there place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNails longer instead of shorter, lips fuller, nose smaller, voice breathier. She tried everything, everything to make her look less like a waking wet dream and every time failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let the punishment fit the crime' A voice echoed in her head 'You created women to be nothing but objects of desire, then you shall become such a woman yourself a hundred fold!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It was an accident. A stupid mistake' Genie thought sadly. Even the voice in her head was alluring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then this will teach you  to be careful.' The voice replied as it faded out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie just stood there for a minute. Taking stock of the situation. Was this permanent? Would they let he change back into herself? If so would she have to wait like a prison sentence or would she have to do some redeeming act? Now he was a she what....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genie? Genie where are you?\" Thew unmistakable voice of Al called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*DING*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of his voice caused the female Djinn so straighten up in a second. Her breasts thrust out proudly as what felt like a bolt of lightning raced up and down her spines....and straight to other places.<br>\r\nGenie was suddenly overcome with  feelings and sensations she had never experienced before, and not a one of them felt anything short of amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeeniee?!\" Al shouted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm.\" She moaned weakly. Trying to fight these sensations but it was like trying to fight the wind. Her hands moved to her stomach as she felt a growing need planted in there. Panting even though she didn't need breath. She tried to keep herself in control but someone else had other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer leg suddenly stuck straight out in front of her and she took a step forward. Like a puppet on a string she found herself marching towards the campsite with the girls and *sigh* Aladdin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Can't we talk about this? I'll clean trash of Jupiter. I'll muck out the stables of Olympus for a milennia. I'll listen to Loki's jokes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is not our doing. Your body is merely acting on what your mind refuses to believe.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one final step Genie walked through the few bushes seperating her from the camp site and into view. Only then were her strings unattached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to get away, clear her head. If she could just get to her lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backed up a few steps, made to dart away and......put up hers behind her head and pushed her chest out as much as she could, running her fingers through her locks she ran her small pink tongue over her cherry red lips before puckering them even more.....all of her own volition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here Al.\"</span></div></div>",

Let alone girls as beautiful as the ones that had practically been throwing themselves at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was slow going, and genie had explained to him the story about all these girls surrounding him in the oasis. Despite how eagerly he initially seemed to go with it when they first appeared, the knowledge that these were now very real women and not just constructs of his friends power, and that they only loved him because they had been created 'to' love him and couldn't think any differently made him feel....'dirty', for a lack of a better word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd tried reasoning with them. He'd managed to ask the girl feeding him grapes in between bites if this was what she really wanted and that she and everyone else was free to leave. She'd responded with a confused frown before kissing him and telling him that there was no one else she or her many sisters would rather be with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd even asked genie if he could 'wish' that they didn't love him like this. His big blue friend almost distractedly explained that he couldn't make someone who already existed fall out of love with another anymore than he could make them fall 'in' love, and that he was already in enough trouble with making these girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin had no idea what he meant and tried to push for more. Only for the big guy to push him into a suddenly appearing mass of pillows were he was swarmed by soft kisses and gentle fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was able to get away soon enough and go looking for genie. Despite the small size of the oasis it had taken some time before his big blue friend showed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been surrounded by literal scores of incredibly beautiful woman all day, each focused on making him enjoy that beauty as much as possible. He'd thought that this would make him more used to the sight of other such girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie tore down those notions in an instant. Breasts that enormous should not be able to sit that high or that firm on a womans torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenies new body spat in the face of adhering to anything close to human proportions. Even the score of women waiting for him just past the brush, magically created aside had realisitc, if impressive measurements. Genie now had a waist so tiny he swore he could wrao his hands around it and have his fingers meet in the middle. Her face was, unsuprisingly supernaturally beautiful, and seemingly locked in an irremovable 'come hither' stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned as he felt the now female genies head sized bosom press tightly into his side while she gently rubbed his footgently with her slipper, and drew him in for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe melted instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no resistance</span></div></div>",

Before her eyes, she watched her love shift into human form once more.  \"Jasmine,\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Jasmine responded as she noticed something:  her tongue was still snake-like!  \"Genie!\" she called.  Genie moved in and revealed a mirror.  She stared at herself, human above the waist, but her long emerald scales tail dragging behind her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genie!

Is this some trick of Mirage's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To a degree.  The Tree of Renewal is powerful, but limited.  It cannot be used to change a person back who does not wish to change,\" Fasir said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait . . . doesn't wish . . .\" Aladdin said, turning his head to Jasmine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down in shame.  \"For a moment before I bit the fruit, part of me was going to miss the tail and other advantages this has,\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.  How stupid can ya get?\" Iago yelled, before being hit by Abu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her heart wanted this.  A second fruit will not reverse it further,\" Fasir said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So . . . I am truly stuck like this?\" Jasmine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You will not change further, but the Tree will not change you back either,\" Fasir said.  \"You are a snake-woman now.\"  Jasmine shook her head as tears came to them.  Aladdin moved close to his beloved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jas,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't Aladdin.  I don't deserve your love.  I . . . I didn't want to become human.  I wanted to stay a monster.  How could you love me?\" Jasmine asked.  Aladdin hugged her and pulled her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you for who you are, Jasmine.  I love more than just your body,\" he replied softly.  \"And  . . . I don't mind your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You . . . You don't?\" Jasmine asked.  Her semi-human eyes looked into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  This body saved me when I fell from the cliff and from those thieves.  You saved me,\" Aladdin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But . . . my spines,\" she whispered, as the long black thorns laid on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was on the street, the snake charmer told me he was immune to his own snakes because of being bitten by them many times.  I can do the same for your poison.  You would never have to worry about hurting me again,\" Aladdin said.  Jasmine shuddered as Aladdin drew her close.  \"I love you.\"  Her tail wrapped around him as she kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one noticed Fasir simply vanishing.  He smiled faintly at Aladdin's words.  A small cat with wings popped in.  \"Oh, this looks interesting,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you say,\" the old seer replied.  The winged cat looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You play a dangerous game.  I like it,\" Chaos said before vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Aladdin broke apart.  \"Come on.  Let's go home,\" Aladdin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Father should be back from his trip soon.  We'll need to tell him what happened,\" Jasmine said.  The heroes walked back towards their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for every choice, there is a consequence.  What Jasmine chose will change not just her own path, but the paths of others.</span></div></div>",

In the orb was the biggest thorn ever to be in the side of an all powerful chaotic evil goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their less than cordial relationship, she did not show anger towards the sleeping figure of the boy. No quite the opposite. It was joy bordering on near ecstasy. Foe you see she was finally implementing what she considered the ultimate plan to not only get rid of the boy, but accomplish so much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was simple really, a mere modification of a plan she had performed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of her arm, an evil mist rushed forward and into the orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the walls of the royal palace of Agrabah, a street rat slept soundly. His form sunken deeply into the feathery softness he was so unused to still after years of having a rock wall for his back and a ragged shaul for a blanket. The mist seeped through the doorway. Wafting over the rolled up enchanted carpet, and rolling over the brass lamp which had a deep rumbling snore coming from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grren clous was upon its target in seconds, it raised up like a serpent waiting to bite before it lunged forward and shot straight down his throat, his nose, his ears and eyes. Letting itself be totally consumed by the hero of the town instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage licked her lips. This was going to be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes happened immediatly. His spine stretched along with other parts of him until he towered over Raoul the head guards. His limbs now lanky and awkward....at least they were until muscle started to pile on top of them. Aladdins once gymnastically toned body gained from years of out manuvering the guards was replaced by a mountain of muscle the likes of which would make more sense for an Odiferon. The kind of body Genie gave him the last time he'd tried showing off for girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis toned stomach became a rock hard 8 pack, his pectorals swelled up like a sack of footballs. By this point his trademaerk purple coat had ripped to shreds by the way just as his arms bulked up from the shoulders down. His biceps blew up until they were the size of a mans head even when he wasn't flexing. No muscle was spared a size change, from the souls of his feet to the top of his head he was ripped like he could wrestle giants with his bare hands and come out on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point when a golden fur started to sprout all over him, and his face was being pushed out into a muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evil incarnate was purring up a storm. Her hands idly drifting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis teeth grew sharper and longer the further away his mouth moved from his skull. His nose looked like it wasn't being pushed foward as well, but instead like it was stretching, being pulled flatter against his face. The nostrils closed up into slits and the skin around it turned a shade of pinky red just as the fur met his thicker, blackened lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingernails were pushed of the tips just as iron hard claws burst through, which happened to his feet just shortly after thick, black pads formed on his soles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fitful moaning in his sleep became a deep masculine growling. He tossed the sheet away when it became to hot to sleep with fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere once a boyishly handsome young adventurer had slept was now an immensely masculine beast man, with extra emphasis on the 'man' part. This figure was large, imposing and dominent. The kind that commanded respect and fear just by being in the room. The one that was in control with no room for arguement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage licked her lips as she materialised in the room. Just the way she liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving a hand over the rooms other occupents she lowered her head onto Aladdins gold coloured barrel chest and rubbed against it, purring up a storm and rousing him from his slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlearily he opened his slitted eyes. Blinking away the sleep and just catching the powerful evil rubbing her head and her hands up and down him in a slow and loving manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up to see him staring at her. Their eyes met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mirage!\" Aladdin growled in a deep an undeniably masculine voice that would make any woman quiver. He lifted one of his massively muscled arms and huge hands to shove the dark goddess of his massive pecks, but paused when he saw his hands were furrier than they should have been. His feline eyes trailed down from his hand towards his bulging biceps, herculian shoulders and eventually drew over the rest of him. He barely looked like himself anymore, more like a cross between a lion and that guy in the market with the huge muscles he'd hidden behind the day before he met Jasmine. The bed now felt like it was built for a child where as before it had been large for him. His pants clung to him for dear life, and (he jodtled his hips a little, ignoring Mirages smile as he did so)......daaaaammnn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting he tried to reach for genies lamp, only for the evil one to lick the spot where his neck met his jaw, causing his arm to drop dead to his side at the intensely pleasurable feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm you taste good my lover.\" Mirage said with a smile. Aladdin gulped as he found the smile more arousing than he should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L...lover?! No way!\" He said and brushed his long fingers against the magical lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud snoring could be heard emanating from it and a whisp floated out of its spout, materialising a small sign that said 'Do Not Disturb'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin groaned in annoyance, and then pleasure as Mirage continued her lavacious assault with her tongue, nimble fingers working their way up and massaging his shoulders casing his massive bulk to relax against all common sense to stay ready and alert. He tried launching himself up and off the bed, but that only succeeded in in pushing Mirages face up his chest and brushing her maw against his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown furred feline didn't mix a beat as she nuzzled against his face in a fashion that a being without any real lips would imitate a kiss. The young former thief mind felt like it was fogging over in a pink haze as he felt the passion in her assault, the heat from her loins grinding against the stone elephant trunk in shredding pants and the powerful smells of lilac she was exuding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little disipointed Aladdin.\" Mirage said with mock anger. \"I was so sure you'd put up more of a fight. I didn't think I'd get you into my bed this easily.\" Aladdintried to glare at her, which would have been intimidating even for her, but for all he was feeling right now it was about as scary as a kittens. Even less so when he tried to command her to change him back, but only suceeded in groaning as he traced the front of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Mirage was not a mistress of magic for nothing, she could hear the stray wish to revert in amongst the cloud of growing desires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And risk losing you to that little girl? Never\" Mirage said smugly, punctuating her remark with another 'kiss'. \"Why would you want to return to being such a little boy? When your everything I want in a man.\" This time she lapped from collar bone to his chin. Causing him to release a moan that what enhanced by his uncontrollable purring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel everything starting to become a blur. Everything that didn't involve what Mirage wanted was fading away. Her smell, by all that was holy he'd never smelt anything so good in his life, and the thing she was doing to him. Her tongue alone was making him feel things Jasmine had never done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of him wanted so badly to flip her onto her back, mark her as his mate. To take her and make her feel so good she'd spend the next thousand years purring. The problem was that this part of him....was the majority part of him. He'd never wanted anything more than he wanted Mirage right now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screwed up his eyes and tried to wave away the fog of passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you! Jasmine! I want Jasmine\" he bellowed. Shaking the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that.\" Mirage said amused. \"Oh wait no I don't. Because its me you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Aladdin shook his head slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!,\" She moaned out. There was a tearing sound and what remained of the heros pants were destroyed. The feline deity reaching for her prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO DO...G! Guh...uh....UH!\" Aladdin's last thread of control broke away and any words he tried to say were swept aside as the fog started their final controls<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no choice my love. Give into your desires\" Mirage said seductively. Aladdin's hands slowly reached up and put themselves around Mirage. One to pull her waist closer, and another started to massage her ass. \"You want me. You need me.\" Her pace picked up as the rumbling in Aladdin's chest grew louder \"I'm your world. Your lover, your mistress, your everything.\" She moaned that out as the lion man pushed her head out of the way and lightly lapped at her neck \"We'll spend eternity together. Rule together, bring chaos together.\" He started pulling himself up and forwards as the masculine purr became a manly growl \"Have...kittens....tog....e...th!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off from the last two letters when, with a deep growl he bit into her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exploded in pure pleasure. Her breath hitched as far as it would and she went limp, falling back onto the bed....just as Aladdin flipped her onto her back, hovering over her like a looming shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she looked back up at had no trace of the boy that once was. All that remained was her Aladdin. Her mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be gentle.\" She suddenly whispered. Finding herself a little scared of the perfect mass of manhood she had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis response was to leap forward and tear her skirt to ribbons</span></div></div>",

Both of them laying on a large bed, only the silk like covers and their fur guarding their modesty, the endless rumble of thunder from outside harmonizing with the rumble in her chest and the deep masculine rumble in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer palace was an absolute mess. Everything was broken. Tables, chairs, the walls had deep gouges in them from claws. Their wasn't one solid thing in her dimension that hadn't been torn up in the whirlwind of their frantic passions. Even the bed was torn up, the sheets were so shredded they couldn't make up the scraps for a harem girls brassiere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lazily waved a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTables un-splintered, pages bound themselves back in leather covers, the bed they were laying on refilled with plush stuffing. Everything restored itself.....with the exception to the claw marks in the walls. Let that be a testament to their furious loving. She also left the sheets....because she liked the unrestricted view they gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh Chaos she was sore. She stretched her lithe body. Enhanced and built into her ultimate fantasy lover or not Aladdin was still mortal, and she didn't think a mere mortal could make her feel so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inched up, raising herself so her head was in the crook of his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir was a shifting and her massive love turned to look down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir was an instant in which she thought he'd 'come to his senses'. He'd through her off and try to race away to find a cure, only for her to catch up to him and seduce him resulting in another round of pure pleasure. So it was both a relief and saddening when instead he reached over with his other arms and pulled her up off the bed, onto his chest and started licked at her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooohhhh.\" She moaned. Looking down at him she saw him look up at her with a mischevious expression in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked back and reached down his chest and abs. The purring and human moaning turning into screaming and primal roaring not much later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He shoved one of his mighty mighty arms right into her face and threw the goddess of Evil of his chest.  His eyes turned to his furry arm and thick claws extending from his paw-like hand.  Looking down, he noticed his whole body was far from human.  His feet nearly hung off the end of the bed.  Rolling away from where Mirage was pushed to, he reached for the lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Aladdin, I should have known you would play hard to get,\" Mirage said with a smile.  Aladdin did not look at her.  He rubbed the lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry . . . Al .  . .\" came what sounded like Genie's voice, \"Too . . . tired . . . to , , ,  come  , , ,  out.\"  Aladdin could only shake when he felt Mirage touch his shoulders.  He threw himself forward, off the bed.  He landed on all fours but didn't make a sound as his massive form hit the hard stone.  His claws dug into the stone as easily as a hot knife into wax.  Mirage laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put them in a sleep spell.  It will disapate when the sun comes up, but tonight you are all mine,\" Mirage said.  Aladdin turned to face her and glared at her.  Mirage flinched just slightly under the powerful gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change me back,\" Aladdin growled.  He lifted himself upright and was taken back at how tiny Mirage looked.  Normally he was just above eye-level with her.  Now he doubted she came up past his large pectorals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear came to him as he realized Jasmine would be equally tiny compared to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do Aladdin.  The power chose you.  You cannot be rid of it that easily,\" Mirage said.  \"Besides, why would you want to return back to that runt of a boy?  You are so much a man now.\"  Aladdin's nose flared and he shuddered.  There was a scent of lilac in the air as Mirage came closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could smell her now.  He could smell Mirage and . . .  by the maker of all, she smelled intoxicating.  Part of him wanted so badly to take her, to bite her neck and lick the wound.  To make this feline his.  He felt a throbbing between his legs.  Oh, did this want to take Mirage so badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shut his eyes and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine!  I love Jasmine!\" he roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you can bring her with us.  I wouldn't mind a concubine,\" Mirage said with a chuckle.  Granted, she would break Jasmine by making her watch them have sex but no need to ruin the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Aladdin yelled.  He rushed to the door but found it locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, no door or window will let you pass through,\" Mirage said as he got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't submit.  I can get to the Tree of Renewal!\" Aladdin said.  Mirage just laughed some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This magic is beyond that tree.  It comes from an era before it.  You have no choice but to submit,\" Mirage said.  Aladdin looked to the wall next to him.  Then to his muscular body.   If he could make those marks in the floor, the wall should be noting.  Raising his hand, he slammed the wall and his hand went through.  Ripping open a wall, Aladdin ran into the dark hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even realize he was now on all fours.  He did not realize he moved with amazing grace, turning on the spot, and completely silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curses!\" Mirage grumbled.  She glared and readied herself to stop him.</span></div></div>",

Uncertainty came to the Jasmines faces as they looked around.  They saw each other and jumped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mirage!  What trick is this!\" Jasmines yelled.  Her face contorted once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My beast man wanted you, and now he can have you,\" Mirage's voice said.  \"But which is the real one?\"  Jasmines' faces returned.  They realized the situation and glared at the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am!\"  \"No I am!\"  \"Your the fake!\"  \"Stop lying!\" the Jasmines yelled at each other in perfect synchronization.  They turned to the other occupants.  \"Raja!  Aladdin!  It's me!  I'm Jasmine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaja felt confused.  He moved towards them slowly.  He kept an eye on both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the game Mirage?\" Aladdin asked.  The faces contorted once more as they looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite simple.  Pick the real Jasmine and and I will depart.  Fail to pick the right one and she is lost forever in darkness.  The only way she could escape is for you to give yourself to me, willingly.  You have until sun rise,\" Mirage's voice said.  Aladdin looked out the balcony and could see dawn's slow approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaja was close now to them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raja!\" the Jasmines yelled.  \"It's me Raja!\"  He looked back and forth and whimpered in confusion.  He wanted to attack the evil Mirage but couldn't tell them apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin walked slowly towards them.  Raja didn't come up to his knees.  The Jasmines didn't come up to his pectorals.  As he looked them in the eye, he searched for some hint, some tell that the one is not the woman he loved.  There was no mark, no tattoo, no physical means of knowing this woman wasn't Jasmine.  But he couldn't trust that anyway.  Mirage was a master of disguise.  He needed something else.  His chest expanded as he took in their scents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA field of fragrances filled his faculties.  Cinnamon, honey, and lilac came from the one on the right.  Cinnamon, honey, and roses came from the one on the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind flashed back to Mirage in his bedroom.  Her alluring scent was coated by lilacs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin smiled and was about to speak when his eyes fell on the Lilac-Jasmine.  As he bore into them, he felt a cold, emptiness inside.  It was buried deep but he could feel it there.  He turned his gaze to the Rose-Jasmine.  His eyes looked into hers.  She smiled, her beautiful smile as horror came to her double but Aladdin shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither of you are my Jasmine!\" Aladdin roared as the sun's warm rays fell into the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curses!\" Mirgae yelled from all around them.  The Jasmines shrieked as the sun struck them.  They turned black and melted into the ground.  Aladdin rushed past them and ripped off the curtains to the canopy bed.  There she lay, his Jasmine.  He let out a deep purr of happiness.  He leaned down.  His muzzle was larger as her head itself.  He wanted to kiss, but it turned into a lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine smiled.  \"Raja, I'm sleeping,\" Jasmine, his Jasmine, murmured.  Her topaz eyes fluttered open and looked into the eyes of the Lion Beast Aladdin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Aladdin?\" Jasmine whispered.  Aladdin nodded as he saw the woman he loved beneath him.  Her beauty, her love, her strength of character.  He could hear her heart begin to race.  She was accepting of his new body . . . No, she was amazed as the heart was beating so quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something was wrong.  A new pheromone came from Jasmine.  She was shaking. Jasmine pushed herself away from Aladdin.  She was terrified of him.  When she reached the other side of the bed, she rolled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Aladdin growled as he watched Jasmine's backside.  A long slender tail protruded out of her.  It looked like . . . A rat's tail.  Jasmine now stood behind the canopy curtains.  \"Jasmine, it's me.\"   She nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . .  I know Aladdin.  But when I look at you, I feel terrified,\" Jasmine replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chuckling came around them.  It wasn't Mirage's cold laugh.  It was a chortle with a voice the would-be happy couple dreaded to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is brilliant!\" came the voice of Chaos.  He melted into existence in the middle of Jasmine's bed.  \"Interesting.  Very interesting.\"  Aladdin controlled his anger.  He did not want the ire of this being.  It could make things far worse than they already are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have something to do with Mirage's latest plot?\" Aladdin asked calmly.  An annoyed look came to Chaos' eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Aladdin, think better of me.  I don't do the same play twice,\" Chaos said.  \"This was all Mirage.  And I must approve with her actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean my new form?\" Aladdin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are a bit too macho for my tastes,\" Chaos said, \"But yes.  The way she changed you is certainly unexpected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't expect you to tell us,\" Jasmine said quickly.  Chaos leered at Jasmine.  She looked upon him with some fear but confidence as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, rolling the die with that one,\" Chaos said.  \"Are you telling the truth?  Or is it a lie?  By telling me what you expect of me, are you hoping I do the opposite?  Hmmm.\"  He laughed again as he turned himself upside down.  \"I'll tell you.  Mirage put within you a deep prey mentality.  You look upon lion-boy and your instincts tell you to run.  A very chaotic way to destroy your love.  The rat tail, now that is pushing the line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And-\" Aladdin rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you ask, the magic fueling this spell comes from you Aladdin.  Away from you, Jasmine will be her normal self.  Around you, she risks wetting herself from fear,\" Chaos said.  He took in a deep breath as though there were a bouquet of roses.  \"I so love the smell of fear in the morning.  It brings out so much chaos.\"  Aladdin growled a little before he bowed his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for what you told us,\" Aladdin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, you roll the die,\" Chaos said.  \"Thanking me tends to bring unexpected results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assumed as much,\" Aladdin said.  The annoyed look returned to his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.  You did,\" Chaos said.  \"Well, as your life won't be boring anytime soon,  I'll leave.  Have fun with your new body Aladdin.  And remember, I'll be watching.\"  He vanished, leaving Aladdin and Jasmine in the room.  Aladdin fell to his knees, trying to make himself look smaller, less predatory.  He could see Jasmine shaking the curtains now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still love me Jasmine?\" Aladdin asked.  Jasmine nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do Aladdin.  I love you so much,\" her voice said as it shook.  \"It's . . . It's just I look at you and I feel such fear of you.\"  Aladdin's ears flattened as a forlorn look came to his eyes.  He looked at some point on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine looked at the man she loved.  She could see the pain this was causing him.  \"Aladdin,\" Jasmine whispered.  \"D-Don't move.\"  Aladdin didn't respond.  He didn't move as his love requested.    He didn't even follow her with his eyes. He didn't have to as he could hear her walking.  She was walking towards him.  Walking the circumference of the bed, she inched closer and closer.  Four feet away.  Three feet away.  Two feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He is the man I love.  He is suffering just as much as me.  We cannot let Mirage win.  He is the man I love . . .\"</i>  This thought repeated itself in Jasmine's mind.  With this mantra, she fought back against the powerful fear she felt.  Even as the fear grew with each inch closer, she pressed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaja kept quiet as well.  He seemed to understand the importance of this action.  He rested back near the damaged doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine pushed out her hand to the mountain of golden muscles.  His left arm was just inches away from her now.  Her hand was quaking from fear.  She could do it.  She could touch Aladdin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jasmine's eyes came into focus.   The gold blur shifted into a beast above her.  Its sharp teeth inches from her.  A deep growl made her almost too scared to act.  Then her scanning eyes noticed this beast had what all male beasts had.  And thankfully it was within range of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jas-\" the beast started to say when she kicked the beast.  She rolled away as she was deafened by a loud roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raja?!\" she called out as she raced to escape.  Her faithful tiger moved to be by her as the beast man fell between her and the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine,\" the beast man growled as he rubbed his sore spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin was at was with himself.  He knew Jasmine saw him as a beast first and attacked him to protect herself.  He knew it was perfectly acceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another part of him didn't.  The beast inside him, the part that wanted to take Mirage, roared in rage at this insult.  It wanted to show Jasmine who was the dominant force, who the leader of the pride was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Aladdin pushed back.  \"We will not harm her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWresting control and feeling his claws retract, Aladdin looked at the terrified princess.  Raja was standing between him and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother grumble from his beast about this interference was silenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine watched as the large lion beast fell on his knees.  Was he from that valley of animals?  What was he doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Jasmine demanded.  \"The guards will be here shortly.  I suggest you leave before you get killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine,\" the beast said, \"Please.  It's me!  It's Aladdin.\"  Shock came to Jasmine's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she whispered as the creature nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mirage wanted me as her plaything.  She turned me into her ideal figure,\" Aladdin said.  His eyes, more feline than he realized, looked at Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're Aladdin, then prove it,\" Jasmine said.  She watched his ears twitch at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I first met you in the market place.  You had given an apple to a small child and was caught for stealing.  I claimed you were my sister and not right in the head.  We pretended Abu was the Sultan,\" Aladdin recounted.  He laughed.  \"It went nearly off without a hitch until Abu bowed and dropped what he had stolen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine said nothing as those memories matched hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that meant nothing.  Mirage could make duplicates with such memories too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know my past with Aladdin,\" she conceded.  \"Raja, is it him?  Is it Aladdin?\"  Raja looked at the kneeling beast man and then to Jasmine.  He lowered himself and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee thanks,\" Aladdin muttered.  His ears twitched again.  Jasmine was right.  The guards were on their way.  He didn't want to fight them.  Not that he was scared they could win against him in this form, but what his inner beast would do to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wanted to assault Jasmine the woman he loved, then what would it do to the men who chased him for years and continued to loathe him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had one last thing to try.  Raising himself up to his feet, Jasmine took in his form in all it's power and authority.  His shoulders relaxed.  A familiar face showed through the furry muzzle as one giant hand extended palm up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you trust me?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine's eyes went wide.  She smacked herself but it wasn't a dream.  The pose was the same.  The words were the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aladdin?\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess?\" came not Aladdin's new voice but the voice of Razoul.  Looking passed Aladdin, she saw the captain of the guard standing there with sword drawn.  \"Princess!  Stand back!  We'll protect you!\"  He and his men charged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin let out a deep growl as he saw the men rushing at him.  He wanted to fight these men for this interuption.  But another part knew he couldn't.  He had to get out of there.</span></div></div>",

Jasmine rushed after him, screaming for the men to stop, for Aladdin to stop, for some help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRazoul was the first to meet the new Aladdin and looked up at the bipedal beast.  Before his sword could swing, he knocked the Captain of the Guards away like a bad date.  His men looked at him with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt good.  He should be feared.  He should be respected.  Moving before they could act, his swipes knocked them all down.  He let out a satisfied growl when his ears picked up rushing feet.  Two sets.  Turning around, his eyes saw Razoul throwing his sword at Aladdin.  The curved blade flying hard.  But Jasmine was running towards him as well.  The blade was close to striking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear fell over Razoul as he watched the princess come into his blade's path.  \"Princess!\" he called out in fear.  But then the beast man reached and pulled her in.  His muscular arms covered much of Jasmine's back.  The blade hit his skin and fell to the ground, clanging about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin let out a pained growl with the strike, like being hit with a stone.  He wanted to make sure Razoul couldn't get up when he heard Jasmine's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Aladdin!  Don't fight.  Don't hurt them anymore,\" Jasmine said firmly.  He looked down and saw the fiercely determined eyes of his love.  The beast stared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRazoul watched as the Princess stared down the beastman from within his arms.  His men began to rise and grab their weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  No!\" he called out.  His men looked at him and followed their orders.  They didn't want to be smacked around like that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin blinked and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When . . . When they attacked,\" Aladdin said.  Jasmine touched his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand Aladdin,\" Jasmine said.  \"Now, let's calmly explain what happened.\"  Aladdin nodded.  His arms retracted and Jasmine turned to face the captain of the guards.  \"Razoul,\" she said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, who is this?  What is going on?\" he asked calmly.  He could see the beast man's chest expanding with each breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Aladdin.  He was transformed by Mirage,\" Jasmine explained.  \"He . . .\"  She saw the blade on the floor.  \"Did you throw that at Aladdin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, but you ran in the way and he . . . he defended you.  It struck his arm,\" Razoul said.  Aladdin's eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I would protect her,\" Aladdin growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aladdin,\" Jasmine said firmly.  He nodded.  \"Let me see your arm.\"  Aladdin held out his powerful limb.  \"Razoul, I don't see a cut.\"  Razoul moved close carefully.  He looked at the golden fur and saw no cut, no scar, not even a blemish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither . .  Neither do I,\" Razoul said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mirage certainly wanted me strong,\" Aladdin said.  He turned to the door as the Sultan and his friends finally arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-Oh my!  What is going on here?\" the Sultan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin sat on Jasmine's bed as she spoke with her father and Razoul in the hallway.  He had to force himself to not speak up as he could hear their words.  He turned his head to Genie doing . . . Something.  He shifted into who knows what as Abu patted the beast man and then ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.  So you handled those guys with no effort at all?\" Iago asked as he came back from the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Aladdin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha!  I got it!\" Genie called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how to cure me?\" Aladdin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.  But the magic is powerful.  Way powerful.  Well beyond anything I could touch,\" Genie said as he took a hammer and tapped Aladdin.  \"I could no sooner undo this than make Iago a soft spoken gentle soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Iago screamed.  \"I have a good side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, usually when it is surrounded by gold,\" Aladdin noted.  He sighed and rose.  He walked to the balcony.  He looked down and saw something from behind the bushes.  A wisp of a familiar cloak.  \"Carpet?\" he called.  The magic rug came over and Aladdin got on.  And went no where.  Carpet shook in defeat and Aladdin looked down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of him was scared.  Part of him worried about injuring himself.  But the beast wasn't.  The beast knew this was nothing.  The beast told him it would be safe.  Growling, he jumped over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body acted on its own.  His knees bent landed on the ground with a solid thump and small dent.  He rose no worse for the fall and looked up.  Iago, Abu, and Genie looked at him with slacked jaws.  Carpet flew over them and was coming down.  Jasmine was on top.  Aladdin turned to the bushes and walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old man with white hair, brown cloak and brown sash covering his head.  The blind seer being waited still as a statue.  He turned only as Jasmine arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day Aladdin,\" Fasir said.  \"I see you are well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a beast,\" Aladdin noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of the body.  Not of the soul,\" Fasir replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fasir, please.  Do you know how to help Aladdin?\" Jasmine asked.  The seer looked in her direction and them approached Aladdin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin watched the man approach and felt something odd.  He felt fear.  The beast within saw Jasmine and wanted her passionately.  The beast saw Razoul and wanted to harm him.  To feel fear because of this man just added to the mystery of who he was and what he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  The magic that changed you is ancient . . . and no cure without wholly exists,\" Fasir said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jasmine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mirage used a spell to reflect the victim's soul.  Aladdin's spirit is strong, fierce, but loyal and caring.  He became this.  This is his soul unleashed.  There is no means to change it without changing who Aladdin is within,\" Fasir explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then . . . what about something to give me the appearance of a normal person?\" Aladdin asked.  \"Even being this tall would allow me to pass as normal.\"  Fasir said nothing for a moment.</span></div></div>",

It used to be ruled by a cruel wizard named Destane, whom Mozenwrathwas apprenticed to, until Mozenrath turned him into a mamluk and took over. It's implied to be due to him being possible abusive, as no one shows any issue with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you think too much about it, it makes seem sense as Mozenwrath's evil and hate was never really directed at Aladdin, unlike any other villain in the show. Aladdin was normally just in the way. <br>\r\nHeck, his first appearance all Mozenwrath dose is release a monster because he's curious what Aladdin could do, and then they just talk. The end of the episode leaves Mozenwrsth unable to understand why Aladdin would save his friends over money. This could be typical Saturday-morning-villain stuff. But it could also be from a combination of a hard life and a harder life under his implied-abusive former-master; The man was turned into a zombie, so he must've been bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for how the two could be brothers still without Aladdin knowing. Fannon either explains it as Aladdin being too young to remember  (If he was a street rat for as long as he claims at some point someone had to taking care of him), or they explain \"Mozen\", as being a half-brother by Kasim.</span></div></div>",

With a thought, he had the girls surrounding him pull their fans around him giving him a few moments of solitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny version of the big blue lug popped in, in front of him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have been a little slapdash for the sake of the show. Let's get you fixed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin nodded as best as he could with his pecs pushing up against his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie cracked his knuckles, rolled up his wrists and shot his master again. He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body evened out. The mass of bulging muscles didn't shrink in the slightest, but everything else about him grew. His legs lengthened and bulked up, his hands which looked tiny on his huge forearms swoll up like sponges. His neck widened and shot up so his jaw wasn't smashed up against his giant pecs. His jaw which grew wider, stronger. Manlier<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go, all better. OK girls open em up again!\" He told the fangirls before zipping out the back and sliding down Abu's back flintstones style without being noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shouts of adoration and praise came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a vengeance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin looked around trying to keep the confusion off his face. Women in the crowd looks grew more intense, even the girl's genie had popped into existence to surround him withs smiles grew bigger. It took him a second to realize they were no longer on eye level with him. He looked down and saw that his royal garb now tented more in the front than it had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie hadn't 'fixed' him the way he thought. Instead of returning his chest and arms to normal, he'd made everything else bigger! He was huge! A giant mass of muscle! He had to be close to two heads taller than he had been! His head was no longer squashed into his chest because his neck was now longer and as thick as a bulls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin looked over himself. At least foot taller or maybe even more. Suddenly Razoul the head guards large and burly physique no longer intimidated him. He had a sneaking suspicion he might just tower over the man now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back up at the genie on the balcony with the three beauties. There was a time they'd never give him the time of day. That their interest was only for those that could provide for them. Now looking at him with the same level of adoration as the crowd, along with such blatant lust at least one of the triplets was sending him hand signals about what she would do with him if he was here for her and not Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, what good were these muscles if he didn't put on a show with them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking he looked up at genie in his harem drag and put out his arms. Getting the message he let the girls 'slip' over the balcony and fall to the crowds gasp. Only to cheer when the three all landed in the prince's big strong arms. Sweeping them up in his arms like a buxom bouquet of roses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept that noble smile firm on his face as they woke up with shock then quickly attached themselves to him so tightly they all but told him they never intended to leave his side ever again. One grabbing his melon-sized biceps and pushing her own melons against it. Her sister crushing herself tightly against his back while wrapping her arms around his neck to keep her from slipping, and the one in red sitting in his lap, tilting her head all the way back to look at him the same expression oh so many men in the past had looked up at her with, grinding her backside into him ever so slightly while doing so and cooing. Continuing to sing about how wonderful and handsome and amazing prince Ali is. All while the crowd cheered and cheered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could only keep the grin he'd had on his face the entire procession as the people are both real and created continued to sing the praises of the Handsome, generous, adventurous, muscular Prince Ali......not noticing the princess turn back into her room in disgust as the display of womanizing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maurice was hardly what you would call a simple man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was known as the town nut job due to his passion for bizarre inventions, this year for example he had devised an automated wood chopping machine that wouldsave the time and effort of a person to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was on version 24 after the last 23 exploded. He had a good feeling about this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also a very sad man, his beloved wife had past away 20 years ago, his beloved Marie who was once known as the vilage beauty, fighting off boys with a stick had chosen to marry him. Most likly because unlike the other men who tried to impress her with their dashing looks, great fortunes and countless gifts he won her over with her true love, books. Something she shared with her daughter was an unnatural love of books and knowledge. Something unusual for the rest of the village. He was able to earn her love by enjoying everything about Marie, her mind, her humour, her wit and not just her looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been struck down the night Belle was born, she had just enough strength to name their daughter before passing away, lossing to much blood in the birthing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats when the problems started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been angry, he had been furious. He left Belle with the midwives and rode off into the forest in a fury. He rode for what seems like forever before he almost ran into an elderly woman in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe normally would had apologised but the fury and grief he had been experiancing was all consuming, instead of an apology he snarled at the woman for being in his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had not been the best thing to do considering she immediatly turned into a beautiful enchantress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enchantres had been prepared to cast ahorrible curse of Maurice when she stopped and looked deep within him. This was not the same type of man she was used to dealing with, this was a broken hearted man who was angry from grief. She could not smite someone for being sad, but this man did still need to be punished less him grief consume him and destroy his live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he cast a spell, a spell that would force him to live the life he was previously about to abandon. The man was unaffected, but his daughter, his Belle....became a beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl grew several inchs in mass and sported fur from head to toe, her nose became a black button and she sprouted fangs and claws. Her cries urned to growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaurice asked on his knees why she would punish the baby and not him. The enchantress replied that changing him would only make him sink deeper into his grief, but changing his daughter would force him to live if but for her sake, and for all his anger towards the baby girl the enchantress knew he would not abandon her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the day he had truely accepted and forgiven his daughter and himself then Belle would remain a beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have put a timer on it like she did the prince but it would have been excessive to force a man in greiving to love who he felt killed his wife like she forced a spoiled noble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears later Maurice had kept his word. He had stayed and raised Belle, he had bribed the midwives with gold to keep them quiet and brought his daughter up in seclusion. Never permitting her to leave the house. It was a horrible chore to bring up such a girl. Since she was several inch's taller than a normal he had to hand make all her cloths so that the villagers did not need wonder why he also bought womens cloths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started raising a few animals so itt would not look unnatural to buy so much food at market, the girl at quite a bit more than he, which was why he bought the cow for when she was young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheyre had been a few close calls, her mothers curiouslity had led Belle to try and leave the house more than a few times but so far no villagers with torches and pitchforks had turned up at his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been difficult but Maurice had raised his daughter into a fine and very intelligemnt young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be the first time he had left her on her own for so long, but he needed to show his invention at the fair if he wanted to make any money he needed for a new home. It was getting increasingly  difficult for Belle, he and the animals to live in their small house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Belle while I'm gone what are you going to do?\" The short man said to the enormous girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't leave the house dad.\" Belle said in a tone that suggested she had heard it a thousand times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt twenty years old Belle was a giant of a woman, standing a head taller than even the tallest man in the village Gaston. Despite having the strength of a bull she was not overly muscular, in fact she had roughly the same build as her mother, the same face if you look past the fur, fangs, nose, pointed ears and two small curved horns on her head. She wore a blue dress with white blouse underneath, the back of her dress tented slightly in the back for her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why shouldnt you leave the house?\" He pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* Because theyll chase me down like I was a monster. I've heard it a thousand times dad.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a thousand times youve ignored me.\" Her father admonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you blame me?!\" She went over to a window and threw open a wooden shutter. \"Look at that dad, a whole world just waiting for me to see it but you wont let me! I'm bored out of my mind, I can't stay here forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaurice sighed and patted hisdaughter in comfort. \"Belle, you know you cant leave the house. The villagers are 'still' talking about the monster that turned up in town several years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was 8 and wondered were you went.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belle.\" He said with a raised voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wont leave.\" She said in a hurt voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl.\" He said and turned to the door, hefting a large sack behind him. \"I'll hopefully be back within a week. Take care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye dad, love you.\" She called to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good bye Belle.\" He called back, leaving the last part of his daughters call unanswered before closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle sank down into a nearby chair, her golden retreiver Montague walking up and placing his head on her lap for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle looked down at the dog her father had gotten her for the lonliness. \"Dont worry Monty, he's only going to be gne for about a week. We'll manage til then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh how wrong she was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, Belle was currently outside of her home, despite promising Maurice to stay inside their home and not wander off. Fortunately, she kept her distance from the village, treading through the open fields on the village outskirts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the curiosity she inherited from her late mother, she wandered into a beautiful valley, overlooking the open landscape, taking in the fresh outdoor air. From there, she picked up a flower near her feet, using her lithe paw-like hands to gently grab the gentle plant by the stem, sniffing it's aroma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she felt relieved to go outside, Belle couldn't help but feel like wanting to be....accepted by the village residents. After all, the memory of her father telling about what caused her to become like this was still fresh in her mind after all these years, as she exhaled a somewhat depressed sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she then heard the sound of a panicked bragging horse rushing toward her, as it was revealed her father's horse Phillipe, still pulling the loaded cart behind him when he galloped out of nowhere in a panicked state. But what made Belle greatly concerned was that her father wasn't with the frightened stallion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Belle sprung up onto her paw-like feet, stopping Phillipe since she was just a few inches shorter than the horse, causing Phillipe when he recognized Belle. \"Phillipe! What are you doing here? Where's.... Where's Papa?\" She said, her voice sounding more concerned with each second, as she gently calmed Phillipe down. From there, Phillipe looked back at the beastly female before him, where Belle asked, \"Where is he, Phillipe? What.... What happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming more distressed about her missing father, Belle quickly turned her head back toward her home for a brief moment before resolving to go and search for Maurice, uncoupling the wagon behind Phillipe while she replied, \"We have to find him, you have to take me to him.\" Belle then quickly hopped up onto Phillipe's back, holding onto the reins with her paw-like digits, giving the physical commands for the stallion to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===============================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time of searching the vacant woods for signs of her father, Belle and Phillipe made their way through the dirt forest trail. Thankfully, her physical affliction gave her a few useful perks, one of which being an enhanced sense of smell and being able to see we'll in the darkness. Picking up the scent trail of her father, Belle and Phillipe stopped in front of what appears to be a large stone castle wall, completely with a pair of large iron fate doors, and a massive castle on the other side of said gates, all while surrounded by a forest of dead tree's and dog outside of the castle stone walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foreboding atmosphere made Belle feel....uneasy about the area she was currently located in, slowly looking around and asking herself, \"....What is this place?\" But then, Phillipe started to panic a little, snorting and beginning to buck, almost as if something was scaring him. However, in an attempt to put the horse at ease, Belle discounts herself off of Phillipe, comforting him as she said, Phillipe, please, steady. Steady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after calming down the unnerved stallion, Belle approached the decrepit gates, pushing them open with little difficulty due to the rust of the gates hinges, causing this rusting screeching sound to erupt from opening the gates. Once she opened the gates, Belle quickly took notice of the hat belonging to Maurice, lying of the cobblestone ground. Out of worry, she picked up the hat with both paw-like hands, where she then whispered, \"Papa....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the evidence, Belle could only come to a conclusion that something's happened to her father, and that he tried to find refuge inside the vast castle standing before her. Left with no other choice, Belle knew that in order to find Maurice, she had to enter inside the castle, unaware of who and what exactly were residing within  the castle and it's hallways.</span></div></div>",

Looking up and down the barely humanoid claay form of what was supposed to be his dream girl, but due to not yet downing anything more complex than bowls and pots in class at the moment she wouldn't give one of Hades living skeletons the proverbial boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know what I was thinking when I did this. Guess it's true sometimes you need a second opinion right.\" He asked himself....who was standing tweo feet away from him admiring his masterpiece with Icarus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been all two easy for Hercules to walk back through time once he'd awakened his infinite powers. Time was like a moving wall you could never move by that ever pushed you foward, for Hercules the wall didn't just reverse it formed an archway for him to step through comfertably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all at his disposal he could do whatever he wanted, have anything he wanted, whoever he wanted......except.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could totally have made her love him again. Heck he could have turned the female population of Greece into a harem of vivacious vixens with beauty that surpassed even the love goddess herself, but it wasn't worth it. He might have been a hormonal teenage boy with the power to literally 'get all the girls' but the hero inside him nagged at him telling him something over and over that prevented him from acting like Adonis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Earn it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she'd made it clear she wasn't interested in him after the whole 'crazy about me' debaucle so a second chance was out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf so then he'd just have to make a better first impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched Aphrodite arrive and shape the sculture with her own power, turning it from a lump two few milleenia early to be called 'modern' instead of 'ugly' and into a vision of feminine beauty. Of course he couldn't help but assist in the changes. The pink skinned blonde deity raised an eyebrow slightly when the statues bust was noticably curvier than she intended when the embarressed boy asked, the chest easily bigger than she'd thought it would be or the hips so wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules grimanced when his past suplicate just said to make the girl crazy about him. Aphrodite rolled her eyes but complied and breath life into her. Giving birth to Hercules's perfect girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime slowed down as Galatea opened her eyes for the first time, freezing before she could take in the world around her. The unfrozen version of the son of Zeus floated up behind the pedastal she was on brushing some of her chocolate brown and velvet soft hair from her ear and whispered into it like an old lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost the chance at perfection once and I 'm not losing you again so listen carefully.\" He took her frozen hand, still cold as clay under his touch. \"You are flesh and blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe porcelian skin under his hand changed as she became more than a semblance of life. The coolness of her skin faded to be replaced by the warmth of a limb with blood pumping through it, he felt her fingers ill with bone and muscle where there had only been painted earth. He even felt the warmth from her face as his intoxicating voice sent a spark of pleasure racing down her spine despite being frozen in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not crazy about Hercules. He is not the end all and be all of your existance. You have a life, you have free will. You have a choice.\" He whispered to her seductivly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe speed up time around her and only her just enough to feel her reaction to him and could immediatly see the tell tale signs of arousal. Heightened breath, a spreading blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Galatea you may not be crazy about him but you can't say you don't have feeling for him. He's a great guy and did just have you brought to life. You could definetly see yourself going out with him, loving him, marrying and raising a family with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm smile spread across her face ever so slowly. The words forming images of just as the almighty Hercules described.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will give him a chance to prove that he's a man worthy of his dream woman. And if he isn't...we'll it's his lose.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now leap of this stand and give him a kiss so strong he won't think twice about toppling the gods themselves to prove himself to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made to leap but froze back into her original position when he took his hand from her. Touching the ground again he moved behind his weaker past self and whispered into his ear with far less seductive tact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOVE HER! Prove yourself to this woman. Prove that you deserve the girl of your dreams. She's the best thing that could ever happen to you so don't blow it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis doubles expression slowly morphed from obvious lust to deeper adoration for the vison lunging as slowly as a slug at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmighty Herc smirked and backed away before letting time resume. Enjoying the scene as himself as Galatea knocked him onto his back and gave him the deepest and most senous kiss he'd ever remember having. Calling it a present for having her brought to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimate Herc turned around and walked back through the veils of time to the present day. Eager to see how this change effected his future</span></div></div>",

Idly drawing circles on his chest with her finger while the boy leaned back, his eyes half open and a dopey grin on his lips. His sight registering only her, his nose filled with the scent of lilacs and roses and his mind full of hearts and pink fog, none of which were caused by magic either mortal or divine. If someone looked at the two you'd be hard to guess who was controlling who. Hercules may have gained the unwavering love of the most beautiful goddess on olympus, but she had gained the unthinking love of the most powerful being in existance who was quite willing to rip the universe to pieces and stict it back together into any shape she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA power she was willing to take advantage of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA power she 'had' taken advantage of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seat Hercules sat upon wasn't just a seat. It was a throne that the people had constructed for him to fit into his city sized palace. They needed a place to rule the now united Greece from after all. So much easier for her to do her job when she didn't have to remember what culture sacrifices what or what passes for divine miracles or apocyliptic signs since they all had the same culture and worsipped the same two beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed contentedly and lay her head on his shoulder as a royal messanger entered the throne room. Bowing at the base of the hundred steps that raised the all powerful couple above all others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My king.\" He said in a deep barintone voice that sent shivers up and down the blonde deitys spine, making her glad she had Hercules give it to every man in Greece. \"I bring word from the battle at the Spartan borders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This had 'better' be good news\" She said impatiently. Sitting up and reluctantly taking her hand away from her kings chest and putting it on her hip. Her eyes narrowed promising punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe messenger gulped. \"They are.....pushing us back my liege. Your armys are not enough to enter the war gods land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't sit to well with the love goddess \"Ares!\" She growled. She turned back to the omnipotent teen, still in a dreamy gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hercules.\" She said in a pitiful voice, her eyes brimming with crocodile tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whasthmttr? (Whats the matter?)\" He sounded worried, the kind of worried that you get at 3am when you've got school in the morning and your trying to finish a paper your not even half way done writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ares won't let our love into Sparta.\" She pressed herself against him, he moaned predictably while she whispered in a seductive low voice into his ear. \"Our armies need for power, much, much more power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrpwr. (More power)\" He whispered. His eyes glowed for a moment and with power beyond any gods his loves wish became reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the borders of Sparta,  soldiers battling the massivly muscled warriors suddenly felt a great warmth wash over them, and before the eys of the warriors born and breed the smaller men grew to massive proportions. Each and every man on the field a hulking 15 foot giant with a muscular build rivaling Atlas, theyre armour as thick as a wall as stone and their swords now massive sabres as wide as an oak trees and as sharp as a crack of lightning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spatrans looked up, and up at the now hulking army. One particular soldier summing up his situation rather nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAphrodite was pleased as she saw the battle turn to her lopves favour, now it was only a matter of time before Sparta was theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job sweety.\" She said while planting light kisses across his cheek while twirling his hair in her fingers. \"And thanks for the puppy....\" The eternally infatile canine on her own lap powerless as she scratched behind it's ears. \"...Hopefully she'll be a better pet than he was a messenger.\"</span></div></div>",

Right now her entire focus was being directed into one point, and could not afford to drop her guard one iota.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassandra dear....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne slip up could cause her to fall into madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, Cassy sweey....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightest faulter and she'd fall into a pit so deep she'd never escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassy.....Cassandra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She spared what little brain power she wasn't concentrating ont her task to ponder how she would sleep toni.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CASSANDRA!!!\" Her mother yelled in a rare loss of compusure and shook her daughter shoulder and breaking her concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it moooooooo........!!!\" By the time she realised she'd let her guard down it was to late, and by the swirling green of her eyes her parents could tell she was having a vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough they didn't realise it was less 'having' and more 'being dragged into one'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================<br>\r\nCassandra's vison<br>\r\n==================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman one the massive silk laden bed was stunning beyond belief. As though the goddess of love had a long lost mortal twin. She was naked bar the opulant sheets she was just barely holding over her near godly figure, her irresistable eyes drawn to the rooms entrance as an adonis that made Adonis look like Icarus walked in. She drank every inch of this perfect specimen in from the tips of his toes to a face even an amazon would turn to jelly upon seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grew warmer and warmer, her breath growing more lustful as this perfect man reached the bed and started crawling up it. She lowered herself down onto it and nearly moaned when she felt the man who she knew was her husband crawling up her her sides, pinning her in place until his face was level with her own. Her long beautiful purple hair lay in all directions framing her heart shaped face adorably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey gazed adoringly into each others eyes for who knows how long before she reached up with perfect hands and drew his head in for a love filled kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...*hufff* Hercules. I love you so much\" She started to moan as hi hands were no longer just a her sides but tracing them, slowly removing the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you two Cassandra.\" He said with full sincerity before flinging the cover from the bed and......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n .....Picking up a large fruit dessert and hitting herself in the face with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents stared for a moment before her father spoke up. \"You know Cassy in this house we have dinner first, then dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl didn't respond to the question.

They were dating, they were married, they were in love. She'd seen this 'other' version of herself being won over by this godlike being as he woe'd her in every way possible. She'd seen him take her on dozens of dates and commit hundreds of unbelievably romantic acts which left the normally dark girl feeling as light as a feather. However when she thought about them she knew it didn't make any sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't in love with Hercules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules wasn't in love with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no intention of marrying him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no intention of marrying her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules while strong was scrawny and underdeveloped. Not some physcially perfect he-man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe most certainly did not look like a mortal verson of Aphrodite with a better figure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these things were true and self evident.....but so was something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My visions are never wrong.\" She said in grim defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich meant in what looked o be the near future given how young the two in her vision looked she would become fantastically hot, and she and Hercules would marry and be extremlu happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have contemplated more.......but her eyes began to swirl and once more she fell into a trance. She fell back into her bed and her body began to sleep while she was fed tales of the future. This time of her in a spacious country mansion, reading to an adorable infant with blue eyes and purple hair while her husband played with their other children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that far from the home.....right outside it in fact Hercules watched the girl 'dream', then with a twitch of his fingers sent a tiny spark racing towards her were a light blue form enveloped her form and then vanished, leaving behind nothing more than a tiny fraction of a percent of growth on the girls figure. Her hips not even marginally wider and her bust only a 20th on a centimetre bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll grow into it.\" He muttered before lowering himself away from the window and with speed beyond flight was back on Phils island without the merest hint of detection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't understand quite why he'd decided he wanted Cassandra to be his future wife, or why he felt the need to make the girl look like the inside on an adult scroll (or himself if you could tell he was alightly more muscular than before.) but he guessed that whoever granted him these above god-like powers was responsible. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. It wasn't like he was forcing it upon her. The visions would only come true if she believed she couldn't change her fate, and he'd undo the babeificaion if she made attempts to undo ir stop it.......for now though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air shimmered in front of him for a second as he lay down and tarted to watch the girls dreams, continuing where it had been left of before she'd snapped out of it with that pie t the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Chin in his other hand with a bored expression on his face as he stared at the girl in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.\" He said in the tone that's generally reserved for talking about the weather. \"You feeling alright Cassandra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?

Especially during the height of summer, and especially especially in the middle of the afternoon when Apollo had the sun hanging directly overhead. So not only would it be odd for someone to wrap themselves in enough animal furs to hide everything from their soles to their scalp from view, it would also be extremely uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe all powerful demi god watched another pitcher of ice water disipear into wear the oracle in trainings mouth would be. Several empty ones scattered around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a cold. I'm dehydrated.\" Was her unusually swift reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again that's probably from the furs. I think your hands leaving more sweat on......did you do something to your fingers?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands shot back into the furs. Hiding them from the demi gods view. Just like the rest of her was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he needed to see. Hercules knew exactly what was happening under those skins and he couldn't say he wasn't pleased with the results. While it was far to soon to say the oracle perspiring to death in front of him was a beauty beyond Aphrodite or even Helen yet, she would definetly get a second glance when she walked down the street. Her figure was already noticabley fuller than it had been. Her face was no longer as long and had filled out more along with her lips. Her hair was growing faster than normal and had already started to develop a curl that would one day transform itself into the pinnacle of style and lustrous perfection that girls from all over Greece would try to copy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally he had half expected her to just give in and jump into his arms by now. By now besides the occasional vision of diaster Cassandra should have been seeing visions of how happy they'd be together almost constantly. This girl had insane willpower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill it was only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...Hercules. I need....need...\" Said the beautifying girl, her voice cracking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There we go.' \"Need what Cass?\" He asked, having to use his powers to keep from giving anything anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need...your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Say no more Cassandra.

A week of thinking on how she could prevent this future, a week of thinking if she even should fight this future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a week...and....she had come to her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked towards their usual lunch table. Her cheeks burned when she knew boys were staring at her backside, which had been steadily growing larger and fuller for the past seven days, shift from side to side in an enticing manner she could not stop moving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly wasn't the fastest transformation in the history of ever but it was steady and quite unstoppable. She'd went to every temple, mystic, soothsayer and more experienced oracle she could, but they all said the exact same thing, that she was going to become the most beautiful woman in tall of history. THat got her withering looks from a few of the seers who'd lost their looks for their powers. Why couldn't she be ugly or crippled like the rest of them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to healers, alchemists and even doctor Hypocrites. However none of them could stop her cheeks from getting fuller, her legs longer or her bust bigger. She wasn't the most attractive girl in the world...yet, but given what she saw in her visions that was only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the table quickly. The area oddly empty of others, even Icarus who she was amazed hadn't been seen for the same amount of time as she'd been changing. The twerp probably had something to do with this, like a love potion that got her to feel for the wrong person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo the only person she could actually see was Hercules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed involentarily, licking her lips without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hercules.\" She called to him while walking towards the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned round, her mouth went dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like her the red head was undergoing his own change. His toga was  tighter since new muscle mass stretched the material further, his arms were thicker and no longer stick like. His dreamy eyes deeper and she could feel his lips draw her....NO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I am NOT turning into some vapid BIMBO!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cassy.\" He greeted, and she noted his voice was a touch deeper and more manly \"You seen Icarus around anywhere? I haven't seen him all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The creep is probably watching from afar.' She thought bitterly. Sitting down she took a deep breath \"Hercules. I....I need to talk to you about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Cassy. You can tell me anything.\" He smiled and moved closer to her. Heat started to rise from her but she suppressed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that is...I've sort of been getting these visions....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, huh.\" She motioned for her to go on, even though she was feeling increasingly more agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. It's sort of about you....and me.\" She whispered the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right I understand!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" at was a relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's some monster coming to get you for your powers and you need me to stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnew it couldn't be easy \"No Hercules I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Cassandra. With the hero son of Zeus protecting you nothing bad is going to happen to you.\" He pushed his chest out more and took her by the hand. Her heart felt like butterflies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no Hercules I don't.\" Whatever she wanted to say died on her lips from what he did next. Caught in his own heroic fantasy Hercules pulled her closer to him, draping her over his arm while holding her protectively to his iron hard chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though monsters and demons and the whims of the gods themselves nothing will stand in the way of keeping you safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. Her nerves were shot. She couldn't form a sentence to save herself, and the heat that was building up inside her had all but exploded. \"Ah to Hades with it.\" She said flatly before reaching up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through fire and thunder and...Cassy what are you MMPH!\" He would have kept going but the plumping feminine lips sealed over his own prevented that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra circled her arms around the back of Hercules head to deepen their intimacy. The boy only took a few second to realise what was going on before lowering his arms to the base of her back and pulling her even closer to him. He sat on on the table were she pulled him down on top of it. Never stopping their make out session at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra was lost in a haze of pure delight. Her guard lower than it had ever been but the visions did not come, they left her to feel consumed the the explosion of pleasurable heat that came the second she touched her lips to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules gazed down at the girl who couldn't meet his gaze since either eyes were rolled back into her skull and mentally smiled. She lasted longer than he thought she would. Slowly he lowerd his hands down onto her rear where he could definetely feel it growing beneath his palms<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His every movement followed by a certain blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe imagined him getting up, not to walk over the the board but to her.

Her breath was ragged, she'd inspired Hypocrites to invent dentistry and try as she might to suppress it she was .................really, really horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike seriousy...................yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she managed to carry on. Barely. Her willpower was holding on my a thread and held down only by the fact she had been avoiding Hercules all this time. Making sure to that he wasn't even in the same area as her or at their closest on the other side of the hall and surrounded by at least half a dozen friends to act as a barrier. Fearing just one encounter with the demi-hun urk, demi-god would put her over the edge. Anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been running late for History. She'd dropped her scrolls and had sent the friends she'd been walking with ahead of her. The stern Mr Herodotus would be more forgiving if only she turned up late after all. Leaving her all by her lonesome in the emptying halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came running around the corner, like her being afraid he'd be late for class and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bumped into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled for a step and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\" He apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least thats what she thought he did. She didn't actually hear what ever it was he said. The snaping of her last restraint was too loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never finished the sentence before she'd jumped him. A flying tackle that ended up with the hottest girl in school's face attached to his like a limpet while her legs wrapped around his abs refusing to let go. Unable to remove her and his more sensible brain funtions halting for the moment Hercules stumbled into a nearby janitors closet with the girl still attached. It was fortunate this tiny room was here or Helen might have been desperate enough to make this Disney adaptation more like classic myth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling one hand free for a moment she reached up and pulled a single pin from her tighly styled hair. Letting it fall down and a wave of brilliant blonde spill across her back. Practically covering the couple in a golden sheet as Helen of troy claimed the lips of the demi gods over and over and over. Each kiss more hungry and passionate than the last. Her perfect legs wrapping around his middle as slim fingers pulled his face as tightly against hers as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marry me.\" She said between kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\" He said with the typical cracking voice of a gangly teenage boy who had the prettiest girl in school trying to suck his tonsils out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marry me!\" She kissed him harder. He could feel her robes starting to slip as she pushed herself against him like a cat. No, like a lion in heat. Her honey locks whipping around. \"Marry me! Love me! Kiss me! Touch me! Fill me with our kids! F**KING F**K ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah he wasn't really expecting her to act on those visions so fast or so hard. Not really ready for it either. So despite the frantic lips smacking against his own or the frenzied hands running the gambit between trying to find somewhere to latch onto and where to pull open his toga he was actually far to nervous to feel what other men would be feeling right now..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen I'm flattered but don't you think you're going to fast? I mean shouldn't we at least date fiMMPHH!!!\" He was of course silenced by a pair of lips pushing hard enough against his own to cut them against his teeth. Seems like his little stunt worked too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! NO DATING! NO WAITING! I NEED YOU NOW! RIGHT NOW!\" He gasped when when she tried reaching under his clothes, forcing him to grip the bottom of his modesty only for her to use that opening to shot up and tear the straps over his shoulder leaving him bare chested. He groaned deeply as he felt her fingers draw over his muscles and circle around his man-nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stop thinking about you! Your in my every dream, my every waking fantasy. Now I can't even blink without seeing us together. I see us being together like it's out of the most romantic fables. Spending each day pushing oue love for each other to new heights. And each night rutting like filthy animals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird to hear the sweetest and most polite girl in school speak like this. If Tempest spoke like this it'd be hot. Kind of off putting from the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen visions of us married. Married! Can you picture it? Because I've had the image burned into my mind for weeks! Wed in the temple of Zeus. Your father performing the ceremony himself with all the gods of Olympus as guests. We'll live in a house bigger than any palace were we will never want for anything. We'll have scores of servants, and maids, and cooks enough to feed a village. Great pools and huge garden for our kids to play in!\" She tears up a little between now gentle kisses and looks up into his eyes with unparalleled affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our kids Hercules. Our beautiful litle girls and handsome little men. I can remember all of their names and faces well enough I could paint them. Their likes and dislikes. Hopes and dreams, and-and-and how much they love each other and us! Their mommy and daddy.\" She pulled herself as tight as possible to the beyond godly demi-god. Pushing her bosom hard enough into his chest that he could feel every inch of the inviting flesh through the loosening fabric, and her smooth bare legs close tighter around his middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're waiting Hercules. Waiting to be born. For us to bring them into the world. Their mother and father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed him again. Despite the sheer difference in strength Hercules felt the power in his legs give out and Helen pushing him up against the wall. Her kiss was no longer starving and desperate but hungry and gentle. His nerves only grew as she guided his hands to rest on her leg and waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help them, my sweet hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started guiding his hand she placed at her waist up. Her voice filled with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Which as far as anyone's memories including her own, she hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules looked at the ceiling before letting out a cross between a sigh and a groan. Backing up against the wall and lowering himself to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was nothing like what he expected. He thought he was steering things so she'd develop feeling for him. Slowly getting more forward as they developed a relationship over months and years until they could say they were in love. Instead what he got was an obsessed love freak who was demanding a boy she'd never been more than a casual friend with to make a baby with her right now. He just meant to nudge her so it happened naturally. Not...not...'order' her to love him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he weren't a hero in training he wasn't sure he'd be able to or even want to resist her demands. However he 'was' a hero in training so all it made him do was feel guilty for essentially brainwashing her. What in the underworld had he been thinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been thinking he'd get the prettiest mortal girl in all of Greece to be his girlfriend. That's what he'd been thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed again and kept staring at the ceiling. Fingers on his lips as he went over the kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss had been great. Fantastic. As far as physical reactions go he loved every part of having Helen in his arms. As far as his conscience went however he just felt dirty. The bad kind of dirty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just wanted a girlfriend.................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phil was right.\" He groaned \"Just because I can do anything.....doesn't mean I can do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis trainer had warned him about being reckless with his power. He'd trained his fair share of hero's who thought they could just solve all the problems of the world by hitting them hard enough, only to get taken down by some shmuck who hit even harder than them. Or wave a sword. Or shoot enough arrows. Or through enough men at it. A guy whose only solution to a problem is to attack without a strategy is a guy who wanted to board Charon's boat ASAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't really thinking about the nuances of what he wanted with Helen. He just wanted her to want him more and more as time went on. Clearly he'd been to general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still wanted Helen. He was still a boy who knew she existed after all just like any other teenage boy in Greece. He just wanted a girlfriend first, and he wanted it to be 'real'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK so....what do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if...he....?</span></div></div>",

He tried again. Picturing in his mind time doubling back on itself. Helen reappearing in class not remembering being in a closet with him. Forgetting all the......the brainwashing. Forgeting the love he'd pushed onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was brought out of his intense focus by the sound of metal hitting the floor and realised Helen had removed the symbol of Zeus that Hercules used to keep his Toga up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the girls busy hands. Idly willing his clothes not to fall off as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen looked surprised, but only for a second before smiling that.....that half smile again with the half lidded eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh.\" She cooed much to his discomfort. \"Hercules. I didn't know you liked that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands jumped open in shock. She thought he was.....she was.....well he kind of NO! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her and concentrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brilliant golden hair turned into a fiery red. Then black at midnight. Then back to gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poured more will into her. Fat enough to fill the room. Thin as a rail. More curvy than Aphro ok that wouldn't help so skip that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned her into a lamia. A gorgon. A cyclops. A guy. Triplets. Triplet snaked male centaur gorgon cylop's  (Cyclopi?) while altering the room around them to fit them all. Then back again. Then just to make sure he added another layer to her robes and fastened them tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing wrong with his powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Helen. Stop. Loving. Me!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis will grabbed reality by the balls and twisted. Reshaping all that was into his grand design. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl blinked. Looking around confused and slightly worried before locking onto Hercules again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hercules?\" He asked warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed in relief \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did something just happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded \"Yeah but don't worry. I fixed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled \"My hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she kissed him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened as she once again pushed up against him. Crushing her breasts int his chest while her arms looped around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm.\" She purred before looking back up at him with those same eyes full or Eros promises \"Now where were we?\" She flicked her neck and her hair exploded out again to fall down her back. With an almost casual shrug her robes loosened leaving her shoulders bare and the rest held up only by the fact she'd have to pull away from him for them to fall off. With a flick of her perfect finger the fastens on his toga came undone yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Here.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of this has had a profound effect of the cats builds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them had grown quite fat, ranging from the merely overweight to so fat that they'd never be able to catch a two legged gazelle if they went anywhere else. Zira herself had engorged so much that her gigantic stomach would rest against the cool stone of her cave even when she deluded herself into standing, and would press against her legs preventing more than the slightest of steps <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/7868170/.\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/7868170/...</a> Her only source of food as with several of the other otcasts being whatever the....not thinner....but 'less obese' lionesses brought her...and her children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVitani was shaping up to match her mothers figure.

His food slipping off his frame like water from a birds back. His body still scrawny and weak despite eating just as much if not more than his barely mobile siblings, still mangy and sickly looking against all odds which left him embittered and angry that his mothers once fanatical plans had long since slipped from her gorged and happy mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryday the outcasts were almost grateful to their hated enemy for banishing them, though this gratitude was more of a taunting \"thank you\" to him.

WE NEED TO GO OVER THE PLAN!!!\" The sickly young lion screamed in his mothers stuffed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monsterously massive mass of feline fatness looked up at her son along with most of the other adult females who had been 'snacking' on their 3rd or 4th (6th in her case) servings of zebra meat . Her eyes, bore a lazy and half hearted glare at her son which told all she was more angry with him for interupting her eating than speaking to her in such a rude manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*chew, chew*</b> What plan?\" She asked and stripped another piece of flesh from the buttock of what had been a very well fed undulate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNuka snorted at his parents attitude. \"The revenge plan mother. You remember? The one to kill Mufasa's offspring and make me the king of the pridelands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...that...\"  Behind her several of her 'minions' rolled their eyes and chuckled under their breath. \"...We're no longer going through with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that...\" He seethed. \"...Because for that plan to work we need to be strong, we need to be fierce, we need power.....WE NEED TO  HAVE STOMACHS THAT DON'T DRAG AGAINST THE GROUND WHEN WALKING AND A SECRET WEAPON THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AN OVERFED WARTHOG!!!\" He screamed and jabbed his paw to the space two feet to the left of Zira's enormous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer youngest Vitani and Kovu were happily digging into their own excessive servings of meat. Vitani like her mother, almost completly helpless and was just managing to hold onto the cave floor with her paws despite her stomach's constant attempts to lift them into the air, dragging in food with her claws and happily scarfing on more food in a single meal than a cub her size would normally eat in a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu on the other hand was by no means 'almost' in anything except maybe an 'almost perfect sphere'. Kovu's paw pads were almost as soft as the day he was born and he could barely remember a time when he hadn't needed to be carried around by a pair of adults to go anywhere faster than rolling would get him. Using what little mobility his form allowed to inch himself closer to the food everytime the space he was chewing on had vanished down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZira watched her son struggle to get to get at his meal before grunting and sticking a blubberous back leg out out and nudging him into the shank were he gorged happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its hardly an issue anymore Nuka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE. CAN'T. MOVE. IN. ANY. WAY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like your sister will be soon enough, and I will be, and nearly all our pride mates couldn't catch a three legged warthog nowadays. If this 'forbidden land' that brat banished us to wasn't so full of waddling prey easier to catch than illness we'd all be near skeletal and boiling with rage....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Instead your all engorged like mini hippos. Eating yourselves to helplessness while leaving me to do all the dirty work.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was hardly true. Nuka was too stupid to do the dirty work, the messy work or the slightly stained work. The only reason he was so emanciated was because the weight that stuck to them like glue just slid off him like water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was that the day they had been banished from pride rock for siding with Scar during Simba's usurping of his uncles throne Zira had planned to one day return an avenge her mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire pride seethed with rage as the lands of the king and marched towards unknown territory. Towards a land beyond the elephant graveyard that no one in the savannah would dare go, a place said to be bare of all but a few scraps of life, were vultures wouldnt even eat the dead and termites and insects plagued the land, ensuring that the lionesses would suffer for their choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey forgot their revenge almost immediatly at seeing the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe land was more rich with life than any other place they'd ever seen. Herd's of zebra that looked more like seas of black and white, warthogs and antelopes in their dozens, meerkats, birds! There was more life here per mile than Zira had ever seen from the top of pride rock......and all of it so very, very plump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may have something to do with the sweetness of the water, of the taste of the air or even the especially green nutrient rich grass beneath their feet but not a one of the creatures that swelled here looked any lighter than three back 'home'. The zebra's were a herd all to themselves and their fastest sprint could only just exceed her slowest walk, Birds could only glide for seconds at a time before tumbling back to earth, most animals could be tracked even without scents with the long streaking trails of their stomach brushing the soil, many of the older ones simply lay in the shade on guts they would sink into as their mobile offspring brought them food. Every last beast in this land was in some form of obesity from merely large to truely defensless. It was as if predators did not exist in this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would soon change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the days, weeks and months the pride and made their mark in this new paradise. Staking out a new cave to call their home, were it was cool in the day and warm during the night, the sweet water flowed through without them needing to leave to drink and the ocassional day time snack would wander in not knowing of the dangers inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthey'd started making a dent into the overwhelming population of prey animals who until recently had never had to worry about being eaten rather than eating, their adipose bodies had made them easy pickings in their numbers, numbers which swelled back up shortly after due to a combination of the area inducing high fertility and the fact the lions were soon blending in with the population quite nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all ballooned to mammoth sizes at a pace like you would never believe, Zira was the first to feel her stomach brush the floor and it was not long before it was trying to lift her legs up off the ground and she was relying on her thinner underlings to hunt for her, who then had to rely on the thinner again once they had difficulty hunting, then again and again until only four out of the nine not including Zira and the cubs were still fit enough to chase down food.......no group there in of which included the blood son or Scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor whatever reason that eluded them Nuka only grew thinner as he aged. He ate far more than either his sister and brother and for all reasons should be big enough that Kovu was more mobile than him. Instead he was the outsider among outsiders, bitter and hungry and angry. Angry at Simba for killing his father, his father for losing him his future as king and his family for being to absorbed in their own gluttony and satisfation to care about revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother had tried to get him to take joy in the irony of it all. Simba had made for them to suffer and instead by his own actions sent them to a paradise superior to the pride lands in every way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his vantage point he couldnt even see her re-assuring smile past her tire thick neck rolls. He yelled at her and stalked outside, by this point a brisk pace easily outmatching his mother who was struggling to keep the last few vestments of mobility. Vowing that he'd get them to remember the plan then he'd just have to take over pride rock himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had actually inherited his fathers cunning mind then he might have actually thought of a plan other than 'convince mother to come up with a plan.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However the pride has a rule not to eat meat they've had a friendly conversation with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise. Believe me I'm way too small to take you on you myself. Not that I have to get much bigger with how easy you'd be. How'd you get so fat anyway?\" She giggled at the site of him trying to get up. Watching his teeth grit with strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her for a moment. The word 'fat' appearing to be strange to him as well. Such words as skinny and fat did not exist in a place were bulk was the way of life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. You don't 'look' as fierce as those monsters.\" He relented \"And I'm assuming that word, 'fat' means not being small then?

But everyone knew it wasn't right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo in the year 1912, a new Lord Graystoke stepped out of his parents jungle home one last time, wearing a suit twenty-years out of date he stood as professionally as a man raised mainly by slumping apes, and party by pictures and books of other men could have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood on deck against the railing of the ship, until his jungle home faded from his eyes into mist. The crew was respectful of this strangely, the leading being an old sliverback- er, old graying man, who had known his parents Micheal who once fancied himslef a pirate and may have set a ship on fire when he accidently fired into some gunpowder about twenty years ago. Micheal took him aside a few nights and would explain things Jane had not, or could not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the ship landed in England, Tarzan knew what his place was to be in this world. As Micheal said, his parents were Lord John Clayton, and Lady Alice. They were a viscount and viscountess, which was somewhat important people, they'd been trusted with going to a place called Afirca (Micheal showed him it on the map, it wasn't far from the massive island Tarzan grew up on) and were expected to return to England when Tarzan was five. Of course they never made it. Tarzan also took up a new name, like his father and a distant cousin, he took up the name John, but refused the surname Clayton as he refused relations to the horried man who nearly killed all he loved, his own cousin as he found out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen docking he was in wonder and to behold at all of the sunlight, and brick and people, though land was little harder walk on for a moment. He was even more surpised there were people not only to greet Jane, but himslef as well, a pointy, serious man in a very nice suit approached. He took one look at this unmannered, fighting stance, the long savage locks, and those curious and confused childish eyes and knew exactly who it was. <br>\r\n\"Lord Graystoke, sire its wonder to finally see you.\" And he showed proper respect with a small bow. Tarzan stared a bit confused, glanced sideways at Jane whom was chatting with her friends excitedly and returned. Slowly and carefully he extended his hand. <br>\r\n\"Uh-John...\" and waited for a handshake that would never come. The man simply rose and politely returned it back to Tarzan very carefully. <br>\r\n\"My Lord, I am the caretaker of your parents estate, Mr. Hobkins.\" He chuckled politely as he added this next part \"and it seems like we have a lot to do, my Lord. Would you be coming with me to return home now, sire?\" He spoke as if speaking to someone who was at least a decade younger than a man in his twenties.</span></div></div>",

She had been running her mouth with this insect for who knew how long and everytime he just kept bringing her in circles. Defeated she plopped onto the dirt once more, her dress bunching up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I just don't know anymore. I know I should know these things by myself but I've just become so confused lately.\" As Alice spoke thought aloud, the blue catipiller faced her once more, the same uninterested expression on his face as he drew another breath from his hookah. \"I just need something to help me relax so I can think again.\" The glade was in silence for a moment, the two figures not saying another word until the catipiller exhaled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come closer my dear. I believe I can help you with that at the very least.\" Alice looked up from her pity to see a blue finger amongst the multi-colored R's waving her forward. It's blower was sitting up straight and holding his pipe out in one of his many hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I have heard many things about those device from my sister and my mother and father. I do appreciate the offer but I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You said you wanted help and I am giving it to you girl. It would only be prudent for you to at least try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice stepped closer, her curiosity beginning to drag her towards the unknown once more. Every step or two, her shoes lay still in the dirt however, reminded of every time in her journey being curious had led her to trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The caterpiller smiled as the girl slowly brought the pipe to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For saying you were against it, you do seem to have adequate form.\" The blue insect folded his top set of arms as the young girl before him continued to bring the hookah closer. <i>The poor fool. Her curiosity is something to shake one's head at.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one more glance to the caterpiller, Alice placed the pipe on her lips. A taste similar to peaches entered her mouth, enticing her to keep it in. Alice closed her eyes and drew in a breath, the smoke filling her mouth almost instantly. It quickly became too much for the young girl as she coughed out billows of rainbow smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong.\" The caterpiller said, hiding a smirk as he inched towards the coughing girl. \"You must learn control girl. Just as your temper and now with this.\" Taking the pipe from the girl's hands, the caterpiller put it back to his mouth. \"Watch.\" He said through his teeth as he puffed once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Alice knew what she was doing was wrong, she couldn't help but feel intrigued by the caterpiller's motions as he blew out ring after ring of smoke into her face. Even through the strange, fuzzy feeling beginning to form in her head, she kept her eyes on her...new friend. After puffing one more ring which Alice breathed in with a smile, she found the pipe being brought back to her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now girl, try again\" Alice nodded at the Caterpiller's harsh tone and guided the hookah pipe into her mouth. The fuzz in her head only grew as she took in the smoke once more, at a much slower rate of course. She closed her eyes, enjoying the taste of apples that had now mixed with the peaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now exhale.\" The caterpiller called from the mushroom where the hookah sat. He covered his mouth, hiding a chuckle as he reached into his 2nd left shoe and brought out a small vial of blue substance. With a twist of the cap, he put one drop onto the hookah's exhaust and heard the girl coughing immediately. \"No, no girl.\" Changing his expression to annoyed, he crawled over to Alice and took the hookah as coughed out blue lines. \"Well, it is no wonder you don't even know who you are. You can't even hold a hookah right.\" Taking a breath himself, the caterpiller blew towards Alice's face, letting little blue spirals swarm about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's head was slightly bobbing up and down and her eyes seemed to fluxuating with dilation. <i>Excellent.</i> \"Girl, it would seem, in my own opinion, that you do have a problem.\" Exhaling out more spirals, the caterpiller began to circle the dazed girl as she stared into the cloudy swirls. \"You see, it appears you are simply too dull and plain for even this world. And even for wherever you came from no doubt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too...dull?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just dull girl, but so absent headed that you can't even remember who you are. And that is a very dangerous thing to be in this place. Unless that is...\" Now staring into Alice's face as he blew a particularly large spirl at her. \"...you have someone to tell you who you are. And it seems I am the one to tell you what some you are. Doesn't that make sense?\" Alice, clearly enraptured by the spirals and empty in the mind, could only nod. \"Good, now why don't you rest for a moment? I just need to prepare something and I can take you someplace a little safer.\" Without warning, Alice fell to the ground, sleeping by the command of the caterpiller.</span></div></div>",

So I guess this chapter's for those of you who haven't seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank's to an egg mayo sandwich he got out of a vending machine in a public toilet. Fry unknowingly got worm's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot just any worm's but highly intelligent worm's who's effort's to improve theyre new home caused Fry to (as Hermes put it) become smarter than Cher, more flexible than Gummbi, more powerful than Hercules and if his effect on Leela was anything to go by more charming than the prince of the same name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole crew minus Leela used microbot's to enter Fry's body to get rid of the worm's while Leela kept Fry from distracted from finding out he had worm's. Throughout their 'fantastic voyage' they found the worm's doing what Fry never did, taking care of him. He became the first three thing's mentioned in the paragraph above which combined together to become the fourth thing. Winning Leela over completly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course when he mentioned that thing's became so differant after he ate that toilet sandwich she realised what cause this and told him to wait at the cafe they were at while she went to take care of something. Which 'by something' she meant destroying the microbot's inside Fry using her own to stop the crew from getting rid of the worm's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this was the point were Fry would come in and demand an explaination aand the crew would tell him. He'd go home with Leela who was just about ready to jump him if the mention's of the bed were anything to go by. He'd feel upset that it was like she was falling in love with what he'd become. He'd go get rid of the worm's and Leela would kick him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead in this universe however Leela managed to get the crew to be quiet about the whole incident before Fry could get their. Thanks to Bender's mouth being convienently melted shut and the rest of the crew sporting bruises and black eye's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo let's think back. Without Fry being told about the worm's he wouldn't feel conflicted about Leela's feeling for the new him and leaveto get rid of them right when they were on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich mean's......I'm not 'that' kind of writer so you can figure it out for yourself.</span></div></div>",

Ignoring his advice she tossed aside her covers and moved her legs out of the bed. She looked up at him to watch the look on his face when he was proven wrong. She got her wish he was surprised for all but the fraction of a second as she stood up. Then immediately feel over from the weakness she felt in her legs. \u201cOkay, maybe I have a little bit of trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold you. Ill just tell the professor you had an accident last night and can't come in today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again he was stopped by the sexy cyclops. \u201cNot so fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The birth rate on the planet was roughly 80% women with only a 20% chance of a male being born. This unfortunate genetic choice meant their species main concern was at almost all times increasing their numbers. A society more geared towards sex than even the legendary Glen Quagmire of Earth (whose playboy genes led to the great earth overpopulation problems until the legalisation of soylent green brought it back down to acceptable levels) but without the numbers nr genetic diversity to sustain it. Amazonian culture could have been a major force in the universe if they were not alway struggling for numbers and could focus on advancement rather than getting as many women as pregnant as possible with the handful of men they have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such amazons guarded their own men jealously, and any man who found himself on the planet who could or would be able to help found themselves a new place to live whether they liked it or not.

As it turns out no amazon is even as tall as Leela. While clearly strong and capable warriors none came to more  than 5'6. Snu Snu was apparently a long and painful way to die. The prisoner was held here until death without food or drink or even sleep, slowly wasting away while his countless lovers stripped him of energy and bodily fluids with strenuous activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFry could only grin as a red head a good half heaad shorter than him who looked like she was smuggling soccer balls walked in and jumped him.

Between trying to hold him and his brushing over and against the first ones body parts, she found herself rapidly becoming aroused in ways she didn't think possible outside of 'the direct approach'. Curious the amazon insisted that the 'most beautiful of the men' keep doing whatever he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did as was expected of him, and as usual for the put upon officer performed far beyond expectation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still had to 'death by snu snu'. However because he'd aroused her to the point she felt like she would burst beforehand, he'd barely had to do anything to tip her over the edge, and even though they'd hardly actually 'done it' it still took the same amount of time to finish with one than it took to Fry and Zap to go through seven...........and she refused to let anyone else have him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to be dragged out by two of her sisters while the next girl came in for her turn.........and had to be dragged out by her sisters when the same thing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the same again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the same again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the first one ran back into the room and pushed the fifth one of the bed, and tried to get him to pick up where they left off. Only for the them to come running in with a club. Soon enough more started piling in and the executioin turned into something else the amazons enjoyed just as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the chaos of the growing brawl in the small room. A small man with adhesive digits wall crawled out the rooms only door</span></div></div>",

Grunting under her breath she closed her solitaire program she put on the banks manditory smile and addressed the man with as much kindness and sarcasm as she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello sir welcome to the first national bank, how can I help you?\" She said, deliberaty ignored his request in the minuet chance that he wouldn't repeat himself and just go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo chance of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'd like to open an account please.\" Said the obliveous flame haired man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banker clenched her teeth hard enough to bite through granite but complied. She hit the keys in front of her hard enough to push through the board but brought the proper window up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how much will you be opening your account with?\" She said trough the forced smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's see.\" He went rummanging through all his pocket's. Scrounging up quarters and nickel's in his jacket then a few penny's in his jean's. He presented his findings to her. \"93 cent's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the handful of change with disdain. Almost like it was laughing at her. To have her time wasted for 'pocket change'. This just had to be the only bank in the whole 'damn' city that you could open an account with for much a tiny amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't going to let him get away with wasting her time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sir.\" She said while trying not to grin maniacally. \"But it's a hundred dollar's minimum investment for adult customer's.\" 'take that jackass.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cheered in her mind when he sighed and slumped over. Then watched in horror as he pulled out his wallet. Franklin's face pressed under her nose as he passed her the 100 dollar bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dad did say not to come home until I did this. I guess me and my girl will just have to bum pizza off mister pinnuchi for a while.\" He said dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe delicatly pulled the beaten note from Fry's finger's and jammed it in a drawer like it was diseased. A few more key stroke's and a letter of notice for his cash card and it was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your card and pin will arrive within the week sir. Thank you for using the first national and come back soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and left with an idiotic smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed in relief and reopened solitaire. Hopefully she'd never have to see that idiot ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly this was not the case. Fry made sure to come back every so often, under the suggestions of his parents and handing money over the counter into the savings account. By december he had a good amount in. Not enough to call a fortune but enough to survive for a month or two with on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn not be tounched for a thousand yeras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==New New York, First national bank, 3000==<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sir let me just bring up your account. It might take a minute because of the age.\" Said the annoyingly familiar cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was he back at this place. Well long story short Fry needed money and he remembered that he had the account for just such an occasion. He just hoped their was enough in it to get him through to payday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see....Initial deposit a 100 dollar. Plus you paid into it right up to december 1999.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah my dad thought the economy would go bust soon and we'd all be put out of the job.\" Fry said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes I heard about that. The recession of 2009. A lot of people lost thier job's back then including my ancestor who used to work at this same bank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you looked familiar. She was the one who helped me set it up. What happened to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She ended up working the street at three bucks a pop.\" The cashier said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Went the red head who'd been put on the spot. The cashier turned back to the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying. You kept paying into it til late ninety nine. Bringing you up to 3230 dollar's paid in....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plenty of money til payday.\" Fry said pleased. He was about to ask for some money out when the woman continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...At our monthly interest rate and over the period of a thousand year's that amounts to.....$123,000,000,000,000 (a hundred and twenty three trillion dollars.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFry continued to stare at her for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulation's sir. I believe that now make's you the single richest person in the galaxy.\" She looked up from the screen to look at him but her eyes widened when she saw noone. Looking oer her station she saw him lying on the ground, breathing hard and foaming at the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd say he took the news rather well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They're reeling em in. Just look at all this money we've made.\" Peter whipped out a huge pile of money. \"GASP Peter did we really make all that?\" Lois inquired, utterly bewitched by the oodles of currency sitting before her. \"There was actually more but I had to bail one of the girl's kids out of jail.\" Peter said \"Here let me introduce you. The girls are Cookie, Sugar, Spice, Cinnamon, Brownsugar, and Butter. The guys really like Butter.\" Peter said pointing at a fat blonde in a bikini surrounded by male patrons. \"Hey Butter.\" \"Butter!\" \"Looking good Butter.\" \"Let me buy you a cookie Butter!\" The fat blonde giggled at the attention as she continued her attempt to satisfy all of her swarming customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Butter draw in the masses, Lois realized something. \"Peter look at how Butter receives so much more affection than the other girls. Don't you think her hefty figure is a vital factor.\" Lois hinted. \"OH MY GOD Lois! you're a genius! The men are into fat chicks! That makes so much sense considering how hot you became after you became fat.\" Peter said blatantly poking his wife's portruding belly button. \"I mean you were hot before you gained weight but you were a little shrimpy, and boring in bed, and you never really filled out your clothes...\" Peter stammered on. \"Okay Peter!\" an irritated Lois interrupted. \"Uh I mean you're beautiful now.\" Peter said attempting to alleviate the situation. \"Anyway what this bakery needs is more fatties.\" Peter stated. \"But what are we going do?\" Lois pondered. \"I've got an idea hehehehehe\" Peter chuckled.  </span></div></div>",

Lois..\" Peter said. \"After studying sales we've discovered that Butter has outperformed the rest of you combined.\" Lois said. \"Now ladies why do you think that is?\" Peter asked the girls. \"Because she's blonde.\" \"Because her bikini's smaller.\" \"Her personality.\" were responses the girls mustered. \"Butter could you come up here.\" Peter ordered. \"Sure thing Mr Griffin.\" replied the dutiful employee. \"Here we have a beautiful bikini clad woman. Blonde hair, cute face, smooth skin, friendly demeanor, pleasant smell. Butter here has it all but I would be remiss if I failed to mention...that shes FAT! Just look at how her belly hangs over her bikini bottom, how her boobs seep out of her top, how her arm flab flaps in the wind, mesmerizing the customers, how her ass sways with her kankles taking each step, how her back fat hides her bikini string, and how her cellulite graces both thick wobbly thighs. This is what brings in customers! Fat chicks!\" Peter said. \"Now Butter tell the other girls your weight.\" Lois said. \"220 pounds.\" Butter proudly stated. Lois hid a smirk, for she surpassed 220 long ago and was now nearing 350 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Alright girls you heard Butter if you want to keep working here you will weigh at least 200 pounds!\" Lois announced. Peter then wheeled in a cart filled with cakes, donuts, and cookies. \"You heard my fat sexy wife, you're going get fat if you want your jobs.\" Peter said.  The girls frowned as they accepted the business requirements and began eating. The girls began eating quickly filling up. \"Uggh this is so filling whats with this food?\" said a girl. \"Ewww This donut isn't filled with jelly its filled with butter!\" exclaimed an alarmed girl. \"That is correct all this food has been modified to be super fattening. You'll all be fat in no time.\" Peter devilishly informed as the girls continued to force the food in their bodies thus growing fatter and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The next at Peter's wife's cookies...   </span></div></div>",

She's far below the weight for an anorexic teenager, let alone a pregnant 30 something. If she keeps trying the old fashioned way she and the baby will die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd this happen?

Though I think you may be a little late. Now PUSH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there was the time we had Chris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the time you had Chris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah....anyway how did this happen? She's been eating enough for 6 every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor kept talking as they wheeled Lois to the threatre \"Near as we can tell the baby been taking in almost seven times the nutrients a baby usually does in the womb. Lois couldn't eat fast enough for it, it started eating her share of the food.\" He held up his hand when they reached the door. \"Relax Mr Griffin your baby and wife will be fine.\" He said and dived through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok now to just *ngh* lift.....it....ooouuutttt HELP ME!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pair of hand reached into the open womb.

With slight difficulty he tilted his head and looked at his barely living mother who was hooked up to at least three I'V's containing 'blood', 'bacon grease' and 'that stuff you get at diners they tell you is cream but doesn't look, smell or taste like cream and is really really bad for you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First day outside and the shrew is at death door already.

Her mother seemed on the phone even more, if it was possible, and the wordt thing so far was the crib being built in her room. It was a nice, simple white thing and she wanted to smash it. But Daddy promised it would only be there for a little while while they rearranged the home office. Things got weirder too, as her mommy got fat. <br>\r\nThen, one day she woke up to grandpa making her pancakes.<br>\r\n\"Eat up, spourt. We got to go to the hospital. It almost reminds me of when my mother was having my lil' brother, my father walked her fifteen miles to the hospital.\"<br>\r\nFinally the time came and the two walked down qhite hallways that all looked the same until they came to a private room. Mommy looked tired, her blonde hair wasn't up but with one hand she was able to send a fax while the other carefully tended to a blue bundle. Angelica climbed up on the bed and saw a small, sickly, quiet boy with glassy eyes who has trouble nursing. She made a face.<br>\r\nlike other newborn babies. Charlotte held him with one hand as she took a phone call<br>\r\n\"Oh Jonathon it went wonderfully. He's only four pounds but you're going to love him when I bring him into work tomorrow!...what do you mean? You know I cant take time off. Thats why your office is half a nursery- I cant leave a newborn at daycare!\" <br>\r\nDrew reached over and took the child from Charlotte, his eyes moved slightly as he waa being moved closer to Angelica, but he didn't cry.<br>\r\n\"What do you think, pumpkin? This is Davy, and you're his big sister now. So he's going to need your help.\"<br>\r\nShe looked down at the baby, he was small and didnt have fat like others, but he had a nice very light brown color and blonde hair just barely covering his head<br>\r\n. His eyes started closing soon after for some sleep. <br>\r\n\"At least hes quiet, Daddy. Not all loud like those other dumb babies.\" <br>\r\nDew chuckled a bit, \"Thats a very good way to look at it.\" And he gave her a onearmed hug. In this moment things were good. David Charles Pickles was welcomed with opened arms to the family, even as a fee people noticed he didn't look like Drew, they judt figured Charlotte had some Native American blood or something, he had some nice brown skin with a few blonde hairs.</span></div></div>",

Or at least he didn't until it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd jokingly wished to be a girl, well not really but a very offended Wanda to turn his sarcasm into a genuine wish. Transforming Timmy Turner into Timantha Turner. He now she would have been angry but soon realised that this was the perfect opportunity to find Trixie the perfect birthday present since she now thinking like a girl herself. So she tip toed off to the mall while wearing a dress that was far too pink and girly even by his new female standards, but not before gender flipping her godparents in revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sound plan since her new gender had rewired her mind enough to instinctively know what women wanted on a level not even that guy from Thatcherite of the same title could. For example she now had a desire for handbags....lots of handbags...and enough was never enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(before I get flamed. That was the answer I got when I told a woman I knew she had too many hand bags.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile traversing the mall she stopped in front of her comic store and to her relief she found she still enjoyed comics (though now for a similar reason that teenage boys bought she hulk and witch blade). She went to by the latest of her second favourite hero when a boys hand grabbed onto it. They struggled with the issue until the fell knocking the boys hat off and revealing the last person Timantha would ever see in a comic store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, Trixie Tang was a total tomboy! Well technically she liked boy stuff as much as girl stuff but who cares. The girl Timmy liked was into comics, video games and unnecessary violence like he was. Timantha's mind raced with the possibilities. Everyone else at the girls super party would be bringing girl stuff, but if one certain boy brought her that collectors edition crimson chin 1987 Halloween special he had saved away then he'd be certain that boy would have a place in her heart 'and' her Realm of Battle Craft guild for many years to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he even needed to give her that, When she found out all Trixie was really looking for in a guy was someone she could be both a girly girl and a buddy with, someone who would watch soaps with her then play crash nebula and eat pizza with her until they were sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so marrying this girl when they were old enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019d spent the rest of the day just hanging out. Something he'd never thought possible with a girl. Hitting the arcade (and scaring every boy there) back to the comic sthop (scaring every boy there) the food court (where every boy they scared away gathered round  to tell them 'both' they were pretty which sent a chill up Timantha's spine and her stomach to churn even though it was hardened after years of eating her mms cooking). They had a blast til it was time for Trixie to head home and prepare her party, but not before giving her BFF a V.I.P invite and a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the soon be a boy again ran home, not all that careful in avoiding her parents since they usually took extreme methods to avoid Timmy. Hey if you don\u2019t see it then it doesn\u2019t exist, and if they\u2019re son didn't exist then that meant they were still childless and could buy that new boat with the fund marked 'Timmy\u2019s college fund' for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got the comic and headed back to Trixie's, just short of the house which was lit up like a Vegas hotel with people who she was sure Trixie didn't know were lined up with arms full of presents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCosma, Wando.\u201d She called on her gender flipped fairy\u2019s. The pink haired slob in a wife beater and the checker dressed sixtys rejected poofed into existence in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sport.\u201d The female voiced man said, taking a break from chugging back brew. \u201cYa get everything ya needed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimantha nodded. \u201cYeah. All girls really want is a guy who isn't afraid to show their sensitive side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd handbags.\u201d Said Cosma in an entranced voice, six handbags on each arms with more poofing in filled with shoes and chocolate. \u201cSo many handbags.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYyyeeeahhh.\u201d Echoed the girl before shaking the cobwebs out of her mind. \u201cNow turn me back into a boy. The sooner I'm a guy again the sooner I can go from being Trixie's BFF to just BF.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it.\u201d They raised their wands which glowed with magical power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would happen next in another, more mainstream world was Timantha would be Timmy Turner again, go to the party, proclaim his sensitive side which would work in making Trixie love him...for about a second before being kicked out in fear of what her friends would think, but he would get over it after being set up with dates with other girls set up by their mothers after he visited the women\u2019s salon and impressed them by getting a treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another world this would happen. However in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Faaarrtttt*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls eyes shot open at the all to familiar sound. The sound she feared almost as much as vicky's shrill voice, which was always accompanied by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POOF*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDa rules floated between her nervous godparents. Flipping itself to the appropriate page and showing them all why it caused the wands to make an immature noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Tim...antha? Did Trixie actually say you were her Best Friend Forever?\u201d Wando asked slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah.\u201d She said in a 'duh' tone. \u201cBut what difference does tha.........that better not be the rule I think...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can't interfere with true love kiddo.\u201d Wando finished. \u201cAnd a friendship strong as the one you\u2019ve made with Trixie in only one day falls under this rules power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, but but but what about my other friends?! If you couldn't break up a friendship any more than you could break up a couple then why didn't it stop me from turning into a girl in the first place!?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer two magical parents looked at each other then laughed out loud. \u201cSeriously? A friendship that strong between dudes? Get serious bud!\u201d Wando fell to the ground laughing, while his wife grimaced at her husbands immaturity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides that. One of those friends of yours seemed pretty keen on getting to know you. And give you that dead frog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimantha's smacked her face. \u201cA.J is in love with me.\u201d She dead panned. Greaaaat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do we do know?\u201d She asked tentatively. She was a girl, for the foreseeable future she feared as long as her hopeful girlfriend was her best friend and one of his former best friends wanted her to be his girlfriend. The changes weren't retroactive so eventually she'd have to explain who she was and where Timmy Turner went. Her parents would probably want to adopt her as the daughter she knew they always really wanted, compounding the can't break true love rule with paternal love which she surmised was in their if friendship was. Ultimately leading them to be good and loving parents to her which coupled with having a great friend like Trixie and her genius friend tripping over himself for her all added up to what she feared was a happy childhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich meant she'd lose her godparents, trapping her as a happy and not miserable girl forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand......</span></div></div>",

Weeding out undesirable and line cutters with a swift and brutal trip on the loserapult. With the money he made working for the Tangs he lived in the slightly smaller mansion next door with his own fleet of luxury cars so forgive him if he wanted to ensure his employment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was currently scaring a teen boy with bad acne and a gift was too small for his liking when he heard the unmistakable sound of indignant remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was cutting his line!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no you don't!\u201d He grunted and reached into the pool of people like someone would pick a hair out of soup. Lifting the comparatively tiny form between his meat hooks and staring at the girl with death in his iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her the once over. A brown paper wrapped and very thin parcel between her painted finger that looked like a magazine. He looked at the girl with his clenched teeth. Normally this would make a grown man wet himself, but this sliver of a girl just stared back at his, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where do you think your going girly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said nothing, reaching into her neon pink blouse and pulling out a small pendent. The letters V.I.P spelled out in cut diamonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colour drained from his face like someone had pulled a plug. He lowered the girl back to her feet with a nervous chuckle. Moving aside submissively to which the girl gladly walked past him. He sighed in relief and went back to his job. Tossing another boy into the distance for holding a box of nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Trixie stared out over the throng of people bored. Present mounting up behind her till they reached the ceiling, forcing her father to have the ceiling and roof knocked out for now so the presents could continue to pile. Beside her Veronica yacked on about something or other she didn't care about. To her other side a butler held a pad with the names of everyone the door guard let in. She didn't care. All she really cared about was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Trixie.\u201d Her heart swelled at the buck toothed site. A thin parcel between the girls fingers dropped to the floor as the most popular and powerful pre teen girl in Dimmsdale swept her best friend into a sisterly hug. Ignoring of the gasps of shock, of her blond  hang on fainting and countless boys wailing in despair at not being the Hugee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimantha could only grin. It may not be what she wanted exactly, but until she could figure a way back to normal it was more than good enough.</span></div></div>",

Did she really need to say more?\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nAllright then. Only her and Trixie sleepover.\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nAlmost immediately after the Tang heiresses public declaration of best friendship the party had shifted into a whole other gear. No longer was the queen of the fourth grade willing to sit in her throne and be brought presents. A DJ sprung up out of nowhere and started laying down some fat beats. A circus troupe burst in and began entertaining the crowds with amazing feats. \u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nEven a truck came by opening up to reveal an arcade for the guys and ponies for the girls....that is the girls who didn't spend the evening competing for the high score of house of the dead while the boys watched in both horror that two girls were owning them and glee that Trixie and her cute friend had suddenly become that much more approachable in their eyes.\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nEventually the party died as most of its guests had bedtimes and chores to pay for Trixie's extravagant gifts. Till it was only the birthday girl, her new true BFF and her old fake BFF who was being dragged away by the bouncer while glaring daggers at her usurper.\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nTimantha had been prepared to go home but Trixie would have none of that. Picking up the smaller girl and carrying her back into the house like one would a doll and plopping her down on the couch in front of a full size movie screen. A bowl of popcorn dumped on her lap just as 'Gore zombies of blood lake 7' started to play. Her....'former?' crush sat down on the other end of the couch now spontaneously dressed in pyjamas, laying back like a guy and flicking the inflated kernels into her mouth with machine precision.\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nThe rest of the night, and she meant the rest of the night was a mix between guy and girl things that in all honesty Timantha wasn't as bothered by as she knew she should have been. One minute they were playing video games and the next she was letting the taller girl do her hair and face. They gorged themselves on pizza and ice cream and fell asleep watching that stupid vampire movie that had Chester\u2019s teeth broken (again) when he publicly said he didn't like it. \u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nIt was about 10am when Trixie finally let her go, both girls by that point to exhausted from their all night party to argue. They bid each other goodbye along with the promise to see each other tomorrow.\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nTimantha's smile at spending a night of fun with her old crush didn't go away....until she realized she was referring to her as her former crush.\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cUh guy.\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nHer pink bow, \u00a0and green hair clip suddenly sported faces\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cHey sweety.\u201d The temporarily male now female voice of Wanda called from the back of her head. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou look like you had a blast with the girl of your dreams last night.\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Until she stopped being the girl of my dreams.\u201d \u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you...\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI think the The girly girls trying to say she likes boys now.\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cCOSMO! That is completely........Sport why don't you look like you want to feed Cosmo to a viscous junk yard dog?\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cViscous what now?\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nH disappeared in a snarling cloud of smoke.\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cBecause he's right.\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nWanda said nothing as her godchild poured her feeling out. Ever since last night she'd noticed that she was thinking of Trixie less and less as the Girl of Timmy Turners dreams and more as the greatest friend a girl can have. If she'd been a boy there would have been no way those blushers lipsticks would have went near him yet she let herself get dolled up without hesitation. She'd actually enjoyed a sappy movie! The same movie that he'd nearly died of boredom watching when his mom had forced him to go with her now held Timantha in rapt attention like it was the greatest masterpiece ever, she was even crying unashamedly almost the entire time. \u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cThat's not to surprising actually.\u201d Wanda said bored, kind of disappointed that the girl hadn't figured it out.\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWhat then?! Why do I feel like this!? Why am I acting like I've done this my whole life!? Why don't I like Trixie any more!? And why couldn't I stop staring during that guys 20 minute shirtless scene.\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you wished you were a girl dear.\u201d \u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cBut why.....\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cYou wished you were a girl.\u201d She repeated. \u201cYou didn't wish you looked like a girl. You didn't wish you were dressed like a girl. You didn't wish for an illusion for people to see you as a girl. You wished to be a girl, completely and totally. When I granted the wish it didn't just stop at putting you in a dress, your brain was rewired to what it would be if Timmy Turner had been born Timantha. A girl who likes boys and not girls.\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI.\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cI mean didn't you think it was weird when you checked to see if you still liked comics you thought of buff guys in skin tight spandex?\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nShe blushed at the thought. She regretted saying that out loud.\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cIt's natural for you to act this way sweety. Just like it's natural it was for the old you to be gaga over Trixie.\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nNo it wasn't. He wasn't supposed to be a girl in the first place. Thoughts about her liking things like dolls and ballet swam to the forefront of her mind. Of holding A.J or Chesters hand and staring into each others eyes before she violently shook her head.\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nShe needed to fix this! She needed to make the people who would love Timantha hate her. She needed Trixie to hate her. She needed her p-parent to hate her.\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nSpeaking of which. She had finally made it to her front yard, standing just one step outside of the property and staring at it like it was the most horrible thing in the world.\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nShe knew what would happen the second she stepped inside. All she would need to do is say they had a daughter and not a son and they would believe her instantly, because that was what they had always wanted. Timmy turner was the accident while Timantha Turner was their dream.......well then she'd just have to turn that dream into a nightmare.\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nShe walked up the footpath slowly until she was right outside the door, channeling the whiny brats of a dozen MTV specials. Sighing deeply she turned the handle and let herself inside.\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nConvince the parents that had always wanted a daughter that they really want there un-noticed son back?\u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nPiece of cake.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just stick with the plan and they'll be begging for Timmy back in no time.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok....1...2....3!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SLAM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door rattled as the tiny but powerful legs almost kicked it off the hinges. There was a moan from the living room followed by a shuffling of feet before a very uninterested Mr Timmy's dad Turner came into view<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. What's it now Timmy? Your imaginary girlfirend dump dump dump dump dump.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey whats wrong? Have you forgotten how to go number 1 again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dump dump dump...\" He pointed at the small figure in the doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? The little Girl that look just like like like like like like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimantha smiled evily before taking a deep breath and prepared the biggest scream she could.....when it was driven out of her by a bone crushing hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I I I k-knew it. I've fu-finally woken up\" A sobbing Mr Turner blubbered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our nightmare of having a son has finally ended. Our real child has finally come.\" A wailing Mrs Turner matched her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixies best friend absorbed it all as she gasped for breath. Each word an arrow in her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO! She couldn't give up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WANT ICE CREAM RIGHT NOW!!!\" She screamed hard enough to blow her parents away along with the china pots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked at each other bfore vanishing ou the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled at her quick and decisive victory....until she heard a truck backing up from outside, followed by a sudden terrible cold and crushing sensation. She swiftly dug herself out of the semi solid substance and found she had been hit with what looked like 3 tones of every flavour ever made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver, her dad stuck his head out and waved at her. \"Sorry it took so long. But nothings too good for my little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking a finger covered in chocolate/ pistachio 'Ok try something else'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WANNA PONY!!!!\" She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom stuck her head out of the other side of the truck. \"Way ahead of you dear.\" She whistled and suddenly a half dozen equines pop out of the frozen dessert. All shivering from the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh which ones mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why all of them.Anything else your adorable little heart desires?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimantha stroked her chin a little while a black spotted pony ate the orange/ Pineapple swirl caught in her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmm??? Ah ha! I WANNA......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My shiny teeth that sparkle, just like the stars in space....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimantha's eyes ticked visibly as she watched the live performance from atop a throne of candy and action figures. All around her friend who not 24 hours ago were partying at the Tang manor were partying harder than ever. Moving along to the beat that the sparkly toothed singer let loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nerds congregated around the the brand new top of the line vz-cube playing one of the games from the massive new selction theyre was, and playing it on a gigantic wall sized tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe populars laughed their smug laughter while swimming about the brand new pool, some merely floating about the pool while digging into fresh lobster and whole white truffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the heck did they afford all this?\" She muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? This? This is a drop in the bucket to what we have saved away.\" Mr Turner shouted over the noise. Tearing his eyes away from the performing acrobats to answer his daughter. \"We used our 'daughter fund' that we'd been paying into and saving up since the day you were born, but forgot about after all these years of hallucinating that you were a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you spend it when you...though I was a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Turner just snorted and turned back to the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimanthas groaned and turned back to the show, lost in thought. Pink, green and purple buttons of her brand, fresh from the paris runway outfit looking up at each other in worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His anger blinding him to the fact that he was destroying all his things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sport, but you know the rules.\" Said his pink haired Fairy, she waved her wand as he broke each item. Repairing it with a flash of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had officially been the worst day of Timmy's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up only to discover that his parents had left to go on vacation for the week, leaving Vickie to look after him for 7 whole days. Literally permiting her to move in for the entire week, she gave him a list of chores that wrapped around the house and deliberatly tied him up and watched him until she was sure he was late for school. Her own being out until they got rid of theur sudden rat problem (heh heh.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe  was given after school detention by the principal, tormented by Crocker who just so happened to be the detention teacher. Had about twenty new F's to add to his collection since the deranged teacher decided to give every test for the year to the class in a single day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got rejected by Trixie, and to pour salt in the wound she didn't just ignore him. She handed him a signed petition now turned legal document that forbade him from seeking a relationship with, being freinds with or even going within 20 feet of not just Trixie but any even remotely attractive girl in Dimmsdale for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought it had been a gag until he saw to heavily armed police officers appeared out of nowhere and dragged him away until he was at least twenty feet from away girl who wasn't prettier than *shudder* Tootie. Which suffice to say since the other few girls who was less attractive or even wore braces had moved away made her the least popular girl in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police said to get used to it since she's his only option now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was estatic. He was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home was basically a repeat of this morning, except with Vickies dog getting his dinner, while he starved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back to present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why couldn't you guy's do anything. I thought you were supposed to 'stop' me from being miserable!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sport, all that happened today was kinda against the rules to fix.\" Said the pink fairy gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We couldn't fix your love life because we can't intrerfear with anything to do with love. Same thing with Vickies dog since she loves it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmo continued. \"And thanks to all the horrible things youve wished for in the past, the rule book was made bigger just for you. See.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a poof a massive purple bound book appeared in mid air. It was so thick that it made the old version look like a pamphlet. It flipped open to a certain page were Wanda started to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says we can't do anything involving our godschilds education.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wished to be smart before.\" Timmy said behind clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but the way your wish's always turn out it looks like they actually add a new rule every time you make a wish.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Heres one that says you can't be invisible, oh and heres one that says no trading places with animals, and one for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a move that shocked both fiary's Timmy jumped up to grab the book and threw it across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sick off all these rules! At this rate I wont be able to wish for anything in the first place. I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO FOLLOW 'DA RULES!!!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda looked at Timmy for a second. \"Timmy sweety, you can't just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done.\" Said Cosmo raising his wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'*Rule-free*'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda and Timmy looked at Cosmo for a moment, not yet caught up with what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just do what I think you did?\" Said Wanda in a distant voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?

She was barely recognisable from the monster that spread fear in the hearts of all Dimmsdale's kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters she didn't have the perpetual look of evil on her face. In fact Timmy could safely say she didn't have a spek of evil left in her body. She had the kind of smile you'd normally only see on cartoon princess's and the eyes that once had the fires of evil in them were now filled with more kindness than he'd ever thought possible for any mortal person to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond of all, she was a knockout! The whole 'icky' part of her must have spread to her appearance because without she had a look that would have he fending guys off with a fiery stick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the stick she was before she had curves. Not to go into to much detail but she was pretty much the opposite of what she was before. Her once green t-shirt and black foot emcompassing heans had been replaced by a pink frilly blouse and what should be 'loose' fitting sweats. Her hair was long and luxurious, topped off with a pink bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If you want a good image just go to deviant art and look up 'not so icky vicky')<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, I must have tripped on the floor.\" Vicky said in a voice that sounded like bird song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Timmy and smiled. \"Hey there little man, how bout I make us some chocolate chip cookies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy just stared. To freaked out by the total change to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until Vicky was right next to him with her hand to his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being used to a pretty girl actually being this close willingly Timmy jumped back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-what-what.\" He stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky just put her hand on her prnounced hips and one under her chin. \"Mmm, you don't feel warm. Oh well maybe you'll feel better after those cookies. And after that I can take you to go see that new movie Crimson Chin movie you wanted to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Timmy still to freaked out to move Wanda took charge, her vocal chords altered and used her powerrs to move Timmy's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee thanks Vicky. Your the greatest babysitter ever.\" Said Wanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giggle. That's what they call me. Bye.\" And with that the now good babysitter was away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow finally in control of his functions Timmy zoomed over to his fairy wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives. I wanted her nice. Not a super model!\" He yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sweety.\" Said his pink eyed fish somehow while in water. \" You didn't wish she was nice. You wished she wasn't 'icky'....\" She poofed up a dictionary. \"....and according to the dictionary 'icky' means eother 'repulsive' and 'distastful' or 'sweet' and 'sentimental'. And since we figured you wouldn't want her to be even less nice we went with the first definition. Getting rid of all the Icky in both mind 'and' body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not gonna happen I.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you nuts.\" Blurted Wanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaa?\" Said the boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Said Wanda flatly. \"I'm not allowed to think this is actually a good wish. I may not like you rewriting somemones personality but seiously you just turned one of the most evil people in the world into one of the sweetest and nicest beings thats ever existed. And with the amount of work me and Cosmo have put in just for anti-Vicky wish's this is really gonna lighten our work load.\" Wanda sighed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was Timmy's turn to be unable to counter the arguement. He had to admit having a nice babysitter who makes cookies and takes you to the movies instead of one who dangles you over rabid dog pits was a plus, amd he guessed he would get used to having such a pretty girl over at his house for a month. Even if she did make him uncomfertable since he remembered who she used to be. Awquard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right. This might turn out to be a pretty sweet wish after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timmy, How about I order Pizza for dinner?\" Came a voice from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that clinch's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then forget mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they were ever so lucky to have a chance with her I think every man in that room would not have spoken to their mothers in a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngels bust swelled out as she filled the room with soft beautiful and oh so arousing melodies. Floating down from the stage, moving through the patrons as she moved them. Not one man's eye left her while the women never looked up from their drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands moved up and down herself as her watchers followed them, lingering in all the places she wanted them to. She reached out and lifted one older flounders chin with her index finger  and then pulling away letting him drop to the table boneless and stupefied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually shimmed back onto stage, her tail swinging far more than needed. The customers whipped into a wolf whistling frenzy again just like they are every night. Resting back in the giant clam she entered the stage from and lounging back, letting the last few notes of her haunting song take them away before the living couch closed and took away her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reopened in back letting the purple blonde out to stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's my little money maker. The one who without my little club would be nothing but a seedy bar.\u201d She fought down the urge to shiver when her boss gave her his version of sweet talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalimari was the owner of the club in addition to being a very well known 'businessman'. Everybody and their Grandmother knew point blank he was the biggest mob boss in the whole of fish city, but without concrete evidence his part in any crime everyone knew he took part in he always got away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel had met the literal slimy squid a few years ago when he was looking for acts. She'd turned up and he'd hired her on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact she could sing didn't filter in until her first show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then he, just like any other guy with eyes had made it his life\u2019s mission to make the voluptuous blonde his which went over about as well as you'd think. Under normal circumstances such a....man would peruse more...forceful methods to obtain what he wanted. Fortunately he meant it when he said this place would be nothing without her. The last time she was sick the joint barely made enough to pay the utilities let alone the employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course boss.\u201d She said sweetly. Smiling at him and his croonys over her shoulder while she floated by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat say for such a stellar performance I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he there yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squids face noticeably soured. His ever present lawyer grasping him by the shoulders and pulling him back then taking over. \u201cWhy yes Ms Jones.\u201d He said in a manner to sharp that they split the water with every click of his tongue. \u201cYour guest has been in back for considerable time waiting for your show to end as we agreed upon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile turned from mind bendingly seductive to school girl joyful. Taking off like a rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark waved after her before whispering to the sulking kalamari out of the corner of his massive mouth. \u201cA seedy bar remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the Cephalopod had any bones he'd be grinding his teeth now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hand on the door, hand to her oversized chest then pushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy in the trench coat smiled at her, hand full of flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Angel. I'MPH!\u201d Whatever he was going to say was apparently less important to her than flinging herself into his arms and pressing her lips to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned into his mouth, hands moving around the back of his head to deepen their intimacy while his moved to the small of her back, crushing her assests into his chest. She reaches to loosen his tie before he decides that\u2019s enough and pulls away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon Angel you know Kalimari would blow his bulbous mind if we tried that here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer answer was to reposition herself in his arms and resume the kiss \u201cMaybe I don't care.\u201d She giigled between lip presses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about not being in the crowd. But the deal with your boss and everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile turned into a deep frown, crossing her arms underneath her bust pushing it up. \u201cI should be able to see you whenever and wherever I want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh? And what will you do when they find out the main attraction already has a guy they wish they could be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Sigh Fine.\u201d She pouted, then immediacy smiled. Ducking behind a screen, her purple dress came off just as a more conservative blue one which made her breasts look smaller came on. Her fin was rolled up instead of flowing down her back and a pair of thick glasses adorned her nose-less face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d Gil said linking his arm with hers, his infectious smile lifting her frown if only a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets just get home.\u201d She said opening the dressing room door again. Brushing her shoulder up against him suggestively \u201cThe sooner we go home the sooner I can...get back out of this thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tugged his collar and smiled. Grabbing around her waist and pulling her close. \u201cNo objections there babe. No objections there.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She-Lion just couldn't take her eyes away from the screens. The anger that each screen gave her was forcing her to stare. On one screen, she was standing right there on stage. It had taken two hours for her to get her Siamese fur all pampered and ready for the concert. Her gold earring had been polished to the point it would shine each time the spotlight hit it. Her jacket? It was beautiful, of course it always was. At least it was until a soda can flew through the air, tossed by some ungrateful concertgoer no doubt, spilling it's sugary contents all over her body. It took her weeks to clean that junk from her claws alone. Another screen showed security footage of her base, more specifically it showed her and her bandmates coming back in from another disaster of a plan to capture Kidd Video. She-Lion couldn't remember which, but judging by the immense amount of chocolate pudding all three of them were wearing, it was probably Fat Cat's fault that it failed. What she did remember was the bill for dry cleaning that she got back for her jacket. Each screen was the same thing, sure the location was different and the circumstances leading to the scene were as well, but they all lead to the same word. Failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Lion pressed a paw to her forehead as she finally worked up the power to turn her hovering chair away from the screens. \"Easy girl.\" Pressing a few buttons on her armrest brought out a large makeup kit. She-Lion reached for her blue eyeshadow, hoping that the cream would calm her down. \"When you decided to take over Flipside, you knew that there were gonna be some losses. Thank Cleo I managed to steal all this scientific junk from that Master Blaster weirdo before bumping him off, I can't even imagine what not being the leader of this outfit would do to my psyche. Not to mention my complexion.\" She-Lion pressed another button on the armrest, bringing a mirror out for her to view her application. Magnificent as always. Still, her beauty would mean nothing if she wasn't ruling over all of Flipside and forcing everyone else to admire it as well. But how would she manage that when things kept going wrong for her? Somewhere in her head, she knew bringing Kidd Video into the equation was the thing that made it all worse. Those kids had a simple job, agree to be her slaves/expendable members of her cover band 'The Copycats' and when she ruled Freeside, they would have a reasonable fee for services rendered. She'd still force them to work for her one way or another, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Lion's tail kept twitching and curling as she tried to keep happy thoughts. It all just kept driving her up the wall and nothing was making her feel any better. She managed to find some reprieve as the sound of the automatic doors opening forced her attention to something else. In this case, her henchman and the two other members of her band Fat Cat and Kool Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your will today your feline ferociousness?\" The way Fat Cat would just raise her up on such a pedestal, so amusing. Especially when it would cause his shoulder pads to scrape the floor. But Fat Cat's question gave a valid point, just what was her game plan today? Her band didn't have another concert lined up for a few weeks but they already had the artist they were gonna steal figured out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know boys, I think I've been running myself ragged with all of our failures at trying to catch Kidd Video. I say it's high time we had a vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally boss.\" Kool Kitty adjusted his red glasses as he leaned against the wall. \"You're finally taking my advice and learning to relax. And where are we gonna be vacationing too if I may ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Lion swirled around in her chair, stopping at the terminal. Turning off each of her embarrassing losses, a map of Flipside showed on screen with a large circle over a small township. \"Like I even have to tell you. A few good days of R &amp; R in She-Lion Central is just what we need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough not saying a word, the two henchmen rolled their eyes behind their leader's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I know this is gonna be perfect, because there will be no Kidd Video to spoil our fun.\"</span></div></div>",

Though that might have had something to do with the fact it was still speeding down the road as he was fixing it. Carla and and were standing a short way off while Kidd was at the driver's seat. Whiz pulled himself from the controls, his normally bright blond hair and clear glasses covered in blackness. He wiped off his glasses with a pant leg before giving a glare to the band's leader. \"Kidd, you think maybe you could stop driving? It's hard enough working on the Kiddmobile without you going faster than nessacary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Whiz.\" Kidd didn't take his eyes off the road as he kept the Kiddmobile's speed up. \"But almost every time we do stop on the road, She-Lion and the Copycats manage to catch up to us. The last thing we want is being unprepared to run if they find us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it would be a lot better if we could actually know where we're going Kidd.\" Carla pointed to the screens that, under normal circumstances would be flashing with thier coordinates, but were currently black. \"For all we know, we've been driving in circles. Glitter can't even figure out where we are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla turned to the band's fairy friend. Glitter was pressed against the glass, looking around outside. \"I certainly can't. I don't know if I've even been to this part of Flipside before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Ash, he had leaned up against the wall of the Kiddmobile, dishing out one of his little improv songs.<br>\r\n\"We don't know where we are.<br>\r\nAll we know is where we've been.<br>\r\nWe keep trying to fix things ourselves, <br>\r\nbut it just keeps boxing us in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright.\" The Kiddmobile turned off the road onto the grass. \"I guess we're pretty safe out here anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like it matters a whole lot.\" Whiz came out from under the controls again, closing up the hatch. \"The main control rod is busted and until we find another one, we're as good as lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKidd climbed out of his seat and walked outside. \"Well that's just great. And where are we gonna find another one of those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe someone in that town over there is willing to trade.\" Carla pointed to a mass of buildings a ways off. The band all looked to one another, it didn't look that far and they weren't exactly brimming with options. With that in mind, the band started hiking.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course it wasn't hard to please them, but that was no excuse for her to not look her best for the adoring public. Even through the thick metal of the flying fortress and the echoes as she made her way to the exit, she could hear the crowds starting to take notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked along, two doors to the side of her opened up and her bandmates walked on through. Kool Kitty was slicking his hair back while Fat Cat was holding tightly to a briefcase. Not for business of course, though in Fat Cat's case chomping through everything handed to him with his own special utensils could be considered business. The sounds of the crowd were increasing as the trio marched along. \"It's gonna be nice letting our fur down for a few days.\" Kool Kitty adjusted his glasses as he spoke, \"That park they here is so comfy, I could just lay there forever if I wanted to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Lion scoffed, of course Kool Kitty would be that easy to please. \"Well, I don't know about you boys, but I'm gonna take my time in the best spas She-Lion Central has to offer. I'll probably drum up extra business just by being there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that...\" Fat Cat said through his salivation over his daydreaming about his heavy lunches and snacks to come, \"How come you get to have a city named after yourself anyway? When do we get our own your selfishness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Lion sighed. \"Well, you've clearly forgotten that when we took this town over, I gave the two of you a choice. We would either share this city, or the next ones we took over would be yours to claim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but we haven't taken any over yet thanks to...\" Kool Kitty was stopped by She-Lion grabbing his tie and tightening it just a little too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you even mention those brats Kool Kitty.\" She-Lion quickly loosened Kool Kitty's tie, believing he got the message. \"This trip is supposed to be for relaxing and having a good time, not for dwelling on our failures. I don't want to hear one more word about those meddling kids for the rest of the trip, got it?\" Both cats beside her nodded their heads, thankfully that meant they understood. Rather good timing too, the trop could feel the fortress making it's final descent and they had made it to the main exit door. \"Alright you two, smile for the crowds.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three cats set themselves into different poses as the door slowly opened up. The general noise from the crowd quickly turned into cheering, fueling the cats' pride as they put more effort into their poses. Of course, such a thing as too much effort is possible and the Copycats ended up flat on their backs as the light of the town shone on them. She-Lion got up first, not wanting to seem like a fool in front of the people of her little haven. \"Hello She-Lion Central! Your stars have arrived!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Lion looked over the crowd as they continued their cheering, her smile growing as she laid eyes on every face. Each of them one that she had seen in the mirror every day when she put on her make-up, because they were all hers. A sea of copys of her, exact in everything but obedience and color in which they were a touch more grey than her. No doubt the real reason the boys were miffed about not having their own towns. But they'll get it someday, and the pride they'd feel watching it happen would be worth it alone. Oh just the memories of how She-Lion had begun the transformation of this town using...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss She-Lion!\" A direct call from a copy of her coming right up to the group, possibly the mayor, brought She-Lion of her flashback. The copy bowed before the group, a few members of the crowd doing the same. \"To what do we owe this sudden visit from you and your bandmates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite simple dear. My band and I are tired from our tours and need some time to rest our paws.\" She-Lion patted the mayor on her head. \"And I could think of no better town to relax then in good old She-Lion Central!\" The crowd cheered once more at the showboating while She-Lion turned to her comrades. \"Hope to see you boys again relaxed and ready.\" A thick smile carved it's way onto She-Lion's face before turning to the crowd again. \"And if you treat us really well, then I think we might even give a little impromptu performance. Now who knows where a kitty can get a soothing massage and fur exfoliation combo?\" A trio of She-Lion copys came up and led the real She-Lion away while Fat Cat and Kool Kitty made their own way through the crowd and out into the blue and pink lit streets.</span></div></div>",

The grey copies of their leader all swooned, dropping down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat Cat nodded, \"Yeah. Though I still say her selfishness could have let us have some power in town.\" Fat Cat looked up to a building they were coming up, a large neon sign of She-Lion giving a thumbs up was in full view. \"At least so she's not the only face in town.\" The two cats came to a four-way intersection, both looking in different directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well man, the park is this way.

But we gotta tell her all the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding?\" Fat Cat gulped as he peeked at the band. \"You heard She-Lion, she won't like us even mentioning those kids. And you know what her shrillness gets like when she's mad.\" The two watched as the band walked into the city, both shivering. \"Besides, who knows? The copys here were pretty good at turning themselves into She-Lion, maybe they'll turn them into her?\"</span></div></div>",

Sure, that first spell required the band to transform a few townspeople at a time, but soon enough the She-Lion copy's multiplied their numbers all their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine. But when things go south man, you get to tell She-Lion how you let this mess happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat Cat rolled his eyes. \"Fine. Now let's get outta here before Kidd Video sees us.\" The two cats ran off into the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys...tell me you're seeing what I'm seeing.\" Kidd Video stared at the large neon She-Lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhiz and Ash were both staring through a few business windows, looking at the grey She-Lion copies that were staring right back with the same bewildered look as them. \"If what you're seeing is what appears to be a city worshipping She-Lion, then we are.\" Whiz took a step away from the glass while Ash was too shocked to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla and Glitter in the meantime were less guarded against the odd sights as a group of four She-Lion copies were walking right to her. \"Glitter, where are we?\" Carla looked to the fairy friend, who hid behind her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me.\" Glitter eventually took a peek, though shivered all the while. \"Maybe their friendly though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four copies stopped in front of the group, the lead She-Lion copy giving a worried glance. \"Don't tell me you kids walked all the way down the road?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, our car broke down and...\" Ash barely had time to speak before Kidd covered his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell them too much.\" He whispered. \"This might be a trap.\" After Ash nodded, Kidd stepped forward. \"Well, what if we did? Besides, we won't be staying long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense\" The grey She-Lion leader shook her head. \"If your car is broken, we can send some She-Lion to bring it. Besides, we're always happy to offer lodging to travelers.\" The lead grabbed Kidd by the hand, giving him fluttering eyes. \"Who knows Mr. Handsome? You might even want to stay for awhile when it's fixed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKidd blushed, unable to resist the complement. Even if it was coming from a copy of his band's enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls...\" The lead She-Lion pointed to Carla and Glitter, \"...why don't you take those two to the spa. They look like they could use it. Meanwhile, why don't I take you boys to the finest hotel in all of She-Lion Central?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith trepidation and without the direct order of Kidd as he was still being occupied by the leader's buttering , the group split up. The two split She-Lion groups glanced back to one another, winking with devious grins.</span></div></div>",

Soon, both have fallen asleep. At around midnight, something strange was happening. There was a bright light beaming through the window, fixating on Scooby. Scooby stirred in his sleep a bit, but finally awoke to the light. It was hypnotizing him as he hopped off of the bed with Shaggy still in a deep sleep. He then opened the window and looked outside. Even though the bright light was still on him, he could still squint and make out other lights on the bottom side of the UFO.

They seemed to be in a vortex, the two girls struggling to go back. It felt like a very long fall and they didn't even notice eachother pass by. In mere seconds they both emerged in each others places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked around. A small note appeared on the ground in front of her, the same for Peach on Samus' huge ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Greetings, you have been chosen to become part of the universe crossover program. We take two people in different universes and swap their places, along with changing many things about you to become very much like the original habitant. For instance, if you look down you'll see one of the changes we've already made.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked down to see a blue frilly dress, rather tight. Along with wearing white arm length gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach felt odd and hot wearing this odd pink bodysuit. It hugged every curve of her body, much tighter than her biker suit she uses for racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We hope you enjoy being part of this program. You will be sent back to your original world after 1 year. Goodbye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. Women who take part in this program get a bonus breast size upgrade!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both feel a bit more strain on their chest from their clothing, peach having it the worst. The bodysuit was made for one shape and one shape only. Samus only had to suffer a tad bit more cleavage.</span></div></div>",

Please note that the interactive story is rated as such because of the free nature of a 'what if'. However here are a few guidlines that I would like you to follow. These guidelines are in place so everyone can enjoy the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**1. No gay or lesbian content.**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**2. No scenes of *EXTREME* graphically violent or hardcore sexual nature.**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**3. Try to write at 'least' two paragraphs a chapter unless it's not supposed to be a chapter (i.e more choices)**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**4. When writing in the 'something else' paths please put a chapter before it explaining what your chapter is about and give the option of whether or not the reader wants to follow it ('would you like to follow this story path?' option 1 - yes, option 2 -something else)**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**5. If a game series has a live series or animated counterpart please use the animated part if the game has very little story. (i.e If using pokemon then write about the animated series and not the game because it has almost no story in comparison to the anime) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone who can make a good actual entry which is at least two paragraphs long I will award an amount of GP based on the quality of the chapter with 100Gp being the minimum Options chapters not included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
